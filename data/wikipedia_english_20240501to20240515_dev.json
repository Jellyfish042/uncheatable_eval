    "English major-general in the British and Portuguese services\nSir George Allan Madden CB (3 January 1771 \u2013 8 December 1828) was an English army officer in the British and Portuguese services.\nBiography\nMadden was the eighth son and fifteenth and youngest child of James Madden, of Cole Hill House, Fulham, Middlesex. He was born in London 3 January 1771, and was baptised at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. After attending private schools, and accepting an engagement on trial in a merchant's office from September 1787, his father, in February 1788, obtained for him a commission in the army. He was appointed cornet in the 14th light dragoons in Ireland, 14 March 1789. On 30 June 1791 he purchased (from Arthur Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Wellington, then promoted in the 58th foot) a lieutenancy in the 12th or Prince of Wales's light dragoons, in which regiment he became captain 29 June 1793 and major 25 December 1800. After serving several years in Ireland, he embarked with his regiment at Cork in September 1793 for Ostend. Contrary winds drove them back, and the regiment was counter-ordered to Toulon, then just relieved by Admiral Hood. Adverse winds and defective supplies caused innumerable delays, and Toulon had been evacuated before the regiment arrived. Madden was with the mounted portion of the regiment, which was refused permission to land at Leghorn. At Porto Ferrajo, island of Elba, no forage could be found. At length, at the invitation of Pope Pius VI, it was put ashore at Civita Vecchia, 6 March 1794, the surviving horses, it is said (Services of Colonel G. A. Madden, p. 3), having then been nine months ashipboard. During the stay of the troops at Civita Vecchia gold medals were presented by the pope to the officers. It appears from the exergue that the medals were originally struck to commemorate the restoration of the port; but a subsequent order of the general commanding directed them to be constantly worn by the recipients, out of respect to the memory of the ill-fated pontiff. Pictures of the reception of the officers at Rome by Pius VI were placed at South Kensington, and in the officers mess 12th lancers. The regiment left Civita Vecchia in May 1794; took part in the operations in Corsica ending with the fall of Calvi in August, and was ordered home in November the same year. Madden's troop was shipwrecked on the coast of Spain. The men and horses were saved, and were assigned quarters by the Spanish government in one of the Puntales forts, near Cadiz, where they remained until a ship was sent out from England to fetch them home in August 1795 (ib. p. 4).\nMadden's conduct was warmly approved by the British authorities at Gibraltar. In January 1797 he went with his regiment to Portugal, and was stationed three years at Lisbon. In 1801 the regiment accompanied Sir Ralph Abercromby to Egypt, and took part in the battle before Alexandria and the advance on Cairo. During the latter, Madden, the youngest field officer of cavalry present with the army, was sent by Lord Hutchinson with detachments of the 12th and 26th (afterwards 23rd) light dragoons, on special service towards Rosetta. Throughout the march on Cairo Madden's activity and intelligence won Hutchinson's high approbation.\nThere was much want of harmony between Madden and the officer in temporary command of the regiment, Colonel Browne, afterwards General Browne-Clayton, K.C. (see Gent. Mag. 1845, ii. 197). An angry altercation on duty matters had taken place between them (see Trial of G. A. Madden, London, 1803, pp. 37\u20138), and in August 1801 Madden charged Browne with having committed perjury in a recent court-martial on a captain of the 12th dragoons. In consequence Madden was arraigned before a general court-martial on a charge of unofficerlike conduct and disrespect to his commanding officer. The court-martial, of which Major-general (Sir) John Moore was president, and Colonels John Stuart (of Maida), Alan Cameron of Lochiel, and other famous officers were members, was held in the camp before Alexandria, 31 August 1801. Two editions of the proceedings were printed. The court found Madden guilty of the charge, and adjudged him to be dismissed the service. Lord Hutchinson refused to confirm the proceedings. Eventually, Madden, who was very popular with his brother-officers, was sent home, and permitted to retire by the sale of his commissions (Lond. Gaz. 26 May 1802), all of which he had purchased. When the 12th light dragoons arrived in England three years later, a duel took place between Madden and Blunden, a major of the regiment, who had taken a part against Madden in the quarrel. Madden, after receiving his adversary's shot, fired in the air, and the matter ended.\nMadden was on terms of the closest intimacy with the margrave and margravine of Anspac, and lived with the family at Benham, Berkshire, and Brandenburgh House, Hammersmith, during the greater part of 1804\u20135. On 4 July 1805 he was, at the margrave's instance, appointed inspectin",
    "The probability of superiority or common language effect size is the probability that, when sampling a pair of observations from two groups, the observation from the second group will be larger than the sample from the first group. It is used to describe a difference between two groups. D. Wolfe and R. Hogg introduced the concept in 1971. Kenneth McGraw and S. P. Wong returned to the concept  in 1992 preferring the term common language effect size. The term probability of superiority was proposed by R. J. Grissom a couple of years later.\nThe probability of superiority can be formalized as . (D. Wolfe and R. Hogg originally discussed it in the inverted form ).  is the probability that some value () sampled at random from one population is larger than the corresponding score () sampled from another population.\nExamples\nMcGraw and Wong gave the example of sex differences in height, noting that when comparing a random man with a random woman, the probability that the man will be taller is 92%. (Alternatively, in 92 out of 100 blind dates, the male will be taller than the female.)\nThe population value for the common language effect size is often reported like this, in terms of pairs randomly chosen from the population. Kerby (2014) notes that a pair, defined as a score in one group paired with a score in another group, is a core concept of the common language effect size.\nAs another example, consider a scientific study (maybe of a treatment for some chronic disease, such as arthritis) with ten people in the treatment group and ten people in a control group. If everyone in the treatment group is compared to everyone in the control group, then there are (10\u00d710=) 100 pairs. At the end of the study, the outcome is rated into a score, for each individual (for example on a scale of mobility and pain, in the case of an arthritis study), and then all the scores are compared between the pairs. The result, as the percent of pairs that support the hypothesis, is the common language effect size. In the example study it could be (let's say) .80, if 80 out of the 100 comparison pairs show a better outcome for the treatment group than the control group, and the report may read as follows: \"When a patient in the treatment group was compared to a patient in the control group, in 80 of 100 pairs the treated patient showed a better treatment outcome.\" The sample value, in for example a study like this, is an unbiased estimator of the population value.\nEquivalent statistics\nMain article: Mann\u2013Whitney U test \u00a7\u00a0Rank-biserial correlation\nAn effect size related to the common language effect size is the rank-biserial correlation.  This measure was introduced by Cureton as an effect size for the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. That is, there are two groups, and scores for the groups have been converted to ranks.\nThe Kerby simple difference formula computes the rank-biserial correlation from the common language effect size. Letting f be the proportion of pairs favorable to the hypothesis (the common language effect size), and letting u be the proportion of pairs not favorable, the rank-biserial r is the simple difference between the two proportions:\u00a0r\u00a0=\u00a0f\u00a0\u2212\u00a0u.  In other words, the correlation is the difference between the common language effect size and its complement.  For example, if the common language effect size is 60%, then the rank-biserial r equals 60% minus 40%, or\u00a0r\u00a0=\u00a00.20. The Kerby formula is directional, with positive values indicating that the results support the hypothesis.\nA non-directional formula for the rank-biserial correlation was provided by Wendt, such that the correlation is always positive.\nSee also\nPairwise comparisons\nCondorcet winner criterion\nIntransitive dice\n",

    "\nAllen R. Place is an American biologist, biochemist, and academic. He is a Director at the BioAnalytical Research Laboratory and the Harmful Algal Bloom Control Technology Incubator within the Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology (IMET), and an associate director for Research and Professor at University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES).\nPlace is most known for his research on the fundamental structures and functions of living systems, addressing three key research areas: fine-tuning enzyme function to adapt to the environment, investigating biochemical adaptations for utilizing unique food sources, and elucidating mechanisms governing sex determination. He has authored journal papers and book chapters, and co-authored software, including \"The Protein Sequencing Apprentice\" (1986). He is the recipient of the UMBI Regent's Award for Public Service and the UMCES President's Award for Excellence in Application of Science.\nPlace is a Fellow at the National Research Council and has served as a Guest Editor for two special issues namely, \"Advances and New Perspectives in Marine Biotechnology II 2016\" published in Marine Drugs and \"New Insights into Fish Physiology-Applications Focus: Challenges and Mitigations II\" featured in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering. He served as a Conference Organizer at the 9th US Symposium on Harmful Algae held in Baltimore in November 2017.\nEducation\nPlace earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Earth and Planetary Sciences with an NIH Predoctoral Fellowship from The Johns Hopkins University in 1973. Subsequently, he pursued a Ph.D. in Biochemistry completing his graduate studies in 1979, and conducted his postdoctoral studies in 1980 at the same institution.\nCareer\nPlace started his academic career as an assistant professor of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania, a position he held from 1980 to 1987. Moving to the Center of Marine Biotechnology at the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (UMBI), he became an associate professor in 1987, and a Professor from 2001 to 2010.\nServing since 2001 as the Director of the BioAnalytical Research Laboratory within IMET, Place has also held the role of Director for the Harmful Algal Bloom Control Technology Incubator (HAB-CTI) since 2022, and concurrently maintains the position of associate director for Research at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) since 2023.\nResearch\nPlace's research has been centered on elucidating molecular mechanisms, unique diets, environments, interactions, and the molecular basis of sex determination.\nBiochemical adaptations to the environment\nPlace has conducted research on the functional significance of allelic variation and geographical differences in gene frequencies. Under the guidance of Dennis Powers during his doctoral research, he delved into exploring the functional significance of allelic variation in lactate dehydrogenases from Fundulus heteroclitus, a common nearshore minnow along the eastern seaboard of the United States. Building on this foundation during a brief postdoctoral position with Bill Sofer, his investigations were extended to alcohol dehydrogenase variants in Drosophila. He scrutinized the kinetic properties of pyruvate reduction for different allozymes, revealing significant differences in reaction velocities at low pyruvate concentrations uncovering geographical variations in Ldh-B gene frequencies observed in F. heteroclitus.\nAquaculture sustainability\nPlace's work on developing and implementing a land-based, marine recirculating aquaculture system addressed environmental concerns associated with traditional fish farming practices and highlighted the vulnerabilities of current aquaculture operations to pollution as well as diseases. He has identified potential substitutes for traditional ingredients emphasizing strategies for enhancing the sustainability of aquaculture practices. In his early work, he investigated the biochemical processes governing the digestion of distinctive food sources, such as wax esters, leading to the establishment of a new research area. He also examined the efficacy of Crypthecodinium sp. phospholipid extract and meal in enriching rotifers, comparing their effectiveness with heterotrophically grown algae and fungal biomass. This study underscored the potential of single-cell heterotrophs as substitutes for fish-based ingredients in aquaculture diets. Collaborating with his student Aaron Watson, he researched the substitution of fishmeal with a plant-based diet to enhance sustainability in aquaculture, emphasizing that a 1.5% inclusion of taurine in the diet facilitates the complete replacement of fishmeal.\nDevelopmental and reproductive physiology\nPlace's research in developmental and reproductive physiology has uncovered the roles of enzymes in digestion, defense, and sexual differentiation.

    "Review of the season\nNBA professional basketball team season\nThe 2024\u201325 Phoenix Suns season will be the 57th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as well as their 32nd season at the Footprint Center. It is also their second full season under the ownership group led by Mat Ishbia and Justin Ishbia after the brothers purchased the team on February 8, 2023, and their second season with their \"Big Three\" superteam of Devin Booker, Kevin Durant, and Bradley Beal together. However, this will be their third season in a row with a new head coach taking over following the announcement of Frank Vogel's firing on May 9, 2024, this time having 2021 NBA Finals champion coach Mike Budenholzer taking over as the new head coach two days later. Not only that, this is also their first season since the 2019\u201320 season where the Suns would properly utilize the NBA G League again with their own squad (this time, the Valley Suns) after previously selling the Northern Arizona Suns to the Detroit Pistons during that season's suspension/reinstatement period and subsequently shutting down that G League team for the following season afterward in a move unrelated to their sale, thus marking the first time where every NBA team would utilize their own G League affiliate during a season. Entering this season, the Suns are looking to improve upon their previous season's record of 49\u201333, which left them with a sixth-place finish in the Western Conference, as well as look to enter the playoffs for the fifth straight season in a row after previously missing out on the playoffs for a decade straight and improve upon their dismal first round performance from last season.\nOff-season\nDraft\nMain article: 2024 NBA draft\nThe Suns entered this draft period (which would last for two days instead of just one day like it was ever since the NBA draft was only two rounds long back in 1989) with only their own first-round pick (that was made 22nd after a tiebreaker with two other teams with the same record as them and that they also kept as their own pick following multiple trades revolving around a first-round pick swap that they made last season) after also trading away their own second-round pick this year as a part of their massive Bradley Beal trade from last season. They also originally had a second-round pick that was from the Denver Nuggets (which would have been made late into the second-round) that they acquired from the Orlando Magic the previous season, but that pick was ultimately vacated from them early on into that season after the NBA discovered the Suns had engaged in conversations with then-Portland Trail Blazers center Drew Eubanks before that season's free agency period officially began. They also held draft rights to the San Antonio Spurs' second-round pick as well had it fell into a certain condition due to a previous trade involving Cameron Payne, but that pick would not be conveyed to them due to the Spurs performing far below expectations of that draft pick's range limitations.\nCoaching changes\nOn April 16, 2024, assistant coach Kevin Young was hired as a head coach for Brigham Young University's men's basketball team (though he would stay for the team's brief 2024 playoff run) after their previous coach, Mark Pope, left BYU to be the new head coach for the University of Kentucky, replacing John Calipari there after he left them for the University of Arkansas. Young had previous hints of leaving for a head coaching position with him being considered a serious candidate for the head coach position for both the Brooklyn Nets and Charlotte Hornets before being hired by BYU. He was also the highest paid assistant coach at the time of his departure.\nOn May 9, following weeks of deliberation after a disappointing first round exit against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2024 NBA playoffs, the Suns decided to fire head coach Frank Vogel after finishing only one season of his five-year, $31 million deal that he had originally signed with the team. Unlike the previous season's coaching search where it was an extensive one, the Suns would only look at a select few candidates to replace Vogel's position, with Holbrook, Arizona native Mike Budenholzer (the head coach the won the 2021 NBA Finals over the Suns) being considered a prominent part of their new head coach search before ultimately getting the position two days later with a five-year deal worth $50 million. Following Budenholzer's hiring, the Suns later announced that none of Vogel's assistant coaches from last season would be retained for the new coaching staff led by Budenholzer this season. However, after an attempt to promote David Fizdale into a front office position later in the month instead, he was reported to return to his role as an assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns on May 29. The Suns would also look to hire Vince Legarza, a former assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks and Minnesota Timberwolves, on May 28. On May 31, Wisconsin Herd ",
    "German military engineer\nChristian Lilly (died 1738) was a German military engineer.\nBiography\nLilly commenced his military career in the service of the Dukes of Zelle and Hanover in 1685, and was under the command of Prince Frederick Augustus and of Lieutenant-general Chauvet. He served several campaigns against the Turks in Hungary, and was present at the battle of Grau and the sieges of Neuhausel, Caschaw, Polack, and Buda (1683\u20136). In 1688 he entered the service of William III, by whom he was naturalised as an Englishman. He served in Scotland in 1689, and in Ireland during the greater part of the war. He was posted to King William's Dutch train of artillery, and served first under Count Solmes at the battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690, and afterwards under General Ginkell at the first siege of Athlone and the first siege of Limerick, raised on 27 August. On 3 September 1690 he was appointed ensign in Lieutenant-general Douglas's regiment, and quartermaster-general to the grand detachment of the army commanded by that officer. He again served under Ginkell at Ballymore in June 1691, was director of the approaches in the second siege of Athlone during the same month, took part in the battle of Aughrim on 11 July, was engineer at the short siege of Galway which followed, and during August and September at the second siege of Limerick, which ended the war.\nOn 1 May 1692 Lilly was appointed engineer of the office of ordnance, and was sent with the train of artillery upon an expedition under the Duke of Leinster, to make a descent upon the French coast, but this proving unsuccessful, a descent was made upon Flanders instead. By royal warrant of 4 August 1692 he was appointed engineer at 10s. a day to accompany a train of brass ordnance and mortars to the West Indies. In 1693 he was sent with the expedition under Sir Francis Wheler to Barbados, Martinique, the Leeward Islands, New England, and Newfoundland, where besides his post of engineer he had chief command of the artillery train, and was captain of a company of foot. On his return home he was appointed on 30 October 1693 captain in Colonel Lillingston's regiment of foot, and was sent into garrison at Plymouth.\nOn 12 October 1694 the Earl of Romney, master-general of the ordnance, appointed him engineer and to command the train of artillery for the West Indies. He went out with Colonel Lillingston in 1695, and served at the sieges of Cape Fran\u00e7ois and Port \u00e0 Paix in Hispaniola, which were taken from the French, and he was afterwards stationed at Jamaica. The town of Kingston, Jamaica, was built on plans prepared by Lilly after the old town of Port Royal had been destroyed by earthquake in 1692. On 19 May 1696 he was appointed fireworker to the artillery train, and the same year was sent to Cuba to report on the situation and strength of the Havana, after which he returned to England. On 17 November he was appointed chief engineer of Jamaica at 20s. a day. He repaired the fortifications of Port Royal, and strengthened the fortifications of other parts of the island under Sir William Beeston. In accordance with a warrant of the governor, dated 1 May 1698, Lilly proceeded with the squadron under Admiral Benbow to examine the Spanish ports on the coast of Peru. He visited Portobello, Carthagena, and the Scottish settlements, &c., and returning to England laid reports upon the capabilities of these ports for defence before the king.\nWhen on 24 May 1698 the artillery trains employed in Flanders and at sea were dismissed and a peace train ordered to be formed, Lilly was appointed one of the six engineers at 100l. per annum from 1 May 1698. By royal warrant of 28 June 1701 the king appointed him third engineer of England, his commission to date from 1 July, with a salary of 150l. per annum.\nOn 14 August the same year he was again appointed chief engineer at Jamaica, and accompanied Brigadier-general William Selwyn to the West Indies. He made surveys of Port Royal and other harbours of Jamaica, and was also engaged in repairing and improving the fortifications. On 10 November 1703 Acting Governor Thomas Handasyd appointed him lieutenant-colonel of artillery in Jamaica. On 4 May 1704 the board of ordnance appointed him chief engineer in the West Indies, and instructed him to fortify the island of Barbados under the orders of General Sir Bevil Granville, the governor. On 29 January 1705 Sir Bevill appointed him colonel of artillery at Barbados.

    "2015\u201317 child abuse and murder of a five-year-old girl in Singapore\nOn 11 August 2017, at an unspecified location in Singapore, a five-year-old Singaporean girl, whose first name was Ayeesha, died in her flat after being severely starved and abused by her birth father. Before her death, Ayeesha and her younger brother were both confined naked inside the toilet of her father's flat for ten months, and they were both being ill-treated for about two years before the death of Ayeesha; Ayeesha's brother survived the abuse in spite of the extensive trauma and injuries he endured. Ayeesha's father was arrested and charged with murder, and also faced 25 counts of abusing Ayeesha and her brother. In the middle of his murder trial, which began in May 2023, Ayeesha's father pleaded guilty to manslaughter and child abuse in April 2024, and was sentenced to 34 years and six months in prison and 12 strokes of the cane, which was widely reported as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d punishment ever imposed given the unprecedented level of cruelty and violence exhibited in the Ayeesha case. The full name of Ayeesha or the identity of her father was not made public to protect the identity of Ayeesha's surviving brother.\nBackground and abuse\nAyeesha was born in Singapore in 2012, and she had one younger brother who was a year her junior. Her father, who separated from Ayeesha's biological mother at one point, remarried with another woman and had three children with the woman, who became Ayeesha's stepmother. A daughter from a previous marriage of Ayeesha's stepmother also lived with the couple. Background information of Ayeesha's father revealed that he was trained in silat, taekwondo and aikido. He formerly worked as an auxiliary police officer from 2003 to 2016. From 2016 to April 2017, Ayeesha's father worked in a fast food restaurant, and he was jobless since then. In 2015, Ayeesha's father faced financial difficulties and he had to cut down on his purchase of food and diapers. Ayeesha's father and stepmother also reduced the children's meals to twice a day. After the divorce of Ayeesha's biological parents, both Ayeesha and her brother were initially placed in foster care in June 2014, before they were returned to live with their father in early 2015. Following this, members of a family welfare centre would regularly monitor the welfare of the children and check up on them, and the father even took both children for a counselling session at the centre in May 2015. However, since then, the children had not seen by any case officer and the father did not send them for schooling, and he often lied to the welfare workers that the children were under the care of his mother or other relatives.\nAyeesha's father and his wife began to abuse both Ayeesha and her biological younger brother in December 2015. The children were also being hit for playing with their faeces; in fact, due to their father decreasing their daily meal intake, Ayeesha and her brother started to eat their own faeces to ease their hunger and even played with them. From February to October 2016, the couple confined the two siblings in a designated naughty corner, which was a narrow space between a bookshelf and a wardrobe to prevent them from escaping, and a CCTV camera was also set up to keep the two children under surveillance. The children, who were continually abused by their father daily, were only allowed to come out of the naughty corner to have their meals or shower. Starting from October 2016, both Ayeesha and her brother were confined naked inside the toilet, and they were only allowed to come out whenever it was mealtime or the adults wanted to use the toilet. One excerpt of the CCTV footage from Ayeesha's one-room flat also showed the two siblings wearing only their diapers when they were locked up in their former naughty corner prior to their confinement in the toilet. The confinement of Ayeesha and her brother in the toilet would last for ten months before the death of Ayeesha in August 2017.\nOnly some instances of the abuse was revealed publicly when the case came into light. One documented instance of the abuse took place on 27 March 2016, when Ayeesha's father had violently assaulted Ayeesha by hitting her for at least 86 times, and the callous and relentless assault lasted for 16 minutes, and the whole abuse was shown on the CCTV footage captured inside the flat. Ayeesha's father was reportedly angered at Ayeesha for smearing her faeces on the wall and while changing her diapers, it incensed him so much that he brutally assaulted her out of rage. Additionally, Ayeesha's father had also repeatedly slapped the girl, as well as punching, caning and kicking her, and he also pulled her body up by holding her hair before punching her. Another incident happened on 27 August 2016, when Ayeesha's father repeatedly used a cane to hit both Ayeesha and her brother inside the living room.\nIn October 2016, Ayeesha's father contacted a welfare officer and expressed his int",

    "\nMayan is a 74-foot wooden schooner designed by John G. Alden and built in Belize in 1947.  She is Alden Design No. 356-B - a Centerboard Schooner constructed of Honduran mahogany.  Her name was taken from her country of origin of Belize where the Maya civilization developed.  Her current home port is San Francisco Bay where she serves as the flagship of the St. Francis Yacht Club.\nCharacteristics\nMayan is rigged as a transitional schooner with a gaff foresail and a Marconi mainsail.  She has an overall length of 66 feet and a beam of 16.5 feet.  She is 59 feet on deck and 62 feet to the main masthead with the intent to be operated on the Intracoastal Waterway.  Her draft ranges from a maximum of 10 feet to a minimum of 4.5 feet through the use of a lifting centerboard. She has a ballast of 9,000 pounds and a displacement of 60,000 pounds.  She is built of Honduran mahogany for the frames, yellow pine for the caulked carvel planking, and teak for the decks.\nMayan accommodates eight guests and requires a crew of three to sail.\nHistory\nMayan was designed by John Alden's office in 1946 for Charles Allen, a WWII Navy captain, and was a revision on their Design No. 356 from 1928.  Allen's son, Paul Allen led the construction team at Tewes Dockyard near Belize City, in the former British Honduras.  Mayan was sailed to New York City after launching.  She was sold in 1948 and served in the charter trade under a series of owners through the 1950s and 1960s.\nIn 1969, musician David Crosby found Mayan in Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale and purchased her for $22,500 borrowed from Peter Tork.  He sailed her from Florida through the Caribbean and the Panama Canal to a new home port in Sausalito, California.  In 1970, Crosby began living on Mayan full-time and wrote rock songs such as Wooden Ships, Carry Me, and Lee Shore while aboard. Crosby eventually moved Mayan to Santa Barbara, California.   He owned her for 45 years.\nIn 2005, Mayan was rebuilt by master shipwright Wayne Ettel in Wilmington Harbor, California.\nIn 2014, Beau Vrolyk purchased Mayan from Crosby for $750,000 and moved her to Santa Cruz, California where he converted her from a staysail schooner back into her original design as a transitional schooner and outfitted her for classics racing.\n",

    "Spanish footballer and manager\nLeopoldo Costa Pay\u00e1, better known as Rino Costa (7 May 1901 \u2013 20 November 1979), was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Valencia CF, and later a manager, taking charge over Valencia.\nHe was one of the first footballers to play his entire career for Valencia CF, and thus be part of the so-called one-club men group.\nPlaying career\nLeopoldo Costa was born on 7 May 1901 in the Chella, Valencia, and he began his footballing career in his hometown club Valencia CF in 1922, at the age of 21 after having played briefly for Atl\u00e9tico Saguntino. He quickly established himself and became an undisputed starter as a right winger for more than a decade since his debut in a friendly match against FC Barcelona on 2 August 1922, which ended in a 2\u20134 loss. He was the only survivor from the Camp de l'Algir\u00f3s era who was a member of the Valencia team that reached promotion to the First Division in 1931, playing two games in the highest category until his official retirement in 1932.\nHis goal-scoring productivity was notable, above the average for his position, netting 78 goals in 402 games played, although without a doubt his greatest virtue was assisting the forwards; he won eight regional championships of Valencia\u00a0. With the arrival of professionalization, he began to lose his space and so in 1932, at the age of 30, he decided to hang up his boots to focus on the drugstore that he had opened on Calle San Vicente and that almost survived into the 21st century.\nPlaying style\nRino, whose nickname comes from \"Risetes\", which according to himself is what his friends called him as a child, knew how to adapt with great intelligence to the frenetic changes in football during his sporting career. A player with good dribbling and an ability to score measured crosses ahead of his time, he became the perfect partner for Montes and Eduardo Cubells.\nAccording to the chroniclers of the time, his physical capacity was far superior to that of his teammates and rivals, which allowed him to turn his runs on the sidelines almost into a triumphant walk. His diagonal runs wreaked havoc on the opposing defenses and his hard shot used to become a goal when he went between the three posts.\nManagerial career\nAfter the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, Rino took his first steps as a coach, turning the Valencia amateur side into a national champion in 1942, and his feat led him to become coach of the first team on 11 July 1942 after the departure of Ram\u00f3n Encinas, who had led Valencia to its first-ever titles after the first titles won: the 1941 Copa del Rey and the 1941\u201342 La Liga. In doing so, he became the first Valencia player to became the club's coach, something that has happened a further 17 times since. He made his debut in a preseason match in Burjassot, which ended in a 3\u20132 win. Despite a promising start (second place at the midway point) and being advised by Eduardo Cubells, a man of great experience, the season turned out to be somewhat gray, so he left on 11 April 1943 without completing a year in the position to return to work with the amateur team again.\nSuch was his enthusiasm for the lower categories, that it was his idea to propose a subsidiary team located on Cuenca Street, which would be created under the presidency of Luis Casanova Giner and baptized as Club Deportivo Mestalla, now known as VCF Mestalla. He remained linked to the Mestalla club until his retirement, except for one season, 1950\u201351, as coach of Castell\u00f3n.\nGennaro Gattuso, also known as Rino Gattuso, became the coach of Valencia in 2022, thus becoming the second \"Rino\" to do so.\nDeath\nRino died on 20 November 1979, at the age of 78.\nHonours\nValencia CF\nValencia Championship:\nWinners (6): 1923, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1931, 1932\nSegunda Divisi\u00f3n:\nWinners (1): 1930\u201331\n",

William later served as a Lieutenant in the French and Indian War, and purchased a tract of land in Culpeper, Virginia in the 1750s from Hume that bordered House of Burgesses member, Henry Field. William's land was originally granted to Alexander Spotswood until his death.\nIn 1822, Morris married his cousin Leah Jarrett and initially moved to Cabell County, Virginia. Four years later, in 1826, he relocated his family to Sangamon County, Illinois alongside his wife's family, Jonathan Jarrett and others, joining his cousins James T. B. Stapp and Wyatt Berry Stapp who had taken up residence a few years earlier.  The move to Illinois coincided with the death of his grandfather, James Jarrett. Jarrett owned the Salt mine on the Burning Springs tract, which George Washington attempted unsuccessfully to secure the rights to. Jarrett's Salt mine was sold for $12,500 and directed the proceeds be distributed among his 18 heirs for the purpose of purchasing land out west.\nWinnebago and Black Hawk War\nIn 1827, Morris commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Indian Wars in Illinois's Mounted Riflemen Regiment during the Winnebago War.\nIn 1831, Morris was promoted to Captain, and he commanded a volunteer company from Sangamon County in the Sauk and Fox War (Sac and Fox), which led to the Black Hawk War. The governor, John Reynolds, called up a volunteer force to \"repel the invasion of the British Band\". The troops marched to the Black Hawks's village on June 25, 1831. Five days later, the Black Hawks signed a treaty stating that they would not return to the east side of the river except by express permission of the government. Captain Morris was present during the signing of the treaty.\nIn 1832 at the start of the Black Hawk War, Morris served as the captain of his own company under Colonel Samuel M. Thompson in the Fourth Regiment, and was elected by his unit as their major. In this election, Abraham Lincoln was promoted from private to captain. Four days later, due to a vacancy in the unit, Morris was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the 4th Illinois Regiment of Mounted Volunteers, overseeing the troops from Sangamon County. Captain Abraham Lincoln was one of his subordinate commanders. His brigade commander was Samuel Whiteside.\nDuring the war Morris served alongside his cousins Colonel James T. B. Stapp (aide-de-camp) and Colonel Wyatt Berry Stapp as well as with Major Zachary Taylor, General Andrew Jackson, and Lieutenant Jefferson Davis.\nAfter the hostilities subdued Morris was discharged as Lt. Colonel, Whiteside was discharged as General, and Lincoln",

    "\n2024 single by Loreen\n\"Forever\" is a song by Swedish singer Loreen, released as a single on  10 May 2024, through Universal. The single was written by Loreen, alongside British production team, TMS, Boy Matthews Conor Blake and Zhone, with the latter also producing the song with Billen Ted. The song is a torch song and ballad which incorporates a EDM and Eurodance production. The song places emphasis on Loreen's vocals, set over progressively louder-growing production instrumentation. In its lyrics, she addresses her love and pleads for not want wanting to be alone and having a lasting love.\n\"Forever\" received positive reviews from music critics, who discussed it in relation to Loreen's previous music and praised her vocals and the lyrics. Loreen debuted the song at the 68th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, where she returned as the reigning winner, after Loreen set a record the previous year at the Eurovision Song Contest 2023, in Liverpool as the only woman to win the competition twice and only second overall (behind Johnny Logan).\nBackground and composition\nLoreen made history at the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 in Liverpool after her entry \"Tattoo\" went on to win the contest with 583 points, earning Sweden its seventh Eurovision win and making Loreen the first woman and the second performer to have won the competition twice. Shortly after her win, Loreen returned to the music studio to work on new music and \"Is It Love\" was the follow up song to her triumph win in Liverpool in 2023. Loreen decided to return to her original roots of dance music. She began looking to create something that would matter to the LGBT community. In an interview for Official Charts Company, she said it was her \"gift to you \". Upon speaking about her new record, Loreen was looking to create a follow-up to 2012's Heal and with \"Tattoo\" being the first part of the book, \"Forever\" serving as the second chapter. Loreen said: \"Tattoo was about having a constructive way of seeing the pain in our lives, but it's necessary to have that pain so we can evolve. Who are we without struggles? So, that was the start, but the conclusion is always love. Positive energy attracts positive energy. I don't want to hear about negative attracting positive...we are not batteries! If you want to change the course of your life, you have to start thinking positive.\"\nLoreen performing \"Forever\" at the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 in Malm\u00f6\nLoreen wrote \"Forever\" with production team TMS, Boy Matthews and Zhone Loreen wanted to create something that sounded \"spiritual\" and dubbed it a \"spiritual pop\" track. Loreen wanted the track to be \"powerful if used the right way\". Loreen did not have a song, but had the narrative to the song, and wanted to create it to perform in the finale of Eurovision Song Contest 2024. The narrative of the song is a declaration of love, and that love is the key to life. Loreen conceived the songs first harmonies by singing by a piano, and once a pattern is formed, \"A free start from beginning to end. And everything came almost in one take. Of course, we tweaked it a little.\"\n\"Forever\" was created solely for her Eurovision return performance as a sequel to \"Tattoo\". Loreen explained that on creating the upcoming album, she has generated a \"a whole suite of songs\". The album would be a journey of her time from Heal to now, and the album would feature some crying, some job and she wants all feelings to be incorporated within the album. Loreen stated that she does not care about what the music industry expects from her, she said this leads to people being \"unhappy\" and results in \"a big price\".

    "American newspaper editor, educator, politician, and lawyer (1829\u20131905)\nDaniel Parham Stubbs (July 7, 1829 \u2013 May 2, 1905) was an American politician.\nFamily and personal life\nThe Stubbs and Parham families were of English descent, and both lived in Georgia until the Stubbses, Quakers opposed to slavery, relocated to Ohio in 1805. William Stubbs and his future wife Delilah Parham were both born in Appling County, Georgia. Parham's father served in the American Revolutionary War, and was present at the Siege of Yorktown.\nDaniel Parham Stubbs was born on July 7, 1829, and raised on the family farm in Preble County, Ohio. He attended local schools, as well as Union County Academy in the neighboring Union County, Indiana. He began teaching in 1853, and was named principal of the academy for 1854, serving through 1855. During his teaching career, Stubbs read law, and completed his legal education at Asbury University in 1856. He then began practicing law and concurrently served as editor of the Union County Herald. He moved to Fairfield, Iowa, in 1857, and practiced law in partnership with James F. Wilson for five years, then alone thereafter. The Wells-Stubbs House was built in Fairfield in 1874, and Stubbs lived there from 1877 until his death on May 2, 1905. Stubbs and his wife Carrie Hollingsworth married in 1855. The couple raised four children, three of whom survived him.\nPolitical career\nStubbs left the Liberty Party in 1856 to join the Republican Party. He won his first political office, the mayoralty of Fairfield, in 1859, and won a second term the following year. Stubbs was then elected to the Iowa Senate in 1863 as a Republican. Stubbs represented District 11 from January 11, 1864, to January 12, 1868, and attended the 1864 National Union National Convention. During the 1872 presidential election, Stubbs supported Liberal Republican Party candidate Horace Greeley. Stubbs was nominated by the Greenback Party to run in the 1877 Iowa gubernatorial election, finishing third of four candidates. He also received the Greenback nomination for the 1880 United States House of Representatives election in Iowa's 1st congressional district, and the 1882 United States Senate elections in Iowa.\n",
    "Proposed regional transit system in India\nThe Ghaziabad\u2013Jewar Regional Rapid Transit System (Ghaziabad\u2013Jewar RRTS) is a proposed 72.29\u00a0km (44.92\u00a0mi)-long semi high-speed rail and regional transit corridor that will connect the National Capital Region (NCR) cities of Ghaziabad, Noida and Noida International Airport at Jewar. It is the fourth of the four rapid rail corridors planned under the first phase of the RapidX project managed by the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC). It will be built to allow a maximum speed of 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), and the distance between Ghaziabad, Noida and its airport will be covered in less than 40\u201350 minutes. The project will be executed at a cost of around \u20b920,045 crore (US$2.4\u00a0billion). It will start from Ghaziabad as the starting station, run through Noida, Greater Noida, YEIDA City and end in Jewar Airport at Jewar. It will have 12 stations and two depots on both the northern and southern ends of the corridor.\nThe project will comprise two sections to distinguish between the urban and the rural divisions. The first will be from Ghaziabad to Kasna or Ecotech VI of Greater Noida, covering 32.9\u00a0km (20.4\u00a0mi) by running together with Noida Metro's 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) extension between Char Murti Chowk and Knowledge Park-IV, while also\nintegrating with Delhi Metro's Red Line at Ghaziabad. The second will be from Kasna or Ecotech VI to Noida International Airport at Jewar by passing through the under-development YEIDA City, covering 32.9\u00a0km (20.4\u00a0mi), where it will be integrated with the proposed 14.6\u00a0km (9.1\u00a0mi)-long light rail line, which will serve the upcoming Noida Film City. The RRTS project was given an in-principle approval by the Government of Uttar Pradesh in December 2023, and the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) issued work order to the owner of the four RRTS corridors, NCRTC, to prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the project in January 2024. The NCRTC submitted the DPR in three months to the YEIDA and the Government of Uttar Pradesh in April 2024. The corridor is expected to be completed by 2027.\nBackground\nDue to increasing population, traffic, congestion, pollution, demand and risk of accidents and mishaps in the National Capital Region (NCR), in 2005, the Planning Commission formed a task force under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) to develop a multi-modal regional transit system for the NCR. This was included in the Integrated Transport Plan for NCR 2032, with special emphasis on Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) connecting regional centres. In 2013, The Governments of India and Delhi decided to create a comprehensive plan for developing a regional railway that will connect Delhi directly with the adjoining cities and regions of the NCR and beyond. Therefore, the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) was formed in July 2013, as a joint venture (JV) of the Governments of India and the states of Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. The objective of this company is to reduce dependence of commuters on road-based transportation and enhance regional connectivity within the NCR and beyond, and construct, own and operate the Regional Rapid Transit Systems (RRTS). Within Delhi, the RRTS systems will largely run underground, connect to the Delhi Metro and provide commuters with a faster alternative option as a last-mile connectivity to reach their destination. These systems will be similar to other regional transit systems in the world, like London's Crossrail, Paris' RER and Munich's S-Bahn.\nInitially, eight corridors traversing the NCR of at least 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) were planned to be implemented, which now increased to nine, of which four corridors are being tracked to implement in the coming years, including the Delhi\u2013Meerut, Delhi\u2013Alwar, Delhi\u2013Panipat and Ghaziabad\u2013Jewar corridors. The Delhi\u2013Meerut corridor was chosen to be implemented first, due to high frequency of travellers and traffic between Delhi and Meerut, so, the central, state governments and the NCRTC began studies and cleared its construction. The Ghaziabad\u2013Jewar corridor is the latest to be added in the list, upon the announcement of the Government of Uttar Pradesh in December 2023, in order to provide a direct and seamless connectivity to the under-construction YEIDA City and Noida International Airport in Jewar.\nHistory\nThere have been plans to link the under-construction Noida International Airport in Jewar with Delhi and the rest of the National Capital Region (NCR) through a direct metro line since May 2019, when the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) showcased their plans with seven options, including either to make Greater Noida the origin of the line as a second line of Noida Metro, or extending the Delhi Metro's Violet Line till the airport from its terminating point at Faridabad. In June 2023, an RRTS corridor plan was presented by the DMRC to link the airport with Indira Gandhi Inter",
    "Art Deco NRHP building in Indianapolis, Indiana\nUnited States historic place\nCircle Tower is a 14-story high rise at 55 Monument Circle in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. The building is a contributing property of the Washington Street\u2013Monument Circle Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.\nThe building was designed by Rubush & Hunter and is an example of Art Deco architecture. The building features ziggurat-like upper floors to circumvent a 108\u00a0ft (33\u00a0m) height restriction which was set by the city planners. Another design element is the use of Egyptian motifs and artwork.  \nPlanning\nThe Tower Realty Company was approved to build on the site in 1929. By May 1929 the site was cleared by razing buildings which included the State Savings and Trust and the Franklin buildings. There was also the four-story building of the Starr Piano Company on the site which had to be purchased and razed. The piano store's 99-year lease also had to be purchased by the Tower Realty Company.\nThe Circle Tower building construction, including the 99 year lease of the piano company, was $1.7 million (equivalent to $30,165,116 in 2023). The Indianapolis Star reported that the lobby and walls would feature imported marble, carved granite, limestone and bronze, and that automatic elevators would be installed. The architects announced that their design would be a nine-story building with five additional stories erected on the set-back principle of construction. By October 3, 1929, most of the structure's exterior had been built.\nHistory\nCircle Tower was completed in 1930 and is located on Monument Circle. It is in the style of Art Deco architecture. The building has 111,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (10,300\u00a0m2) of floorspace and features an Egyptian motif with other design details that include an ornate lobby. In 1997, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contribution property of the Washington Street\u2013Monument Circle Historic District.\nThe Chicago co-working company Expansive purchased the building from Ambrose Property Group for $11.65 million in 2017. The buyer intended to renovate parts of the building for co-working space. In 2023, Expansive was sued by Centier Bank of Merrillville, Indiana, for non-payment and bankruptcy proceeding began.\nDesign\nThe building was designed by Rubush & Hunter. The elevators in the building are adorned with an art-deco motif featuring a black-and-gold color scheme with various carvings. King Tut's tomb had been discovered in 1922 and The Indianapolis Star newspaper stated that there was a \"nationwide obsession with all things Egyptian\". The newspaper stated that the tomb's discovery was the reason for the Egyptian motifs which appear in the design elements of the building. There are granite sculptures in the arched entryway and Indianapolis sculptor Joseph Willenborg created a bronze grill with Egyptian figures.\nThe highest stories of the building are ziggurat-like, tapering back from the lower stories. A 1922 city ordinance limited buildings on the Circle to a height of no more than 108\u00a0ft (33\u00a0m). Rubush and Hunter were able to incorporate the set-back upper levels to make the building taller.\nGallery\nPhotochrom of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument ca. 1904 before Circle Tower\nMonument Circle, with Circle Tower on the left (2014)\nCircle Tower (2012)\nCircle Tower Egyptian design elements\nSee also\nList of Art Deco architecture in Indiana\n",
    "Singaporean police officer and spy (1921\u20131998)\nHalford Lovell Boudewyn (1921 \u2013 26 April 1998) was a Singaporean retired police officer who, during the Japanese occupation, worked as a spy by stealing classified document from the Indian National Army (INA) and shared war news about the Japanese to prisoner-of-war camps using an illegal wireless set.\nEarly life\nBorn in 1921, Boudewyn studied at St. Joseph's Institution and graduated and joined the Straits Settlements Police Force in September 1939. He was promoted to Inspectorate in January 1941 and was later sent to work at Alor Gajah Police Station in Malacca, Malaysia. However, he returned to Singapore in February 1942 when the Japanese invaded Singapore and Malaya, causing the Straits Settlements Police Force to close.\nWork as a spy\nIn 1943, Boudewyn worked for a Eurasian food contractor who was supplying food to camps for the Indian National Army (INA) in Singapore. While supplying food, he became friends with a British Indian Army officer, Aubrey Wyman, who was a prisoner-of-war (POW). Wyman had a position at an office, opposite of the INA headquarters at Upper Serangoon Road, and had access to important documents which told of the harsh treatment of the POWs and the INA. Afterwards, Boudewyn and Wyman planned to smuggle the documents out.\nBy then, the documents were located in a different camp and Boudewyn quit his job to join the then-Japanese controlled police force. Boudewyn then posed as a vegetable seller who sold his vegetables to the camp everyday, a friend (not Wyman) would then buy the vegetables and hide the documents in the pile, returning the vegetables to Boudewyn as they were \"rotten\". He would tie the vegetables with the documents on his bicycle, which would avoid detection from the officers as they searched him before he entered or left.\nAlong with this, while working at the Japanese controlled police force, he commandeered wireless sets. He stole two and replaced them with \"duds\". He hid one in a laundry basket at Orchard Road Police Station and the other at a house in Chancery Lane. He monitored the broadcasts and with the help of Wyman, relayed the information to POW camps.\nHe wrote what he heard from the radio on paper before transferring the notes to jelly. The jelly absorbed the ink from the carbon pencil and functioned as a printing block. He then used this to create a 100 copies and, using sago paste, would paste them on lampposts from St Barnabas Road to Tanjong Pagar Railway Station. Boudewyn was later rewarded $50 by the Japanese for having \"discovered\" these postings.\nAfter being given a tip however, Boudewyn got scared and buried the Chancery Lane wireless set and the documents in an oil drum at the Chancery Lane house but continued to use the Orchard Road wireless set. Unexpectedly, the Japanese decided to occupy the house, turning the spot where Boudewyn had buried the oil drum into a garden. The Japanese had dug about 3 feet into the ground, one foot away from where he had buried the oil drum.\nHe later moved the oil drum over to his brother's house, which is where it remained until after the war. Afterwards, Boudewyn contacted the Army Intelligence and submitted the documents to them. These documents were later used as evidence in an inquiry used to investigate high-ranking officers.\nPost-war\nBoudewyn (right) being awarded the Colonial Police Medal by Franklin Charles Gimson.\nIn 1948, Boudewyn was awarded the Colonial Police Medal by then-Governor of Singapore Franklin Charles Gimson. In 1971, he retired from the Police Force due to health complications.\nPersonal life\nIn 1992, he lived at Toa Payoh. In 1946, he married Theresa Mildred Boudewyn (n\u00e9e Da Silva), a cosmetics saleswoman. In 1968, he was awarded the Pingat Bakti Setia.\nIn 1985, he suffered from a stroke after having undergone five coronary bypass operations.\nDeath\nOn 26 April 1998, Boudewyn died in his sleep at 77 after suffering from bladder cancer for 12 years and severe heart complications. He was survived by his wife, two daughters, and one son.\n",

He was made the club captain the following year, as Eskaton were relegated to the Second Division, nonetheless, Tipu attracted the attention of Premier Division club Brothers Union, joining them in 1996.\nTipu represented Abahani Limited Dhaka during the 1996\u201397 Bangabandhu Cup and managed to score the first goal of the tournament against Malaysia Red. He was also part of the Abahani squad which lifted the 2000 National League title. He also won the  2001\u201302 edition of the tournament with Mohammedan SC. However, his stints at major clubs such as Abahani and Mohammedan were cut-short due to club bindings.\nIn 2005, Tipu returned to Abahani and cemented his status as a super-sub during his final stint at the club. During a 2009 AFC President's Cup group-stage game against Sri Lanka Army, Tipu came on as a 72nd-minute substitute and scored the winner within a minute with his first touch. He also managed to win consecutive B.League titles before transferring to Muktijoddha Sangsad KC in 2009.\nInternational career\nTipu began his international career in 1996, representing Bangladesh U16 at the 1996 AFC U-16 Championship qualifiers held in Nagoya, Japan. Under coach Otto Pfister, the team defeated Malaysia U16 3\u20130 before losing 2\u20130 to hosts Japan U16, which eventually denied them qualification to the main round.\nIn the same year, Otto Pfister included Tipu in the Bangladesh U19 team which defeated Maldives 8\u20130 in aggregate to qualify for the 1996 AFC Youth Championship. During the second-leg of the qualifiers, Tipu scored a hat-trick as Bangladesh thrashed Maldives U19 5\u20130. Nonetheless, he was less impressive in the main tournament held in Seoul, South Korea, as Bangladesh finished bottom of their group.\nThe following year, Otto Pfister handed Tipu his Bangladesh national team debut at the 1997 SAFF Gold Cup. Tipu most memorable international match came during the 1999 South Asian Games semi-final against India. Tipu who came on as a second-half substitute scored the games only goal from a long-range shot ensuring Bangladesh's place in the final.

    "\nThe surviving wing of Byram Hall, in 2020\nByram Park is a former country estate in Byram, North Yorkshire, a village in England.\nThe estate was acquired by the Ramsden family in 1618.  Byram Hall, at the heart of the park, had been built in the 16th century, and was altered by its new owners.  In 1762, John Carr of York redesigned the building, giving it facades in the Neoclassical style.  It had a three-storey main front, and two-storey wings, with the west wing having 15 bays.  In 1780, Robert Adam made internal alterations to the building.  The family sold the estate in the 1920s, following which part of the building was demolished, with most of the remainder following in 1947.  The east service wing survived until it burnt down in the 1980s.  The west service wing survives, as do several associated buildings, and most features of the park.\nThe coach house, in 2020\nThe surviving service wing is built of rendered brick and sandstone, with dressings in stone and red gauged brick, a cornice and a low parapet.  There are three storeys and nine bays.  In the ground floor, alternate bays contain doorways and sash windows, and the upper floors contain sash windows with flat brick arches.  It is in poor condition and is not inhabited, but is Grade II listed.  Nearby is the coach house and stable block, also designed by John Carr, and disused due to mining subsidence.  The structure is built of brick and sandstone, and has hipped roofs of Welsh slate and asbestos.  The building has two storeys and an L-shaped plan, the stables forming a north range with three bays, and the coach house an east wing with seven bays.  The middle three bays of the coach house project, and in the centre is a round carriage arch with a moulded archivolt, the flanking bays with round-arched windows in moulded archivolts.  The outer bays contain round carriage arches with impost bands.  In the upper floor are sash windows with flat arches of gauged brick.  The stables contain blind arcading and round-arched stable openings.\nThe footbridge over the lake\nThe park and gardens were in existence by the early 18th century.  Capability Brown was commissioned in 1782 to produce a plan for their redevelopment, but he died the following year and it is not known whether he completed the plan or whether it was carried out.  Over the next few years, a lake was constructed, and many trees were removed from the deer park.  In the mid 19th century, more woodland was planted, the lake was redesigned, and pleasure grounds were created to its north, including formal gardens and greenhouses.  Following the sale of the estate, the parkland was converted to farmland, and much of the woodland was removed, but the lake and kitchen garden survive.   A bridge over the lake, built in 1825, is Grade II listed.  The piers are in stone and brick.  The bridge has three segmental arches in cast iron and wood, with pointed arcading to the spandrels, quatrefoil decoration above the piers, and a latticework parapet.\nWithin the pleasure grounds, there is a Grade II listed orangery.  It was designed by John Carr in the late-18th century, and has been converted into a private house.  It is in rendered sandstone and brick, on a plinth, with a frieze, a dentilled cornice, an openwork parapet with faceted finials, and a Welsh slate roof.  There is a single storey and five bays.  It has an arcade with moulded round arches, a glazed entrance and multi-paned windows.  The walls of the formal gardens and kitchen garden survive, the areas linked by tunnels, designed to allow gardeners to move between them.\nIn addition, two lodges survive.  One, originally half of a matching pair, is Grade II listed and has been attributed to Carr.  It is built of limewashed stone on a plinth, with a stepped low parapet and a Welsh slate roof.  There is a square plan, a single storey and a single bay, the centre of each side slightly projecting.  The central doorway has a plain architrave, a frieze and a pediment.  On the sides are windows, each in an architrave, with an apron, a frieze and a pediment.  The other, the North Lodge, was built in the mid 19th century, and was restored and extended in the 1960s.\nSee also\nListed buildings in Byram cum Sutton\n",
    "\nAbdul Rahim Ahmad Mahmoud al-Huwaiti (died; April 2020) was a Saudi citizen and member of the Howeitat tribe, known for his resistance against the Saudi government's eviction orders for a mega-project. A government employee at the Ministry of Finance, al-Huwaiti became a symbol of protest after he was killed by Saudi security forces in April 2020, following his refusal to give up his ancestral land. His death sparked international criticism and brought attention to the impact of Saudi Arabia's Neom project on the local population.\nEarly life and career\nAl-Hawiti was a civil servant in the Ministry of Finance.\nConflict with Saudi government\nIn April 2020, Al-Hawaiti and other residents were being pressured by the Saudi government to give up their properties and accept financial compensation for a Neom mega-project. Al-Hawaiti refused to allow the Land Registry Committee to enter his house. He posted several videos on social media protesting against the eviction.\nOn 13 April 2020, he posted videos online announcing that Saudi security forces were trying to evict him and other members of the Howeitat tribe from their historical homeland to make way for the development of Neom. In the videos, Al-Huwaiti said that he would defy the eviction orders, although he expected that Saudi authorities would plant weapons in his house to incriminate him.\nDeath\nAl-Hawaiti was shot dead by Saudi security forces after he refused to hand over his property for a mega-project on the Red Sea. According to Saudi activists, al-Hawaiti was shot dead after recording his last video of security forces storming his property. The Saudi government has not commented on the alleged killing.\nAl-Huwaiti's funeral was held near the village of al-Khoraibah and was well attended despite the presence of Saudi security forces.\nAftermath\nOn 9 June 2020, the MENA Rights Group and ALQST submitted a letter to the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, alleging that al-Hawaiti was subjected to excessive torture by law enforcement officials. and executed as a result of the use of disproportionate force acting on behalf of Saudi Arabia.\nLegacy\nAl-Hawaiti's death sparked international attention and criticism of the Saudi government's handling of the Neom project and its impact on the local population.\nSee also\nRabih Alenezi\n",
    "Genus of lichens\nMelanotopelia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae. It has four species of corticolous (bark-dwelling), crustose lichens. This genus includes species characterised by dark pigmentation in their exciple (a ring of tissue encircling their fruiting bodies), non-amyloid ascospores, and specific secondary metabolites.\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was circumscribed in 2008 by the lichenologists H. Thorsten Lumbsch and Armin Mangold, with M.\u00a0toensbergii assigned as the type species. The name Melanotopelia comes from the Greek prefix melano- (meaning very dark), which refers to the dark pigmentation of the true exciple, and the genus Topelia (family Gyalectaceae), which it superficially resembles. The type was originally described as a member of the genus Topeliopsis toensbergii in 2000.\nMelanotopelia was established to address certain morphological and chemical characteristics that distinguished it from other genera within its family. Previous studies on the genus Topeliopsis had revealed notable inconsistencies in its circumscription. Initially described to accommodate species with specific ascomata features and spore characteristics, Topeliopsis was found to be heterogeneous. Some species, such as T.\u00a0rugosa and T.\u00a0toensbergii, showed unique traits that set them apart, such as dark pigmented layers in the proper exciple, non-amyloid ascospores, and the presence of depsidones.\nSubsequent molecular phylogenetics analyses supported the exclusion of these deviating species from Topeliopsis. The detailed morphological and chemical differences, along with DNA sequence data, demonstrated the need for a distinct genus to house these outliers. Consequently, the new genus Melanotopelia was described.\nDescription\nMelanotopelia is a genus of crustose lichens characterised by a thin, sometimes barely noticeable thallus covered by a delicate epinecral layer. The thallus lacks a visible prothallus and contains a trentepohlioid photobiont, which is a type of green alga.\nThe apothecia (fruiting bodies) are sessile (attached directly by their base without a stalk) and can be subglobose (almost spherical) or barrel-shaped. Initially, they are closed but later open by a terminal pore. These apothecia measure between 0.3 and 1.0\u00a0mm in diameter and have a somewhat toothed margin. The discs are dark brown to blackish and deeply urn-shaped. The true exciple (outer layer of the apothecium) is cup-shaped, dark brown to black-brown, and features an internal, hyaline (translucent), amyloid layer at the top with lateral paraphyses (sterile filamentous structures).\nThe hypothecium, which is the tissue layer below the hymenium (spore-bearing layer), is hyaline. The hymenium itself is tall, ranging from 150 to 350\u00a0\u00b5m, hyaline, and non-amyloid. Paraphyses are simple, straight, and fused together without thickened tips. The asci (spore sacs) are cylindrical, non-amyloid, and of the Ostropales type, typically containing 1 to 4 spores.\nThe ascospores are ellipsoid, hyaline, and have a true muriform (brick-like) structure. They measure 75 to 180\u00a0\u00b5m in length and 20 to 40\u00a0\u00b5m in width. These spores are thin-walled, sometimes indistinctly surrounded by a halo (halonate), and turn reddish when treated with iodine. Pycnidia, which are asexual reproductive structures, are unknown for this genus.

    "Chilean Thoroughbred racehorse\nFor other uses, see Wolf (disambiguation).\nWolf (19 August 1987\u20132002) was a champion Chilean Thoroughbred racehorse who won the Chilean Triple Crown while undefeated, compiling a win streak of ten races, including six consecutive Group 1 wins, and was named the Chilean Horse of the Year in 1990 and 1991. According to articles by El Turf and Textual, Wolf is considered to be one of the best Chilean racehorses ever. Along with Gran Ducato, he was voted the Chilean Horse of the Decade of 1990. Wolf became known as the 'turf champion' of his home track, Club H\u00edpico de Santiago.\nBackground\nWolf was a dark bay or brown horse with no markings and was bred by Haras Santa Amelia.\nWolf's sire Domineau was bred in the United States, where he spent his racing career, winning only 3 of 51 starts and $97,615, never advancing beyond the allowance level. Exported to Chile, Domineau found more success as a sire, becoming the leading sire in Chile in 1988 and 1990.\nWolf was sold at auction and purchased by trainer Hern\u00e1n Miranda for the \"Stud Panam\u00e1\", who found some physical issues with Wolf's feet and returned him to his breeder. Haras Santa Amelia campaigned Wolf, with Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Allende Fern\u00e1ndez as his trainer.\nRacing career\nIn Chile (1990-1991)\nWolf debuted as a two-year-old on April 29, 1990, in a 1300-meter maiden race at Club H\u00edpico de Santiago, which he won by five and a half lengths. A month later, he easily won the Group 3 Cl\u00e1sico Raimundo Vald\u00e9s C. over 1600 meters, with a winning margin of nine lengths.\nWolf's third race was the Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico Alberto Vial Infante, also 1600 meters long. Along with being his first start at the highest level of racing, it was his first start on a yielding track, since all of this other starts were run under firm conditions. He didn't handle the yielding track well, with his trainer Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Allende Fern\u00e1ndez saying that he dropped in level on the surface. Wolf struggled in the race, but managed to defeat Mayfair by one and a quarter lengths.\nWolf returned to the races as a three-year-old in the Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico Nacional Ricardo Lyon, run over 2000 meters. He ran in fifth place in the early parts of the race before moving to the lead 400 meters from the finish, pulling away to win by an authoritative eight and a quarter lengths.\nA month later, Wolf ran in the Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico El Ensayo, one of the most important races on the Chilean calendar and first leg of the Chilean Triple Crown. Ten rivals faced Wolf, including Mayfair, who took the early lead in the 2400 meter race. Wolf ran the same way he did in the Cl\u00e1sico Nacional Ricardo Lyon, waiting in fifth place before making his move around the final turn. Once again, Wolf pulled away easily, winning by seven and a quarter lengths and setting a new track record of 2:23.1.\nThe Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico St. Leger, second leg of the Triple Crown, was Wolf's next race, run on December 1, 1990. It was his first race at a different track, Hip\u00f3dromo Chile, and his first race on the dirt. The favorite for the race was Memo, then considered the best horse in training at Hip\u00f3dromo Chile. The confrontation between the two colts was built up as the 'race of the century', with nearly one hundred thousand people attending the race.\nAs per his usual, Memo took the lead right out of the gates, but Wolf's jockey Luis Mu\u00f1oz Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez rode him much closer to the pace than usual, in third place, to avoid giving Memo too much of an advantage early on. Wolf moved into second place a little over 900 meters from the finish, and Luis Mu\u00f1oz Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez pushed him to stay on Memo's heels, despite so much of the 2200 meter race still being left to run. Coming into the homestretch, Wolf drew up next to Memo, and the two dug in for the final 400 meters. The two drew away from the rest of the field, by over twenty lengths. The two remained neck-and-neck until the final 150 meters, when Wolf began to open up on Memo, eventually winning by a length and a three-quarters. Afterwards, Wolf's trainer Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Allende Fern\u00e1ndez said \"This is the loveliest race I have ever seen in my life.\"\nWolf returned to Club H\u00edpico de Santiago later that month to run in the Group 1 Gran Cl\u00e1sico Coronaci\u00f3n, run over a distance of 2000 meters. He won the race by nine lengths in a \"walk\".\nThe third and final leg of the Chilean Triple Crown, the Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico El Derby, a 2400-meter long race at Valparaiso Sporting Club, was run February 3, 1991. Wolf was a strong favorite become the first horse since Pr\u00f3logo in 1966 to win the Triple Crown, despite the return presence of Memo. Wolf performed as expected, and the race unfolded much like the St. Leger, although this time Wolf crossed the finish line five lengths ahead of Memo.\nFor his campaign in 1990 and 1991, Wolf was named the Chilean Champion Turf Two-Year-Old, Champion Turf Three-Year-Old, Champion Dirt Three-Year-Old, and Horse of the Year.\nIn the United States (1991-1992)\nWolf's American campaign began July 29, 19",
    "Kan 7.10.360 is an interactive virtual museum dedicated to the commemoration and illustration of the events of the October 7, 2023 massacres. It was launched in May 2024 by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation in preparation for Israel's Memorial Day.\nBackground\nOn the morning of October 7, 2023, Hamas militants and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants launched a surprise attack on Israel. Under the cover of thousands of rocket launches, approximately 3,000 militant infiltrated dozens of Israeli communities and military installations in and around the Gaza Envelope, engaging in firefights against the few security forces present. The militant carried out massacres and rapes, killing 1,150 people, of whom 779 were civilians, and kidnapped around 253 people, including women, elderly, and infants, to the Gaza Strip. In the initial hours, response units, Israeli police officers, YAMAM fighters, and IDF soldiers fought against them despite being outnumbered. About 1,550 militants were killed on Israeli soil during the battles, while the Israeli side lost 301 soldiers, 55 police officers, and 10 Shin Bet agents.\nIn response to the massacres, the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation initiated the creation of the 7.10.360 Museum to document and commemorate the events of October 7.\nEstablishment of the Museum and Its Goals\nIn preparation for Israel's Memorial Day in May 2024, the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation launched the 7.10.360 Museum, an interactive virtual museum by \"Kan Digital\" in collaboration with the tech company AppsFlyer. It is the first of its kind in Israel. The museum allows visitors to virtually tour the Gaza Envelope communities from anywhere in the country and the world. Through an application, visitors can view documentation of the events and aftermath of the October 7, 2023 attack. Visitors can also hear firsthand accounts from residents and security personnel.\nThe museum utilizes thousands of hours of raw materials collected in the corporation's archives since the outbreak of the war, including reports, films, interviews, and podcasts. Additionally, previously unpublished video clips, security footage, recordings, and correspondences were incorporated, gathered through research conducted by the corporation's team in collaboration with southern communities and settlements. In the months following the museum's launch, additional archival footage and data are expected to be added, providing a foundation for future research and education about the massacre. The technical management of the museum is handled by Diskin Company, which developed the virtual museum of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp.\n",
    "Mountain in Israel\nView of the mount\nMount Adir (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d3\u05d9\u05e8, romanized:\u00a0Har Adir, Arabic: \u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0639\u062f\u0627\u062b\u0631, romanized:\u00a0Jabal Adathir) is a mountain in the Upper Galilee, Israel, located within the area of the Meron Nature Reserve, near the settlements of Sasa, Mattat, and Hurfeish. The mountain rises to a height of 1,008 meters above sea level, making it one of the highest mountains in Israel. It is covered with a dense Mediterranean forest of oak, terebinth, pistacia, and kermes oak.\nThe name of the mountain, which overlooks Lebanon, was given to it because of the verse from the Book of Isaiah \"and Lebanon with its majestic trees will fall.\" At the site, there are remnants of a fortress from the Iron Age, which was presumably built by the Omride dynasty of the Kingdom of Israel. The summit of the mountain is closed to visitors and on it is an IDF base with numerous antennas, which are visible from afar.\nArcheology\nThe excavations conducted in the 1970s exposed remains which were interpreted as a three-strata fortress dated to the 9th\u201211th centuries BCE. The fortress showed characteristics of the Omride architecture and must have been built by the kings of the Northern Kingdom as a center of control over the wooded, sparsely inhabited Upper Galilee, facing the territory of Tyre in the west. Ceramic findings at the site, also date back to the Iron Age II.\nMount Adir Lookout\nMount Adir lookout\nMount Adir, close to the border with Lebanon, offers an excellent view towards most of southern Lebanon. On the first memorial day of the Second Lebanon War, the families of the fallen soldiers requested the establishment of a lookout in memory of the war's casualties. Initiated by the bereaved families, the lookout was established by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and with the assistance of the Jewish National Fund. It was inaugurated in a state ceremony on July 3, 2012, and consists of a wooden deck that can accommodate 180 visitors. On the railing, there are explanations about the course of the war, metal plates with the names of the 121 soldiers who fell during the war, orientation maps of the area, and engraved is the poem by Yehuda Amichai \"For Man Is a Tree of the Field\".\nDedication\nThere is also a plaque with a dedication from the bereaved families in memory of the war's casualties, which reads:We, the parents of soldiers who fell defending the Israel in the Second Lebanon War, are bound to this land with every fiber of our being. We have always seen contributing to the state as a central part of our worldview. Our enlistment and the enlistment of our sons to serve in the Israel Defense Forces is a natural continuation of this recognition. It was clear to us and our sons that service in the army might put them in situations where they would be required to risk their lives and perhaps even sacrifice them. We always hoped that this need would never arise. In the summer of 2006, during the war, we accompanied our sons to their eternal rest. This lookout was built in memory of our beloved, with appreciation, love, and endless longing.\nNature\nSince the lookout is located in the Mount Meron Nature Reserve, efforts were made not to harm nature. Therefore, the paved road to the mountain's summit, which was laid many years ago to reach the military base on the mountain, does not reach the lookout. Access to the lookout is possible only on foot, after a walk of about 5 minutes on a dirt road leading from the parking lot adjacent to the military camp.\n",
    "F-type star in the constellation Cetus\nHD 18262 (HR 870, HIP 13679) is an F-type giant or subgiant star located in the constellation Cetus. It has an apparent magnitude of 5.963, which makes it faintly visible to the naked eye. According to the Gaia spacecraft, HD 18262 is located at a distance of 43.79 parsecs (142.8 light-years) and is moving away from Earth at a velocity of 27.4 km/s. Considering the apparent magnitude and the distance, its absolute magnitude is equivalent to 2.79. It belongs to the thin disk population of the Milky Way.\nCharacteristics\nIt is an evolved F-type star that has left the main sequence and is now between a giant star and a subgiant, based on its spectral type of F6III-IVs. The star is 1.54 times more massive than the Sun and has expanded to 2 times its size. It is emitting six times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,400 K, which is around 630 degrees hotter than the Sun's photosphere. The age of HD 18262 is estimated at 1.64 billion years, equivalent to 36% of the Solar System's age. The star is metal-enriched compared to the Sun, the abundance of iron  on its surface is 2.3 higher than that of the Sun, while the oxygen abundance  is 2.9 times higher. Its B-V color index is 0.437, giving it the yellowish-white color of a F-type star.\nThe distance to HD 18262, based on information from the Gaia spacecraft, is of 43.79 parsecs (142.8 light-years). The apparent magnitude of the star is of 5.96m, which is bright enough to be seen to the naked eye under dark sites, far away from light pollution. The absolute magnitude, i.e. its brightness if it was seen at a distance of 10 parsecs (32.6\u00a0ly), is of 2.79. HD 18262 is moving away from Earth at a velocity of 27.38 km/s. It is part of the thin disk population of the Milky Way. Its orbit around the galaxy has a low eccentricity of 0.06 and its distance from the galactic center varies from 7.14 to 8.11 kiloparsecs (23,280 to 26,440 light-years).\nNo debris disks have been detected around this star as of 2016 and no exoplanets have been detected around it as of 2012. A 2019 study analysed the possibility of HD 18262 hosting a giant planet, in five ensembles, analysing five different compositions. The highest possibity was in the second ensemble, where the planet would be formed by volatiles, lithophiles, and sderophiles. In this case, the possibility is of 23%. HD 18262's habitable zone is located at a mean distance of 2.44 astronomical units from it.\nNotes\n^ from logarithms of 0.358 and 0.46 respectively.\n",

    "Lenticular galaxy in the constellation Perseus\nIC 310 is a lenticular galaxy located in the constellation Perseus. It is located 265 million light-years from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, it is about 117,000 light-years across. The galaxy was discovered by Edward D. Swift on November 3, 1888.\nCharacteristics\nIC 310 is classified as a head-tail radio galaxy or specifically a narrow-angle tail radio galaxy described by Sijbring et at. 1998 and Feretti et at. 1998. IC 310 has an active nucleus (AGN) and seems to represent a low-luminosity FRI radio galaxy at the borderline angle which reveals its BL Lac-type central engine.\nAt the redshift of z = 0.0189, it is one of the brightest objects detected in the Perseus Cluster at both radio frequencies and X-ray energies, and also the fourth closest AGN detected in terms of VHE gamma rays after Centaurus A, Messier 87 (M 87), and 3C 84 known as NGC 1275 which belongs to same cluster. It shares the similar properties similar to M 87, which the emission can be traced to its blazar-like central engine but shows time variability and hard spectrum that is harder to the spectrum.\nIn addition, IC 310 is identified as a \u03b3-ray emitter based on the observations at GeV energies with Fermi-LAT and with MAGIC telescopes at high energies (VHE, E > 100\u2009GeV), making it a subject of curiosity since its nucleus displays blazar-like behavior.  According to further studies, it is suggested IC 310 is the closest blazar and key object for AGN research, due to the fact, a blazar-like radio jet has been found using parsec-scale VLBL imaging, together with the unusual flat gamma-ray spectrum and variable high-energy emission.\nThere is a point-like emission in IC 310 according the XMM-Newton observation, without signs of the structure correlated with its radio halo tail. The temperature of the intracluster medium decreases as a function of distance from the cluster center from kT ~ 6 keV located northwest corner of the field to about 3 KeV in the southwest region. Although no shape edges found in the surface brightness profile, there is a brightness excess of a smooth \u03b2 model by about 20% seen. There is an increase in temperature by 10% in the same region indicating the region in IC 310 is infalling into the Perseus Cluster. The gas in front of the galaxy is compressed as well, indicating the IC 310 system is undergoing a merger.\nBlack hole\nA supermassive black hole inside IC 310 has been found to weigh over 300 million times the mass of the sun. According to an observation, over 250 million years ago, the high gamma-ray radiation left the vicinity of the black hole and reached Earth between the night of 12 and 13 November, 2012, which was observed by the pair of 17m diameter MAGIC Telescopes in La Plama.\nThis shocked an impressively bright flare on the variability time scales on minutes reaching up average flux level in the night up to one Crab above 1 TeV with hard spectrum over the past 20 years in energy. It showed a series of strong outbursts from the intra-night light curve. This shows the fast variability that constrains the size of the gamma-ray emission regime, to shrink 20% of the gravitation radius from the black hole challenging shock acceleration models.\nGroup membership\nIC 310 belongs to the NGC 1275 group, which is part of the Perseus Cluster. Other members include NGC 1224, NGC 1267, NGC 1270, NGC 1273, NGC 1277, NGC 1279, IC 288, IC 294 and IC 312.\n",

The building was conceived in 1959 by architect Gerald Robinson, whose design was influenced by the work of Le Corbusier. Construction began in 1961 and the building opened in the fall of 1963, though it was not completed until the spring of 1964. The building occupies a property owned by Victoria University that was leased in 1961 for 100 years. When it opened, the building contained stores, a theatre, offices, and apartments. The Colonnade is one of the earliest examples of brutalist architecture in Canada.\nHistory and design\nIn 1959, architect Gerald Robinson (1930\u2013) and engineer Irwin Burns (d. 2016) met at a Toronto Film Society programme. The men had a coffee at the end of the evening and talked about the decline of cities and how to revitalise them. The following morning, a real estate developer named Murray Webber (d. 2008) telephoned Burns to tell him about a property on Bloor Street, owned by Victoria University, that was available for long-term lease and development. At noon that day, Burns went to Bloor to look at the property. By chance, he ran into Robinson on the street. As the two examined the property, Burns said, \"there is the place to demonstrate what we talked about last night.\"\nBurns and Webber formed a corporation called One Thirty One Bloor West Limited, of which Burns was the president and general manager. The corporation owned half the project, while the other half was owned by Arthur Minden (1910\u20131966). In Robinson's telling, \"the inspiration came from Burns, the respectability from Webber, and the money from Minden.\" The group's proposal won out over 25 other projects submitted to Victoria University for the site. Burns and Webber announced the project on 5 October 1961. The 100-year lease they acquired from Victoria was the largest ground lease in the city's history. The developers built The Colonnade in conjunction with Britannica House at 151 Bloor, which sits on the same parcel. Shortly after the project got underway, Minden sold his half-stake to the Rubin Corporation, which became Revenue Properties later.\nGerald Robinson served as architect for the project, while Wells and Tampold were the associate architects. Norbert Seethaler was the structural engineer, John Garay Associates were the mechanical engineers, and Ellard Wilson Associates were the electrical engineers. Sasaki-Strong Associates served as landscape architects.\nMayor Donald Summerville opened The Colonnade on 16 October 1963. At the time of the opening, the building was incomplete. Construction continued until April 1964.\nThe forecourt facing Bloor Street\nRobinson drew inspiration from the concept that Le Corbusier used in his Unit\u00e9 d'habitation projects. The main block of the structure sits on a 20-foot column grid, and is 16 bays long and three bays wide. The first three storeys form the base of the structure and terminate in arches below the fourth floor. An article in The Canadian Architect compared Robinson's treatment of the arches to those of a Gothic cathedral. On either side, a two-storey podium that is two bays deep extends from the main block. Both sides of the podium include semi-elliptical cutaways that form forecourts. In the front forecourt, a floating staircase leads to a terrace on the second floor deck.\nBelow ground there are two levels of parking. The three-storey base has shops at street level and on the second floor, while the third floor serves as a mechanical area. Originally, the second floor included a 190-seat theatre called the Colonnade Theatre. Previously, Burns had served as producer for the Arts Theatre Club. The first play to run at The Colonnade Theatre was Before Compiegne, which was written by Jack Winter and opened on 3 April 1964. The play was directed by George Luscombe of Toronto Workshop Productions.\nThe fourth and fifth floors of the main block were offices originally. Floors 6-13 are apartments, and two of the 13th floor units extend to the 14th floor penthouse. Both penthouse units include open terraces, one of which has a pool. When it opened, the 164 apartments ranged in price from $110 to $1,400 per month. Over the years, The Colonnade's residents included performers Jan Rube\u0161 and Susan Douglas Rube\u0161, Simpsons chairman G. Allan Burton, lawyer Ronald Rolls, professor Thomas Howarth, judge Hugh Foster, member of parliament Marvin Gelber, and literary agent Beverley Slopen.\nRobinson believed The Colonnade should have served as a template for new downtown developments. He said, \"the whole city should be like this.  The principles we have used here will be needed in any downtown development if it is not to be dehumanized. Do you want something like Place Ville Marie where the great towers stand empty at night and the shops are below ground?\"\nThe Globe and Mail's architecture critic, Adele Freedman, wrote later",

He distinguished the magazine from merely one dedicated to Southern literature, explaining:\n will not say southern literature, for we have a decided distaste for such local expressions, as if literature were of different characters in the South and in the North. It is the same every where except in degree and tone, and its advancement, its elevation in the South, is the proper object of our desires and efforts.\nIt was named for the Orion constellation at the suggestion of William Tappan Thompson, later an editor. The first issue of the magazine, published in March 1842, resembled the typography and appearance of the Knickerbocker, published around the same time, though Richards denied any intentional emulation.\nThe magazine, not affiliated with any particular denomination or religious group, aimed to uplift literary standards in the South. Within its sixty-four pages it featured a diversity of literary works, with contributions from prominent writers hailing from both the South and North, such as William Gilmore Simms. Richards' family, including his wife Cornelia Richards, his brother Thomas Addison Richards, and his sister, also contributed to the magazine.\nRichards took on various roles in addition to being editor, contributing literary criticism, essays, humour and poetry.\nSeeking to expand the magazine's reach and influence, he relocated the magazine to Charleston, South Carolina in early 1844. However, despite these efforts, the magazine ceased publication after just six months there, ending in August 1844.\nLegacy\nAlthough criticized by some contemporaries, Orion overall received praise for its typographic quality, content, and Richard's contributions. Its significance lied in Richards's efforts to foster literature in the South and being the first of his contributions in that vein, such as his later magazine ventures the Southern Literary Gazette and the Schoolfellow.\n",
    "Russian submarine\nKit (Russian: \u041a\u0438\u0442, lit.\u2009'whale') was the second boat of the Narval class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. The submarine was laid down in December 1911 and launched in May 1915, though it was not completed until October 1915. Built for the Black Sea Fleet, it carried out raids against Ottoman supply convoys along the coast of Anatolia and was responsible for sinking 24 ships, for a total of 1,270\u00a0gross register tons\u00a0(GRT).\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the submarine remained in Sevastopol, where it was first captured by the Germans and then by the British and the White Army in the Russian Civil War. The British scuttled Kit and several other submarines near Sevastopol in April 1919 to prevent the Bolsheviks from acquiring them. Their location was found by the Soviets in 1934 and Kit became the only one of them to be raised, though they decided not to restore the submarine and had it scrapped.\nDesign and construction\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Narval-class boats and three Morzh class. The Nevsky Factory\u00a0 in Saint Petersburg developed the Narval class on the basis of a foreign design, the popular Holland type made by the American Holland Torpedo Boat Company. But there was a dispute in the Imperial Russian Navy before 1911 on which submarine type to purchase, the Narval class or the Morzh class that was designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee, who argued that they needed to study foreign technological advancements. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class.\nThe Narval-class submarines were the most advanced Russian submarines at the time because unlike the rest they had crash-diving tanks for faster diving, internal bulkheads that provided more protection for the crew, and used natural flow to fill the main ballast tanks instead of pumps. A problem that arose during their construction was that the twin 1,140 horsepower (850\u00a0kW) diesel engines to power each boat had been ordered from Germany and were not delivered by the time World War I broke out, so they had to be replaced by four American-built engines that each provided 210 horsepower (160\u00a0kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30\u00a0km/h; 18\u00a0mph) surface speed could not be attained, and neither could the 12-knot (22\u00a0km/h; 14\u00a0mph) underwater speed. Kit had slightly different weaponry from the other boats in its class, being equipped with two deck guns, including one 75\u00a0mm (3\u00a0in) and one 57\u00a0mm (2\u00a0in), along with four 450\u00a0mm (18\u00a0in) torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars. After modifications done in 1917, Kit also received two 7.62\u00a0mm machine guns and its artillery was changed for two Japanese 75 mm guns, though its external torpedo-launching collars were reduced to four.\nConstruction of all three Narval-class submarines began in Saint Petersburg, where they were laid down in December 1911, before being transferred to the shipyards in Nikolayev for the final assembly. The engines were not delivered from the United States until January 1915. Kit began its sea trials in the fall of 1915, during which some engine problems were discovered, and it underwent modifications. The submarine was completed and entered service on 27 October  1915.\nService history\nWorld War I\nAt the time when Kit entered service with the Russian Black Sea Fleet, it was focused on disrupting the Ottoman merchant convoys transporting coal from the area of Zonguldak to Constantinople, which was the main source of fuel for the Ottoman Navy. The new submarines that joined the fleet were tasked with patrolling the Anatolian coast and the entrance to the Bosporus. Despite issues with their engines, Kit and the other boats of its class became popular with Russian submarine crews. The three boats became the 2nd Squadron of the Black Sea Submarine Brigade.\nFrom late 1915 until April 1916, Kit was given modifications, this time receiving more advanced communications equipment, and it returned to service by May 1916. In that month, while on patrol, Kit was attacked by a German aircraft on the 12th, though it was able to escape without any damage. The submarine carried out six patrols in the early summer of 1916. During one of these, on 13 June 1916 Kit sank a Turkish schooner that was transporting oil. On 23 October it accompanied se",
    "\n1996 studio album by Richie Jen\nToo Softhearted (Chinese: \u5fc3\u592a\u8edf; pinyin: X\u012bn T\u00e0i Ru\u01cen), is the fifth studio album by Taiwanese recording artist Richie Jen, released on December 24, 1996, via Rock Records. The album spawned the titular track as the lead single. Musically, the album incorporates a range of musical styles such as R&B, pop, disco and flamenco. \nA major commercial success, Too Softhearted sold over 1 million copies in mainland China and over 2.3 million copies across Asia. It is one of the best-selling albums in China in terms of physical sales. When accounting for unofficial sales of the album, it is claimed that the album sold over 26 million copies in China.\nBackground and release\nToo Softhearted was released through Rock Records on December 24, 1996. Jen had initially decided that he would abandon his career as a singer and pursue a profession in sports journalism if the album did not perform well. This was because it was the last chance given to him by his record company. \nThe album subsequently saw large amounts of success and won the singer various accolades. The titular single was one of the most popular songs in China following its release and became one of Jen's signature songs.\nComposition\nThe album was recorded at studios in Taipei and Los Angeles. The lyrics of the single \"Too Softhearted\" depicts Jen's sentiments of heartbreak. It was written and produced by Taiwanese musician Johnny Chen and arranged by Christopher Troy. The track \"5151\" incorporates free and rhythmic reggae while \"I Love You\" (Dance version) is characterized as a bouncy funk number. \"The Bell Hanging on the Ivy\" samples the flamenco dance-pop song \"Macarena\" (1993) and contains Spanish verses interspersed throughout the track.\nCommercial performance\nToo Softhearted experienced major commercial success in Asia upon its release. The album is claimed to have sold over 26 million copies in mainland China, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time in the country. However, the lack of official statistics have made authenticating the claim difficult; Jen himself later stated in an interview that legitimate sales of the album stood at over 1 million copies in mainland China, and 2.3 million copies throughout Asia. Initially, the album received lukewarm reception in Taiwan; however, its sales surged following its widespread popularity in China, eventually leading to sales of approximately 600,000 copies in the territory.\nAwards\nTrack listing\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nSales\n",
    "For the later 1970s team of the same name, see San Francisco Shamrocks.\nIce hockey team in San Francisco, California\nThe San Francisco Shamrocks were an amateur ice hockey team from San Francisco, California. The team was one of the founding member of the third iteration of the Pacific Coast Hockey League and survived until 1950.\nHistory\nThe Shamrocks were founded in 1944 when the Southern California Hockey League and Northwest International Hockey League merged to form the Pacific Coast Hockey League. As it was approximately halfway between the two separate leagues, the San Francisco region was a natural place for new teams to find a home, as was the case with the Fresno Falcons and Oakland Oaks. The Shamrocks were originally placed in the central division but found themselves lumped in with the other California clubs in the south division by year two. The team was largely unsuccessful both on and off the ice, and by 1950 the club was in debt. The Shamrocks, along with the San Diego Skyhawks, asked the league for a 1-year hiatus in 1950 with the intent to return but the move proved disastrous for the club. With the league only operating clubs in the Pacific Northwest, the reduction in travel costs proved to be a welcome relief for the extant teams. The financial surety, along with the fact that California crowds had yet to become enamored with the sport, convinced the PCHL to abandon the market. Rather than try to find a new league or play independently, the Shamrocks were allowed to remain dormant.\nMore than 25 years later, the San Francisco Shamrocks name was revived for the Pacific Hockey League, but that club had no formal connection with this franchise.\nTrain crash\nIn the middle of the team's third season, the Shamrocks were travelling to a game when their train slammed into a truck carrying gasoline. The fuel ignited and showered the train, injuring many passengers and killing four. the 15 members of the team were hailed as local heroes because in the immediate aftermath, the young men help to carry several injured people away from the burning car. The survivors reported that the boys had remained calm while kicking out the windows and carrying others to safety. The players had to walk through a burning train car to help and six players were severely injured as a result. Though their issues were not considered life-threatening, the affected players missed the remainder of the season. In order to help the team, each of the other clubs in the PCHL's southern division agreed to send a player to San Francisco so they could finish out the season with a full roster. Rollie Morrisseau had the worst of the injuries with burns from his waist up to his head.\nSeason-by-season results\nSource:\nNotable players\nDick Bittner\nRalph Buchanan\nMaurice Courteau\nJoe Crozier\nLes Cunningham\nPaul Gauthier\nWally Hergesheimer\nDoug Jackson\nLou Jankowski\nSteve Kraftcheck\nStanford Smith\nNeil Strain\n",

    "Method of detecting gravitational waves\nGround-based interferometric gravitational-wave search refers to methods and devices used to search and detect gravitational waves based on interferometers built on the ground. Most of current gravitational wave observations have been made using these techniques; the first one was made in 2015 by the two LIGO detectors. The current major detectors are the two LIGO in the United States, Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan, which are all part of the second generation of detectors; future projects include LIGO-India as part of the second generation, and the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer forming a third generation.\nHistory\nWhile gravitational waves were first formulated as part of general relativity by Einstein in 1916, there were no real attempts to detect them until the 1960s, when Joseph Weber created the first of so-called \"Weber bars\". While these proved unable to reach the required sensitivity for detecting gravitational waves, many research groups focused on this topic were created at that time. While a lot of efforts were dedicated to improving the resonant bar design, the idea of using a large interferometer for gravitational wave detection was formulated in the 1970s and began to gain traction in the 1980s, leading to the foundation of LIGO in 1984 and Virgo in 1989.\nMost of the current large interferometers started construction in the 1990s and finished in the early 2000s (1999 for LIGO, 2003 for Virgo, 2002 for GEO 600). After a few years of observation and improvements to reach their target sensitivity, it became clear that a detection was unlikely and that further upgrades were required, leading to large projects now labelled as the \"second generation of detectors\" (Advanced LIGO and Virgo), with important sensitivity gains. This periods also marked the beginning of joint observing periods between the different detectors, which are crucial to confirm the validity of a signal, and sparked collaborations between the different teams.\nThe second generation upgrades were made during the early 2010s, lasting from 2010 to 2014 for LIGO and 2011 to 2017 for Virgo. In parallel, the KAGRA project was launched in Japan in 2010. In 2015, soon after restarting observations, the two LIGO detectors achieved the first direct observation of gravitational waves. This marked the beginning of the still ongoing series of gravitational wave observation periods, labelled O1 through O5; Virgo joined the observations in 2017, near the end of the O2 period, leading quickly to the first three-detector observation, and a few days later the GW170817 event, which is the only one to date to have been observed both with gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation. KAGRA was completed in 2020, only observing for brief periods of time due to its low sensitivity up until now.\nThe O4 observing run is currently ongoing, and expected to last until early 2025. More than 90 confirmed detections have been published; the collaborations now also produce live alerts when signals are detected, with more than 90 significant alerts already emitted during O4.\nPrinciple\nIn general relativity, a gravitational wave is a space-time perturbation which propagates at the speed of light. It thus slightly curves space-time, which locally changes the light path. Mathematically speaking, if  is the amplitude (assumed to be small) of the incoming gravitational wave and  the length of the optical cavity in which the light is in circulation, the change  of the optical path due to the gravitational wave is given by the formula:with  being a geometrical factor which depends on the relative orientation between the cavity and the direction of propagation of the incoming gravitational wave. In other terms, the change in length is proportional to both to the length of the cavity and the amplitude of the gravitational wave.\nAnimation displaying the principle of gravitational wave detection with an interferometer such as Virgo. Mirror displacements and phase difference are widely exaggerated\u00a0; time is also slowed down by more than a factor 10.\nInterferometer\nVirgo is a Michelson interferometer whose mirrors are suspended. A laser is divided into two beams by a beam splitter tilted by 45 degrees. The two beams propagate in the two perpendicular arms of the interferometer, are reflected by mirrors located at the end of the arms, and recombine on the beam splitter, generating interferences which are detected by a photodiode. An incoming gravitational wave changes the optical path of the laser beams in the arms, which then changes the interference pattern recorded by the photodiode.\nThis means the various mirrors of the interferometer must be \"frozen\" in position: when they move, the optical cavity length changes and so does the interference signal read at the instrument output port. The mirror positions relative to a reference and their alignment are monitored accurately in real time with a precision better than the ",

    "Spanish footballer manager and sports leader\nJuli\u00e1n Eustasio Olave Videa (29 March 1884 \u2013 2 April 1932) was a Spanish sports leader who presided over the Spanish Football Federation between 1924 and 1926 and also a football Manager who co-directed one match of the Spanish national team in 1924. As the president of the RFEF, he signed the Declaration of Professionalism in 1924 and its implementation in 1926, and he was also the first Spaniard to join the FIFA Committee in 1925.\nBiography\nAlthough born on 29 March 1884 in Bilbao, his sporting career began in 1910, as technical secretary of the Real Sociedad, since he had his automobile representation business in the city of San Sebasti\u00e1n. When he was the vice-president of the club, he was one of the promoters and founders of the Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Clubes de F\u00fatbol (UECF), which was created as an alternative to the FECF, the current Royal Spanish Football Federation, and which was on the verge of wrecking the structure of Spanish football. He was elected secretary of this entity, and as such, when FIFA did not accept the coexistence of two federations, he signed a letter to FECF proposing to reach a merger agreement between the two federations. An agreement was enventually reached in September, with the basis for unification being signed by the presidents of the two entities in dispute, Olave and Ricardo Ruiz Ferry.\nThe Spanish Union officially disappeared in 1914, but it always remained as a de facto power in the shadows, reappearing when the Spanish National League was created in 1928, postulating a rather elitist tournament, and later in 1933\u201334 supporting the group of the so-called \"speakers\", but on both of these occasions, Olave was now on the opposite trench. In 1924, in one of those turbulent assemblies, he was elected the 5th president of the Spanish Football Federation, a position that he held for two years until his resignation in 1926, being replaced by Antonio Bernab\u00e9u. In those years of so much turmoil within Spanish football, Olave was a figure of enormous relief and importance.\nNotably, Olave was the one who signed the Declaration of Professionalism in 1924 and its implementation in 1926. In his functions as president, Olave had the task of heading the Selection Committee of the Spanish national team, a triumvirate made up of himself, treasurer Jos\u00e9 Rosich, and secretary Luis Colina, so he provisionally served as national coach in a match against Austria held at the Camp de Les Corts on 21 December 1924, which ended in a 2\u20131 victory thanks to goals from Antonio Juantegui and Josep Samitier. In March 1927, he was invinted to become the president of the federation again, but he instead offered to serve Spanish football in a lower step than the one he had occupied a few months before, thus being reconstituted as treasurer. In 1928, he had no hesitation in coming to the aid of the then president, Pedro D\u00edez de Rivera y Figueroa, to put order in the federation finances.\nIn the 1910s he was one of the first translators of the football regulations into Spanish. He was the first Spaniard to join the FIFA Committee in 1925, under the presidency of Jules Rimet. The 1929 FIFA Congress, which was held in Barcelona, was attended by a Spanish delegation formed by Olave, Rosich, and Ricardo Cabot, and its most important point was the discussion of the regulations of the upcoming inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930, and Spain was the first to withdraw its candidacy to host the tournament in order to donate support to Montevideo, the \"most Spanish city among all the Spanish capitals of South America\".\nDeath\nOlave died in Madrid on 2 April 1932, at the age of 48.\n",
    "\nMarquess of Merry del Val (Spanish: Marqu\u00e9s de Merry del Val) is a hereditary title in the Peerage of Spain, granted in 1925 by King Alfonso XIII to diplomat Alfonso Merry del Val.\nHistory\nThe family's surname, Merry del Val, was formed by combining the surnames of the 1st Marquess's paternal grandparents: Rafael Merry y Gayte and Mar\u00eda de la Trinidad del Val G\u00f3mez. The Merrys were the Irish noble family, originally from County Waterford, that settled in Seville in the 18th century. Those of the Val were a noble lineage from the Kingdom of Aragon, originally from Zaragoza.\nThe parents of the 1st Marquess were Sof\u00eda Josefa de Zulueta (1839\u20131925), and Rafael Carlos Merry del Val (1831\u20131917), a career diplomat who served as the Spanish Ambassador to Belgium, to the Holy See, and Minister at the Imperial Court of Vienna, and Gentlemen of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth II and Kings Alfonso XII and Alfonso XII. The 1st Marquess served as Spanish Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1913 until 1931.

He served as the page to captain John Smith, and later as an Algonquian interpreter for the colony.\nEarly life\nCollier was born around 1595 in London, England.\nJamestown colonist\nCollier is listed among the 104 colonists on the Virginia Company of London's manifest, and was one of four boys in the first group of settlers to Jamestown. He served as a servant and page to captain John Smith and accompanied Smith on his explorations into the unknown parts of Virginia. Collier was likely around 12-13 years old in 1607 which was a normal age for apprenticeships in England. Collier accompanied Smith for his first meeting with Powhatan and Pocahontas.\nAccording to contemporary historians, Collier was sent by Smith to learn the language of the Algonquian-speaking Warraskoyack tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy, and later served the colony as an interpreter. He befriended weroance (chief) Tackonekintaco during that period.

    "Norwegian politician\nBjarne Store-Jakobsen (born 12 January 1944) is a Norwegian politician, activist, and journalist. In 2005, he was elected to the S\u00e1mi Parliament of Norway as a member of the Labour Party. He was selected by the S\u00e1mi parliament to serve as a representative for the Sami People of Norway at the Working Group on Indigenous Peoples at the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, where he would serve as leader. He served as an advisor for the President of the S\u00e1mi Parliament Egil Olli until his dismissal in 2011. He would later leave the Labour Party and serve as the leader of the S\u00e1mi People's Party.\nPrior to his time in politics, Store-Jakobsen served as a spokesperson and unofficial leader for the Sami people protesting against the development of the Alta Hydroelectric Power Station during the Alta controversy. Store-Jakobsen worked in the film and television industry as a journalist for 15 years, working for Nordlys, S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi, and Sveriges Television. His life is depicted in the 2014 film Bihtto\u0161, directed by his daughter, Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers.\nEarly life and career\nStore-Jakobsen was born on 12 January 1944 in the village of Karlebotn and was raised in the village of Vesterelv (Nesseby). He met his former wife, Esther Tailfeathers, at the 1981 World Council of Indigenous Peoples General Assembly in Canberra.:\u200a187\u200a\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, amid the Alta controversy, Store-Jakobsen served in a leadership position for the \u010cSV S\u00e1mi rights movement. He was dubbed the \"brains behind\" the movement,:\u200a177\u200a for Sami activists challenging the development of a hydroelectric plant, the Alta Hydroelectric Power Station, by the Norwegian government on the Altaelva. He served as the spokesman for the Sami who were undergoing a hunger strike at the Storting to oppose the development,:\u200a195\u200a citing the dam's subsequent threat to flood the S\u00e1mi community of Masi, and as an assertion of self-determination on their pastoral lands. Store-Jakobsen opposed the development on the grounds that individuals in the reindeer husbandry sector were opposed to the development, and the importance in protecting the nature in the area. As an activist, he was referred to with the nickname Bihtto\u0161 Bierna (Rebel Bjarne). Amid the confrontation, Store-Jakobsen stated that he was allegedly contacted by several European terrorist organizations, whose assistance he turned down. During the confrontation, Store-Jakobsen insisted that the protests be exclusively peaceful, refusing a proposal to sink the Janina, a ship used to house police officers, citing that the action would be a violent escalation.\nA trained journalist, Store-Jakobsen worked in the film and television production industries for 15 years, working as a journalist and editor. Prior to January 1978, Store-Jakobsen worked for Nordlys as a correspondent for Alta,:\u200a102\u200a quitting over management of the Sami editorial line.:\u200a102\u200a In the 1980s, Store-Jakobsen worked for the newspaper S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi in Karasjok, as its editor.:\u200a186\u200a:\u200a187\u200a In 2003, he was working as the head of the Sami editorial department for Sveriges Television in Kiruna. As of 2007, Store-Jakobsen was a member of the Sami Film Association.\nPolitical career\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Store-Jakobsen was elected to the S\u00e1mi Parliament of Norway in the 2005 Norwegian S\u00e1mi parliamentary election, representing the Midt-Troms constituency as a member of the Labour Party (Ap). During his time in the Sami parliament, he served as a member for the business and culture committee.\nIn 2008, Store-Jakobsen was appointed by the S\u00e1mi Parliament of Norway as the representative of the Sami people of Norway at the Working Group of Indigenous Peoples in the Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC). He was appointed for a second time in 2010, continuing to represent the Sami people of Norway. During his time in the BEAC, he served as head of the Working Group of Indigenous Peoples. As part of BEAC, Store-Jakobsen led the \"Vyngy syo\" (Voice of the Tundra) project, aimed at organizing Nenets language broadcasting in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. In his capacity as leader for the working group, he was critical of Russian government programs targeting Indigenous people's relationship with alcohol and the failure to provide alternative employment for communities. He called for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide financial support and prevent the bankruptcy of Kola S\u00e1mi Radio. The position oversaw the attempted implementation of the reindeer husbandry industry within the Sami of the Kola Peninsula with the project \"Obsjina Kildin\".\nIn June 2011, Store-Jakobsen was removed from his post of advisor to the President of the S\u00e1mi Parliament of Norway. Incumbent President Egil Olli cited the need for renewal in the post, stating that the then 67-year-old man was too old for the position, while Store-Jakobsen cited internal power struggles as the reason for his ouster.

    "German sports club\nTurn- und Spielgemeinde e.V. D\u00fclmen is a sports club from the town of D\u00fclmen in Westphalia. The club was founded on 28 October 1945 as the legal successor to the VfL D\u00fclmen and Turn- und Spielverein 1884 D\u00fclmen clubs. It offers football, athletics, table tennis and martial arts.\nTable tennis\nOverview and successes\nTSG D\u00fclmen's most successful department to date has been the table tennis department. The first women's team was one of the most successful German teams in the 1990s and played in the German table tennis league for many years. In 1987, the team was promoted to the 2nd Bundesliga and in 1988, under coach Dirk Schimmelpfennig, the team made it through to the 1st BL. TSG D\u00fclmen were German champions in 1995 and finished runners-up six times in total. In 1991, the D\u00fclmen team won the ETTU Cup and reached the final the following year; in 1995 and 1996, they reached the European Cup final, but lost both finals against Statisztika Budapest from Hungary. The players in these successful years included Olga Nemes, Ding Yaping, Tong Ling, Nicole Struse, Ilka B\u00f6hning, Elke Wosik, Dana Weber and Christiane Praedel. Birgit Schmude (now Birgit Schneider), the German schoolgirl champion from 1986, has been active in the club since 1980. She moved to Langweid in 1991 and returned via ESV Coesfeld in 1994. In 1997, the team made up of Nicole Struse, \u00c5sa Svensson, Alessia Arisi, Ilka B\u00f6hning and Birgit Schneider (Schmude) became German runners-up. Immediately afterwards, TSG withdrew all the women's teams.\nThe men's team became champions of the Oberliga in 1996 and played in the Regionalliga West in 1996/97. Christian S\u00fc\u00df was a youth player at TSG in 1998/99. At the end of the 1999/2000 season, the team was withdrawn from the 2nd Bundesliga.\nThe history\nThe table tennis department was founded in 1948 by Hermann Schl\u00fcter. Karl Kerckhoff was head of the department for 30 years. Initially, there was only one men's team. A women's team was registered for the first time in 1960. In 1982, the ladies played in the district league. After that, they were promoted every year until they finally reached the 1st Bundesliga in 1988. The manager during this time was Manny Malta, who was replaced by Siegfried Schmitz in 1990.\nLiterature\nD\u00fclmen-Report, DTS magazine, 1991/5 p.\u00a028-31\nDTS magazine, 1997/7 p.\u00a06\u20138; 20\nAthletics\nIn the 1960s, discus thrower Bernd Mensmann was active for TSG D\u00fclmen. Among other things, he was German runner-up in the discus throw in 1960. The department also produced other top athletes. These include sprinter Manuel Sanders and cross-country runner Klara Koppe.\nThe athletics department of TSG D\u00fclmen organised the German Marathon Championships in 1975 and 1983. Every year on the first weekend of December, a so-called \"Nikolauslauf\" takes place in favour of the M\u00fcnster Children's Cancer Aid. This is a road race over 2.5\u00a0km, 5\u00a0km and 10\u00a0km. There are around 600 participants each year. The 38th edition will take place in 2024. Another road race is the \"Wasserlauf\", which has been held annually since 2014. It was initially held in Hausd\u00fclmen. Since 2022, however, it has been held on the same course as the Nikolauslauf in the stadium on Grenzweg.\nIn addition to the road races, TSG D\u00fclmen has also organised the annual D\u00fclmen pole vault meeting since 2020, in which athletes such as Wolfgang Ritte and Annika Roloff have taken part on several occasions. In 2024, the track opening sports festival will also be held for the 41st time and the school sports festival for the 27th time.\n",
    "Indoor velodrome in Ghent, Belgium\nThe Flemish Cycling Center Eddy Merckx is a sport complex with indoor cycling track in the Belgian city of Ghent. It is named after the famous Belgian road and track cyclist Eddy Merckx.\nThe venue hosted the 1988 UCI Track Cycling World Championships and the 2009 European Track Cycling Championships, and for years it is the permanent location of the Belgian National track championships.\nHistory\nIn 1988, the open-air track \"Blaarmeersen\" was built in the Blaarmeersen recreation center close to the Watersportbaan in Ghent. The Track Cycling World Championships were organized there that same year. The weather conditions during these world championships were so bad that the competitions had to be postponed several times and the program was delayed. On this basis, the UCI changed the regulations stating that from then on the track cycling world championships had to be organized on an indoor cycling track.\nThe concept of the semi-covered cycling track was mainly tailored to training. The cycling track itself, the oval on which the race took place, was considered one of the best in Europe, even in the world. However, the ancillary accommodations were minimal, such that extra stands had to be added for important championships.\nIn 2005, the Blaarmeersen slope was covered after a cooperation agreement between, among others, the Flemish Government, the Royal Belgian Cycling League, Bloso, and the City of Ghent. The \"Flemish Cycling Center Eddy Merckx\" was officially opened on February 17, 2006. The permanently covered track of 250 meters bears the name of multiple world champion Eddy Merckx.\nThe first important championships that took place were the Men's and woman's omnium races of the 2009 European Track Championships.\nIn 2019, it hosted the UEC European Track Championships (under-23 & junior).\nOther sports\nOn June 25, 2009, a BMX track was opened, a track that meets UCI standards. The course is 375 meters long, has 4 dolomite strips, 3 bends and a starting hill with fully automatic starting gates.\nOther sports are also be practiced on the center square of the track. There are courts for handball, korfball, volleyball, badminton and cycle ball.\nSee also\nList of cycling tracks and velodromes\n",
    "Football club\nSV Merseburg 99 is a sports club from Merseburg in Saxony-Anhalt. The club has existed since August 23, 1899. The club colors are green and white. The club's home base is the Merseburg City Stadium.\nClub history\nSV Merseburg was founded on August 23, 1899, by a total of 14 founding members, making it the oldest ball game club in Merseburg. As early as 1900, the club changed its name to Spielverein Hohenzollern. From 1901 onwards they played under the name Ballspielverein Hohenzollern. In 1921 there was the last renaming as SV Merseburg 1899. After the Second World War, the club was dissolved and replaced by the Merseburg Nord sports community. This was taken over in 1948 by the Buna-Werke company sports association (BSG) Chemie Buna Schkopau. Shortly before reunification, the BSG became SV Buna Schkopau on August 1, 1990, whose successor club was founded on February 7, 1991, under the name SV Merseburg 99. On July 1, 2019, the club merged with VfB IMO Merseburg. SV 99 was supposed to dissolve and the members joined VfB IMO, which renamed itself 1. FC Merseburg. \u00a0After the application for dissolution was made and most of the members of SV 99 joined the new club, some old members of SV 99 decided in 2020 to continue the club, whose dissolution had not yet been completed.\nAthletic career\nIn 1923, the Merseburgers were promoted to the Saalegau League after several unsuccessful attempts, and from 1933 the club played in the Gauliga Mitte. In 1935 the club was relegated from the Gauliga, but managed to gain immediate promotion a year later. The best placement dates back to 1938, where the Merseburgers achieved third place. In 1940, SV Merseburg was finally relegated from the Gauliga.\nAfter the Second World War, BSG Chemie Buna celebrated its first success in 1951. The Merseburgers surprisingly won the  Chemnitz Cup against BSG Chemie Leipzig. In 1952, the BSG was one of the founding communities of the newly created third-class Halle district league. After winning the district championship in 1964, Schkopau failed in the elimination round for the GDR League , but was able to achieve promotion a year later. From 1974 to 1981 the chemists played continuously in the second league. In the 1970s, the Schkopauers reached the round of 16 once (0\u20131 against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt ) and the quarter-finals twice (3\u20134, 0\u20134 against FC Rot-Wei\u00df Erfurt ) in the GDR Football Cup. In 1981, Schkopau celebrated the greatest success in football history with promotion to the GDR Oberliga. However, this league turned out to be too big. While the Schkopauers were able to win 3\u20131 against Energie Cottbus on the second matchday, there was a 1:10 debacle against Dynamo Dresden a week later. In their only league season, the Merseburgers managed a total of eleven points. The following regular team played in the league under coach Olaf Keller\u00a0:\nFrom 1982 to 1990, BSG Chemie Buna Schkopau played consistently in the second division again after being relegated from the Oberliga. In the summer of unity, the team was withdrawn from the second division for financial reasons. The club, which was renamed SV Merseburg 99 during the course of the season, competed in the premiere season of 1990/1991 in the Saxony-Anhalt State League, which was then third-class in the East German league system, and qualified as its first champions for the NOFV Amateur Oberliga, which was third-class in the whole of Germany from the 1991/92 season Football. After relegation in the summer of 1992, the following year they were promoted again to the amateur league for the 1993/94 season. Due to the introduction of the Regionalliga as a new 3rd division, the penultimate place was enough for the Merseburgers to remain in the now fourth-tier NOFV Oberliga for 1994/95. After relegation in 1995/96, Merseburg continued to prove to be an elevator team. After several relegations and promotions, the club established itself in the seventh-tier national league in 2012. In the 2014/15 season, the Merseburgers came second in the South Regional League. Since several teams had withdrawn from the Saxony-Anhalt association league, second place was enough for promotion to the now sixth-class association league. In its first season, 2015/16, SV Merseburg won the championship straight away and was promoted to the fifth-class Oberliga Nordost, from which the club was relegated after two seasons. The club played in the Landesliga S\u00fcd until the 2018/19 season.\nCareer from 2002 to 2019\nWell-known former players\nJ\u00f6rg Emmerich (* 1974) - The long-time team captain of the second division club FC Erzgebirge Aue played in Merseburg until 1996\nRainer Lisiewicz (* 1949) \u2013 First coach of the newly founded 1.

    "Spanish military man and sports leader\nJuli\u00e1n Troncoso Sagredo (12 November 1895 \u2013 9 March 1938) was a Spanish military man and sports leader who served as the first president of the Francoist Spanish Football Federation between 1937 and 1939, playing a crucial role in having it recognized by FIFA, to the detriment of the republican one, and managed to structure all football in the so-called Franco zone, with a profusion of tournaments that culminated with the 1939 Copa del General\u00edsimo. Troncoso also served as the 9th president of the Spanish Football Federation between 1939 and 1940.\nIn his military life, he participated in the Battle of Annual in 1921 and was a prisoner of war.\nEarly life and education\nJuli\u00e1n Troncoso was born in Valladolid on 12 November 1895 into a family with strong military roots that managed to form a lineage by joining the Army along with three of his brothers.\nIn 1912, the 17-year-old Troncoso entered the Cavalry Academy of Valladolid\u00a0 where he studied until 1917, the year in which he obtained the position of lieutenant. He graduated in Physical Education from the Army Gymnastics School\u00a0, the only Spanish center for the specific training of Physical Education teachers.\nMilitary career\nIn 1920, after staying in various garrisons on the Iberian Peninsula, Troncoso was transferred to Morocco where he was part of the Alc\u00e1ntara Cavalry Regiment No. 14. Integrated there, he took part in the Battle of Annual in July 1921, and as a result, he was captured on 3 August 1921 when the Zeluan position surrendered. Initially presumed dead, it was later learned that he was imprisoned in Axdir, where he remained a prisoner until 27 January 1923, when he was freed along with other imprisoned officers and embarked towards Melilla on the steamship \"Antonio L\u00f3pez\". After being released, he went to Pamplona, where his wife Elena Cadena Iraizoz was from, and where he remained stationed until 1931. \nIn June 1931, Troncoso moved to Zaragoza where he remained until 1936. At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Troncoso joined the uprising in Zaragoza and was injured in the fighting that took place in the Aragonese capital. While convalescing, he moved to Pamplona and from there to the Navarrese town of Garaioa where, possibly, his wife of Navarrese origin had a house, and while he was in that municipality, he went out in search of a group of Republicans who were trying to cross the border and was wounded again, this time in the thigh. On 6 September, he was appointed military commander of Vera del Bidasoa, a municipality in whose quarry numerous executions were carried out. On 10 September, he was appointed military commander of Hondarribia, which had been occupied on 4 September, and on 12 September, he took over as military commander of Irun and Hondarribia. On 23 December 1936, by order of the National Defense Board, Troncoso was named \"Head of the Border Services of Northern Spain with jurisdiction in the provinces of Navarra and\nGipuzkoa, being in charge of surveillance with troops from all the Pyrenees to Huesca; from the coasts to the war front and from the customs and smuggling repression services\".\nIn 1937, Troncoso was appointed commander of Bidasoa (Borders in Irun), from where he organized, and even personally directed, a network of \"commandos\" dedicated to the assault and kidnapping of ships related to the republic, who clandestinely delivered goods from French ports. His successes were continued, mainly because he pretended that he was an independent entity that sold his catches to the highest bidder, but this was always the Franco Government. Hence Troncoso became known in the French media as \"The Pirate of Bidasoa\". After his appointment, the \"Command\" led by Troncoso was provided with a press office, a code cabinet, and a cartography cabinet, while its agents were stationed in Hendaye, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Bayonne, and La Rochelle. Soon the Command decided to take action against Republican espionage and specifically against the \"Quintanilla Network\". The actions of the Troncoso group ended on 18 September 1937, when the failure to hijack the Republican submarine C-2 in Brest resulted in the arrest of Troncoso and cost him a stint in prison in France. On 22 March 1938, a court in Brest sentenced Troncoso and other members of the command to six months in prison, but fortunately for him, the accusations could only implicate him in the use of weapons without a license since such a submarine \"did not exist\", so he was released four days later and then expelled from France by Hendaye. With his expulsion from France his career as an undercover agent of Juli\u00e1n Troncoso ended, so when he returned to Spain, he was removed from his position as Military Commander of Bidasoa and transferred to the Catalan front. The republican press declared him dead in March 1938, however the news turned out to be false.\nHe retired with the rank of colonel, achieved in 1952, becoming in 1959 in the reserve a",
    "Portuguese professional wrestler\nCarlos Rocha  was a Portuguese professional wrestler  known for being part of the WWWF and for having a career in international wrestling, especially in Canada and the United States.\nProfessional wrestling career\nPortugal and Europe (1940-1960s)\nPortuguese Wrestling is often associated with the name of Tarzan Taborda, especially due to his influence on this modality and having worked almost his entire career in Europe and having close contact with Portugal. However, there is a figure who is little known, little talked about in the world of Portuguese Wrestling, and that figure is called Carlos Rocha.\nCarlos Rocha is a very Portuguese name, and one that certainly stands out internationally, and this fact is quite important in this article, as Carlos Rocha is actually the Portuguese Wrestler with the best career ever in the world.\nThe \u201cPortuguese Champion\u201d as he was known in the United States, was born in 1927 and little or nothing is known about him when he grew up, however he began to be referred to by the Wrestling shows that, together with Tarzan Taborda and Z\u00e9 Lu\u00eds, lit up the stages of the Parque Mayer and the Coliseu dos Recreios in the 40s of the 20th century.\nAt that time wrestling was different, says Correio da Manh\u00e3:\n\u201cThey rarely went to the ropes or jumped out. All he needed was a pair of shorts and boots and he was like a fighter.\u201d\nHowever, his national career would remain quite young, as Carlos Rocha invested heavily in an international career. There are records that Carlos Rocha fought for Europe, especially for Spain and France. In the country of \u201cour brothers\u201d, Rocha was promoted in team fights with a supposed brother called Jack and in France there is a record of Rocha losing to Arabet Said in 1950. His career would change when he traveled to South Africa, in order to have some shows on the African continent and was accompanied at this time by Tarzan Taborda, however the future held something better for Rocha.\nNorth America (1960s-1970s)\nThere are records that in the 60s, Carlos Rocha was already installed on the American Continent, more specifically in the country of opportunities, the United States of America, where he began by competing in some shows in California, little is known about this time, but a new stage in Rocha's life was beginning. The most notable fight recorded in the 1960s was with Peter Maivia in England, as Carlos Rocha was traveling all over the world, including South America.\nInternational Wrestling \u2013 Montreal (1971-1972)\nRocha soon after moving to the cold country of the American Continent, began working under the orders of the International Wrestling promotion in Montreal, where he created a small rivalry with a current WWE Hall of Famer, Abdullah The Butcher. This rivalry generated a special event in the Portuguese's career, as on December 27, 1971, Rocha defeated Abdullah to become World/International Heavyweight Champion (Montreal-Version). Shortly after, Rocha left IW and worked all over Canada, passing through Vancouver and Stampede Wrestling, where by this time he had already become a well-known name in wrestling in Canada, being an acquaintance of the Hart family, more precisely the Stampede promoter Stu Hart.\nMaple Leaf Wrestling \u2013 Toronto (1972-1977)\nAnother important point in Carlos Rocha's career was the promotion of Maple Leaf Wrestling, where we managed for the first time to extract a great deal of information about Rocha's character. Carlos Rocha was a technical and truly old-school wrestler, he was always accompanied by a blue jacket, he had an armband with the symbol of Portugal on his right arm and he entered to the sound of the national anthem on his way to the ring and was promoted as the \u201cPortuguese Champion\u201d, however it wasn't really a title, just something to add to his gimmick and to attract the Portuguese fans who at the time were based in Canada and believe it or not, Carlos Rocha was a valuable asset in the company.\nHe debuted in the company with a victory over Don Serrano in 1971. Several matches were made during his stay in MPLW, but the ones that caught the most attention were the 3 consecutive matches against the WWE Hall Of Famer, The Sheik. These fights broke spectator records, always reaching more than 14,000 people and in their third fight, they reached 18,700 people in the audience and Carlos Rocha, babyface, received huge ovations. The time in Canada and in the promotion passed quite quickly, as Carlos Rocha was now a well-known fighter and was in contact with wrestlers who would later become Hall of Famers. All this attention in Canada also drew attention to the American company World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) owned by Vince McMahon Sr. and then in 1977, Carlos Rocha became the first Portuguese to compete in the biggest wrestling company in the world.\nWorld Wide Wrestling Federation (1976-1977)\nThe dream began now, Carlos Rocha was in the WWWF (now WWE) and could continue with his \u201cPortuguese",

    "American politician (born 1985)\nEzekiel Berzoff-Cohen (born September 19, 1984) is an American politician who has served as a member of the Baltimore City Council representing District 1 since 2016. Cohen is the Democratic nominee for president of the Baltimore City Council after defeating incumbent city council president Nick Mosby in the Democratic primary election on May 14, 2024.\nEarly life and education\nCohen was born in Northampton, Massachusetts on September 19, 1984, to father Lewis Cohen, a psychiatrist, and mother Joan Berzoff, a professor at Smith College. He moved from Massachusetts to Baltimore to attend Goucher College, where he served as the president of the student government association and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 2008. Cohen later attended Johns Hopkins University, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in public policy.\nCohen taught middle school social studies with Teach for America at George G. Kelson Elementary School and Curtis Bay Elementary School until 2011, when he founded his own nonprofit, The Intersection, which ran after-school programs for city youth. In August 2022, Cohen was hired as a consultant for Open Society Foundations.\nBaltimore City Council\nTenure\nIn March 2015, Cohen announced that he would run for the Baltimore City Council in District 1, seeking to succeed retiring city councilor James Kraft. During the Democratic primary, he ran on a platform ran on a platform including providing universal prekindergarten, improving police-community relationships, making Baltimore more pedestrian-friendly, expanding the city's summer jobs program, and reducing fees on small businesses. Cohen won the six-way Democratic primary election with 27.3 percent of the vote on April 26, 2016, and defeated Republican nominee Matthew McDaniel in the general election on November 8. He was sworn into the Baltimore City Council on December 8, 2016, where he was a member of the Education, Workforce, and Youth Committee during his entire tenure, including as its chair from 2016 to 2020, and on the Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and Public Safety Committee from 2016 to 2020. During his tenure, Cohen gained a reputation as a progressive and ally to Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott.\nCohen ran for re-election in 2020. He defeated challenger Paris Bienert in the Democratic primary and ran unopposed in the general election. During the election, Cohen asked his supporters to donate to Baltimore City Public Schools funds to support families amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn January 2023, Cohen expressed interest in running for president of the Baltimore City Council, challenging incumbent president Nick Mosby. He officially entered the race on March 19, 2023. During the Democratic primary, Cohen criticized Mosby for his fights with Scott. He also received endorsements from State's Attorney Ivan Bates, Comptroller Bill Henry, and various local labor unions. He also lead his competitors, Mosby and former city councilmember Shannon Sneed, in fundraising. Cohen defeated Mosby in the Democratic primary election on May 14, 2024, and will face Republican challenger Emmanuel Digman in the general election. If Cohen wins, he will be the first Jewish president of the Baltimore City Council since Walter Orlinsky.\nCrime and policing\nDuring his 2016 city council campaign, Cohen criticized Mayor Martin O'Malley's CitiStat and zero-tolerance crime policies as \"failures\". He supports giving the city of Baltimore control over its police department. He also called for several community-focused police reforms, including a shift away from the police department's war on drugs mentality and toward prioritizing public safety over making arrests.\nIn July 2019, Cohen introduced a bill requiring agencies that interact with children and families to train employees on how to respond to trauma. The bill, which was later renamed after the late U.S. representative Elijah Cummings, passed, and was signed into law by Mayor Jack Young in February 2020. The law made Baltimore the first American city to have legislated trauma-informed care into law.\nCohen called for cuts to city police funding following the murder of George Floyd in June 2020, and called for criminal justice reforms after Derek Chauvin was sentenced in April 2021. He supported Maryland Police Accountability Act of 2021, which repealed the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, limited the use of no-knock warrants, and required police body cameras.\nIn July 2022, after 48-year-old Timothy Reynolds was fatally shot in a confrontation with squeegee workers, Cohen sent an open letter to the deputy mayor calling on the city to put an end to squeegee work by increasing enforcement, support systems, and job opportunities for youth. He also suggested using universal basic income to give squeegee workers direct payments to encourage them to stop washing car windows at intersections.\nDuring his 2024 city council president campaign, Cohen s",
    "\nNoreen Goldman is an American social scientist who is the Hughes-Rogers Professor of Demography and Public Affairs at Princeton University. She studies social and economic factors and how they impact adult health. She was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2024.\nEarly life and education\nGoldman studied mathematics at New York University. She moved to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for her doctoral research, where she studied the demography of kin.\nResearch and career\nGoldman has spent her entire career at Princeton University, where she was made an Endowed Professor in 2007. Her research combines demographic and epidemiological investigations into the impact of social and economic factors on adult health. Her early work considered the impact of marital status on health and mortality, revealing that widowed men had poorer life expectancies than widowed women.  Goldman analyzed the quality of data from the World Fertility Survey, which provided her with useful experience in survey design. She designed and led large-scale population surveys that investigate the causes of illness for women and children in rural communities. She created an event history calendar to understand the timelines of maternal and child health in Guatemala, and investigated the social effects of health in Taiwan. She worked with cardiologists and molecular biologists to understand the cardiac health of children born in the 1990s, revealing that Black and Hispanic patients had considerably lower Life's Essential 8 scores than their white counterparts.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Goldman studied the changing life expectancies of different groups in the United States. She found that life expectancy of Hispanic Native Americans decreased by four years from 2019. She demonstrated that the life expectancy of African American and Latino populations reduced by 3 \u2013 4 times that of white people, and that the pandemic would reverse ten years of progress made toward closing gaps in life expectancy. She went on to show that Filipino men had the largest decline in life expectancy of all Asian American groups.\nAwards and honors\n2024 Elected Member of the National Academy of Sciences\n2024 Honoured member of the Population Association of America\nSelected publications\nY R Hu; N Goldman (1 May 1990). \"Mortality differentials by marital status: an international comparison\".

In winning the Queens County Handicap, Best Turn injured a foot, leading to his retirement from racing.\nStud career\nBest Turn retired to stand stud at Calumet Farm, where he enjoyed considerable success as a sire, peaking at ninth on the American sire list in 1979. He sired 346 foals, including 35 black-type winners (10.1%). His AEI was 2.81. As a broodmare sire, he sired 136 dams of 890 foals, including 33 black-type winners (3.7%), with an AEI of 1.28.\nBest Turn also was a successful sport horse sire.\nBest Turn died in February, 1984. He was euthanized due to complications from foot surgery.

    "River in Bulgaria\nThe Mladezhka reka (Bulgarian: \u041c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0430) is a 40\u00a0km long river in southeastern Bulgaria, a left tributary of the Veleka, which flows into the Black Sea.\nThe river takes its source at an altitude of 486\u00a0m some 800\u00a0m southeast of the summit of Batak Cheshma (509\u00a0m) on the Bulgaria\u2013Turkey border. Along its whole course it flows in a deep densely forested valley, initially in direction northeast until the village of Mladezhko and then in direction southeast until its mouth. The Mladezhka reka flows into the Veleka at an altitude of 96 m about 2 m east of the historic locality of Petrova Niva.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 232\u00a0km2, or 23.3% of the Veleka's total. The river has typically Mediterranean characteristics with high water in February and low water in August. The average flow at the crossing of the first class I-9 road is 1.01\u00a0m3/s.\nThe Mladezhka reka flows entirely in Burgas Province. There one settlement along its course, the village of Mladezhko in Malko Tarnovo Municipality. Its waters are among the cleanest in Bulgaria and are not diverted for economic purposes. Its whole valley is part of the Strandzha Nature Park and its lower course is located in the Paroria protected area, which sheltered an important monastic community in the 14th century during the Second Bulgarian Empire. The historic locality of Petrova Niva at the mouth of the Mladezhka reka was the starting point of the 1903 Bulgarian Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in the Strandzha region.\nGallery\nCitations\n^ a b c d e Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria 1980, p.\u00a0144\n^ Speake, Graham (2018).

    "Stadium in Peru\nLuis G\u00e1lvez Chipoco Stadium (Spanish: Estadio Luis G\u00e1lvez Chipoco) is a multi-purpose stadium in Barranco, Lima, Peru. It is also known as Parque Confraternidad, the name of the public park located there prior to its construction that partially served as the location of Barranco Zoo (Spanish: Zool\u00f3gico de Barranco), the district's zoo from 1947 until its closure in 1970, when its animals were moved to the Parque de las Leyendas in San Miguel.\nHistory\nAerial photograph of the park and the zoo in 1943 by SANDIVRA.\nPark\nThe area where the stadium is currently located, located at the entrance of the district, near its limit with Miraflores, was originally a public park known as Parque Confraternidad, inaugurated in 1943 and featuring a lake. Under mayor Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who took office in 1956, the grounds for the stadium were used in festivities. From 1958 to 1966, a building at the park hosted the district's municipal library until it moved to its current premises in the district's main square.\nZoo\nThe park's lake was located adjacent to Barranco Zoo (Spanish: Zool\u00f3gico de Barranco), created in 1947 with the arrival of the animals previously part of the zoo located at the Parque de la Exposici\u00f3n, eventually developing into a full-fledged zoo with over 600 specimens in 1956.\nAt least two elephants were purchased from a circus by the district's municipality to form part of the zoo's collection: in 1959, it acquired six-year-old Mary Jumbo from the \"Tropicana\" circus at the Plaza Dos de Mayo\u2014who refused to board a truck and walked from the historic centre of Lima towards the zoo\u2014and in 1962 another elephant walked the same path, alongside a camel, and two lions, a puma and a siberian bear known as \"Chaplin\" who rode a bicycle as part of its performances. Additionally, a lioness known as \"La Reina\" arrived from Costa Rica in 1959, and two polar bears known as Karl and Hilda arrived from California on April 27, 1964.\nOther animals featured at the park included condors, hippos and sea lions in the lake, as well as jaguars and pumas. The aforementioned six-ton Mary Jumbo became well known for her calmness when being photographed alongside young visitors, as did a giant turtle originally from the exhibit at the Parque Neptuno. The zoo's collection often received donations from a number of different countries as a symbol of their friendship with Peru.\nBy the time it closed on May 15, 1970, its number of unique specimens had been reduced to around 250, with all of them moving to the Parque de las Leyendas, inaugurated in 1964.\nStadium\nLuis G\u00e1lvez Chipoco (1877\u20131960)\nBoth the park and the zoo were replaced by a neoclassical stadium named after athlete and former CONSUDATLE President Dr. Luis G\u00e1lvez Chipoco (Arica; September 6, 1877 \u2014 Barranco; March 27, 1960), which was inaugurated on October 12, 1986, by then mayor Jorge del Castillo. It features a full-sized soccer field, an athletic track and a swimming pool. The park's remaining area has since become the Family Park (Spanish: Parque de la Familia), and it features an artificial lake populated by geese whose conditions have been criticised on numerous occasions.\nIn 2009, a modernised athletic track was inaugurated as part of Peru's bid to host the 2015 Pan American Games due to a design error at the renovated National Stadium.\nSee also\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Lima\n",
    "\nThe Mid-Mesozoic Parasitoid Revolution (MMPR) was an evolutionary radiation of insect parasites and parasitoids from the Toarcian to the Albian.\nTimeline\nThe MMPR represented a major reorganisation of terrestrial food webs. Before the MMPR, parasitoid insects were absent in many fossil assemblages, such as the Triassic-aged Madygen, Molteno, Beishan, Shangtu, and Cow Branch Formations. The MMPR was marked by an increase in diversity among coleopterans, dipterans, strepsipterans, and hymenopterans, the main insect clades containing parasitoids, that reflected these clades entering parasitoid niches.\nThe beginning phase of the MMPR lasted from the late Early Toarcian to the Valanginian. It is documented in the Jiulongshan and Karabastau Formations from the Middle and Late Jurassic, respectively. In the Jiulongshan's Yanliao Biota, the neuropteran parasitoid lineage Mantispidae, the dipteran parasitoid lineages Nemestrinidae and Eremochaetidae, and the coleopteran parasitoid families Ripiphoridae and Staphylinidae are represented, though the staphylinid subfamilies known to contain parasitoid species are absent. Most notably, the Yanliao Biota contains the plant-associated sawfly clades Xyeloidea, Tenthredinoidea, Pamphilioidea, Cephoidea, Siricoidea, and Orussoidea, the latter being the only parasitoid sawfly lineage, and the apocritan parasitoid clades Evanioidea, Ephialtitoidea, and Proctotrupoidea, which belong to the hymenopteran order. In the Karabastau Formation, a similar family-level diversity of parasitoid hymenopterans is represented but with double the species diversity. Nemestrinids, acrocerids, and eremochaetids represent dipteran parasitoids from the Karabastau and mantispids represent neuropteran ones, with anthribids and staphylinids being represented among coleopteran parasitoids. The assemblage found in the Berriasian Lulworth Formation has also been studied and cited as evidence of the MMPR, as it contains twenty species of parasitoid apocritans, including megalyroids, evanioids, proctotrupoids, ichneumonoids, chrysidoids, and the enigmatic Apocrites.\nPhase 2 of the MMPR, lasting from the Late Valanginian to the Albian, involved even further parasitoid diversification. In the Barremian Yixian Formation, the number of hymenopteran parasitoid lineages jumped to thirteen from the eight to nine found in the previous lagerstatten. Amongst evanioids, there were evaniids, praeaulacids, aulacids, and baissids. Ephialtitoids were represented by ephialtitids; Amongst procrotrupoids, the mesoserphids, helorids, pelecinids, roproniids, and serphids were represented. Ichneumonoids, chrysidoids, and vespoids were represented in the Yixian by ichneumonids, bethylonymids, and scoliids, respectively. Dipteran species diversity was the same as in the Jurassic lagerstatten and contained among the eremochaetids and nemestrinids. Thirty-seven parasitoid coleopterans were found, mainly among staphylinids but also among carabids, while nine species of mantispid neuropterans were found.\n",

    "2023 fantasy novel by Brandon Sanderson\nThe Sunlit Man is a 2023 fantasy novel by Brandon Sanderson, set in his Cosmere universe. The novel was the fourth of Sanderson's \"secret projects\", a result of his record-breaking 2022 Kickstarter campaign.\nPlot\nA man called Nomad is being pursued by the Night Brigade. (Nomad's true name is Sigzil; he is a minor character from The Stormlight Archive.) Nomad and his spren companion Auxiliary arrive on the planet Canticle. Canticle is a very small, inhospitable planet. The heat of the sun kills anyone who is exposed to daylight; the planet's inhabitants live on floating cities, always fleeing from the dawn.\nNomad is immediately captured by the Cinder King, a local warlord. The Cinder King controls his subjects with objects called cinderhearts, which burn away their personalities and turn them into creatures called Charred. Nomad escapes the Cinder King with a woman named Rebeke and her sister Elegy, who has been turned into a Charred.\nNomad reaches the floating city of Beacon. He befriends the citizens there as they flee from the Cinder King. On Canticle, the ships are powered by energy from deceased citizens who are left to burn in the sunlight; their souls interact with the sun to produce power sources for the Beaconites\u2019 cities. The Beaconites believe in a mythical refuge that will be safe from the sunlight. Nomad promises to bring them there, but in reality this shelter is a small research station from Scadrial, which cannot support the population of Beacon.\nThe Scadrians offer to hire Nomad as a mercenary, but he decides to stay with the Beaconites. They name him Zellion. Eventually, he teaches Elegy to regain part of her humanity. He and Rebeke discover a way to power their cities more efficiently, preventing the need for more sacrifices. Zellion kills the Cinder King and leaves Canticle behind.\nPublication\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sanderson wrote four secret novels. In 2022, he announced a campaign on Kickstarter to fund the self-publishing of these novels. This campaign became the must successful Kickstarter campaign of all time. The Sunlit Man became the fourth novel released as a part of this campaign. The four novels were initially distributed as special hardcover editions to Kickstarter backers. Later, the novels were acquired and hardcover editions were published by Tor Books. The Tor Books editions were released three months after each special edition was released.\nReception\nLyndsey Luther of Reactor compared the novel to an entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Luther believes that the book would likely not be a good starting point for a reader new to the Cosmere universe, stating \"If you like to have every question answered, every loose end tied up, every character nuance explained\u2026 this will not be the book for you. If you\u2019re okay with just going along for the ride and don\u2019t think too much about the little details, you\u2019ll have a much better time, but you\u2019d likely have an even better time if you\u2019ve read some of the other books in Sanderson\u2019s \u201cextended universe\u201d before jumping in here.\" Luther enjoyed the novel, comparing Nomad to the protagonist from Mad Max: Fury Road if one were to \"make  a visitor from another planet who doesn\u2019t speak the language, give him an actual personality,  make him likable from the get-go\".\nCharles Papadopoulos of ScreenRant wrote that \"as a standalone story, Yumi and the Nightmare Painter is perhaps the best work to come from Sanderson's Secret Projects. However, The Sunlit Man ... could be the most exciting experience specifically for Cosmere fans.\" Papadopoulos praised the way in which Sanderson adds science fiction elements to the fantasy universe of the Cosmere, as well as the connections with Sanderson's other novel The Lost Metal.\n",
    "1972\u20131973 purge of Ukrainian intelligentsia and society by the Communist Party\nFrom 12 January 1972 to 1973, a wide-reaching purge of Ukrainian society and intelligentsia was organised by Leonid Brezhnev and the KGB. Codenamed Operation Bloc (Russian: \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u00ab\u0411\u043b\u043e\u043a\u00bb, romanized:\u00a0Operatsiya \u00abBlok\u00bb; Ukrainian: \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f \u00ab\u0411\u043b\u043e\u043a\u00bb, romanized:\u00a0Operatsiia \u00abBlok\u00bb), the purge resulted in the arrest of 193 people, including most of the leaders of the Ukrainian dissident movement, as well as the removal of Petro Shelest and the installation of Volodymyr Shcherbytsky as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine.\nBackground\nThe 1965\u20131966 Ukrainian purge, aimed against the counter-culture Sixtiers, largely failed in its intention of bringing the Ukrainian dissident movement to submission. Instead, it resulted in the further politicisation of Ukrainian dissidents from their previous position of supporting greater self-expression into a movement for greater Ukrainian autonomy under the Soviet Union. Some of those arrested, such as Viacheslav Chornovil, had emerged as leading figures of the strengthened dissident movement since the purge.\nPalace intrigues additionally drove the purge; Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev's Dnipropetrovsk Mafia, a group of politicians from Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, was opposed to the Kharkiv Clan of Petro Shelest, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine (as well as the smaller Donetsk Clan). Shelest's greater tolerance for Ukrainian national expression proved intolerable to Brezhnev, and moves began being made to dampen his authority. In 1970 Vitaly Fedorchuk left the central KGB apparatus to become its director in Ukraine.\nDobosh affair\nPrior to the execution of Operation Bloc, Belgian foreign student Yaroslav Dobosh, a member of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists in exile, was dispatched at the recommendation of Omelian Koval\u00a0 and the blessing of cardinal Josyf Slipyj to the Soviet Union on a mission to acquire samvydav. This material was intended to later be released for open publication outside of the Eastern Bloc.\nDovbosh first travelled to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, where he met dissidents Zynoviia Franko, Ivan Svitlychnyi, and Leonid Selezenko, who gave him a roll of camera film containing photographs of Sviatoslav Karavanskyi's Dictionary of Rhymes in the Ukrainian Language and a copy of The Ukrainian Herald.\nOn 2 January 1972 Dobosh left Kyiv for the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. There, he met Stefania Hulyk-Hnatenko on the street and held a conversation with her. At this time, Dobosh was under constant surveillance by the KGB. His hotel room was bugged, and he was photographed several times during his time in the city. Two days later, he began travelling south, intending to cross over the border in Zakarpattia Oblast. The KGB, fearful that he would bring samvydav or military secrets over to the west, determined that it was necessary to intercept him.\nFollowing a stop at the Chop border station that occurred smoothly, the train was again stopped after a kilometre, and Dobosh was taken by four individuals (two civilian and two military). Under the pretext that his visa had been incorrectly stamped, he was taken into detention. During his detention, eight rolls of film including Karavanskyi's Dictionary of Rhymes in the Ukrainian Language and photos of dissidents Vasyl Stus and Valentyn Moroz were found, in addition to books that KGB officers incorrectly believed to be samvydav (including a tourist brochure of Saint Andrew's Church in Kyiv). Under interrogation, Dobosh admitted his membership in the OUN and the Ukrainian Youth Association, as well as the fact that Koval had sent him to the Soviet Union. This provided the basis to execute Operation Bloc.\nPurge\nOn the eve of the purge, leading Ukrainian dissidents gathered in the Lviv flat of Olena Antoniv\u00a0 to hold a Vertep (nativity play) ceremony for the holiday of Koliada. The celebration quickly grew into a protest against Soviet state atheism. Those present were all arrested within the next three days; Vasyl Stus in Kyiv and Iryna Kalynets and Stefania Shabatura\u00a0 in Lviv. The arrests of Viacheslav Chornovil, Mykhaylo Osadchy, and Ivan Gel soon followed.\nSimultaneously with those in Lviv, Koliada celebrations also took place in Kyiv. These had been discovered in advance by the KGB, which, fearing that the celebrations could grow to encompass several parts of the city, arrested the organisers between 12 and 14 January: Ivan Svitlychnyi, Yevhen Sverstiuk, Leonid Plyushch, Mykola Plahotniuk\u00a0, Zinovii Antoniuk\u00a0, Oleksandr Serhiienko\u00a0, and Ivan Kovalenko\u00a0. On 13 January Shelest formally gave the order to begin Operation Bloc.\nAfter three days, over 20 of Ukraine's leading dissidents had been arrested in the cities of Kyiv, Lviv, and Odesa. They would all eventually be sentenced to seven years of hard labour and between three and five years of exile. Dobosh was deported from the Soviet Union to Belgium, where he re",
    "Municipal building in Keynsham, Somerset, England\nKeynsham Civic Centre is a municipal building in Keynsham, a town in Somerset, in England. The complex includes a library and community centre building known as Keynsham Town Hall.  \nHistory\nThe old 1960s structures in 2007\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with the chocolate manufacturing industry, an urban district council was formed in Keynsham in 1938. The new council initially met in the Church Rooms at the Church of St John the Baptist, although they moved to the old library (formerly the Liberal Club) on Bath Street West after the Second World War.\nIn the early 1960s, with the increasing responsibilities of local authorities, the council decided to commission dedicated offices. The site that they selected was a large area on the east side of Temple Street. The area was occupied by some old terraced houses, which were cleared away, and a time capsule, containing documents and memorabilia, was buried. The new complex, which involved a town hall, council offices, a library, and a clock tower, was designed in the brutalist style, built in concrete and was completed in the mid-1960s. It continued to serve as the offices of Keynsham Urban District Council for the next decade, and was used as the meeting place of Wansdyke District Council when it was formed in 1974. However it ceased to be the local seat of government when the new unitary authority, Bath and North East Somerset Council, was formed in Bath in 1996. However, the unitary authority continued to use the complex at Keynsham for the provision of local services.\nIn 2012, Bath and North East Somerset Council decided to demolish the 1960s structures, and replace them with a new civic centre, including a library and community centre, and a larger retail and office building. The site for the new complex was about 100 yards (91\u00a0m) further north along Temple Street. During demolition works on the old structures the old time capsule was found and reburied with more up to date artifacts. The new buildings were designed by AHR in the modern style, built by Willmott Dixon and were completed in 2015. They won a British Council for Offices Award for their design.\nIn 2021, the offices were refurbished at a cost of \u00a31.6 million, to allow council employees from outlying buildings to relocate to them.\nArchitecture\nThe buildings are constructed of reinforced concrete and cross-laminated timber.  The library and community centre building is known as Keynsham Town Hall and is a two-storey building, while the larger retail and office building has a single-storey plinth, with three interlinked three-storey office blocks above.  The design of the library and community centre building involves an asymmetrical main frontage facing onto  Temple Street. It features, on the first floor at the north end, a rectangular gold-coloured box, manufactured from cross-laminated timber, which is jettied out over the pavement. Meanwhile, the larger building features a pitched roof broken by a system of clerestory windows to assist ventilation. The buildings were designed to be highly energy efficient, making use of natural ventilation, thermal mass and daylight.  Within the town hall are mosaics from the Keynsham Roman Villa.\n",

Since 1999, he has held the position of Professor at IPPT-PAN, where he leads the Division of Safety Engineering (Smart-Tech Centre) and the Department of Intelligent Technologies.\nHolnicki-Szulc has led research projects in space technology and energy production. As project coordinator, he oversaw the EU Project ADLAND (2008\u20132010), and EU Marie Curie Project SMART-NEST (2011\u20132015), focusing on adaptive shock absorbers for aircraft landing gears. Among national projects, he coordinated SMART and SAFE (2008\u20132012), and AIA Polish (2013\u20132016), which developed methods and tools for health monitoring, adaptive design, and vibration control.\nWorks\nHolnicki-Szulc explored the concept of virtual distortions as a computational tool for analyzing structural problems caused by incompatible deformations in his 1991 book, Virtual Distortion Method. In 1995, he co-authored Structural Analysis, Design, and Control by the Virtual Distortion Method with Jacek T. Gierlinski, introducing the Virtual Distortion Method (VDM) and its applications in structural analysis and design, providing theoretical foundations on how VDM facilitates efficient computational methods.\nHolnicki-Szulc, in collaboration with Jos\u00e9 Rodellar, edited Smart Structures, which delved into advancements in fundamental research, intelligent monitoring for structural identification, and damage assessment. He alongside Carlos Mota Soares, compiled invited lectures from the AMAS & ECCOMAS Workshop/Thematic Conference SMART'03 on smart materials and structures in the publication Advances in Smart Technologies in Structural Engineering. Tracy Kijewski-Correa in her review praised the book saying \"this book emphasizes the unique and promising solutions to societal problems.\" In the 2008 book Smart Technologies for Safety Engineering, he presented a decade's worth of research from the Smart-Tech Centre, highlighting interdisciplinary applications like intelligent structures, adaptive materials, and control systems.\nResearch\nHolnicki-Szulc has focused his research on creating adaptive impact absorption, virtual distortion methods, and innovative designs such as motor less landing capsules and adaptive landing gears.\nHolnicki-Szulc developed the Virtual Distortion Method (VDM) in the early eighties, highlighting its effectiveness as a numerical tool for rapid structural reanalysis across various engineering domains. Inspired by the theory of elastic distortions, which models dislocations within an elastic continuum, this method enabled swift reanalysis in structural optimization. The initial applications of his VDM method spanned diverse areas, including modeling elastic-plastic progressive collapse using a linear system formulation and representing physical nonlinearities through virtual distortions. Later, his focus shifted to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) issues with a specific focus on applying the VDM technique to address the inverse problem of damage identification. Additionally, the need for developing \"smart\" techniques for Adaptive Impact Absorption (AIA) emerged from his product-oriented \"Copernicus\" projects. This led him to explore new techniques for impact load identification, both online and offline, essential for AIA applications and addressing black-box engineering problems.\nHolnicki-Szulc and his research group, Smart-Tech, delved in the challenging domain of AIA requiring multidisciplinary skills in mechanics, control, material science, electronics, optics, and informatics. He alongside this group, played a role in organizing the ECCOMAS Thematic Conference on Smart Struct",
    "\nATZ-28 (\"Bolshaya Sazhen\")\nNational Center for Control and Testing of Space Vehicles (NCUVKS, formerly the Yevpatoria Deep Space Communication Center) is an institution subordinate to the State Space Agency of Ukraine that manages space flight operations, deep space research using its own technical means, space monitoring, geophysical monitoring, and testing of space technology.\nHistory\nIn 1960, the center's facilities were established in a coastal plain area of Crimea near the city of Yevpatoria. The technical basis of the center was the space radio complex \"Pluton\", which was equipped with unique antennas that had no world analogues. For the first twenty years of the Soviet space era, interplanetary flight management was carried out exclusively from Yevpatoria.\nOn February 12, 1961, the Deep Space Communication Center began managing the flight of the world's first automatic interplanetary station Venera 1. In 1965, the launches of the Venera 2 and Venera 3 spacecraft took place. Subsequently, a series of space vehicles of the \u201cLuna\u201d, \u201cVenera\u201d, and \u201cMars\u201d series were launched, during which flight dynamics and landing on the planets of the Solar System, studying the atmospheres of planets, and transmitting information were tested. Specialists of the Deep Space Communication Center constantly managed the work of spacecraft, receiving operational and scientific information.\nThe long-term experience in managing automatic interplanetary stations, operating deep space ground stations, achievements in the fields of electronics, informatics, radio engineering, mechanical engineering and other areas of science and production made it possible to create a research complex\u2014the radio astronomical telescope RT-70.\nSince December 1978, the RT-70 of the Deep Space Communication Center in Yevpatoria has been a permanent participant in the implementation of deep space research programs.\nRadio technical complex \"Pluton\"\nOn August 31, 1995, at 10:50\u00a0a.m., the launch of the Cyclone-3 launch vehicle took place, which placed the first Ukrainian national satellite \u201cSich-1\u201d into orbit, designed for the operational acquisition of information to address the tasks of Earth observation from space. The team of the Deep Space Communication Center, during the management of the \"Sich-1\" spacecraft, carried out a number of scientific experiments that allowed many discoveries to be made and new technologies to be developed, providing information to the national economy that is used in the interests of the economy.\nIn 1996, according to the Decree of the President of Ukraine in Yevpatoria, the National Center for Control and Testing of Space Vehicles (NCUVKS) was established on the basis of the Deep Space Communication Center. This center is designed to manage spacecraft within national and international space programs.\nIn 2014, as a result of the annexation of Crimea, all technical means of the Deep Space Communication Center in the village of Vitine (near the city of Yevpatoria) remained on the territory of the temporarily occupied territory of Crimea. That same year, in order to restore operational control over the National Center and its branches, the leadership of the State Space Agency of Ukraine decided to relocate the NCUVKS to the mainland of Ukraine, to the city of Kyiv. Currently, the purpose of the NCUVKS is to comprehensively support the development of Ukraine's space industry, implement the measures of the National Target Scientific and Technical Space Program in cooperation with the State Space Agency of Ukraine in the interests of national security and defense, the economy of the state, and to meet the needs of the population of Ukraine.\nThe NCUVKS comprises four branches: the Center for Receiving and Processing Special Information and Control of the Navigation Field, the Main Special Control Center, the Western Radio Engineering Observation Center, and the Dnipro branch of the NCUVKS \"Dniprocosmos,\" whose capabilities fully meet the tasks assigned to the center.\nIn the future, the resources of the NCUVKS may be used to carry out tasks such as ensuring the provision of satellite communication and data relay services, coordinate-time and navigation support, monitoring and analyzing the space environment on request of government agencies; guaranteed and operational provision of information obtained from remote sensing satellites, and technical support for the creation of modern technologies for its special use, the creation of multifunctional technical means.\nOn December 20, 2023, at 05:00, a missile strike was carried out at the former location of the Deep Space Communication Center near Yevpatoria, resulting in damage to the occupiers' military equipment.\nMission\nThe NCUVKS participates in the implementation of research and development in the field of creating rocket and space technology and special equipment in the interests of national security and defense, the development of the economy of Ukraine, as well as in the execu",

    "2015 novel by Niccol\u00f2 Ammaniti\nAnna is a 2015 post-apocalyptic fictional novel by Niccol\u00f2 Ammaniti.\nIt follows thirteen-year-old Anna in a post-apocalyptic Sicily where a virus has wiped out all adults. She searches for her kidnapped brother Astor, facing peril and discovering her resilience. The novel explores survival and the impact of a world without adults.\nPlot\nIn 2016, a mysterious disease called the \"Red\" spreads worldwide from Belgium, causing sterility and death, marked by red spots on the infected. It is incurable, and most of the population is quickly wiped out. Only children are immune until puberty, leaving them to survive alone in a desolate world. By sixteen, they too die as the disease manifests.\nIn 2020, thirteen-year-old Anna and her younger brother Astor live on a hidden farm in Sicily, devastated by the Red and fires. Anna cares for Astor, using a notebook from their mother for survival tips. She keeps him indoors with stories of monsters outside. One day, she encounters a wild dog, wounds it, but later helps it survive.\nReturning home, Anna finds the farm destroyed and Astor kidnapped by a gang led by Angelica and the Bear, who recruit or kill other children for supplies. Anna sets out to find him, joined by the now-tame dog, named Coccolone, and a boy named Pietro, who believes a pair of Adidas shoes can cure the Red. They reach the gang's hideout, the Grand Hotel Terme Elise, where a supposed healer, Picciridduna, resides.\nAnna finds Astor, but he refuses to leave, accusing her of lying. During a festival, Picciridduna, an unintelligent hermaphrodite, is sacrificed to supposedly cure the children, but it fails. Anna, Pietro, and Astor leave for Cefal\u00f9 with Coccolone. On Anna's birthday, she gets her first period but hides it, fearing the Red's onset.\nWhile traveling to the mainland, Pietro shows symptoms and, after a severe accident, asks Anna to end his suffering. Anna and Astor reach Messina and cross to the mainland, finding it as desolate as Sicily. They discover the Adidas shoes and each wear one, hoping they hold a cure.\nTheme\nNiccol\u00f2 Ammaniti conceived the novel from a purely biological-behavioural perspective, pondering what children would do if left to their own devices. This idea led him to imagine a world where, for some reason, adults had disappeared. The concept raised numerous questions about the children's survival, which became a central theme of the story.\nPublication history\nAmmaniti, Niccol\u00f2 (2015). Anna (in Italian). Turin: Einaudi.

    "Congolese musical artist\nMusical artist\nBakunde Ilondjoko (January 5, 1951 \u2013 September 20, 2011), known as Bakunde Ilo Pablo, was a Congolese drummer, musician and composer best known for being a long-time member of Za\u00efko Langa Langa. His drumming was characterized by his powerful hitting and mastery of the hi-hat.\nEarly career and musical debut\nPaul Bakunde Ilondjoko was born on January 5, 1951, in Kinshasa (then-called L\u00e9opoldville) in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nHe attended primary school at the Sainte-Marie school in the commune of Lingwala. He received his secondary education at the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e de la Gombe (then-called Kalina). Pablo's interest in music blossomed, with a fascination for jazz and pop music during his formative years and through his early exposure to artists like Johnny Hallyday and Claude Fran\u00e7ois. His debut into music composition came in 1965 with his song \"Oiseau De L'Amour,\" inspired by a personal romantic experience. Despite his interest in jazz and pop, he transitioned to Congolese music in 1971, spurred by an invitation to join the orchestra Les Corsaires by his friend Oscar Diabanza. Subsequently, he journeyed through various musical groups, including Chem Chem Yetu and Orchestre Stukas, where he released his first single, \"Mangenge.\"\nProminence\nIn 1974, he joined Za\u00efko Langa Langa to replace Meridjo Belobi, their main drummer, who was imprisoned in Ekafela. They shared the post after his release. He had known them long before, rehearsing with their guitarist Mbuta Matima when he was in the band's pop section. His debut song with the band, \"Ndonge,\" recorded at Johnny Bokelo's recording studio and released in October 1974, emerged as a monumental hit, marking the onset of a flourishing career. Subsequent releases such as \"Ando,\" \"Eboza,\" \"Mangobo,\" \"Feti,\" and \"Matata\" solidified his stature as a distinguished songwriter in the band.\nIn 1978, he was part of the delegation of Za\u00efko Langa Langa musicians on the band's first European tour, at the invitation of the JMPR (Jeunesse du Mouvement Populaire de R\u00e9volution). Pablo shined in 1984 with the release of his first solo album, \"Rencontre,\" featuring Bozi Boziana on lead vocals. This album showcased \"Azo,\" a studio rendition of his initial composition, \"Oiseau De L'Amour.\" In 1985, alongside bandmate Meridjo Belobi, Pablo pioneered the technique of double-drumming in Congolese rumba.\n1988's month of May witnessed a leadership dispute within Za\u00efko Langa Langa led to the formation of Za\u00efko Langa Langa Familia Dei, with Pablo as a prominent member. Their eponymous debut album, released in December 1989, featured the classic hit \"L'Oiseau Rare,\" another rendition of Pablo's debut composition, which garnered international acclaim. At the same time, he became president of UMUZA (Union des musiciens za\u00efrois), succeeding Franco Luambo following his death.\nThroughout the 1990s, Pablo continued releasing solo albums such as \"Songa Fiele\" (1990) and \"Kenya Safari\" (1991). His contributions continued within Za\u00efko Langa Langa Familia Dei, with compositions like the titular track of the album \"Au Revoir Prince\" (1991) and \"Les Riches et Les Pauvres\" (1992) from their third album, \"Bako Bandela.\"\nLater years and death\nIn 1994, Bakunde Ilo Pablo withdrew from the music scene, redirecting his focus towards other endeavors. However, he later started hosting a radio show titled \"Bana L\u00e9o.\"\nHe died on the morning of September 20, 2011 at the age of 60 in Kinshasa, at the Candeur polyclinic in the commune of Limete.\nDiscography\nSolo albums\nRencontre (1984)\nSonga Fiele (1990)\nKenya Safari (1991)\nAs a band member\nZa\u00efko Langa Langa\nPlaisir de l'Ouest Afrique (double album, 1976)\nNkolo Mboka (double album, 1982)\nL'Orchestre de tous les \u00c2ges (1983)\nMuvaro / Etape (1983)\nOn Gagne le Proc\u00e8s (1984)\nTout-Choc Anti-Choc Za\u00efko Langa Langa en Europe (1984)\nOldies And Goodies (compilation album, 1985)\nZa\u00efko Eyi Nkisi (1985)\nTala Mod\u00e8le Echanger (1985)\nEh Ngoss!

    "Indonesian activist\nNjono or Njono Prawiro (Perfected Spelling: Nyono, August 28, 1925 \u2013 October 1968) was a labor activist and member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). Njono was known as the Secretary-General and Chairman of the Central All-Indonesian Workers Organization (SOBSI) and a member of the Politburo of the PKI Central Committee who got involved in the September 30 Movement. Previously, Njono was a member of the Indonesian Labor Party (PBI) and served as its interim chairman.\nEarly life\nNjono was born in Cilacap 28 August 1925. He was the eldest son of Sastrodiredjo, a railway employee. In 1931, Njono studied at the Sekolah Rakjat (People's School) of Taman Siswa (Taman Muda) and completed it in 1938. He then continued to Taman Guru Muda but did not finish. He then worked as a young journalist at the Asia Raya newspaper in Jakarta during the Japanese occupation.\nEarly political career\nIn the early period of independence, Njono served as a member of the Working Body of Central Indonesian National Djakarta Raya (Greater Jakarta) and concurrently as a member of the Central Indonesian National Committee. Njono also led the Tram Workers Union in Kramat before joining the Indonesian Labor Brigade (BBI) and becoming the leader of the Jakarta branch of BBI. Njono was then elected as the interim chairman of the Indonesian Labor Party (PBI) on 26 July 1946, replacing Sjamsu Harja Udaja, who was arrested after the failed July 1946 coup, with Setyadjit Soegondo\u00a0 as the interim deputy. In November 1946, as part of the negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia leading up to the Linggarjati Agreement, various subcommittees were formed on the suggestion of the joint commission for civil affairs. Njono became a member of the labor affairs subcommittee.\nTo address the party's deteriorating condition, Njono held a party conference in Solo on 5 October 1946 to carry out \"self-correction, selection, and centralization\" by changing the party's direction to a more moderate stance in order to attract broader support from various backgrounds of workers. Policy statements asserting that the party adhered to Marxism\u2013Leninism principles and addressing class conflict were removed. Based on the results of the PBI Congress in Malang on 6 April 1947, Njono was elected as vice-chairman, while Setyadjit became the party's chairman.\nSOBSI\nNjono became the Secretary General of SOBSI in November 1946. He served as the head of the SOBSI delegation for the 2nd WFTU Conference in Beijing and departed on 5 January 1950. Njono then became the chairman of SOBSI upon his return from the visit on 19 November.  Furthermore, Njono was also appointed as the Vice President of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) since 1953.\nUnder his leadership, SOBSI became increasingly dominated by the PKI, a process that began in late October 1949 when SOBSI resumed its activities after being halted due to the Madiun Affair. By mid-1951, almost all SOBSI members were subject to the leadership of the PKI. The unions under its umbrella also became increasingly dominated or influenced by the PKI.\nIn September 1960, Njono proposed the establishment of workers' councils in every state-owned enterprise with the status of advisory bodies for \"all matters.\" This proposal emerged as an effort by SOBSI cadres to dominate the economic field and provide communist unions with a counterbalance capable of improving the welfare of their members. Therefore, this proposal was immediately supported by communist-affiliated organizations. The government implemented this proposal, but the cadres from labor and peasant unions only served as advisors without having any control over production management, which was far from what SOBSI had hoped for.\nMember of PKI\nDespite having a close relationship with D.N. Aidit and often being considered to have been a member of the PKI for a long time, Njono officially applied to join the PKI in December 1954. He was elected as a member of the DPR, representing the PKI in 1955. Njono was then inaugurated as a candidate member of the Politburo as a result of the Sixth National Congress of the PKI held on 7\u201314 September 1959 and officially became a member of the Politburo in February 1963. Njono also became the chairman of the PKI's Greater Jakarta Regional Committee (CDB) in September 1964. Hence, he resigned as Chairman of the National Council of SOBSI.\nInvolvement in the G30S\nNjono played a role in dividing Jakarta into six sectors, where civilian volunteers were prepared as reserves to carry out operations in each sector. Most of the volunteers came from the People's Youth and had received military training at Lubang Buaya. However, only the Gambir sector carried out the task of occupying the Telecommunications Building (now Telkom STO Gambir Building).\nAdditionally, he organized a network consisting of various posts, probably located in members' homes or party offices. These posts would be manned by PK",
    "1991 studio album by Mark Murphy\nOne for Junior is a 1991 studio album by Mark Murphy.\nOne for Junior is the 30th studio album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. The album is a collaboration with Sheila Jordan. It was recorded in 1991 when Murphy was 59 years old and released by the Muse label in the United States in 1993. The album is a tribute to Junior Morrow. Murphy contributes the composition \"One for Junior\", co-written with Sheila Jordan.\nBackground\nSheila Jordan and Mark Murphy were longtime friends. After a concert they gave together in Cleveland in 1991 they decided to record an album together for Muse. Murphy and Jordan met at her home in New York to decide on the material they would include. In the title for the album, \"Junior\" is a reference to painter Helen Mayer, a longtime friend of Jordan and Murphy. Mayer called herself Junior Morrow. The album cover is a photograph of one of her original paintings. Mayer died before the album was recorded.\nIn the liner notes both Jordan and Murphy recount stories and memories of Helen Mayer. Both write about encounters at The Page Three nightclub in Greenwich Village owned by Jacquie Howe. Mayer frequented the night club, painted a mural there and Murphy and Jordan often performed at the club. Jordan first heard Murphy sing at Page Three. The three became friends there.\nThe song \"Difficult to Say Goodbye\" was written for Murphy by singer and songwriter Ellen Hoffman. She writes, \"I had written the song for him upon the death of his life-time partner, Eddie. A few years later he recorded it on a duo-album with Sheila Jordan...part of a 2-song medley. Sheila is singing \"Don't Like GoodByes\", (written by composer Harold Arlen) and Mark is singing my song\".\nRecording\nMurphy and Jordan recorded the material for this release in September of 1991 at Sear Sound in New York City. Pianist Kenny Barron, bassist Harvie Swartz, and drummer Ben Riley who had recorded with Jordan on Lost and Found (Muse, 1990) were enlisted for the backup trio. Pianist Bill Mays who had recorded, arranged and produced multiple Murphy albums including Bop for Kerouac, Beauty and the Beast, and Kerouac, Then and Now, joined the group for the two George Gruntz tracks. The Gruntz compositions were from operas he composed; \"Aria 18\" is from Money: A Jazz Opera,  and \"Eastern Ballad\" is from Cosmopolitan Greetings. Gruntz, Murphy and Jordan were supposed to work together on Money but Murphy was not available at the time of production. Murphy did perform, tour and record the opera Cosmopolitan Greetings.\nThere were some problems during the recording. Sheila Jordan thought she sounded shrill on \"One for Junior\". Murphy had problems during the recording of the medley (track 9). He wanted the tempo to be very slow for his part, singing Hoffman's \"Difficult to Say Goodbye\", and insisted they slow down. Murphy was having trouble \"reading the music because of the way it was spread out across his music stand \u2013 again he regretted forgetting his glasses. He had to weave his head to see it better, and the microphone picked up the changes in his position\".\nReception\nScott Yanow assigns 4.5 stars to this release on AllMusic. He said, \"This CD is a real gem...On a typically intelligent and chance taking program there are many highlights including a humorous conversation between hipsters on \"Where or When,\" a couple of ballad medleys and Jordan's witty lyrics on \"The Bird\"\". Yanow includes the release in his list of some of the best individual Muse sets in his book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide.\nColin Larkin assigns 4 stars to the album in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music.

    "Insignia of the Association\nNational Mary Washington Memorial Association (NMWMA) is a hereditary American woman's organization created in Washington, D.C. in 1889, to support in perpetuity the monument to Mary Ball Washington located at Fredericksburg, Virginia. It is the second chartered historical and patriotic society among women in the United States.\nOn February 22, 1890, the Association was chartered in the District of Columbia, for 1000 years. This organization, composed almost wholly of women and limited to 600 hereditary life members, received by gift the land that had been deeded to the Fredericksburg association and, with the active cooperation of the Daughters of the American Revolution, secured the money needed and built there a new monument and lodge, the title to which was vested in the President and the Chief Justice of the United States and the governor of Virginia, ex officio, as trustees.\nDeath of Mary Washington\nMary Ball Washington\nMary Ball Washington died August 25, 1789, at Fredericksburg, Virginia. She was buried on August 28. All over the country, the mourning was general, press and churches made note of the event, and members of congress wore mourning for thirty days. President Washington wrote a note of thanks to congress for the passing of a resolution to build a monument in memory of his mother. But the new government had more pressing duties than the building of monuments. When Lafayette visited the United States in 1825, nothing but a little headstone marked the grave of Mary Washington.\nFirst monument\nFirst monument\nIn 1831, the citizens of Fredericksburg had secured about US$2,000 for the building of a monument over the grave when Silas E. Burrows of New York asked \"to be allowed the honor of individually erecting the monument.\" The generous offer was accepted and \nThe first monument was never completed, its stones crumbled and fell, and around them, for four years, surged the American Civil War. From time to time, attempts were made to complete the monument or to build a new one. Two or three times, bills for that purpose passed the U.S. Senate and failed to pass the United States House of Representatives.\nTwo associations\nIn the spring of 1889, \"the grave of the Mother of Washington,\" at Fredericksburg, Virginia, was advertised in the newspapers: \"For sale at auction to the highest bidder\", by a distant real estate man who had made capital of Washington's tomb.\nIn June 1889, the NMWMA was organized in Washington, D.C. at the home of Amelia Champlin Warner Waite, wife of Chief Justice Morrison Waite, with attention being called to the state of the grave and monument of Washington's mother by the advertisement of a Fredericksburg, Virginia, auctioneer, who was to sell it to the highest bidder. At their first meeting, they appointed their officers: Amelia Waite, President, and Margaret Hetzel, whose dollar was the first in the National coffer, serving as a substantial support to her accompanying appeal to the Washington Post, suggesting that women should rear the long sought monument, and that every woman able to do so should send US$1 toward it, The Post serving as treasurer. They also formulated their plan for the National Association, providing that a vice-president from each State be appointed. Further action was unexpectedly suspended on account of the \"Johnstown Flood\" during the month of June, when the sympathies of the whole country were aroused in behalf of its sufferers. In the fall, however, work was resumed. A charter was obtained by the NMWMA on February 22, 1890.\nThe first meeting of the National Association, after incorporation, was held in the Green Room of the White House May 13, 1891, It was attended by some of the most distinguished women at the capital. There, they organized the National Association for the purpose of rescuing the grave and completing the unfinished monument, if practicable, or erecting a new one. Among Hetzel's early acts in its behalf was a resolution before the DAR, when in the fall of 1890 they actually organized, to secure the aid and interest of this body, and her resolution was unanimously carried. Hereditary life memberships in the National Society, on the payment of US$25, were suggested by Mrs. Roger A. Pryor, of Virginia, and until February 1896, such members would be welcomed.\nAt the same time, the people of Fredericksburg were seized with horror and indignation. The women of Fredericksburg reviewed the situation, and in October 1889, organized their society, which was chartered November 16, 1889. Slowly, the work progressed, until the Fredericksburg association had about US$5,000, the ruins of the old monument, and more than 5 acres (2.0\u00a0ha) of ground. Two citizens of Fredericksburg presented the local association with two lots and the third was bought by the local association with the proceeds of a local appeal of another citizen. Late in 1889, Mr. McDowell, in a letter to the Fredericksburg Association, wrote asking if it w",
    "Building in Manhattan, New York\nFor the building in Newark, see 550 Broad Street.\n55 Broad Street is a 30-story building at Broad Street and Beaver Street in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City, U.S. It adjoins 15 William, a skyscraper to the east. The building was constructed from 1964 to 1967, and initially operated as the headquarters of the trading firm Goldman Sachs from 1967 to 1983. It continued as an office building afterward, although it was vacant for renovations from 1991 to 1995. In 2023, renovations began to convert the building from commercial space into residential apartments. The project is expected to create 571 apartments and to finish in around 2025.\nThe building was owned by the Rudin Management Company from 1964 to 2023; the building was taken over by Silverstein Properties and Metro Loft for the redevelopment effort, although Rudin maintains a stake in the project. Ares Real Estate Group has also invested in the redevelopment venture.\nHistory\nThe area was previously covered by two connected 10-story buildings owned by the Areljay Company, 55 Broad Street and 45 Beaver Street. The former 55 Broad Street had been constructed in a colonnaded neo\u2010Roman style in 1921, and 45 Beaver had been built as an annex in 1931. The main tenant of both buildings was the bank Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, which had previously owned the buildings before selling to Areljay in 1951 and continuing as tenants. Both buildings were bought by Samuel Rudin in October 1964, who arranged for the demolition of both in order to clear the site so that the construction of the new 55 Broad Street could begin.\nThe new 30-story skyscraper was built by the firm Emery Roth & Sons, and was finished in 1967. Goldman Sachs, in its early growing years, was the building's tenant during its first 16 years. Goldman moved out in 1983 due to outgrowing it, going to the nearby 85 Broad Street. In 1985, investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert (later infamous as the company at which disgraced financier Michael Milken worked) moved in as the main tenant. The firm went bust in 1990, leaving the building empty. Rudin spent around $40 million renovating the building over the next five years to remove asbestos and to add top-of-the-line for the era broadband and Internet connectivity, attracting tech companies to the building. New tenants included Sun Microsystems and a space for tech startup \"incubators\" run by Ernst & Young. Many of these left after the dot-com bust of 2000. The Rudin family had trouble keeping the space profitably rented in the 2010s, and came to the conclusion that the building was not viable continuing as office space. The Rudins did consider knocking down the building and building a taller replacement. However, changes in zoning rules since the 1960s would have meant having to give up space, and the cost of such a project was estimated at $600 million. The plans for the potential new building were leaked to the public in 2016, but ultimately nothing came of them.\nThe coronavirus pandemic in 2020 further increased commercial vacancy rates, increasing the urgency of such a project, while residential vacancy rates remained very low. The Rudins sold most of their stake to Nathan Berman of Metro Loft and Silverstein Properties with the agreement that Metro Loft would lead a residential conversion. Silverstein and Metro Loft originally intended to buy the building for $180 million in May 2022, but increasing interest rates led to the postponement of the sale. The building was finally sold in July 2023 for $173 million. The owners also took out a construction loan for the project at $220 million. The next month, CetraRuddy was hired as the project's architect. The plans called for the building to be converted into 571 apartments. Silverstein's CEO Marty Burger cited the \"great floor plate, great size, great ceiling heights\" as reasons for his company's decision to convert 55 Broad Street into a residential building.\nThe building's redevelopment is planned to be an all-electric residential building, which is not how buildings were traditionally made in New York. Environmental law changes in the 2010s and 2020s discouraged the use of gas for heating, and it also spared the redevelopment the trouble of including gas piping in the new layout. Many of the apartments are expected to be small studio apartments, aimed at recent college graduates working in the area without a family. One firm that had been renting office space as of 2023 initially sued to keep its lease, but later settled out of court and agreed to move out.\nReception\nA 2024 article in The New Yorker by D. T. Max called the building's past as an office space \"an unlovable building in an unlivable neighborhood\" and wrote that the architecture firm was seeking to merely maximize the amount of rentable office space in its style of construction, which the article derisively called a \"stack of boxes\". Lower Manhattan had very few people living in i",

    "The First Plenary Council for China (Latin: Primum Concilium Sinese, Chinese: \u7b2c\u4e00\u5c4a\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e3b\u6559\u4f1a\u8bae) was a Catholic Church council of bishops that took place in Shanghai in 1924. It was held with the Pope's approval, carried out discussions and passed resolutions regarding issues that pertained to the Catholic Church in China. \nBackground\nThe Catholic Church had existed in China for centuries, but it was largely dominated by foreign missionaries. Missionaries had held local councils in China in the past, but there had never been a national meeting of bishops in China. The Holy See was interested in implementing 'localization' of the Catholic Church in China and desired that a council of bishops could help accomplish that. Celso Costantini the Holy See's representative in China called for the meeting to begin in Shanghai on May 15th 1924.\nMeeting\nThere were 108 participants in the meeting, including 42 bishops. It took place over several weeks and concluded on June 12th of that year. Discussions were carried out in Latin rather than French (the common language used by the missionaries who dominated the clergy) or Chinese.\nThe participants agreed on several resolutions, including that Chinese clergy should be permitted to hold any office in the church provided that they were qualified, missionaries should be strictly forbidden from involvement in politics, that the mission regions in China should be reorganized into 17 areas and that localization of the church was a missionary goal. Missionaries were forbidden from a number of malpractices, including interference in lawsuits on behalf of foreign governments, ridiculing Chinese culture and they were required to obey Chinese laws. Foreign flags and symbols were also banned from being hung in Chinese churches.\nConclusion\nThe resolutions were drafted and submitted to the Holy See for approval, which was given formally on June 12th 1928. The Catholic church in China followed the path of reform set by the council. Many mission territories were converted into dioceses in the following decades and many Chinese priests were elevated to the episcopacy and installed as diocesan bishops across China. The first native-born Chinese bishops were consecrated in Rome in 1926.\nLegacy\nFollowing the establishment of communist rule in China in 1949, most of the foreign missionaries were expelled and the Chinese Catholic Church became almost entirely Chinese in the following years. Following the implementation of state control over the Chinese Catholic Church and the resultant division created, bishops of China were also henceforth divided into 'underground' and state-approved churches, and no meeting of all bishops in China has occurred since.\nIn 2024, on the 100-year anniversary of the council, an international conference at the Pontifical Urbaniana University was organized to discuss the implications of the council.\n",
    "Municipal building in Cricklade, Wiltshire, England\nOckwell's Glove Factory, also known as the Old Town Hall, is a historic building in Cricklade, a town in Wiltshire in England. The building, which currently accommodates the offices and meeting place of Cricklade Town Council, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nA town hall, supported by ten pillars, which previously stood in the High Street, dated back to 1569. Following charges of corruption brought against more than half the local 240 electors in the constituency in the 1768 general election, the rights of local people to elect members of parliament was severely diluted under the Parliamentary Elections (Cricklade) Act 1782, and by the end of the century the aldermen, who had met in the old town hall, had ceased to be appointed. The old town hall, dilapidated and redundant, was demolished in 1818.\nIn the mid-19th century, a local builder, George Lansdown, decide to commission a new town hall. It was designed by James Lansdown in the neoclassical style, built in limestone rubble and was completed in 1861. The building was used for meetings of the parish council, the petty sessions, and the manorial courts.  In 1862, while St Sampson's Church was being restored, services were held in the town hall.\nIn 1933, after a new town hall was constructed about 100 yards (91\u00a0m) to the southwest along the High Street, the old building was sold to Charles Ockwell & Company, a glove manufacturer, which was the town's largest employer.  Ockwell converted the old building into a factory and installed electrically powered sewing machines. In the inter-war period, the business struggled because of cheap supplies of surplus army stores from the US and because of competition from Hong Kong. During the Second World War, the building was extended, to increase production on military contracts.  However, in the postwar period demand for gloves fell steadily and the company closed in 1994.\nIn 1996, the building was purchased by North Wiltshire District Council. A project to convert the building into offices was financed by Wiltshire County Council, North Wiltshire District Council and Cricklade Town Council. In 2000, the conversion works commenced, and in 2002, Cricklade Town Council relocated to the ground floor of the building, while the town's library, which had been based at Bath Road since 1972, moved into the first floor. There was also space created for a doctor's surgery, which also relocated from Bath Road, and a tourist information centre.\nArchitecture\nThe two-storey building is three bays wide, and has a central carriage entrance with iron gates in the central bay.  It is built of limestone rubble, with a Welsh slate roof. The left-hand bay on the ground floor is fenestrated by a shop front, while the right-hand bay on the ground floor and all the bays on the first floor are fenestrated by sash windows with architraves. On the roof, there is a central statue of Ceres, which is said to have come from the Great Exhibition. Internally, the principal room is the assembly hall which is 50 feet (15\u00a0m) long. The building was grade II listed in 1976.\n",
    "\nMilitary unit\nThe Philippine Civic Action Group \u2013 Vietnam (PHILCAG\u2013V) was the Armed Forces of the Philippines contingent sent to the Republic of Vietnam or South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. This was an answer by the Philippine government to the request made by South Vietnam and the United States for combat troops.  While combat troops were sent, the main mission given to PHILCAG was in the area of pacification, civic engagement, engineering, and medical missions. At its peak, the PHILCAG-V had more than 182 officers and 1,882 enlisted personnel cantoned at the Tay Ninh Combat Base. In the course of 8 years, the Philippines sent about 10,450 personnel during the Vietnam. 9 members of the contingent have died, and more than 64 have been wounded.\nThe motto and philosophy of PHILCAG was \"To build, not to destroy, bring happiness, not sorrow, develop good will, not hatred.\"\nHistory\nOperation Brotherhood\nIn the aftermath of the First Indochina War, Pres. Ramon Magsaysay gave recognition to the Republic of Vietnam on July 14, 1955. Filipino civic minded groups lead by the Philippine Jaycees joined  \"Operation Brotherhood\" to help in the refugee crisis in South Vietnam. The Jaycees also conducted relief, sanitation, and medical missions at a refugee center in Saigon. From the initial 7 doctors and nurses, their numbers ballooned to 105, treating more than 400,000 patients in the first year alone.\nPres. Ngo Dinh Diem was initially cold over the presence of Filipino medical staff and was quoted in saying that Vietnam did not need \u201ca bunch of orators and nightclub musicians,\u201d referring to Filipinos in general. It was Edward Lansdale who convinced Ngo that Operation Brotherhood was vital to his fight against his communist counterparts in North Vietnam. It was however disclosed that Operation Brotherhood was run by Filipino medical staff but had nominal support from the Central Intelligence Agency through Lansdale.\nLansdale also organized for the Vietnamese leadership to send military officers from the ARVN to the Philippines for them to see Magsaysay administration's success in fighting the communist HUKBALAHAP.  This was to help the Vietnamese build confidence in counterinsurgency. Magsaysay's Presidential Security Guard commander, Col. Napoleon D. Valeriano, was later sent to Vietnam to help organize Diem's Presidential Guards, and remove the Binh Xuyen influence from the organization.\nFreedom Company\nOperation Brotherhood was succeeded by the Freedom Company in 1955, and this time the CIA had full control of its operation. The contingent was mostly composed of Filipino World War II veterans, who were involved in guerilla warfare, the training of the Presidential Guards, as well as psychological warfare. The Freedom Company would later transform itself to the Eastern Construction Company (ECoy), as the direction was to transform the activities from a non-profit to commercial. ECoy would be headed by Col. Frisco San Juan, and would receive contracts wherein Vietnamese talent pool was not able to produce the technical staff to maintain and operate American made equipment.  ECoy would continue its work into the late 1960s.\nThe withdrawal of the French from Indochina pulled the United States into the region. As the US involvement from military advisory role became deeper, this has pushed the US Army to actual combat against North Vietnamese forces and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam or commonly known as Viet Cong. This shift began during the Battle of Ia Drang in November 1965. Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson meanwhile wanted to have multinational face to the Vietnam conflict. He wanted \"more flags\" as this was a \"good fight\" against communism. The US Government put pressure on the Philippines to join in the fight, and capitalized on the domino theory, where if South Vietnam falls, the rest of Southeast Asia will fall - including the Philippines. While South Vietnam was not a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), Johnson wanted the military alliance to play its part in the conflict, however there was lack of cooperation by the France and United Kingdom.\nPHILCON-I\nIn July 1964, the Chairman of the Military Revolution, MGen. Nguyen Kanh, sent a formal note to Pres. Diosdado Macapagal, requesting for military assistance in its fight against the Viet Cong. The Congress of the Philippines passed Republic Act 4162, approving the request and authorizing the President to send aid and support to South Vietnam.  The act also allocated a budget of PhP 1 million. This was followed by a similar request by Prime Minister Phan Huey Quat in April 1965, requesting for 2,000 troops.\nPres. Macapagal in the Oval Office with Pres. Johnson\nPres. Macapagal mobilized the First Philippine Contingent (PHILCON I), which was composed of doctors, nurses, and civil military officers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Apart from civic military operations, the mission also included 16 Psychological Warfare Officers ",
    "\nHereford United 1973\u201374 football season\nThe 1973\u201374 season was the 44th season of competitive football played by Hereford United Football Club and their second in the Football League. Following promotion in their debut league season, the club competed in Division Three, as well as the League Cup, FA Cup and Welsh Cup.\nSummary\nHereford enjoyed a steady start to the season and were as high as fifth in the table by the end of October. A sequence of only four wins in 17 matches between December and March checked their progress, but a nine-match unbeaten run pulled them clear of danger to an eventual 18th-place finish, eight points above the relegation zone.\nIn the FA Cup, Hereford evoked memories of their giant-killing exploits two years earlier with a 2\u20131 replay win over West Ham United in the third round. Alan Jones struck the winning goal after a late Pat Holland equaliser had denied Hereford victory in the first match at Upton Park. The Cup run ended in the next round at the hands of Bristol City.\nOn 26 September 1973, Brian Evans, a pre-season signing from Swansea City, became the first Hereford player to win an international cap when he featured in Wales' 3\u20130 defeat against Poland in a World Cup qualifier.\nSquad\nPlayers who made one appearance or more for Hereford United F.C. during the 1973-74 season\n\nThird Division\nSource: rsssf.com\nResults\nThird Division\nMain article: 1973\u201374 Football League\nGrimsby Town v Hereford United\nHereford United v Blackburn Rovers\nCharlton Athletic v Hereford United\nBristol Rovers v Hereford United\nHereford United v Watford\nHereford United v Tranmere Rovers\nHalifax Town v Hereford United\nHereford United v Wrexham\nPort Vale v Hereford United\nTranmere Rovers v Hereford United\nHereford United v Cambridge United\nSouthend United v Hereford United\nHereford United v Bristol Rovers\nHereford United v Brighton & Hove Albion\nSouthport v Hereford United\nHereford United v Oldham Athletic\nYork City v Hereford United\nHereford United v Huddersfield Town\nHereford United v Walsall\nChesterfield v Hereford United\nWrexham v Hereford United\nHereford United v Bournemouth\nHereford United v Charlton Athletic\nBlackburn Rovers v Hereford United\nWatford v Hereford United\nHereford United v Grimsby Town\nAldershot v Hereford United\nCambridge United v Hereford United\nHereford United v Plymouth Argyle\nHereford United v Port Vale\nRochdale v Hereford United\nBournemouth v Hereford United\nBrighton & Hove Albion v Hereford United\nHereford United v Halifax Town\nHereford United v Southend United\nHereford United v Aldershot\nOldham Athletic v Hereford United\nPlymouth Argyle v Hereford United\nHereford United v Southport\nHereford United v Rochdale\nHereford United v York City\nHuddersfield Town v Hereford United\nHereford United v Shrewsbury Town\nShrewsbury Town v Hereford United\nHereford United v Chesterfield\nWalsall v Hereford United\n\nLeague Cup\nMain article: 1973\u201374 Football League Cup\nCardiff City v Hereford United\n\nFA Cup\nMain article: 1973\u201374 FA Cup\nHereford United v Torquay United\nHereford United v Walton & Hersham\nWest Ham United v Hereford United\nHereford United v West Ham United\nHereford United v Bristol City\n\nWelsh Cup\nMain article: 1973\u201374 Welsh Cup\nWorcester City v Hereford United\n\n",

Treil graduated in mathematics in 1982 with an M.Sc. and in 1985 with a Ph.D. His Ph.D. thesis, dealing with geometric aspects of Hankel operators and Toeplitz operators, was supervised by Nikolai Kapitonovich Nikolski. From 1986 to 1989 Treil was an assistant professor at the Baikonur branch of the Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI). From 1989 to 1991 he was a researcher at the laboratory of theoretical cybernetics at Leningrad University. In Michigan State University's department of mathematics, he was from 1991 to 1992 a visiting assistant professor, from 1992 to 1994 an assistant professor, from 1994 to 1998 he was an associate professor, and from 1998 to 1999 a full professor. In Brown University's department of mathematics, he was from 2000 to 2001 an associate professor and was appointed in 2001 a full professor. He was a visiting scholar in 1990 at the Mittag-Leffler Institute, where he worked with Alexandre Megretski of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Treil was in autumn 1998 a visiting professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's department of electrical engineering and computer science.\nTreil has done important research in the intersection of operator theory, complex analysis, and harmonic analysis. Much of his research is on problems related to applied mathematics, such as control theory, stationary random processes, signal processing, and wavelets. His research interest include Hankel operators, Toeplitz operators, functional models of operators, spectral decompositions of operators, spectral theory of matrix- and operator-valued functions, the Corona problem, and the interplay between operator theory and complex geometry.\nIn 1993 Treil was awarded the Salem Prize. He wrote several papers with Alexander Volberg and Fedor Nazarov, who were his colleagues at Michigan State University. Volberg shared the 1988 Salem Prize with Jean-Christophe Yoccoz. Nazarov won the 1999 Salem Prize.  \nSelected publications\nNazarov, F.; Treil, S.

    "1992 single by Gang Starr featuring Nice & Smooth\n\"Dwyck\" (stylized in all caps) is a song by American hip hop duo Gang Starr, released in 1992 as the lead single from their fourth studio album Hard to Earn (1994). It features American hip hop duo Nice & Smooth. The song samples \"Synthetic Substitution\" by Melvin Bliss, \"Funky for You\" and \"No Bones in Ice Cream\" by Nice & Smooth, and \"Step in the Arena\" by Gang Starr.\nBackground\nAfter Gang Starr worked with Nice & Smooth on the song \"Down the Line\", the latter collaborated the former to return a favor. They recorded \"Dwyck\" in a two-day session, during which rappers WC and Don Barron (from the hip hop group Masters of Ceremony) were also present. At the time, the artists thought Guru's verse was the weakest. DJ Premier recalled that on the first day, Smooth B recorded 20 takes of the line \"Yo Keithy E, I left my Phillie at home, do you have another?\" The next day, he performed his verse in one take.\n\"Dwyck\" was originally the B-side to \"Take It Personal\" by Gang Starr. Gang Starr did not expect the song to become as popular as it did. They remastered the song, and added the new version to their album Daily Operation at the request of Chrysalis Records. However, the label reneged on their promise to re-release the album, which was problematic as people were only buying Daily Operation for \"Dwyck\". Gang Starr eventually included the song in Hard to Earn so it would still appear on one of their albums.\nThe title of the song originated from a trending joke started by rapper Biz Markie, in which a person would attract someone else's attention and show themselves grabbing their penis while saying \"Dwyck!\"\nCritical reception\nTom Doggett of RapReviews considered \"Dwyck\" the best song from Hard to Earn and \"one of the truly great party starters from the early nineties\". He further wrote of the song, \"The stripped-down production consists of only drums and a bassline, which allows the artists to take the spotlight in each verse, which they do. Smooth B's subdued rhymes in the third verse stand out the most, though Greg Nice and Guru do their thing as well. The most unforgettable part of the song, though, is Primo's turntable wizardry between verses, a breathtaking display from a true master.\"\nCharts\n",

    "Spanish sailor, entrepreneur, and sports leader\nEnrique Pardi\u00f1as y Barreiros was a Spanish sailor and sports leader who served as the second president of Real Sociedad between 1912 and 1915, and as the first president Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Clubes de F\u00fatbol (UECF), the forerunner federation of the current Royal Spanish Football Federation between 1912 and 1914.\nSporting career\nAthlete\nAt the end of the 19th century, Pardi\u00f1as was a member of the Spanish colonial administration of Cuba (acting secretary), and at the beginning of the 20th century, he was a member of San Sebasti\u00e1n's high society. He stood out in the sport of sailing, both as a sailor, winning the first edition of the Argentine Yacht Club Cup in 1908, but also as a skipper, federator, and mainly as commodore of the Real Club N\u00e1utico de San Sebasti\u00e1n\u00a0, a position he still held when he died in 1920.\nPresidencial mandates\nIn 1912, Pardi\u00f1as was appointed as the second president of Real Sociedad, replacing Adolfo S\u00e1enz. As president of this club, he was one of the promoters and founders of the Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Clubes de F\u00fatbol (UECF), a federation founded by the dissidents of the FECF, the current Royal Spanish Football Federation, following a disagreement about the venue of the 1913 Copa del Rey. He was elected president of this entity at the constitution assembly of this federation, held in San Sebasti\u00e1n at the end of December 1912. The Gipuzkoan teams joined it, with the notable exception of Racing de Ir\u00fan, a part of the Catalans with FC Barcelona at the helm, and some clubs from other regions.\nDuring 1913, a great rivalry arose between both federations, and two parallel Copa del Rey tournaments were held in March 1913, an \"official\", organized by FECF in Madrid, and an \"unofficial\", organized by the UECF in Barcelona. Pardi\u00f1as' personal friendship with Queen Victoria Eugenia made it possible for the queen to \"donate\" a Cup for the Copa del Rey sponsored by this federation, and likewise, Pardi\u00f1as managed to get King Alfonso XIII to grant the title of \"Royal\" to the UECF, before he did the same as compensation to the FECF. This royal recognition gave the UECF a certain prestige and made it a serious rival to the FECF, although the number of clubs affiliated with it was considerably smaller. In the Copa del Rey sponsored by the UECF, Real Sociedad, chaired by Pardi\u00f1as himself, faced FC Barcelona in a double match for the title, and after drawing in both games, FC Barcelona won in the final third tiebreaker match.\nThe UECF tried to gain recognition from FIFA by holding an international match against a French XI, held on 25 May 1913 at the Amute in Hondarribia, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw and which is now considered to have been the first-ever (unofficial) match of a Spanish national team. The UECF's attempt to affiliate with FIFA caused the international federation to issue an ultimatum to the two Spanish federations forcing them to merge if they wanted to be recognized by FIFA. During the summer of 1913, arduous negotiations were carried out between the two federations that finally led to the creation of several regional federations and the new Royal Spanish Football Federation in September 1913. The Royal Spanish Union of Clubs, although without activity since September, it was not officially dissolved until 5 February 1914. The RFEF recognized the title obtained by Barcelona in the UECF tournament as part of the Cup's record, as the 1913 UECF Copa del Rey.\n",

    "Series of intense solar storms in 2024\nThe solar storms of May 2024 were a series of powerful solar storms with extreme solar flares and geomagnetic storm components that occurred from 10\u201313 May 2024 during solar cycle 25. The geomagnetic storm was the most powerful to affect Earth since March 1989, and produced aurorae at far more equatorial latitudes than usual in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\nSolar flares and coronal mass ejections\nThe Sun's photosphere observed in visible light on 10\u00a0May. The sunspot group associated with AR3664 is present on the Sun's western limb. The comparative sizes of Earth and Jupiter are shown to scale.The Sun's corona observed in extreme ultraviolet (131\u00a0\u00c5) on 8\u00a0May. AR3664, located at center disk, produced multiple flares during this time.\nOn 8 May 2024, a solar active region which had been assigned the NOAA region number 13664 (AR3664) produced an X1.0-class and multiple M-class solar flares and launched several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) toward Earth. On 9 May, the active region produced an X2.25- and X1.12-class flare each associated with a full-halo CME. On 10 May, the region produced an X3.98-class flare, and on 11 May at 01:23 UTC it produced another X-class flare of magnitude 5.4\u20135.7 with another asymmetrical full-halo CME. The region also caused an S1 solar radiation storm with spikes reaching S2. On 14 May, as the most active region 3664 rotated beyond the sun's western limb, the strongest flare occurred, an X8.7, causing level R3 (strong) radio blackouts.\nGeomagnetic storm\nValues of the three-hour Kp-index from 10\u201314 May 2024\nAs a result of the interplanetary magnetic field reaching a magnitude of 73\u00a0nT (nanotesla), with the component along Earth's magnetic axis oriented south reaching as much as \u221250\u00a0nT, the moderately high solar wind density, and the solar wind speed reaching 750\u2013800\u00a0km/s (470\u2013500\u00a0mi/s) between 11\u201312 May (UTC time), the event was classified as a G5-class geomagnetic storm (Kp = 9), making it the most intense storm since the 2003 Halloween solar storms. Several other CMEs were expected to reach Earth on 11 and 12 May.\nComparison to other geomagnetic storms\nThe disturbance storm time index (Dst index) is a measure in the context of space weather. A negative Dst index means that Earth's magnetic field is weakened. This is particularly the case during solar storms, with a higher negative Dst index indicating a stronger solar storm.\nThe 2003 Halloween solar storms had a peak Dst index of \u2212383 nT, although a second storm on 20 November 2003 reached \u2212422 nT while not reaching G5-class. The March 1989 geomagnetic storm had a peak Dst index of \u2212589 nT, while the May 1921 geomagnetic storm has been estimated to have had a peak Dst index of \u2212907\u00b1132\u00a0nT. Estimates for the peak Dst index of the Carrington Event superstorm of 1859 are between \u2212800\u00a0nT and \u22121750\u00a0nT.\nThe May 2024 solar storms reached a peak Dst index of \u2212412\u00a0nT at 03:00 UTC on 11 May.\nThe Ap-index of 11 May 2024 was 271, higher than the Ap-indexes of 13 and 14 March 1989, significantly higher than the Ap-indexes of 29/30 October and 20 November 2003, and the second-highest ever recorded, after the Ap-index of 13 November 1960, which was 280.\nAurora sightings\nA selection of maps showing the typical midnight equatorward boundary of aurorae at different Kp levels.\nAll five of Clark's aurora classifications were documented: glows, patches, arcs, rays, and coronas.

Pink aurora is produced by nitrogen molecules, green and red aurora is produced by oxygen molecules, and blue and purple aurora is produced by hydrogen and helium molecules, at altitudes of 100 to 400 km.\nThree CMEs from 8 May reached Earth on 10 May 2024, causing severe to extreme geomagnetic storms with bright and very long-lasting aurorae.\nIn North America, aurorae were seen across the United States as far south as the Florida Keys, as well as from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico, The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. The aurora was also seen in Hawaii.\nAurorae were seen across Europe from as far south as Portugal, Spain, and Sardinia. Aurorae were also visible in Algeria and the Canary Islands in Africa.\nIn Asia, aurorae could be seen from Turkey, Cyprus, Iran, Japan, northern India, and across northern China, including near the cities of Urumqi and Beijing.\nIn Australia, aurorae were seen as far north as Townsville and Mackay in Queensland, while in the rest of the Southern Hemisphere aurorae were seen in New\u00a0Zealand, Chile, Argentina, South Africa, and as far north as New Caledo",
    "Church building in Osmington, England\nSt Osmund's Church is a Church of England parish church in Osmington, Dorset, England. It is a Grade II* listed building.\nHistory\nMuch of the church dates to a rebuild in the mid-19th century, but there are a number of earlier features. The chancel arch has been dated to c. 1200, the nave's north arcade to c. 1300 and the west tower to the 15th century. In 1796, the east end of the chancel was altered and its roof re-covered.\nBy the mid 19th-century, the church was found to be in poor structural condition, particularly as one of its side walls was \"considerably out of the perpendicular\", and the roof's timbers were in a state of decay. The decision was made to demolish and rebuild most of the church, with the exception of the tower. It was also decided to enlarge the church with the addition of a south aisle as congregation numbers had exceeded the church's capacity.\nThe rebuilding and extension plans were drawn up by the architect Benjamin Ferrey, with seated capacity increased from 140 to 331. Owing to the parish's small size and limited wealth, an appeal was launched to raise the necessary funds for the work. By mid-February 1845, over \u00a3450 had been raised by donations, including a grant of \u00a3120 from the Salisbury Diocesan Church Building Association.\nTenders were sought for the works by 26 April 1845 and the contract was subsequently given to Messrs Cornick and Sons of Bridport, whose tender was \"considerably lower\" than the others. During the work, which was carried out in 1845\u201346, services were temporarily held in the parish's schoolroom.\nToday, the church continues to serve the parish of Osmington with Poxwell. It forms part of the Ridgeway circuit, a group of seven churches within the region of Weymouth.\nArchitecture\nSt Osmund's is built of local stone, with slate roofs and window dressings in Ham Hill stone. It is made up of the nave, north and south aisles, chancel, west tower and south porch. The north aisle was rebuilt during the 1845\u201346 work; new windows were added but old stonework was used for the walls. The new south aisle was designed to match the north aisle. The two-stage embattled tower is surmounted by a turret and has a clock on its east side. It has three storeys internally and contains four bells: one inscribed 'Angelus Gabriel' and dating to the late 14th century, one inscribed 'Ave Maria' and dating to the 15th century, and two by John Wallis, dated 1593.\nInternal fittings include a restored font which has been dated to c. 1200. The stone pulpit was erected in memory of the district's HM Inspector of Schools, Rev. W. F. Tregarthen, in 1884, and the brass lectern was added at the same time in memory of the vicar Rev. Sir James Erasmus Philipps. The rood screen dates to 1897.\nThe lychgate at the entrance of the churchyard dates to 1895. It was erected in the memory of the vicar Rev. J. T. Vaudrey and was dedicated by the Archdeacon of Dorset, Rev. Francis Sowter, on 13 November 1895. The churchyard contains two Grade II listed features: the table tomb of Robert Godsall, dated 1678, and an unidentified headstone from the 18th century.\n",

The 1885 New Haven season was extremely brief, as the team had just one official game, joining the league and folding after one game on August 15, 1885. New Haven ended their one-game season with a record of 0\u20131 and were managed by H.A. Ely . After New Haven folded, the Southern New England League re-formed as the Connecticut State League on August 27, 1885.\nNew Haven returned to hosting minor league play in 1887, with the team becoming known as the New Haven \"Blues\" for the first time. The New Haven team became members of the six\u2013team Independent level Eastern League.

Playing with the Troy team, his 1888 manager was Ted Sullivan, who years later managed New Haven. Sullivan disapproved of Dasher Troy's consumption of alcoholic beverages and Troy reluctantly agreed to refrain from drinking in order to play for the team under Sullivan. In the last inning of a home game during the 1888 season, Troy promised to his manager that if Sullivan went to the bar under the grandstand and brought him a beer, Troy would \"clear the bases.\" Sullivan obliged the request and Troy reportedly walked up to bat and said, \"The 'Old Dash' is back.\"  Troy then hit the ball off the center field fence and raced around the bases for a",

On 3 June 1691, \u00d6mkhei attended the Dolonnuur Assembly together with Tusheet Khan, Zasagt Khan and more than 500 noyans and taijis. Since then, the Khalkha Mongols in Outer Mongolia submitted to the Qing dynasty. The three khanates, Sechen Khan, T\u00fcsheet Khan and Zasagt Khan, became three provincial subdivisions or aimags of Qing China. In the next year, Khalka was divided into three zams (\u0437\u0430\u043c), the area of Sechen Khan aimag was named \"Khalka Left Zam\" (Mongolian: \u0425\u0430\u043b\u0445\u044b\u043d \u0437\u04af\u04af\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043c, Chinese: \u5580\u723e\u5580\u6771\u8def).

Mayner started playing music when he was around 14 years old, learning to play guitar and drums. A few years later, with the help of music software, music production would begin. Mayner completed his mandatory service in the IDF army.\nIn 2014, when he was 23 years old, he independently moved to the city of Tel Aviv to focus on music creation. At that time he created his debut album, \"Atar Minor\", while doing odd jobs to earn a living. In 2016, Miner uploaded his first song, \u201c24,\u201d to the video-sharing website \u201cYouTube.\u201d Still in the same year, he produced and arranged the song \"Representar\" by rapper Ortega. Two years later in 2018, he published his debut album, \"Atar Mayner\", with the Yahlom record label. The album was praised by critics, as well as sympathetic reactions from the public. The album included the single \"Medina of Thieves\", which also featured Dor3 and Rasta Chai. In 2019, the single \"Touch Myself\" was released, but it was removed from streaming and social media platforms after Miner felt the audience misinterpreted the song lyrics. Also in the same year the song \"I Have a Hole in My Heart in Your Shape\" by the band \"Girafat\" was released, which Mayner composed and produced together with Gilad Kahane.\nIn 2020, together with Yuval Hambalel, he released a new version of the song \"My Way\". He also musically produced his sister-in-law Rif Cohen album \"Quelle heure est-il\" and performed a cover version of the song \"One Human Tissue\" with her as part of the \"Order\" Hour Project. On November 5, the television series \"The Cook\" for which he produced the soundtrack, work for which he was nominated for the 2020 Television Academy Awards. During the year, he released the singles \"Wake Up\" and \"Reason to Love\", and At the end of the year, on December 20, he released his second album, \"Lila Tov\". After the album's release, Miner was included in \"Forbes\" magazine 30 Under 30 list. Miner's third album, \"Peneim\", was released on August 28, 2022. In March 2023, he participated as a warm-up show at American rapper Travis Scott performance at Yarakon Park.\nMayner lives in Tel Aviv.

    "Improvised hide boat used in South and Central America\nJean-Baptiste Debret, Mineiro crossing river.  In this particular example the vessel has the luxury of a wooden gunwale.\nA pelota was an improvised rawhide boat used in South and Central America for crossing rivers.  It was similar in some respects to the coracle of the British Isles or the bull boat of North America, but it had little or no wooden framework or internal supporting structure, often relying entirely on the stiffness of the hide and the packing of the cargo to keep it open and afloat.  Thus, the hide could be carried about on horseback and set up quickly in an emergency, a commonplace rural skill.  The vessel was towed by an animal, or by a human swimmer gripping a cord with the teeth, who had to be careful not to swamp it, women being considered particularly dexterous.  Pelotas could convey substantial loads\u2014around a quarter of a ton was common\u2014and even small artillery pieces.  They continued to be used well into the 20th century.\nNecessity\nFording the San Joaqu\u00edn (detail), C\u00e1ndido L\u00f3pez, oil on canvas, Museo Nacional Hist\u00f3rico\nThere were few bridges in these regions and rivers had to be forded or, if too deep, crossed in a boat, which might well be unavailable.  To cross a river in an emergency e.g. when swollen by torrential rains or during a military campaign, travellers on horseback had to employ such means as were to hand.  They were unlikely to be carrying timber, which in some regions e.g. the treeless pampas might be hard to procure.  Ox-hides were common, however, and many travellers were in the habit of carrying one under their saddle.  (The native recado is a saddle applied in multiple superposed layers, one of which is a large square sheet of rawhide.)\nWrote botanist Augustin Saint-Hilaire:Since I left the province of Santa Catarina , I had travelled about six hundred leagues, and I had crossed a country cut by numerous rivers; part of this country is rich and flourishing, and yet I did not see a single bridge, sometimes I did not even find any canoe on the banks of the rivers. When this happens, the inhabitants of the country take a rawhide, they knot the four corners of it, and thus form a sort of rounded boat (pelota), to which they attach a strap. Anyone who wants to cross the water sits in this type of canoe and remains motionless while a swimmer, holding the strap between his teeth, pulls it until he reaches the other bank. I have had luggage transported in this way, often very heavy though he was reluctant to entrust his rich collection of specimens to this means of conveyance.\nConstruction\nCrossing the Luj\u00e1n River, Argentina.  The bridge  - the only one in the province  -  often washed away.\nA sun-dried rawhide is inherently rather stiff, and tends to curve preferentially with the hairy side outwards.  The legs were cut off to form a roughly rectangular structure and tied at the four corners to increase its curvature.\nIn some cases a refinement was employed.  Since animal hides were habitually dried by staking them out on the ground, they came with peg-holes along the margins.  By passing a cord through these eyelets, the curvature could be further enhanced  - like tightening a purse-string.  The vessel has been compared to the gigantic water-lily of the Amazon. Martin Dobrizhoffer, a Jesuit missionary in Paraguay, recorded that the four sides were raised \"like the upturned brim of a hat\", a distance of about 2 spans.  Sometimes, a few sticks were inserted for internal support, but this was not usually necessary, or always possible.\nIf no cowhide was available, one might be procured by slaughtering an animal on the spot and skinning it.  Since this hide lacked stiffness, however, it was necessary to vary the construction.  The skin was stuffed with, and tied around, a bundle of straw, and only served as a rudimentary float.\nStiffness\nIf the hide was allowed to get wet through, it tended to become soft and pliable, hence useless.  Then it was necessary to dry it out, or to use bracing sticks if these could be found.\nF\u00e9lix de Azara, a Spanish colonial official whose duties compelled him to travel through remote regions and who often used the pelota to cross rivers, complained in his travel diary that torrential rains not only caused flooding but gradually made the pelota useless.\nIt was said that if a pelota should take too long to cross a river, as might happen if the towing swimmer grew tired, or lost his hold, the hide would soften up and the vessel might sink.\nPropulsion\nThe hide boat was towed across the river, either by a swimmer pulling a cord with his teeth, or by a bullock, or by holding onto the tail of a horse.  In the Mato Grosso a second swimmer helped to guide it and push it from behind.\nThe French traveller de Moussy, who rode very extensively over Argentina, wrote:\nThis way of crossing rivers was naturally perilous, and more than one accident, sometimes fatal, was the result; but every Argentine countryma",
    "For another meaning, see NATO phonetic alphabet, APCO radiotelephony spelling alphabet\nIn Russian phonology and in some other languages, a phonetic word (Russian: \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e, French: mot phon\u00e9tique) is a sequence of morphemes clustered around one nuclear stress. A phonetic word may contain more than one lexical item.\nRussian language\nIt may consist of a single content word and adjacent clitics (function words). It may include a proclitic (\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435, on the sofa), an enclitic (\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0431\u044b, \"whether <someone> would read\"), or even both: \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441 \u0431\u044b, \u043f\u043e \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0435 \u043b\u0438.\nIn most cases an accent falls on a syllable of the content word, never on the enclitic, and in rare cases it may fall on the proclitic leaving the content word unstressed: \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0301 (on a hill) vs. \u043d\u0430\u0301 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443 (onto a hill). In modern standard Russian there is a tendency to abandon putting accent on the proclitic. Still, this is preserved in phraseologisms, such as \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0301 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e (\"take the word\") or \u0441\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0301 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443 (\"to become puzzled, scared\", \"to repent or become sorry belatedly\", literally \"to clutch one's own head\").\nThe unstressed content words are the vestige of the Old East Slavic/protoslavic prosodic feature called  enclinomenon (w:ru:\u044d\u043d\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d), a word or group of words without stress.\nThe concept of the phonetic word is important because  quality, intensity and duration of vowels in unstressed syllables (vowel reduction) depend on their location in relation to this stressed syllable.\nThe concept of phonetic word should not be confused with loss of stress in rhythmic speech, e.g., in poetry, in trisyllabic metrical feet:\n\u041d\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0301 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0301\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0301\n\u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043b\u044f\u0301\u0442\u044c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0301\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0301\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445\nFrench language\nIn French language the concept of mot phon\u00e9tique (also translated as phonological phrase) was introduced by Fran\u00e7ois Wioland in 2005.\nLes mots phon\u00e9tiques sont des unit\u00e9s minimales de production et de perception qui signifient, que l\u2019on peut observer dans les communications verbales, sans r\u00e9f\u00e9rence consciente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9crit, comme le sont les \u00e9changes et dialogues spontan\u00e9s,  soit pr\u00e9sentiels, soit t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques\n(Phonetic words are minimal units of production and perception which have a definite meaning, which can be observed in verbal communications, without conscious reference in writing, as are spontaneous exchanges and dialogues, either face-to-face or by telephone.\nA phonemic word has the following characteristics:\nIt contains a small number of syllables\nInternal syllables are less important for understanding and the meaning is clear from the context\nThe last syllable is pronounced stressed (accented and prolonged)\nExamples:\nSingle-syllable: oui; vous\nTwo-syllable: bonjour; sans blague! - Stress: da daaa\nThree-syllable tout a fait; au retour - Stress: da da daaa\nFour-syllable: sans aucun doute  - Stress: da da da daaa\nSix-syllable: il est am\u00e9ricain  - Stress: da da da da da daaa\nExamples of  phrases that consist of two three-syllable phonetic words: \"ces enfants sont petits\"; \"il est bon en fran\u00e7ais\"; \"vous avez entendu?\"\nMots phon\u00e9tiques can have secondary accents. However the syllable preceding the main accent completely loses its accent. Also, accents tend to alternate, i.e., there will be a sequence of unaccented sylables, rather than a sequence of accented syllables. This principle is called \"accent clash avoidance.\" According to this principle, if an utterance is grammatically split into, e.g., two mots phon\u00e9tiques, then if the second one is monosyllable, the two are pronounced as one mot phon\u00e9tique.\nMots phon\u00e9tiques should be distinguished from rhythmic groups (groupes rythmiques).\nSee also\nStress in Russian language\u00a0\nSyntagma (linguistics)\nPhonological word\n",
    "Lunar lander developed by Firefly Aerospace\n Firefly Aerospace Blue Ghost, or simply Blue Ghost, is a class of lunar landers designed by Firefly Aerospace to deliver small payloads to the surface of the Moon. The first Blue Ghost mission is planned to launch in 2024.\nFunding\nIn 2017, Space Policy Directive 1 signaled the intention of returning NASA astronauts to the Moon. In 2018, NASA solicited bids from nine companies, including Firefly Aerospace, for the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. CLPS is part of the NASA Artemis program; one of the long-term goals of Artemis is establishing a permanent crewed base on the Moon.\nIn 2021, Firefly Aerospace received a NASA contract that was  valued at US$93 million to conduct lunar landings for NASA.\nOverview\nPower on board the Blue Ghost lander is provided via solar panels that have multiple deployment options. The solar array provides a maximum of 650 W. The lander is communications enabled and features multiple layers of insulation, heating system and four landing legs. The company touts the landers fully in house end to end manufacturing and testing process as a differentiator among the CLPS Lunar Landers.\nMissions\nBlue Ghost M1\nOn February 4, 2021, NASA awarded Firefly a contract worth US$93.3 million to deliver a suite of ten science investigations and technology demonstrations to the Moon in 2023. The award is part of the CLPS initiative, in which NASA is securing the service of commercial partners to quickly land science and technology payloads on the lunar surface as part of the Artemis program.\nFirefly Aerospace is the prime contractor responsible for end-to-end delivery services, including payload integration, launch from Earth, landing on the Moon, and mission operations. Subcontractors include SolAero By Rocket Lab, providing the solar panels, and ASI by Rocket Lab, providing the lander flight software, ground software, GN&C software, trajectory design, orbit determination, and avionics/flight software testbed integration. This was the sixth award for lunar surface delivery under the CLPS initiative, and the first delivery awarded to Firefly Aerospace. Firefly's Cedar Park facility will serve as the company's mission operations center for the 2023 delivery and the location of payload integration, with Rocket Lab serving as the backup mission operations center.\nThe mission is planned to land at Mare Crisium, a 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) wide basin visible from Earth. Instruments will gather data to provide insight into the Moon's regolith \u2013 loose, fragmented rock and soil \u2013 properties, geophysical characteristics, and the interaction of solar wind and Earth's magnetic field, helping to prepare for human missions to the lunar surface. On May 20, 2021, Firefly selected SpaceX's Falcon 9 as the launch vehicle for the first mission, as its own Alpha rocket does not have the performance or payload volume needed to launch Blue Ghost. Firefly's future Beta launch vehicle is expected to support future Blue Ghost missions.\nOn April 26, 2022, Firefly announced the completion of the Integration Readiness Review (IRR) for the first Blue Ghost lander, M1, with the launch now expected to occur in 2024. In November 2023 Firefly provided a more precise time window for the mission, occurring between the third and the fourth quarters of 2024. In May 2024, the first engines for Blue Ghost were completed.\nPayloads\nThe payloads, collectively expected to total 94\u00a0kg (207\u00a0lb) in mass, include:\nThe Regolith Adherence Characterization (RAC), which will determine how lunar regolith sticks to a range of materials exposed to the Moon's environment during landing and lander operations. Components will be derived from the MISSE-FF facility currently on the International Space Station (ISS).\nThe Next Generation Lunar Retroreflectors (NGLR), which will serve as a target for lasers on Earth to precisely measure the distance between Earth and the Moon. The retroreflector that will fly on this mission also will provide data that could be used to understand various aspects of the lunar interior and address fundamental physics questions.\nThe Lunar Environment Heliospheric X-ray Imager (LEXI), which will capture images of the interaction of Earth's magnetosphere with the flow of charged particles from the Sun, called the solar wind.\nThe Reconfigurable, Radiation Tolerant Computer System (RadPC), which aims to demonstrate a radiation-tolerant computing technology. Due to the Moon's lack of atmosphere and magnetic field, radiation from the Sun will be a challenge for electronics. This investigation also will characterize the radiation effects on the lunar surface.\nThe Lunar Magnetotelluric Sounder (LMS), which is designed to characterize the structure and composition of the Moon's mantle by studying electric and magnetic fields. The investigation will make use of a flight-spare magnetometer, a device that measures magnetic fields, originally made for the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolut",
    "Singaporean convicted killer and drug trafficker\nRoshdi bin Abdullah Altway was a Singaporean convicted killer and drug trafficker. Roshdi first gained notoriety in 1993 for the murder of a narcotics officer. Roshdi was charged with murdering Rajab Mohamed, an inspector of the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), by battering the officer to death with a granite mortar in 1993. Although Roshdi stated in his defence that he acted in self-defence when he mistook the inspector for trying to reach for his revolver and harm him, Roshdi was nonetheless found guilty of murdering Inspector Rajab and sentenced to death after his defence was rejected. In 1994, upon his appeal, Roshdi's claims of self-defence were accepted, and therefore his death sentence was commuted to ten years\u2019 jail for manslaughter, in addition to six years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane for illegal possession of a revolver and six bullets.\nAfter his release however, Roshdi re-offended and he was sentenced in 2007 to 12 years' jail and ten strokes of the cane for trafficking Subutex tablets and for drug consumption. After his parole and release from this sentence, Roshdi was caught for capital diamorphine trafficking in 2016, and he was sentenced to death a second time after failing to substantiate his defence of safekeeping but not trafficking the 78.77g of diamorphine.\nPersonal life\nRoshdi bin Abdullah Altway was born in Singapore in 1959. He had at least one sister in his family. Roshdi was married sometime during his adulthood, but it is not known if he had any children.\nRoshdi worked as a salesman prior to his arrest in March 1993 for murder, and some sources also described Roshdi's occupation as a businessman. He also had previous records of drug consumption, and was detained under the Criminal Law Act at one point. In 1990, Roshdi was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) for allegedly selling drugs, but he subsequently became an informant of the CNB (with the codename \"786\") after agreeing to the request of Inspector Rajab Mohamed, who was in charge of the investigations in Roshdi's case. Reportedly, Roshdi and Inspector Rajab befriended each other and they operated as bookies at the Turf Club, and both men often place bets against each other. Roshdi reportedly also lent Inspector Rajab about S$40,000 in relation to the bets they made. This friendship however, lasted for merely three years before the two men fell out over monetary issues and it ended with the murder of Inspector Rajab Mohamed.\nMurder of Inspector Rajab Mohamed (1993)\nArrest and investigations\nCNB Inspector Rajab Mohamed (aged 35), who was found murdered three days after he went missing\nOn the night of 8 March 1993, Inspector Rajab Mohamed was last seen alive by his wife, who saw him responding to a pager call at his home, and he also told his wife that he was going to meet his informant at Serangoon North. Aside from this, he called his office and asked his men to stand by for a drug bust and he would make a second call. However, the call never came, and Inspector Rajab did not return home later that night. A day after his disappearance, Inspector Rajab's 32-year-old wife Masita Sanoesia, a Singapore Coast Guard corporal who was then three months pregnant, reported her husband missing to the police, and both Inspector Rajab's family and friends helped to search for Inspector Rajab in some parts of Singapore, and just five minutes before the discovery of Inspector Rajab's death, his sister tried to contact a newspaper to publicly appeal for information of her whereabouts.\nMeanwhile, the police investigated the disappearance of Inspector Rajab, and through the phone records, they identified Roshdi Abdullah Altway as the same informant whom the missing inspector was meeting on that night, and arrested him on suspicion of being involved in the disappearance of Inspector Rajab. After his arrest on 10 March 1993, Roshdi confessed to the police that he murdered Inspector Rajab.\nOn the night of 11 March 1993, Roshdi led the police to a Tampines multi-storey carpark, where the decomposing body of 35-year-old Inspector Rajab Mohamed was found in the back-seat of his car. At the time when Inspector Rajab's corpse was found, he was speculated to have died for more than two days, and his skull was found to have been crushed, purportedly caused by blunt force trauma caused by multiple blows inflicted with a blunt object. According to Dr Wee Keng Poh, a forensic pathologist who performed an autopsy on the victim, there were multiple skull fractures on his head and a large amount of force was exerted in inflicting the blows that caused these injuries, which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. At the same time, Inspector Rajab's revolver and ammunition, consisting of five or six bullets, were recovered from the Ang Mo Kio flat of Roshdi's mother-in-law. Police investigations classified Inspector Rajab's death as murder, and on 13 March 1993, 34-year-old ",

    "This article is about the movement in moral philosophy. For the intellectual concept itself, see ideal (ethics).\nGerman philosopher Immanuel Kant's particular view of human nature and intellectual inquiry, later summed up as \"Kantianism\", articulated a theory of ethical idealism with respect to moral choice.\nEthical idealism, which is also referred to by terms such as moral idealism, principled idealism, and other expressions, is a philosphical framework based on holding onto specifically defined ideals in the context of facing various consequences to holding such principles and/or values. Such ideals, which are analyzed during the process of ethical thinking, become applied in practice via a group of specific goals relative to what has been learned over time about morality. As noted by philosopher Norbert Paulo, following ideals in a doctrinaire fashion will \"exceed obligations\" put on people such that actions \"are warranted, but not strictly required.\"\nWith certain philosophical movements throughout history emphasizing various types of moral idealism, such as influences being a part of Christian ethics, Jewish ethics, and Platonist ethics, it relates to human decision making as differing alternatives get compared and contrasted. Advocates for ethical idealism, such as the philosopher Nicholas Rescher, have asserted that inherent mental concepts shared in terms of the human condition among multiple peoples have a real, tangible nature due to their influences turning logical thinking into action, particularly by stimulating peoples' sense of motivation. In contrast, skeptical philosophers, such as the philosopher Richard Rorty, have argued that the complex course of recorded history has shown that \"to do the right thing is largely a matter of luck\" and particularly is due to \"being born in a certain place and a certain time.\"\nDefinitions and general background\nA range of different philosophical movements throughout history have emphasized moral idealism, with this including the doctrine influencing Christian ethics, Jewish ethics, and Platonist ethics. This has occurred in the context of an underlying argument about morality in which, as one scholar has put it, certain thinkers have postulated \"an underlying sense of right and wrong that is common to all human beings at all times and places\". Ongoing debates on whether or not these kinds of inherent mental concepts truly exist have been called a \"great divide in contemporary philosophy\".\nA framework in the mind based on holding onto specifically defined ideals weighs them in the context of facing various consequences to holding such principles and/or values. An ideal placed under intellectual analysis become applied in practice via a group of specific goals relative to what has been learned over time about moral thinking. As noted by Austrian philosopher Norbert Paulo, following ideals in a doctrinaire fashion will \"exceed obligations\" put on people such that actions \"are warranted, but not strictly required.\"\nAmerican scholar Nicholas Rescher has stated that metaphysics comes into play when analyzing such a philosophical viewpoint about human thinking given that nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\", with this developing in terms of their special existence relative to the broader concept of ethical choice. He has described a worldview coming into focus via logical thinking based on moral idealism that he has defined in depth, remarking that \"it  rational to strive for the unattainable\" and that a \"practicality\" exists in \"seriously pursuing impossible dreams.\" He interpreted the human condition shared among multiple groups as tied together in a real, tangible fashion due to their mutual influences that've resulted from idealistic ethics, particularly by such ideas stimulating peoples' sense of motivation.\nWriting in his book Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals, Rescher specifically argued,\n\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, exist as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and  a stimulus to action.\"\nOther thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as human beings and similarly material-based entities. A prominent example of this philosophical take is the ancient Greek intellectual figure of Plato. To him, ideals represented self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through reason rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, whil",
    "Galaxy located in Bo\u00f6tes\nIC 4516 is a type E elliptical galaxy located in Bo\u00f6tes. Its redshift is 0.045618 which corresponds IC 4516 to be located 667 million light-years from Earth. The galaxy was discovered by Lewis Swift on June 2, 1898, which was his last discovery after spending half a century observing astronomical objects, starting with the observation of the Great Comet in 1843.\nFeatures\nIC 4516 is classified a radio galaxy, specially a Fanaroff-Riley type 2 (FR II).  It has an active nucleus and is the brightest member in the galaxy cluster, WHL J145423.5+162119.\nIC 4516 contains a strong radio source in its center called 3C 306. The radio source is identified to be stronger than 25 mJy on the Green Bank 4.85 GHz sky maps. Based on its infrared-radio flux ratio as well as infrared spectral indices and radio morphologies, it is classified to be a \"starburst\" or \"monster\".  Further results show that the rms scatter in logarithmic infrared-radio q is not more compared to \u03c3q = 0.16 for starburst galaxies which is selected at 4.85\u00a0GHz.\nMoreover, IC 4516 is one of the \u03b3-ray-emitting radio galaxies detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi), indicating it contributes to EGB  (diffuse unresolved extragalactic \u03b3-ray background) which is written by Mauro et al. and Hooper et al. This is suggested that IC 4516 is an AGN with a \"mis-aligned\" jet in with the direction of \u223c>20\u00b0 towards Earth. Its possible IC 4516 is a low-luminosity core-dominated radio galaxy that is expected to have a proportionally lower \u03b3-ray luminosity to the point it can't be detected individually by Fermi, based on the relation of core radio and its luminosity.\nA further study conducted in 2020 in search of Centaurus A-like features, finds there is statistical evidence of flux variability on 6-month time scales for seven of the 26 radio galaxies, among them is IC 4516, in which is calculated over the full energy range of 100 MeV \u2264 E \u2264 300 GeV. A variability index study was conducted via the method used by Nolan et al. 2012 which shows if the null hypothesis is correct, the variability index is correct, then it is distributed as \u03c72 with 19 degrees of freedom. This suggests evidence for variability index to be at the \u22653\u03c3 level.\nFrom the variability indices that is distributed as X\u00b2 functions with Ndof degrees of freedom, which one of the variability indices is greater than the 99% confidence limit of 18.48 and 72.44 for the (Ndof = 7) and 2 month (Ndof = 47) light curves, IC 4516 is found to be variable thus suggesting blazar-like behavior.\n",

    "Italian Alessandro Poerio-class scout cruiser\nGuglielmo Pepe was an Italian Alessandro Poerio-class scout cruiser. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1915, she served during World War I, participating in the Adriatic campaign, often supporting raids by Italian motor torpedo boats. She was reclassified as a destroyer in 1921 due to her light displacement. Like her sister ships, Alessandro Poerio and Cesare Rossarol, she was named after a famous Neapolitan light cavalryman who helped defend Venice from attacks by the Imperial Austrian Army during the revolutions in 1848.\nIn 1937, Fascist Italy sold the ship to the Nationalist faction in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Renamed Teruel, the ship subsequently served in the Spanish Navy until she was stricken in 1948.\nDesign\nGuglielmo Pepe was an Italian \"light scout cruiser\" (Italian:esploratore leggero) measuring 85\u00a0m (278\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) long and 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) in beam. She had three Yarrow three-drum water-tube boilers with water pipes, two groups of Belluzzo steam turbines rated at 24,000\u00a0hp (17,897\u00a0kW), and two three-blade propellers. Her fuel capacity of 325 tons gave her a range of 2,400 nautical miles (4,400\u00a0km; 2,800\u00a0mi) at 13 knots (24\u00a0km/h; 15\u00a0mph). She could launch torpedoes while maintaining a constant speed of over 30 knots (56\u00a0km/h; 35\u00a0mph). Her normal displacement was 891 tons standard, and her full-load displacement was 1,270 tons.\nPlans originally called for Guglielmo Pepe to have an armament of four 102/35\u00a0mm guns and eight 450-millimetre (17.7\u00a0in) torpedo tubes, but was revised during construction, and she entered service with six 102/35-millimetre guns and four 450-millimetre (17.7\u00a0in) torpedo tubes, and a minelaying capacity of 42 mines, making her armament equivalent to that of an Austro-Hungarian Novara-class scout cruiser. In 1916, two 76/40 mm Mod 16 RM guns were installed aboard her; they were removed in 1917 when two 40/39 mm guns replaced them. In 1918, she was refitted with 102/45 mm guns.\nConstruction and commissioning\nGuglielmo Pepe was laid down by Gio. Ansaldo & C. at Sestri Ponente, Italy, on 2\u00a0July\u00a01913. She was launched on 17\u00a0September\u00a01914 and commissioned on 20\u00a0August\u00a01915.\nService history\nRegia Marina\nWorld War I\n1915\u20131916\nWorld War I was raging when Guglielmo Pepe entered service in August\u00a01915. On 30\u00a0December\u00a01915 she became part of the 2nd Scouting Group of the 4th Naval Division along with her sister ships Alessandro Poerio and Cesare Rossarol, based at Venice.\nOn 3\u00a0May\u00a01916, Guglielmo Pepe and Cesare Rossarol got underway with the destroyers Francesco Nullo and Giuseppe Missori to provide distant support to the destroyers Fuciliere and Zeffiro as they laid a minefield in the Adriatic Sea off \u0160ibenik (known to the Italians as Sebenico) on the coast of Austria-Hungary. Off Punta Maestra, the Italian formation sighted four Austro-Hungarian Navy Husz\u00e1r-class destroyers and six Austro-Hungarian torpedo boats and steered to attack them. While the Austro-Hungarian ships headed toward the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola with the Italians in pursuit, three Austro-Hungarian seaplanes attacked the Italian ships. The Italians repelled the attack, but at 15:50, after an Austro-Hungarian cruiser and two additional Austro-Hungarian torpedo boats departed Pola to support the Austro-Hungarian ships, the Italian force gave up the chase and withdrew. Meanwhile, Fuciliere and Zeffiro succeeded in laying the minefield during the night of 3\u20134 May 1916.\nGuglielmo Pepe and Cesare Rossarol laid a minefield off Ancona, Italy, on 11\u00a0May\u00a01916.\nEscorted as far as the Austro-Hungarian defensive barrage by Guglielmo Pepe and Cesare Rossarol and supported by the destroyers Alpino and Fuciliere and the coastal torpedo boats 40 PN and 46 OS, the destroyer Zeffiro, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate captain) Costanzo Ciano and with Lieutenant Nazario Sauro, an Italian irredentist, aboard as pilot, entered the port of Pore\u010d on the western side of Istria, a peninsula on Austria-Hungary's coast, at dawn on 12\u00a0June\u00a01916. A group of men from Zeffiro, including Sauro, captured a gendarme who showed them the location of an aircraft hangar. In the meantime, Alpino, Fuciliere, 40 PN, and 46 OS had joined Zeffiro, and at 04:50 they began a bombardment which lasted about 20 minutes. The hangar suffered damage from hits by 76-millimetre (3\u00a0in) shells from the Italian ships. Austro-Hungarian coastal artillery batteries returned fire,  and then 10 Austro-Hungarian seaplanes attacked the Italian ships. Allied aircraft came to the defense of the Italians, resulting in a dogfight in which Austro-Hungarian seaplanes collided with two Italian and one French aircraft. All the Italian ships returned to base, although they suffered damage and a number of casualties, including four men killed in action.\nOn 1\u20132 November 1916, Guglielmo Pepe, Alessandro Poerio, Francesco Nullo, and Giuseppe Missori made ready to provide poss",
    "Doric temple in Dublin, Ireland\nThe Printing House is a classical Palladian style temple building that was constructed within the campus of Trinity College Dublin around 1734 under the tenure of provost Richard Baldwin.\nThe building housed the Dublin University Press from its opening until 1976.\nHistory\nThe building was likely executed by Richard Castle as his first solo commission although it may have originally been designed by Castle or Edward Lovett Pearce prior to his death in 1733.\nThe builder is recorded as John Plummer, while other craftsmen included Moses Darley as stonecutter and Thomas Gilbert who was involved in procuring stone. Darley, Gilbert and Castle had all previously worked for Lovett Pearce on the nearby Parliament House, the first Palladian building of scale in Dublin.\nThe building is faced in rusticated imported Portland stone with freestanding pillars while more modest local calp limestone is used for the sides of the building with the chimneys and bases of the pillars in more sturdy Irish granite.\nThe building would have originally closed a pleached lime tree-lined avenue leading from the Thomas Burgh designed Anatomy House which was constructed circa 20 years prior but has since been demolished. It would have originally been to the rear of The Rubrics and Rotten Row.\nJohn Sterne, Bishop of Clogher donated \u00a31,000 towards the construction of the building and a plaque with a Latin dedication is still inscribed over the front door.\nThe building would have been notable for being one of the earliest Palladian style buildings in Dublin using a combination of Portland stone in the English Georgian tradition of the period as well as local materials from the Dublin region.\nOther college works\nCastle was also engaged to later design a campanile (belfry) for the campus which was constructed around 1746 but was ultimately demolished around 1790 as it was deemed structurally unsound. He also designed a dining hall around 1745 which was replaced around 1765 and presented designs for an entirely new west front and front square for the college which have since been lost.\nBook of Kells\nIn 2023, it was announced that the building would host the Book of Kells, during refurbishment works which are to be carried out on the Old Library building within the campus.\nSee also\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Printing House, Trinity College, Dublin.\nSt Paul's, Covent Garden\n",

    "Spanish football manager\nJos\u00e9 V\u00edctor Rodr\u00edguez de Miguel (10 February 1945 \u2013 3 March 2016) was a Spanish football manager, taking charge over the likes of Real Murcia, Real Oviedo, and Granada CF. Throughout his long managerial career, he achieved eight promotions with different teams.\nBiography\nBorn on 10 February 1945 in Palencia, Castile and Le\u00f3n, Rodr\u00edguez could not be a footballer due to a heart disease for which he underwent surgery on several occasions, and thus, in the 1964\u201365 season, at the age of just 19, he began his career as a coach in the ranks of Real Murcia. From then on he went through all the ranks of the Grana team, becoming the regional youth coach with Murcia at the time when players from Murcia, Albacete, and Alicante were called up under that flag, and under his leadership, a methodical and innovative coach at that time, he guided the Murcia youth team to several Spanish championships in its category in the early 1970s. He then became an assistant coach of Real Murcia, before finally taking charge over the first team, which he promoted to the First Division in both 1976 and 1980.\nIn the late 1960s, Rodr\u00edguez guided Cartagena FC from Preferente to the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n with a team that became known by the press of the time as the S\u00faperCartagena, having only lost one game that season. He coached the Cartagena team again in the 1982\u201383 and 1983\u201384 seasons, now in the Second Division.\nRodr\u00edguez also coached Albacete (1978\u201379), Oviedo (1981\u201382), UD Melilla (1887\u201388), CF Gand\u00eda (1988\u201390), H\u00e9rcules CF (1990\u201391), Yeclano CF (1991\u201393, 1995\u201398, and 2003\u201304), Granada CF (1994\u201395 and 2006\u201307), Elche CF, and Mar Menor FC, some of them at different stages. He was also on the verge of a promotion with Yeclano in the 1990s.\nRodr\u00edguez was also the sports director of numerous clubs and was famous for his detailed reports on footballers when there was no other means than a typewriter. He had family ties with Cartagena where his brother lived, and he used to visit the Cartagonova stadium from time to time and boasted that he had the best archive of videos of football teams and players in his house in Pinar de Campoverde.\nDeath\nIn June 2011, Rodr\u00edguez was admitted to the Torrevieja Hospital as a result of a heart problem with pulmonary complications.\nRodr\u00edguez died on 3 March 2016, at the age of 71, having been admitted to a hospital several times for serious heart problems. Since 11 February 2016, the headquarters of the Football Federation in Murcia has a classroom named after him.\n",
    "Municipal building in Grays, Essex, England\nThurrock Town Hall is a newest part of municipal complex in New Road in Grays, Essex, a town in England. The complex accommodates the offices and meeting place of Thurrock Council.\nHistory\nThe 1992 extension (left) and 1986 building (right)\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with chemical manufacturing, a local board of health was established in Grays in 1886. The board was succeeded by Grays Thurrock Urban District Council in 1894, and council offices were established at No. 53 High Street. After the urban districts of Grays Thurrock, Purfleet and Tilbury, as well as the Orsett Rural District were amalgamated to form Thurrock Urban District Council in 1936, the enlarged council established its offices in a house, previously known as \"Farley\", in Whitehall Lane in Grays. This remained the meeting place for Thurrock Council after it was formed in 1974.\nHowever, in the early 1980s, in the context of the increased responsibilities of local authorities, council leaders decided that they needed more substantial facilities. The oldest part of the new complex was the eastern section, on the corner with Derby Road. It was designed in the modern style, built in red brick and opened as Thurrock Council Offices in 1986. This building later became known as Council Offices Building 1 ('CO1'). The design of the three-storey building involved an asymmetrical main frontage of 11 bays facing onto New Road. The eighth bay contained a full-height plate-glass wall, which was projected forward and surmounted by a semi-circular stone clad roof. The upper floors were slightly canted forward and fenestrated by a series of tall bi-partite and tri-partite casement windows. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber, the committee rooms and the offices themselves.\nThe complex was extended to the west in a similar style in 1992. This building later became known as Council Offices Building 2 ('CO2'). Again, the first and second floors were slightly canted forward and fenestrated by a series of tall tri-partite casement windows. However, there was an additional floor which was fully clad in plate glass. Internally, the new block including a reception area and additional offices.\nIn October 2019, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, visited the council offices to sign a book of condolence commemorating 39 Vietnamese people who had died in the trailer of a refrigerator lorry.\nBy the 2020s, the offices needed refurbishment.  The council decided to vacate the 1986 building, to refurbish the 1992 extension, and to erect an additional block even further to the west on the corner of the New Road and the High Street, facing St Peter & St Paul's Church. The site was occupied by four shops which were demolished. The new block was designed by LSI Architects, built in buff brick at a cost of \u00a310 million and was completed in 2022. This building was known during the development phase as Council Offices Building 3 ('CO3'). The design of the new block involved an asymmetrical main frontage in two sections facing onto the High Street. Both sections were jettied out over the pavement with the left-hand section supported by piers. Internally, it incorporated a new reception area, committee rooms, a council chamber, a registry office, a cafe, and new offices.\nFollowing its completion, the council voted to rename new building \"Thurrock Town Hall\". The vacated 1986 building was marketed for sale on August 2023. The council indicated that it was suitable for conversion, or for redevelopment to allow new housing to be erected on that site.\n",
    "An mpisikidy practices sikidy in 1900\nSikidy is a form of algebraic geomancy practiced by Malagasy peoples in Madagascar. It involves algorithmic operations performed on random data generated from tree seeds, which are ritually arranged in a tableau called a toetry and divinely interpreted after being mathematically operated on. Columns of seeds, designated \"slaves\" or \"princes\" belonging to respective \"lands\" for each, interact symbolically to express vintana ('fate') in the interpretation of the diviner. The diviner also prescribes solutions to problems and ways to avoid fated misfortune, often involving a sacrifice. \nThe centuries-old practice derives from Islamic influence brought to the island by pre-colonial Arab traders. The sikidy is consulted for a range of divinatory questions pertaining to fate and the future, including identifying sources of and rectifying misfortune, reading the fate of newborns, and planning annual migrations. The mathematics of sikidy include the concepts of Boolean algebra, symbolic logic and parity.\nHistory\nAn mpisikidy practices sikidy in 1895\nThe practice is several centuries old, and is influenced by Arab geomantic traditions of Arab Muslim traders on the island. Stephen Ellis and Solofo Randrianja describe sikidy as \"probably one of the oldest components of Malagasy culture\", writing that it most likely the product of an indigenous divinatory art later influenced by Islamic practice. Umar H. D. Danfulani writes that the integration of Arabic divination into indigenous divination is \"clearly demonstrated\" in Madagascar, where the Arabic astrological system was adapted to the indigenous agricultural system and meshed with Malagasy lunar months by \"adapting indigenous months, volana, to the astrological months, vintana\". Danfulani also describes the concepts in sikidy of \"houses\" (lands) and \"kings in their houses\" as retained from medieval Arabic astrology.\nMost writers link the practice to the \"sea-going trade involving the southwest coast of India, the Persian Gulf, and the east coast of Africa in the 9th or 10th century C.E.\" Though the etymology of sikidy is unknown, it has been posited that the word derives from the Arabic sichr ('incantation' or 'charm'). Sikidy was of central importance to pre-Christian Malagasy religion, with one practitioner quoted in 1892 as calling sikidy \"the Bible of our ancestors\". A missionary report from 1616 describes one form of sikidy using tree seeds, and another using fingered markings in the sand. The early colonial French governor of Madagascar \u00c9tienne de Flacourt documented sikidy in the mid-17th century:\nMatatane country in southeastern Madagascar  where the Antemoro  live was a center of astrological study as early as the fourteenth century . This area was also the site of early Arab settlements, although strict Islamic observances were lost centuries ago . Historical evidence shows that Antemoro diviners, bearers of the astrological system, infiltrated nearly all the ancient kingdoms of Madagascar beginning in the sixteenth century.  Today, although many persons claim to be ombiasy , only the Antemoro diviners are considered true professionals. The area is still a famous place of learning where specialists go for training and then return to their home communities with a certain body of knowledge. Now we can better understand the degree of similarity of divination forms found throughout Madagascar. For centuries Matitanana has remained a training center for diviners who have migrated widely, usually attaining important positions in their home communities and with various royal families.\u2014\u200a\u00c9tienne de Flacourt, l'Histoire de la Grande Isle MadagascarThe \"infliltration\" of Antemoro diviners in Malagasy kingdoms, and Matitanana role as a place for astrological and divinatory learning, help to explain the relative uniformity of sikidy across Madagascar.\nOrigin myths\n15th century Arabic classification of the geomantic figuresMythic tradition relating to the origin of sikidy \"links  both to the return by walking on water of Arab ancestors who had intermarried with Malagasy but then left, and to the names of the days of the week\" and holds that the art was supernaturally communicated to the ancestors, with Zanahary (the supreme deity of Malagasy religion) giving it to Ranakandriana, who then gave it to a line of diviners (Ranakandriana to Ramanitralanana to Rabibi-andrano to Andriambavi-maitso (who was a woman) to Andriam-bavi-nosy), the last of whom terminated the monopoly by giving it to the people, declaring: \"Behold, I give you the sikidy, of which you may inquire what offerings you should present in order to obtain blessings; and what expiation you should make so as to avert evils, when any are ill or under apprehension of some future calamity\".\nA mythic anecdote of Ranakandriana says that two men observed him one day playing in the sand. In fact he was practicing a form of sikidy worked in sand called sikidy alanana. The two men sei",

He was awarded the title \"Sain Noyon\" by the 4th Dalai Lama because of his great contribution to the Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia.\nIn order to diminish the predominant influence of the T\u00fcsheet Khans in Khalkha, in 1725, the Yongzheng Emperor of Qing created Sain Noyon Aimag, carved out of 19 khoshuu (sub-districts) in western T\u00fcsheet Khan Aimag.  During Qing dynasty, the title of Sain Noyon rulers was khoshoi chin van (\u0445\u043e\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0438\u043d \u0432\u0430\u043d), lower than khan. However, their influence was no less than that of three Khalka khans. Since 1728, each aimag was governed by aimag congress chigulgan (\u0447\u0443\u0443\u043b\u0433\u0430\u043d) comprising the lords of the khoshuns; the chigulgan daruga (\u0447\u0443\u0443\u043b\u0433\u0430\u043d \u0434\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430 - official presiding the congress) was appointed from the khoshun lords by the Qing government. the congress of Sain Noyon aimag was called the \"Tsetserlegiin chuulgan\" (\u0426\u044d\u0446\u044d\u0440\u043b\u044d\u0433\u0438\u0439\u043d \u0447\u0443\u0443\u043b\u0433\u0430\u043d, \u9f4a\u9f4a\u723e\u91cc\u514b\u76df), which was held every three years in Tsetserleg.\nAfter Mongolian independence from the Qing China in 1911, the ruler of Sain Noyon was given the title of \"Khan\" by the order of Bogd Khan, since then, the aimag was renamed \"Sain Noyon Khan\". In 1923, following the Mongolian Revolution of 1921, the Sain Noyon Khan aimag was renamed Tsetserleg Mandal uulyn aimag (\u0426\u044d\u0446\u044d\u0440\u043b\u044d\u0433 \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0443\u0443\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u0433), which named after Tsetserleg.

    "American naval officer (1881\u20131963)\nWilliam Alexander Ancrum (July 8, 1881 \u2013 March 11, 1963) was a captain in the United States Navy who fought during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in five separate wars during his career. He held numerous commands in the Navy in various capacities. He served directly with Admiral Sims and General Pershing. He was knighted by two separate European heads of state for his service.\nEarly life\nWilliam Alexander Ancrum III, of Camden, South Carolina, was born at the home of his maternal grandparents (\"Rossdhu\") in Abbeville, SC, on July 8, 1881, the oldest son of Planter and Civil War Veteran William Alexander Ancrum II and Anna Susan Calhoun. His grandfather, John Alfred Calhoun, a signer of the Ordinance of Secession, was the nephew of United States Vice President John C. Calhoun. Young Ancrum was raised on both Redbank Plantation (owned by the Ancrums since the mid-18th century) and the family's residence on Fair Street that was built as a summer residence by his paternal great-grandfather, William Ancrum Jr. of Charleston in the late 1700s. The latter was inspired by the Caribbean Georgian architecture he so admired in Jamaica while returning home to Charleston from Eton College.\nOf French Huguenot and Scottish descent, Ancrum came from a Charleston family that settled in Camden to better cultivate the rich swamps of the Wateree and avoid malaria. He was educated in the local Camden schools but maintained his connections to Charleston, eventually later becoming a member of the St. Cecilia Society. A bright and disciplined young man, after completing school Ancrum was one of few to successfully secure a spot at the United States Naval Academy.\nCareer\nFollowing his graduation from the Naval Academy in February 1903, he embarked on his career with an initial assignment to USS Wisconsin, stationed at the Bremerton, Washington, Navy Yard, bound for Chefoo, China. Subsequently, he was transferred to USS Oregon, part of the Asiatic Fleet. After completing over two years of service on USS Oregon, he transitioned to the destroyer Chauncey, tasked with patrolling the Western Philippines during the Russo-Japanese War and participating in operations against the Moros. He then joined USS Minnesota upon her commissioning on March 9, 1907, and served aboard during her world cruise alongside fifteen other battleships.\"\nHis subsequent assignments led him to the Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts, where he briefly served aboard the newly commissioned USS Flusser on October 28, 1909. On December 29, 1909, he assumed the role of an assistant to the Engineer Officer at the Navy Yard, Norfolk, Virginia, and also served as a member of the Court of Inquiry during that tour of duty. He undertook temporary ordnance duty on USS Kearsarge and USS Kentucky at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in October 1911, and upon detachment from the Norfolk Navy Yard on December 16, 1912, he assumed command of USS Warrington, commanding the vessel for six months.\nIn May 1913, he took command of USS Jarvis, followed by commanding USS Flusser and the First Division, Torpedo Flotilla, from September 5, 1913, to July 20, 1915. During this period, his division escorted General Funston's Army to Vera Cruz, Mexico, and later transported American refugees from Tampico to Galveston. From 1915 to 1917, he had duty at the Naval Training Station, Newport, Rhode Island, with additional duty as the Assistant Umpire for Navy Department Strategic Maneuver No. 2, aboard USS Brooklyn, and attended a course at the Naval War College.\nOn April 6, 1917, he reported to USS Birmingham briefly, following which he was transferred to the gunboat Sacramento for a short period of duty as Aide to Commander Squadron TWO, Patrol Force, on coastal patrol from Cape Cod to Barnegat. On August 1, 1917, he reached London, England, on orders to the staff of Admiral Sims, and in July 1918, he conducted special additional duty at Southampton, investigating conditions aboard several small steamers. His exemplary service earned him a Special Letter of Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy.William A. Ancrum as aide to Admiral Sims at the very beginning of World War OneUpon his return to the United States from London, he was ordered to report to Commander Cruiser-Transport Force, at Hoboken, New Jersey. There, he instructed merchant captains for a month, who were to be commissioned in the Navy for command of certain vessels assigned the task of bringing troops home from France. He then proceeded to the Boston Navy Yard to command USS Sigourney, which was completing a major overhaul, and assumed command of that vessel, with additional duty in command of Destroyer Division SIX.\nAbout a year later, that division was decommissioned, and all personnel were transferred to Destroyer Division TWENTY-SIX, USS Alden flagship. In February 1920, part of that division left Philadelphia for Constantinople and the Adriatic. Their duty completed a year later, they joine",
    "First Apostolic Prefect of Indonesia\nJacobus Nelissen is a Catholic priest born in the Netherlands who became the first Apostolic Prefect of Batavia leading the local Church from the year 1808 until 1817.\nBiography\nJacobus Nelissen was born in Mill in the Netherlands on October 3, 1752. In 1805, Nelissen left for the Dutch Cape Colony as a missionary, together with Joannes Lansink and Lambertus Prinsen. Their departure was aimed at establishing an apostolic prefecture at the Cape of Good Hope and providing pastoral care to the Dutch people there. They sailed on a Prussian ship and arrived in South Africa on 4 October 1805. After the occupation of the colony by the British Empire on January 18, 1806, all Dutch residents were expelled, including these three missionaries. Lansink then died on March 8, 1806.\nOn May 8, 1807, the leadership of the Catholic church in Rome received Napoleon's approval to establish the Apostolic Prefecture of the Dutch East Indies. Nelissen and Prinsen left for the Dutch East Indies on July 22, 1807, after receiving approval in the form of a decree from Lodewijk. Nelissen was appointed as Apostolic Prefect of Batavia by decision of Propaganda Fide on 8 May 1807. On July 22, 1807, Mgr. Nelissen departed from Texel to the Dutch East Indies as missionary along with Mgr. Lambertus Prinsen. The goal was to establish an Apostolic Prefecture in Batavia. Mgr. Nelissen arrived in Batavia and was installed as the first Prefect Apostolic of Batavia on April 4, 1808. He began working with pioneering the establishment of the first Catholic Church named St. Lucovicus in Senen.\nThe first public eucharist celebration in Batavia was held at the home of Doctor FCH Assmuss who served as Head of the Health Service on April 10, 1808. In 1809, Prinsen left for Semarang to use several Protestant churches as places of worship. This continued until 1824.\nNelissen passed away in Batavia, Hindia Belanda, on December 6, 1817, at the age of 65 years after contracting tuberculosis .

For the French politician (1878\u20131961), see Antoine Borrel.\nAntoine Borel (December 29, 1840 \u2013 March 26, 1915) was a banker for the eponymous Borel & Co., headquartered in San Francisco, California. He was born in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland and emigrated to the United States in 1862, where he joined his brother's bank and served as a Swiss consul and director for several companies, including the Spring Valley Water Company, the California Street Cable Company, and the Bankers' Investment Company. He died following an operation in Switzerland, to where he had returned in July 1914 for health issues.\nEarly life\nBorel was born in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland, to a wealthy merchant family, and completed his education in Switzerland and Germany. He emigrated to San Francisco, arriving in 1862, following his brother Alfred, who had arrived in 1855.:\u200a81\u200a\nCareer\nCalifornia Street Cable Railroad Company stock certificate #1, showing Borel owned 1,000 shares\nAlfred Borel founded Borel & Co. in 1852; Antoine joined him in 1862, and the business was turned over to Antoine when Alfred returned to Europe in 1898.:\u200a81\u200a:\u200a57\u201359\u200a Antoine was appointed the vice-consul of Switzerland to California and Nevada when he was 21, ascending to consul-general in 1885, a position he held until 1913. During this period, Antoine also served on the board of several companies, including the Spring Valley Water Company, the California Street Cable Company, the Wells Fargo Express Company, and the Bank of California Company.\nBorel was a prominent philanthropist in San Mateo, California, where he had established a summer home in 1874 on the advice of their family's doctors. After a fire in 1883 which destroyed the city's public library, Borel donated land for a new library building, which subsequently was destroyed in another fire in 1887.:\u200a86\u201387\u200a Borel also built a chapel on the edge of his property, later known as Geneva or Grace Chapel, in 1892; it later was turned over to Saint Matthews Episcopal Church in 1902, and then to the Hillbarn Theatre, a community theater organization, in 1937.:\u200a117\u200a\nPersonal life and legacy\nAntoine Borel and his wife, Grace (n\u00e9e Canitrot, 1849\u20131923), were married in 1871 and had seven children, six of which were living at the time of his death: five daughters and one son.\nBorel's children and :\nChonita S. \"Nita\" Borel (1872\u20131958)\nSophie Grace Borel (1874\u20131953) , \nGrace Eleanor Borel (1876\u20131958) \nAlice Borel (1877\u20131936) \nAntoine Alfred Borel, Jr. (1879\u20131958) \nAlfred August Borel (1880\u20131884)\nGuadalupe Henriette \"Lupita\" Borel (1882\u20131949)\nBorel died on March 26, 1915, in Lausanne, Switzerland, following an intestinal operation.

A. Pioche,:\u200a272\u200a who also was a prominent San Francisco banker. That site was west of El Camino Real near present-day SR\u00a092 in San Mateo; Antoine Borel used it as his summer residence. After his death, it became the year-round home for the Borel family, including San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Aylett R. Cotton Jr., son of Aylett R. Cotton; the younger Cotton had married two of Borel's daughters. Portions of the estate were sold off in the 1920s, forming new residential subdivisions south of the original city limits.:\u200a160\u200a:\u200a251\u200a The center section of the estate was designated for the construction of SR\u00a092 in 1961, and the Borel family won settlements totaling more than US$1\u00a0million, and the family decided to develop the remaining land, dividing it between the Bovets, who took the eastern portion, and the Cottons, who took the western. A proposal to retain the remaining buildings and gardens as a park was dismissed and they were removed relatively quickly.:\u200a239\u2013240\u200a\nSR\u00a092 runs partially along the valley formed by Borel Creek, which drains into Seal Slough. The creek was channelized and covered east of Alameda de las Pulgas after the land was acquired for the new freeway. It resurfaces east of the railroad tracks currently used by Caltrain.\nThe mansion on the Homestead site was started in 1868 by Sidney V. Pringle, then sold to Pioche, who remodeled it before it was acquired by Borel with the estate. It was destroyed in a fire on June 8, 1962;:\u200a140\u200a at that time, it already had been scheduled for demolition.

    "Anarchist military government in China\nThe Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian (Chinese: \u95a9\u5357\u8b77\u6cd5\u5340; pinyin: M\u01d0nn\u00e1n h\u00f9f\u01ce q\u016b) was a de facto autonomous region of Republic of China established by the \"Guangdong Army to assist Fujian\" (Chinese: \u63f4\u95a9\u7cb5\u8ecd; pinyin: Yu\u00e1nm\u01d0n yu\u00e8j\u016bn) led by General Chen Jiongming. The regional administration controlled 26 counties of southern and western Fujian, with Zhangzhou as its capital, where it implemented some policies with anarchist characteristics.\nThe regional administration was established during the Constitutional Protection Movement, when Chen's forces fought to defeat the Northern warlords of the Anhui and Zhili cliques, and reassert constitutionalism in southern China. After moving into Fujian and fighting against the northern forces of Li Houji\u00a0, Chen's Guangdong Army established control over the southern part of the region. Zhangzhou subsequently became a centre of the New Culture Movement, which established newspapers to propagate its ideas of \"liberty\", equality\", \"fraternity\" and \"mutual aid\". Anarchists and communists were also attracted to the region, where under Chen's protection, they were able to agitate and organize with full freedom of speech and freedom of association. \nIn the capital of Zhangzhou, the city's defensive walls were demolished in order to make way for carriageways and public parks. The administration also established a comprehensive education system, sending several students to France as part of the work-study program. The reforms carried out were extensive and received popular support, as they improved societal infrastructure and welfare, while also keeping taxes relatively low. The reforms attracted the attention of the Russian Soviet Republic, which dispatched a representative to establish relations with the regional administration. This also drew the attention of American and British intelligence, which were worried by the rise of \"Bolshevism\" in the region.\nWith the outbreak of the Guangdong\u2013Guangxi War, the majority of Chen's Guangdong Army left the region in order to fight against the Guangxi clique and retake control of Guangdong. For a few months, a small garrison was left behind in Southern Fujian, which was eventually handed back over to the forces of Li Houji.\nHistory\nCapture of Southern Fujian\nBy 1917, northern warlords had seized control of the Beiyang government. Revolutionaries in southern China responded by launching the Constitutional Protection Movement, calling for the restoration of the constitutional order. In October 1917, Chen Jiongming was appointed as commander-in-chief of the Guangdong Army\u00a0, which was already planning a military expedition against the government.\nThe warlords of the Anhui and Zhili cliques sent their forces south to pacify the rebellion in Guangdong, acting with the assistance of Fujian's military governor Li Houji\u00a0. Chen responded by ordering the Guangdong Army to \"assist Fujian\" (Chinese: \u63f4\u95a9\u7cb5\u8ecd; pinyin: Yu\u00e1nm\u01d0n yu\u00e8j\u016bn) and bring it under the rule of the Constitutional Protection Junta. They transferred to Shantou, where Chen began recruiting thousands of people into his army. He established an arsenal in Shanwei, laid out an extensive military logistics network by building new roads and supply stations, and organised local militia to counter banditry and carry out guerrilla warfare against invading forces. He did this with little help from Guangdong's military governor Mo Rongxin, who denied him necessary funding, hoping to limit his growing influence.\nLi went ahead with his plans to attack Guangdong, recruiting thousands of people from Northern Fujian into his own army. On May 1918, Li attacked Guangdong, but faced heavy resistance from Chen's Guangdong Army and guerrilla militias. In August, Chen's forces mounted a counteroffensive and quickly advanced into Fujian. By the end of the month, they had captured the province's southern capital of Zhangzhou, which Chen established as his base of operations, while Li's army held onto its territory in Xiamen. In November 1918, the two sides arranged a brief armistice. Although Li received reinforcements from the north, the looting and arbitrary attacks carried out by the northern soldiers against the local population alienated the people of Fujian, who began cooperating with the Guangdong Army. By the end of 1918, Chen's numerically inferior forces had captured more than half of Fujian province.\nNew Culture Movement\nWith a new base area in Minnan, Chen Jiongming began putting his ideas for reform into practice, building strong civilian institutions while maintaining his military strength. By this time, members of the New Culture Movement had begun calling for far-reaching modernizing reforms, including democratization, humanitarianism, scientific progress and mutual assistance. Chen's former teacher Zhu Zhixin invited members of the New Culture Movement to Zhangzhou, in order to carry out reforms, educate the populace and transform southern Fujia",
    "10th episode of the 1st season of Sh\u014dgun\n\"A Dream of a Dream\" (Japanese: \u5922\u306e\u4e2d\u306e\u5922, Hepburn: Yume no Naka no Yume) is the tenth episode of the American historical drama television series Sh\u014dgun, based on the novel by James Clavell. The episode was written by Maegan Houang and Emily Yoshida, and directed by Frederick E. O. Toye. It was released on Hulu on April 23, 2024, and it also aired on FX on the same day.\nThe series is set in 1600, and follows three characters. John Blackthorne, a risk-taking English sailor who ends up shipwrecked in Japan, a land whose unfamiliar culture will ultimately redefine him; Lord Toranaga, a shrewd, powerful daimyo, at odds with his own dangerous, political rivals; and Lady Mariko, a woman with invaluable skills but dishonorable family ties, who must prove her value and allegiance. In the episode, Toranaga and Blackthorne face an uncertain future as they prepare for the incoming war. \nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.625 million household viewers and gained a 0.09 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349. The episode received critical acclaim, who praised the episode as a satisfying conclusion to the storylines, while also highlighting the performances, visuals and writing as strong points.\nOriginally conceived as a limited series, it was reported in May 2024 that two more seasons were in early development.\nPlot\nBlackthorne mourns over Mariko's body, while Yabushige privately asks for forgiveness for his role in her death. After her funeral, the Council unanimously votes to declare war on Toranaga, although they do not believe Ishido's claims that Toranaga orchestrated the attack. \nBlackthorne leaves Osaka with Yabushige and Toranaga's consorts, having learned from Alvito that Mariko persuaded the Church to spare his life. Upon arriving in Ajiro, they discover that the Erasmus has been burned and Yabushige is arrested while Toranaga's men ruthlessly hunt for suspected traitors, as Omi has correctly deduced he was responsible. Yabushige confesses to having aided Ishido, so Toranaga revokes him from his lands and orders him to commit seppuku the following day, agreeing to become his second. \nBlackthorne reunites with Fuji who informs him that she plans to become a nun, effectively relieved from her duties as his consort. The next day, Blackthorne meets with Toranaga, with Muraji acting as his translator, revealed to be Toranaga's spy. Blackthorne wants Toranaga to spare Ajiro, and reveals that he is aware that Mariko was responsible for destroying the Erasmus as it would ensure his life would be spared. Despite Blackthorne promising to not pursue retaliation against the church, Toranaga refuses. Blackthorne threatens to commit seppuku, but Toranaga stops him and orders the construction of a fleet of ships. \nToranaga later meets with Yabushige before he commits seppuku. Toranaga confirms he was responsible for destroying the Erasmus to prevent Blackthorne from leaving, and that Mariko's death helped convince Ochiba to withdraw her support from Ishido ahead of the future Battle of Sekigahara. Despite Yabushige's insistence, Toranaga does not open up about his complete plan. Yabushige then commits seppuku by stabbing himself in the stomach, after which Toranaga beheads him with his sword. Accompanied by Fuji on a boat, Blackthorne convinces her in throwing her family's ashes in the sea, while he throws Mariko's cross as well. With the help of Buntaro and the villagers, Blackthorne begins efforts to salvage the Erasmus, managing to lift it up a bit from the sea. Blackthorne then exchanges a silent look with Toranaga in the distance, before leaving the scene. \nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn March 2024, Hulu confirmed that the tenth episode of the series would be titled \"A Dream of a Dream\", and was to be written by Maegan Houang and Emily Yoshida, and directed by Frederick E. O. Toye. It was Houang's second writing credit, Yoshida's second writing credit, and Toye's fourth directing credit.\nWriting\nOn opening the episode with a dream-like scene featuring an older Blackthorne, Justin Marks explained, \"we initially frame the story as if it were the recollection of an old man looking back on his life with regret in some way, only to find that what we were really seeing was the dream of a young man looking forward with regret to the life that he could possibly have.\"\nToranaga revealing his real plan was slightly different from the novel. While the series has him reveal part of it to Yabushige, only the reader is told about this in the novel. Marks felt that it was important for Yabushige to know, as they knew they were \"sending Yabushige into oblivion.\" Through this ending, Toranaga would be involved in the Tokugawa shogunate and start the creation of the Edo period, which would last until 1868.:\u200a14:55\u201317:16\u200a Hiroyuki Sanada considered this \"kind of a happy ending\", as the viewer would know what Toranaga creates by doing research. He said, \"That's Toranaga",
    "Lifeboat station in Scotland\nStromness Lifeboat Station is located in the harbour town of Stromness, the second largest town of Mainland, Orkney, in the isles of Orkney, Scotland.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1867.\nSince 1998, the station has operated a Severn-class All-weather lifeboat, 17-16 Violet, Dorothy and Kathleen (ON 1236).\nHistory\nOn 1 January 1866, the Albion was wrecked on Graemsay, one of the Orkney Islands island. Fortunately 90 people survived, but 10 people died. Following this event, a request was made to the RNLI to open a lifeboat station in the area, and after a visit by their Inspector of Lifeboats, this was agreed. At the time, Stromness would be the most northerly of all the RNLI stations.\nA boathouse was constructed at The Ness by Robertson & Smith, costing \u00a3144-19s-6d,  An order for a 33-foot 10-oared self-righting lifeboat at \u00a3280 was placed with Forrestt of Limehouse, London, and a launch-carriage cost a further \u00a398-10s-0d. Transported to Stromness free of charge by the 'Aberdeen Steam Navigation company', and 'Edinburgh, Leith and Clyde Shipping company'. The boat arrived in Stromness in the summer of 1867. The lifeboat was provided out of a gift from Bradford manufacturer and philanthropist Titus Salt, and was duly named Saltaire after his model village near Shipley in Yorkshire.\nThe Ness and former lifeboat house\nAn RNLI inspection in 1890 proved that The Ness was a difficult location to launch the boat. At a practice launch into a gale, it took over an hour to get the boat afloat. Whilst conditions still weren't perfect at Stromness, it was recommended that the boat be relocated to Stromness harbour and remain afloat. A new 42-foot 12-oared Self-righting lifeboat was ordered from McAlister of Dumbarton, funded by the Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds (Ashton Order) Friendly Society, and named Good Shepherd at a ceremony in Greenock on 16 May 1891. The boat arrived in Stromness on 15 June 1891.\nWork began in 1900 on the construction of a new boathouse with roller slipway at Stromness harbour. Costing \u00a31250, the boathouse was completed in 1902.\nRNLI trials of motor-powered lifeboats began in the early 1900s, using modified Pulling and Sailing lifeboats (lifeboats with oars and sails). In 1907, the RNLI placed an order with Thames Ironworks for four new purpose-built motor-powered lifeboats. The first of these was the \u00a32,995 42-foot self-righting John A. Hay (ON 591), with a 30\u00a0hp petrol engine, providing 6.5 knots, funded from the legacy of Mr John Alexander Hay of Cheltenham. Setting out from London Docks on 15 April 1909, along with a similar boat for Stromsay, she covered the 768 in 15 days, arriving in Stromness on 30 April.\nOn 15 June 1916, the HMS Hampshire struck a mine off Marwick Head, just 12 north of Stromness, and sank with the loss of 737 lives, including that of Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener. There were only 12 survivors. There is speculation whether it would have made any difference given the conditions, but the lifeboat was never called out.\nStromness 1926 Boathouse and slipway\nMelville, Dundas and Whitsun, of Glasgow started construction of a replacement boathouse and roller-slipway in 1925, on the site of the previous boathouse. Costing \u00a310,660, it was completed in 1926. However, when a new lifeboat was due for Stromness two years later, it was proposed that they receive a 60-foot Barnett-class lifeboat, which would need to be kept afloat due to the size.\nHonorary Secretary at Stromness, Mr George Thompson, travelled to London to meet RNLI 'Naval Architect' James Rennie Barnett, and the result was the 51-foot Barnett (Stromness-class) lifeboat, suitable for slipway launches from a boathouse. As it turned out, the new Stromness lifeboat, J.J.K.S.W. (ON 702), would be the only one housed.\nStromness Lifeboat performed an exceptional service in 1930, but without a good outcome. On 28 March 1930, in gale conditions, the Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran was wrecked on Ve Skerries, near Papa Stour, on the west side of Shetland. Despite recent moves to locate a lifeboat in Lerwick, there were no lifeboats based in Shetland. After all other rescue attempts failed, the Stromness lifeboat, being the nearest, was launched at 4:30pm on 30 March. In very poor conditions, the lifeboat first sailed to Scalloway as a staging point for food and a refuel, arriving at 7:30 am on the 31 March, before heading around Shetland with a local Pilot, to Ve Skerries. All that was found was the wreck, and no survivors. The lifeboat headed back to Scalloway, before commencing the 16\u00bd hour journey back to Stromness, arrriving at 11:00pm on 1 April. J.J.K.S.W. (ON 702) had been away for 55 hours, and travelled 320 miles.\nIn 1998, Stromness received their latest lifeboat. A Severn-class lifeboat, the largest type of the RNLI fleet, fitted with twin Caterpillar 3412 1200\u00a0bhp marine diesel engines, providing a top ",

    "1992 studio album by Mary's Danish\nAmerican Standard is the third and final album by the American band Mary's Danish, released in 1992. The band supported the album by participating in a Rock the Vote tour, following it with a tour with the Darling Buds. \"Leave It Alone\" peaked at No. 20 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart.\nProduction\nThe album was produced primarily by Peter Asher, who also served as the band's manager. Niko Bolas engineered and assisted with the production. It was recorded in 10 days at Skywalker Sound. All six bandmembers contributed to the songwriting; the band rented a loft space in Central Los Angeles prior to the recording sessions so that they could jam. \"God Said\" criticizes the operations of televangelists. \"Porcupine\" denounces detaching oneself from society. \"Gotcha Covered\" is about life in Los Angeles. Chad Smith played drums on the unlisted track, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" that also appeared on the soundtrack to Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\nCritical reception\nThe Los Angeles Times wrote that \"in the key moments ... the band asserts a confident and consistent voice, shedding some of its old, distracting eclecticism in favor of a more comfortable and appealing rock 'n' roll purity.\" Trouser Press determined that \"the album's consistency makes it more listenable, if less adventurous, with an immediacy and urgency missing from prior work.\" The Chicago Tribune opined that \"siren singers Julie Ritter and Gretchen Seager belt out 'Leave It Alone', a speed-metal oeuvre in which guitarists Louis Gutierrez and David King fire up the grunge.\"\nThe Indianapolis Star said that \"an occasional attempt toward mainstream rock, along with some overused themes, dooms a few tunes to mediocrity.\" Spin deemed the album \"rock with that everything-but-the-kitchen-sink vibe about it.\" The Waterloo Region Record concluded that \"Mary's Danish is probably a great alternative-singles band, but as a collection American Standard just doesn't stand up to repeated listenings.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"the material here is substandard in comparison to the earlier releases, and Asher's '70s-slick production style simply doesn't mesh with the post-post-punk eclecticism at the heart of the band's sound.\"\nTrack listing\n",
    "Species of flowering plant\nErodium lebelii, sticky stork's-bill, is an annual plant in the family Geraniaceae. It occurs on sand dunes and heaths on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of western Europe. Its taxonomic status is uncertain: some authorities consider it merely a variety or subspecies of common stork's-bill while others consider it to be the same as the north African species Erodium aethiopicum.\nDescription\nSticky stork's-bill is an annual monoecious herb which typically grows in rosettes pressed flat to the ground, with a deep tap root that allows it to survive through the summer on dry soils. The stem is often very short, but can be up to 15 or even 25\u00a0cm long, green or reddish in colour, and covered in dense, glandular hairs particularly towards the top. The leaves are all or mostly basal, but are arranged in opposite pairs if the stem elongates. Each leaf is deeply divided or pinnate, with deeply incised segments (cut more than half way to the base), up to 3\u00a0cm long, and covered in white hairs. The petioles are also hairy and are somewhat shorter than the blade.\nDetail of a leaf\nThere can be several inflorescences, which are umbels of 2-4 (sometimes 5) actinomorphic flowers, arising from the tops of the branched stem. The flowers are supported by densely glandular-hairy pedicels about 1\u00a0cm long. They are hermaphroditic, with 5 glandular-hairy sepals a few millimetres long and 5 white to pinkish petals 5\u00a0mm long. There are also five stamens and five carpels, which develop into fruits that look like a miniature storks bill. Each fruit is a schizocarp which breaks into 5 mericarps, each of which has a short (5\u00a0mm) basal segment containing one black seed, and a long (20\u00a0mm) beak that splits open at maturity to reveal a feathery appendage that enables the seeds to be dispersed by the wind. At the top of the basal segment there is a large, shallow pit that (unlike common stork's-bill) is not surrounded by a ridge and groove, but is partially covered by the long white hairs on the body of the mericarp.\nThe flowers are pale lilac and unspotted.\nIdentification\nGlandular hairs on the pedicel and sepals is a key identification feature.\nSticky stork's-bill is very similar in appearance to common stork's-bill, especially the coastal variety of that species, E. cicutarium ssp. dunense. The key features to look out for are the dense glandular hairs on the pedicels and sepals of E. lebelii, the greyish appearance of its leaves, the pale flowers which are usually in pairs, rather than groups, and the apical pit of the mericarp, which is not surrounded by a ridge and groove. The petals must be unspotted. Confirmation can be made by a chromosome count.\nMusk stork's-bill is sometimes very glandular and sticky, but the leaflets of its pinnate leaves are almost entire, and it has large, pink flowers.\nTaxonomy\nThe name Erodium lebelii was coined by the French botanist Claude Thomas Alexis Jordan in the Classe des Sciences publication of the Academy of Sciences, Literature and Arts of Lyon 1851, which is not currently available on the society's website. Although Jordan created an enormous herbarium, the type specimens are all British material, housed at the Natural History Museum in London. Over the years there has been much confusion about which stork's-bills should be considered species, but the currently accepted account was worked out by Charlotte Henriette Andreas (1910\u20131989) in 1947, although she used the name E. glandulosum for E. lebelii.\nIts chromosome number is 2n = 20.\nThere are two subspecies of sticky stork's-bill: ssp. cicutarium is the common one, while ssp. marcuccii (Parl.) Guitt. is restricted to Corsica, Italy, Spain and Morocco.\nIt occasionally crosses with common stork's-bill to produce the hybrid Erodium x anaristatum Andreas, which is a vigorous plant that has showy flowers but produces few fruits, suggesting that it is sterile. It is usually found as isolated plants in places where both parents are present. The hybrid has a chromosome number of 2n = 30 (the other parent has 40 chromosomes).\nThe name of the genus, Erodium, is derived from the Ancient Greek word for a heron or egret, \u1f10\u03c1\u1ff3\u03b4\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 (erodios), because of the shape of the fruits. The specific epithet was given in honour of the French explorer and botanist Jacques Eug\u00e8ne Lebel.\nDistribution and status\nSticky stork's-bill is almost entirely restricted to western Europe, where it grows mainly on the Atlantic coast from Germany to Spain, and on the Mediterranean coast in Italy, Corsica, mainland France and Spain. It probably extends to Morocco in North Africa, but there are taxonomic uncertainties about the more southerly plants. If Erodium lebelii is really conspecific with E. aethiopicum, then it also occurs along the whole Mediterranean coast of Africa.\nIts conservation status globally has not been assessed, but in Britain and France it is listed as LC (least concern), although in Picardy, towards the northern edge of its range, it i",

    "1965 studio album by Jean Shepard\nIt's a Man Every Time is a studio album by American country singer Jean Shepard. It was released in November 1965 by Capitol Records and featured 12 tracks. The album's title track was its only single. It was given a positive reception by Billboard magazine following its release and was her second album to make the US country chart.\nBackground, recording and content\nJean Shepard found success during the Honky-tonk era of country music during the 1950s. With the introduction of country pop, her career stalled in the later half of the decade. In 1963, her husband Hawkshaw Hawkins was killed in a plane crash. In 1964, she had a commercial comeback with the single \"Second Fiddle (To an Old Guitar)\". By this point, she became a regular performer on Bill Anderson's television show. In October 1965, Billboard announced that Shepard had recorded a new album and single.\nIt's a Man Every Time was recorded at the Columbia Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Sessions were held between October 1964 and February 1965. The album was produced by Marvin Hughes and was Shepard's second album produced with him. The album contained a total of 12 tracks. Included was a song written by Johnny Cash and June Carter called \"Ain't You Ashamed\". Another song was composed by Conway Twitty titled \"Let Me Be the Judge\". The liner notes described the track \"Billy Christian\" as a song about \"a gallivanting husband\" and called the title track \"plaintive elegance\".\nRelease, critical reception, chart performance and singles\nIt's a Man Every Time was released by Capitol Records in November 1965. It was the sixth studio album of Shepard's career. The label distributed the album as a vinyl LP, offered in both mono and stereo formats. Six songs were included on either side of the disc.

    "(1909\u20131998), Romanian writer and political figure\nAlexandru Talex, born Atanase Alexandrescu (first name also Al., Alex., or Alexandre; 7 December 1909 \u2013 17 November 1998), was a Romanian activist journalist, cultural promoter, translator, and literary historian, noted in particular for being the friend and apologist of novelist Panait Istrati. He debuted as a journalist while in his twenties, when he became a posthumous disciple of historian and nationalist thinker Vasile P\u00e2rvan, defending his thought against the dismissive opinions expressed by Eugen Lovinescu. As a friend of Mihai Stelescu, Talex was associated with Stelescu's proletarian-fascist group, the Crusade of Romanianism. He edited the movement's newspaper for two years, obtaining Istrati's collaboration and intellectual support; they were good friends for the final five months of Istrati's life, with Talex emerging as his custodian. He also established a lifelong relationship with Istrati's widow, Margareta, providing her with material support.\nIn early 1936, Talex oversaw the standoff between the Crusade and the more powerful Iron Guard, but recommended a non-violent approach. Stelescu was murdered by an Iron Guard death squad in July of that year, and the movement began disintegrating; Talex himself quit in September, immediately after having published an article supporting non-Soviet communism. Though affiliated for a while with the state party, called National Renaissance Front, and joining the Union of Professional Journalists as a contributor to various periodicals, he focused mainly on his preservation of Istrati's legacy. In 1944, with Romania was engaged on the Eastern Front, Talex published his biography of Istrati, emphasizing his late friend's anti-Sovietism. In tandem, he was drawn into the anti-Nazi resistance network, joining the editorial staff of Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103\u2014an underground paper connected to the Romanian Communist Party. Following the 23 August Coup and its momentary restoration of democracy, he was active within the Romanian Social Democratic Party, supporting its alliance with the communists.\nThe Romanian communist regime tolerated Talex, and allowed him to continue working as a journalist, though its censorship apparatus banned his Istrati biography. In the 1960s, as Romania entered a national-communist phase, Istrati came to be reevaluated as an important writer and thinker. This effort was taken up by Alexandru Oprea and Eugen Barbu, on terms that Talex found unacceptable. His publicized critique led to his own rediscovery as an Istrati expert, and he was directly involved in the publication of Istrati books, from reprints of his novels to collections of his letters. Talex also participated in a similar effort undertaken in France by Roger Grenier, and became an internationally recognized figure. He lived to see the Romanian Revolution of 1989, which allowed him to publish previously censored works by Istrati. By the time of his death in 1998, he was being criticized for his monopoly on Istrati's public image\u2014including his attempt to block discussion about Istrati's, and his own, connections to fascism\u2014and for the poor quality of his translations from French.\nBiography\nEarly life\nAtanase Alexandrescu, the future Alexandru Talex, was born in Bucharest, capital of the Romanian Kingdom, on 7 December 1909; he had a brother and a sister. According to his own testimony, he attended Mihai Viteazul College, where his teacher of Latin was the renowned culture-critic, Eugen Lovinescu. He entered literary life shortly after enlisting at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters\u2014his first works were \"critical notes\" in the student journal Lic\u0103riri (February 1931). Talex was colleagues with novelist Pericle Martinescu, with whom he attended the bohemian caf\u00e9s on Calea Victoriei. They worked together on Petre B\u0103nescu's weekly newspaper, Timpul Nostru, where Alexandrescu took over as editorial secretary.\nAlexandrescu followed up with numerous articles in the press, including in publications such as Azi, Adev\u0103rul, Diminea\u021ba and Vremea, and was in attendance at Lovinescu's literary salon, Sbur\u0103torul. For a while in 1931\u20131932, he was featured alongside Lovinescu in Cristalul magazine, put out in Pite\u0219ti by Mihail Ilovici. Alexandrescu's object of admiration was the historian and political thinker Vasile P\u00e2rvan (1882\u20131927), on whom he wrote his graduation thesis. He was impressed with P\u00e2rvan's personality, and worked in particular to familiarize the public with P\u00e2rvan's anti-Russian stances, which he himself took to be morally and historically justified. He was therefore outraged in 1930, when Lovinescu attacked P\u00e2rvan, and in particular by the attack's harshness. Aspiring to be recognized as a literary expert, Alexandrescu earned the confidence of P\u00e2rvan's sister, Elvira Ap\u0103teanu, who allowed him to take possession of her brother's surviving letters. Talex claims that he then let the literary historian George C\u0103linescu borrow these",
    "American thoroughbred racehorse\nBaldski (15 May 1974\u201310 August 1993) was an American-bred thoroughbred racehorse and a Brilliant/Intermediate Chef-de-race.\nBackground\nBaldski was a dark bay or brown stallion, 16 hands tall, with well-built hindquarters but a slim front end. He was bred by Jane Engelhard, recorded as Mrs. Charles W. Engelhard on papers after her late husband. He was considered well-bred.\nToo Bald, Baldski's dam, was Broodmare of the Year and considered a top-class broodmare. Baldski was her fifth foal. She also produced Exceller, a multiple G1 winner and Hall of Fame member, and Capote, the 1986 American Champion Two-Year-Old Male and a notable sire.\nNijinsky, Baldski's sire, was a top-class racehorse, winning the English Triple Crown and achieving a Timeform rating of 138, and a top-class sire, being named a Chef-de-race and being on leading sire lists in at least three countries.\nBaldski was sold in the 1975 Keeneland July yearling sale, being purchased for $75,000 by Eugene Cashman.\nRace career\nBaldski had a lacklustre racing career. He won 7 of 27 starts, with his only stakes win being in a minor event at Calder, the Gold Coast Handicap. He also finished second the Grade 2 Ak-Sar-Ben Omaha Gold Cup Handicap and Grade 3 Ak-Sar-Ben President's Cup Handicap. In the Daily Racing Form's 1977 Free Handicap for American three-year-old males, he was rated at 114 pounds. Baldski raced from 1977 to 1979.\nStud career\nBaldski was retired to stud in 1980, entering stud at Farnsworth Farms in Florida, where he would spend his entire stud career. Baldski was a much better sire than racehorse, becoming a prominent sire, especially in Florida.\nBaldski sired 577 foals, including 419 winners (72.6%) and 48 black-type winners (8.3%) (The Blood-Horse credits Baldski with an additional black-type winner (8.5%)).

His broodmare sire AEI was 1.47 with a CI of 1.37.\nIn 1989, Baldski-Diplomat Way was used as an example of a negative nick in a nicking pattern table published in The Blood-Horse, due to no stakes winners being produced from 19 foals bred on the cross.

    "Anglo-Norman adventurer\nNot to be confused with Hervey de Montmorency, 4th Viscount Mountmorres.\nHervey de Montmorency (fl. 1169) was an Anglo-Norman adventurer and invader of Ireland. His name also appears variously as Mount-Maurice, Monte Mauricii, Monte Marisco, Monte Marecy, Montmarreis, Montmorenci, Mumoreci, and Momorci.\nBiography\nMontmorency may not unreasonably be held to have belonged to the same line as the Montmorencies of France (of this there is no conclusive proof, but see Andr\u00e9 Duchesne, Histoire G\u00e9n\u00e9alogique de la Maison de Montmorency, pp.\u00a09, 53, 87, 92; Montmorency-Morr\u00e8s, Genealogical Memoir, passim; L'Art de V\u00e9rifier, xii. 9, and other French genealogists; the forms of the name borne by Hervey and the French Montmorencies suggest a common stock, and Herv\u00e9 was a Christian name much used by the French house; in connection with this see Giraldus Cambrebsis, De rebus a se gestis, ii. c. 2, where the canon, afterwards the dean, of Paris there mentioned, the son of the castellan de Monte Mauricii,' was Herve, son of Matthieu ' de Montmorency; ' compare Duchesne, u.s. pp.\u00a097, 106, and Preuves, pp.\u00a039, 55). Hervey is said by M. de Montmorency-Morres to have been the son of a Robert FitzGeoffrey, lord of lands in Thorney and of Huntspill-Marreis, Somerset, by his wife Lucia, daughter of Alexander de Alneto, and to have been half-brother of Stephen, constable of Cardigan. This bit of genealogy has, however, been made up to fall in with the erroneous belief that Giraldus asserts that Hervey was the uncle of Robert FitzStephen, and may be dismissed at once. According to Duchesne (u.s.), followed in 'L'Art de Verifier les Dates' (u.s.), Hervey was the son of Bouchard IV de Montmorency\u00a0, by Agnes, daughter of Raoul de Pontoise\u00a0; he served Louis VI and Louis VII of France, and coming to England married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert de Beaumont (d. 1118), Count of Meulan, and widow of Gilbert de Clare (d. 1148), earl of Pembroke, which would make him stepfather of Earl Richard, called Strongbow. Hervey, however, was paternal uncle of Earl Richard (Giraldus, Expugnatio Hibernica, p.\u00a0230), and must therefore have been a son by a second marriage of Adeliza, daughter of Hugh, count of Clermont (William of Jumi\u00e8ges, viii. 37), who married for her first husband Gilbert FitzRichard, the father of Gilbert, earl of Pembroke (see a charter in MS. Register of Thorney, pt. iv. c. 35, f. 30, printed in Monasticon, ii. 601, where Hervey is described as brother of Gilbert and the other children of Adeliza and Gilbert FitzRichard, and pt. ix. c. 11, f. 9, where Adeliza is styled 'de Monte Moraci, domina de Deneford,' and is also styled 'domina de Deneford,' pt. iv. c. 10, f. 2 b\u00a0; see also pt. iv. c. 8, f. 2). The father of Hervey was no doubt called 'de Monte Moraci,' or Mount Maurice, but nothing has been ascertained about him (it is impossible to accept M. de Montmorency-Morres's Hervey, son of Geoffrey, lord of Thorney, as an historic person, while his theory that there were two Herveys, cousins-German, is a mere device to get out of the difficulty caused by his confusing together Earl Richard and Robert FitzStephen).\nHervey was in early life a gallant warrior ('olim Gallica militia strenuus,' Expugnatio, p.\u00a0328, translated by Hooker, he ' had good experience in the feats of war, after the manner used in France,' Irish Historic, p.\u00a038. This passage was no doubt the ground of Duchesne's assertion that he served Louis VI and Louis VII). He was a man of broken fortunes when he was sent by his nephew, Earl Richard, to Ireland with Robert FitzStephen in 1169 to report on aft'airs there to the earl. After the victory of these first invaders at Wexford their ally Derruot, king of Leinster, rewarded him with two cantreds of land on the coast between Wexford and Waterford, and he appears to have shared in Dermot's raids on Ossory and Offaly (Song of Dermot and the Earl, 11. 606, 749, 930). On the landing of Raymond FitzGerald at Dundunnolf, near Waterford, Hervey joined him, and shared in his victory over the people of Waterford and the chief, Donnell O'Phelan. Giraldus puts into his mouth a speech recommending the slaughter of seventy Waterford men who had been taken prisoners; but the Anglo-Norman poet of the Conquest gives a wholly different version of the event (ib. 11. 1474\u201389). He remained with Raymond in an entrenched position in Bannow Bay until they were reinforced on 23 August by the arrival of Earl Richard, who was joined by Hervey. Raymond's mission to Henry II having failed , Earl Richard sent Hervey to the king, probably in August 1171 (Gesta Henrini, i. 24), to make his peace. On his return Hervey met the earl at Waterford, told him that Henry required his attendance, accompanied him to England, and at Newnham, Gloucestershire, was the means of arranging matters between him and the king. During Henry's visit to Ireland Hervey probably acted as the marshal of the royal army\u00a0; for in his charter for the foundat",

    "2022 single by Paulo Londra\n\"Julieta\" is a song by the Argentine rapper and singer Paulo Londra. It was released by Warner Music Latina as the sixth single from his second studio album Back to the Game (2022). The song marked Londra's return to the reggaeton genre that made him known in 2018 and 2019 for his singles \"Ad\u00e1n y Eva\" and \"Tal Vez\" respectively.\nBackground and composition\nIn July 2022, Londra revealed in an Instagram post that he would release a different song every Thursday between that month and August, among which \"Julieta\" was announced, which would be released on August 4, 2022. On August 1, 2022, Londra released a teaser of the music video.\n\"Julieta\" is a romantic reggaeton song composed by Londra, Federico Vindver and Alejandro Ram\u00edrez Su\u00e1rez, while the musical production was done by Sky Rompiendo and Vindver. The title of the song is inspired by the character Juliet from William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy Romeo and Juliet (1597), where she cannot live her love with her lover Romeo. The lyrics of the song, precisely, represent an impossible love that drives Londra crazy for not knowing if it is reciprocated.\nCommercial performance\nOn its first day of release, \"Julieta\" achieved two and a half million views on YouTube, placing the video at the top of the music trends in Argentina. This resulted in the song debuting at number 82 on the Billboard Argentina Hot 100 on the week dated August 13, 2022 and remained in the ranking for three weeks.\nMusic video\nThe music video was directed by Gabriel Bosisio, produced by Buena Productora and was filmed in Buenos Aires. The video clip  is based on the elements of 80's horror films and shows Londra hospitalized and strapped to a gurney in a psychiatric hospital.

    "11th edition of the competition\nSports seasonThe 2004 NIRSA national soccer championship, also referred to as the NIRSA Collegiate Soccer Sport Club championship, was the 11th NIRSA National Soccer Championships, the annual national championships for United States-based, collegiate club soccer teams organized by NIRSA. It took place at the Whitaker Fields at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas from Thursday, November 18 to Saturday, November 20, 2004. The tournament would get rained out before a champion could be crowned in any division. The only division to have a continuation to the tournament was the men's championship division which took place at the Red Mountain Soccer Complex in Mesa, Arizona on January 8, 2005.\nOverview\nHeavy rains in Austin, Texas on the preceding Monday and Tuesday resulted in the tournament staff postponing the tournament from the initial start date of Thursday to Friday to allow the fields more time to dry. However, the tournament would not be extended, meaning the games would be shortened. Despite best efforts, at approximately noon on Saturday, a thunderstorm passed through which not only further flooded the already wet fields but also created a safety hazard with the lightning. Ultimately, the initial tournament would get cancelled, marking the first time this has ever occurred in the NIRSA national championships.\nPrior to the cancellation\nIn the men's championship division, by the quarterfinals, no teams remaining had previously made the finals while the men's open division had no previous champions. Meanwhile, the women's championship division only had one team remaining who had not previously won at least 2 titles, UC-Santa Barbara, who had only ever made the finals once, in 2001, where they lost to Penn State who in this tournament, was eliminated in the group stage following a 3-way tie on points and a 2-way tie on goal difference. Despite this, UC-Santa Barbara would eventually go on to become the winningest team in the women's championship division. The women's open championship was the only division to not finish at least the quarterfinals, the remaining teams were LSU, Illinois, Texas, UC-Davis, Colorado \"Black\", Northern Colorado, Virginia Tech, and UCLA.\nContinuation\nFollowing the cancellation, each division was able to decide how to move forward. Both open divisions and the men's championship consolation bracket elected to not declare a winner while the women's championship decided to elect all four remaining teams as co-champions. The only division who was able to organize a continuation tournament was the men's championship division who had three of the four remaining teams agree to a tournament in Mesa, Arizona on January 8, 2005. Despite choosing Arizona as the host site to mitigate the risk of rain, Mesa would receive, what was described as, \"their total annual rainfall for 2005\" in the week preceding the tournament, flooding the fields. Luckily, the fields would dry in time for the tournament to go on as scheduled.\nSince North Carolina elected not to participate, the teams decided that a round-robin would be the best solution to finishing the tournament. Each team would play each other once with each game requiring a winner and the team with the best record would be crowned champion. The remaining teams were Texas A&M, Colorado State, and UC-Berkeley, none of which had ever made the finals.\nIn the opening match, Colorado State would defeat UC-Berkeley 2\u20130. The following match, Texas A&M would beat Colorado State 1\u20130, meaning if Texas A&M won their final match they'd be champions but if they lost a three-way penalty shootout would ensue to determine the champion. Texas A&M would go on to win their final match 2\u20130 and be crowned national champions for the first time. This result also meant Colorado State would finish 2nd and UC-Berkeley finishing 3rd. Following the tournament, Bill Besan\u00e7on would be named men's championship MVP.\nFormat\nThe competition consisted of 80 teams: 40 championship teams and 40 open teams. The divisions were further divided into a men's and women's division: 24 men's and 16 women's teams in the championship division as well as 20 men's and 20 women's teams in the open division. The divisions were then further divided into groups: eight groups of three teams in the men's championship, four groups of four teams each in the women's championship division, and five groups of four teams each in the men's and women's open divisions.\nAll four divisions engaged in a round-robin tournament that determined teams able to advance to a knockout stage. Each team played every other team in their group once in pool play which consisted of two 40-minute halves separated by a seven-minute halftime and utilized the three points for a win system. After pool play, the two highest ranked teams from each group in the men's and women's championship divisions advanced to their respective knockout stage, with the third placed team in the men's championship a",
    "May and Gilan (Arabic: \u0645\u064a \u0648 \u063a\u064a\u0644\u0627\u0646, romanized:\u00a0May and Ghil\u00e2n; also spelled Mai and Ghaylan) is a legend, or hik\u00e2ya, originating from Qatar. In Qatari folklore, the tale of May and Ghil\u00e2n has been celebrated as a foundational narrative, often recounted through oral tradition. Ghil\u00e2n, a prominent figure in Qatar's maritime history, is revered as the progenitor of pearl fishing, the historical mainstay of Qatar's inhabitants.\nStory\nTraditional rowing boat used by the people of Al Khor on display in the Sheikh Faisal bin Qassim Al Thani Museum\nThe narrative unfolds in Khor Al Muhanadah (now Al Khor) in northeast Qatar, where Ghil\u00e2n, an affluent boat owner, commands a fleet of vessels engaged in pearl fishing. His authority is challenged by the arrival of May, a daring woman who emerges as a formidable competitor in the industry. Despite Ghil\u00e2n's initial dominance, May's superior boats and crew pose a formidable threat to his supremacy.\nA pivotal moment occurs when May's boats, propelled by skilled rowers, outpace Ghil\u00e2n's vessels on the route to the pearl oyster beds. \nWhen her boat outpaced that of Ghaylen, he became irritated and implored her for assistance in towing. She responded with a sarcastic remark: \u201cthe rope is in the minds of paddles.\u201d During that era, pearl fishing was commonly conducted using row boats. In a moment of indignation, Ghil\u00e2n devises a cunning strategy to regain his advantage. Inspired by the sight of a grasshopper's wings, he conceives the idea of utilizing sails to harness the wind's power. The implementation of sail technology enables Ghil\u00e2n's boats to surpass May's, leading to his triumph.\nThe tale intertwines themes of competition, innovation, and gender dynamics, reflecting the complexities of traditional Arabian culture. May's boldness challenges conventional gender roles, while Ghil\u00e2n's strategic prowess reinforces his status as a revered leader.\nWhile the legend of May and Ghil\u00e2n has endured within Qatari folklore, its widespread dissemination has been limited primarily to the locality of Al Khor. According to tradition, the myth originated from the local Al Muhannadi tribe. Despite efforts to preserve oral traditions, the story's transmission has been widely reduced after several generations.\nPreservation\nA written version of the legend is currently on display in the Al Khor Museum.\nModern adaptations\nQatari playwright Abdulrahman Al Mannai made a theatrical adaptation of the legend in 2006 at the fifth edition of the Doha Cultural Festival hosted by the National Council for Culture, Arts and Heritage. The play took place at Qatar National Theatre. An operetta featuring traditional sea music and dances, over 120 performers took part in the play. Matar Ali and Fouad Al-Hariri composed and arranged the musical notes of the operetta, while Faisal Al-Tamimi directed the acting performances.\nAs part of a four-part series of animated shorts revolving around Qatar's folk heritage released by Qatar Museums in December 2023, the tale of May and Ghilan featured as the series' inaugural episode. It was produced by Sheikha Roda Al Thani.\nSee also\nQatari folklore\n",
    "2022 double murder of autistic twin brothers in Singapore\nOn 21 January 2022, at a playground in Greenridge Crescent, located in Singapore's Upper Bukit Timah, 11-year-old twin brothers Ethan Yap E Chern (\u53f6\u80b2\u6210 Y\u00e8 Y\u00f9ch\u00e9ng) and Aston Yap Kai Shern (\u53f6\u51ef\u80dc Y\u00e8 K\u01ceish\u00e8ng), who were both diagnosed with autism, were murdered by their 48-year-old father Xavier Yap Jung Houn (\u53f6\u4fca\u5b8f Y\u00e8 J\u00f9nh\u00f3ng), who strangled the both of them to death before he attempted to commit suicide but failed to. Yap was charged with the double murder, which shocked the nation at that time. Yap, whose murder charges were reduced due to clinical depression, was reported to have killed the boys due to his suicidal thoughts and his belief that his sons would be neglected and unloved by their mother upon his death and thus wanted to kill himself and the twins to remove themselves as burdens on his wife. Yap was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment in August 2023, after he pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter at the High Court.\nBackground\nEthan Yap E Chern and Aston Yap Kai Shern, both twins, were born on 14 October 2010 to their parents Xavier Yap Jung Houn and Anna Seah Puay Hiang, the latter who was previously married with one daughter, who lived together with the Yaps. Yap, a university graduate who formerly worked as a manager at the Ministry of Defence, had once studied for a doctorate at England.\nWhen both Ethan and Aston were two years old, Yap and his wife suspected that the brothers were possibly autistic after noticing certain signs of their behaviour. In May 2017, at the age of six, the boys were formally diagnosed with global developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. According to sources, Seah was unable to accept the boys' condition and despite the doctor's recommendation to enrol the boys in a special education school, the boys were enrolled at the age of nine in Primary 1 at a mainstream primary school located in the Eng Kong estate area while they were still non-verbal. The boys encountered learning difficulties throughout their schooling, and so, the boys' mother and maid would each accompany one child to classes. Whenever the mother was unavailable, one of the twins would not be present for school. Reportedly, Yap's wife did not allow her husband to have a say in decisions on which school the boys should attend, or their school activities. It was reported that Yap had a good relationship with his sons. Yap would help the brothers to prepare their daily necessities and gave them whatever they wanted, and he would not resort to physical force whenever he was disciplining the twins. Yap also played a more major role in their studies and often make time to spend with his sons after they enrolled in primary school.\nHowever, in around 2019 or 2020, Yap became increasingly concerned about his sons' welfare. In 2021, Yap's wife, who allegedly had an affair, began to grow more prone to anger and allegedly became more abusive towards the twins, and it only added to his concerns. In December 2021, Yap began to harbour suicidal thoughts, and he even bought an ice pick with plans to take his own life. At the start of 2022, the boys were about to be assessed for their suitability to remain in their mainstream primary school, and this turn of events caused Yap's wife to become more depressed and infuriated at her sons. Assuming this as a sign that his wife had given up on the boys, Yap began harbouring serious thoughts of killing his sons before he commit suicide, so as to unburden his wife. Yap also feared for his sons, fearing that they would become ostracized should he and his wife die one day, and it became another factor behind his motive of murdering his sons on 21 January 2022.\nDouble murder\nOn 21 January 2022, Xavier Yap decided to carry out his murder plot at a playground near his house in Greenridge Crescent in Upper Bukit Timah, where he often bring his sons to play. The area itself was said to be near a forest and an open field, which was also why he chose that place. At about 4.45pm, Yap armed himself with an ice pick and he drove his sons to the playground in his car. For the first ten minutes, both Ethan and Aston played at the playground, before Yap proceeded to bring the brothers one after another into a canal near the open field, located in the area where the playground was. Yap first laid his hands on Ethan, using a stick to press against Ethan's neck before he strangled the boy to his death, and he even placed Ethan's head underwater at the canal itself. Throughout the murder of Ethan, Aston was watching quietly on the side and after his brother died, Aston met essentially the same fate as Ethan, with Yap strangling Aston to death before he also submerged the boy's head into the canal water to make sure he died. According to an autopsy report by Dr George Paul, the boys died from strangulation.\nAfter the boys were dead, Yap attempted to kill himself several times, using either the ice pick, a tree branch and a rock.

    "Former confectionary business in Dublin, Ireland\nWilliams and Woods was a confectionery business in Dublin, Ireland.\nHistory\nHenry Williams opened his original confectionery shop on Dame Street in the 1850s. Robert Woods joined him some years later as a business partner and the company was renamed Williams and Woods. On opening, the factory employed 400 worker, mainly women from the local area. The company had its own cow's milk herd in North Dublin as well as a fruit farm in Kilsallaghan, County Dublin. In 1875, the company moved to the former Simpson's Hospital on Great Britain Street (now Parnell Street), later replaced by Cineworld Dublin.\nCineworld cinema at the site of the former Williams and Woods operations\nBy the 1890s, the company had expanded to 26 King's Inns Street, at the corner of Loftus Lane, adjacent to Henrietta Street.\nDuring the visit of Britain's Queen Victoria to Dublin in 1900, Williams and Woods provided 10,000 bags of sweets and 1 ton of jam for the Queen's Children's Day event in the Phoenix Park, which was attended by fifteen thousand children. In 1907, the company had an exhibit at the Irish International Exhibition in Herbert Park. During the 1916 Easter Rising, the rebels laid plans to occupy the Williams and Woods factory building but this did not come to pass.\nIn 1928, the company was acquired by the English company Crosse & Blackwell.\nBy the 1950s, the workforce had grown to 1,000 and the company had expanded to producing good for other brands, including Crosse & Blackwell and Chef. In the 1960s, artist Patricia Hurl's first job was in the office of Williams and Woods as a comptometer operator.\nThe company was ultimately taken over by Nestl\u00e9 after its UK parent, Crosse & Blackwell, was acquired in 1960.\nIn 1975, the company by then known as Willwood moved its operations out of Dublin city centre to a modern manufacturing facility in Tallaght.\nThe remaining portion of the Irish entity was taken over in 1977 with the brands being phased out over the next two decades.\nBuilding\nModernist factory\nThe Art Deco factory at 26 King's Inns Street was designed by Donnelly and Moore architects and built by G&T Crampton in 1910. It was further extended in the 1920s and 1941. The site had previously been home to a confectionery factory that had been built in 1856 but had been destroyed by fire in 1908. Dublin City Council includes the building on its Record of Protected Structures, reference number 8905.\nIn 2012, the building was converted into an arts centre, which launched in 2014 as The Chocolate Factory.\nGeorgian building\nThe former Simpson's Hospital building on Parnell Street was sold off to developers after the factory's move in 1975 and ultimately demolished.\nExternal links\nPhoto of the factory from the 1950s in the RTE archive\nPhoto of the factory from 1968 in the RTE archive\nPhoto of the inside of the factory from 1962\n",
    "English footballer\nGeorge William Wilson was an association footballer who won the FA Cup with Blackburn Olympic in 1883.\nGeorge Wilson, Blackburn Olympic, circa 1883, from the Sheffield Evening Telegraph, 2 February 1907\nEarly life\nWilson was born on 5 May 1859 in Swinton into a family with its roots in glass bottle manufacture.\nFootball career\nWilson played as centre-forward for Mexborough in the late 1870s; he was famous enough to play for The Zulus touring side, and in 1881 he played briefly for Sheffield Wednesday. He moved to Olympic the following year as one of the two professional \"imports\", as the Wednesday objected to his taking payment for playing for the Zulus.  He was known for long throws and was employed as a clerk in Blackburn in order to justify his amateur status.  His debut for the Olympic was at Nottingham Forest in October 1882, the game ending acrimoniously as the Olympians walked off in protest at the referee allowing a goal after an offside Norman charged goalkeeper Thomas Hacking out of the way of a goalbound shot.\nWilson also made his competitive debut in the first round of the Lancashire Senior Cup the same month, in an easy 11\u20130 win over the obscure Padiham Church club, but, as he had not lived in Blackburn for the required 2 years, the Olympians were disqualified - it was assumed this was a deliberate move so the Olympians could concentrate on bigger competition.  Wilson duly scored in every round of Olympic's 1882\u201383 FA Cup run, other than the final against the Old Etonians; he did put the ball in the goal close to the end of the match, but it was disallowed on the basis that it had already gone out of play,  It was his pass to Alf Matthews that led to Matthews scoring the Olympians' equalizer.  He also played in the Olympic side which lost the 1883 Lancashire Charity Cup final 6\u20132 to Blackburn Rovers.\nThe generally working-class Olympic did not have the wealthy backing that other clubs in the region had, and Preston North End \"lured George Wilson from Blackburn Olympic by offering him the tenancy of the Black-a-Moor-Head public house\" for the 1883\u201384 season.  His time with North End was not a success due to injury, and he returned to Mexborough in 1884.  He won the Sheffield Senior Cup with the club in 1886; one of his final appearances for the club was in goal in the Minor Cup for amateur Sheffield sides.\nPost-football career\nWilson returned to Swinton when his career was over.

    "Evolutionary tinkering is an explanation of how evolution happens in nature. It explains that evolution works as a tinkerer who experiments with miscellaneous items, unsure of the outcome, and utilizes whatever is available to craft functional objects whose utility may only become evident later. None of the materials serve a defined purpose initially, and each can be employed in multiple ways. According to the tinkering concept, \u201cevolution does not produce novelties from scratch\". It comes from previously unseen associations of old materials to modify an existing system to give a new function or combine systems together to enhance the functions. The transformation from unicellular to multicellular during evolution is such an event which has elaborated the existing function.\nThe process of evolutionary tinkering takes quite a long time. As a meticulous tinkerer who continuously refines its creations, making adjustments, trimming and extending here and there, seizing every chance to gradually tailor them to their evolving purposes, this process happens over countless eons.\nMost of the time, traits in nature are barely favorable enough for organisms to survive. For instance, RuBisCO is profoundly inefficient, despite the fact that it catalyzes one of the most important reactions on the planet: carbon fixation. This is likely due to the enzyme originating in the common ancestor of all plastids when the atmospheric conditions were drastically different than they are today.\nFran\u00e7ois Jacob\nIn his seminal article 'Evolution and Tinkering', Fran\u00e7ois Jacob first introduced the idea of tinkering to a broad audience of scientists, drawing from diverse fields such as molecular biology, evolutionary biology, and cultural anthropology. The concept of tinkering, or more precisely, the notion of bricolage, serves as a theoretical framework for analyzing various phenomena characterized by a common underlying process: the opportunistic rearrangement and recombination of existing elements. Jacob and Monad also won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his work on the lac operon.\nEngineering vs. Tinkering\nNatural selection is frequently likened to the work of an engineer, yet this analogy falls short. Unlike the engineer who operates based on meticulous planning and a clear vision of the end product, evolution lacks such deliberate intent. Additionally, while the engineer has access to carefully selected materials and specialized equipment tailored for their tasks, evolution relies on the resources available in its surroundings.\nMoreover, the engineer's creations tend to approach a level of perfection achievable with current technology, whereas evolution does not strive for perfection but rather resembles a tinkerer. This tinkerer, akin to evolution, lacks a precise blueprint of the outcome and instead utilizes whatever materials are at hand to fashion something functional. While the engineer depends on specific materials and tools precisely suited to their project, the tinkerer makes do with miscellaneous scraps and remnants. The resulting creations of the tinkerer emerge from a series of opportunistic events, enriching their repertoire with each encounter.\nThe development of lungs in terrestrial vertebrates illustrates a process akin to tinkering rather than deliberate engineering. It originated in certain freshwater fish faced with oxygen deficient environments, leading them to ingest air and absorb oxygen through their esophageal walls. Over time, this behavior favored the enlargement of the esophageal surface area, eventually giving rise to lung-like structures through the emergence and enlargement of esophageal diverticula.\nThe brain is the key adaptive feature of humans, yet still holds mysteries regarding its precise purpose. The brain has also evolved through natural selection over millions of years, like other body parts, primarily to serve our reproductive needs. However, the human brain's development was more complex unlike straightforward evolutionary changes such as a leg into a wing. It involved adding new structures, particularly the neocortex, onto older ones. This rapid evolution led to a division between the neocortex, responsible for intellectual functions, and the older structures, controlling emotional and visceral activities. These older structures lack the discriminative and symbolic abilities of the neocortex and are primarily associated with emotions. Despite the dominance of the neocortex in intellectual processes, the older structures maintain strong connections with automatic centers, ensuring vital functions like obtaining food and responding to threats. This evolutionary process, characterized by the emergence of a dominant neocortex alongside the persistence of older systems, resembles a tinkering process, where new elements are added onto existing ones without fully replacing them.\nEvolution by Molecular Tinkering\nJacob was convinced that although morphological analysis supports his notion of bricolage, o",

He taught at Harvard University from 1892 to 1937.\nBiography\nCharles Burton Gulick, son of traveling salesman Horace Gulick and his wife Anna Louise Sillcocks Gulick, studied classical philology at Harvard University. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1890 and his master's degree in 1891. Following this, he traveled to Germany and Greece for further study. Gulick spent his entire academic career at Harvard, starting as an instructor in Greek in 1892. In 1894, he earned his doctorate and was promoted to assistant professor. He became a full Professor of Greek in 1909 and was appointed Eliot Professor of Greek in 1925. Additionally, he served as a visiting professor at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in 1911\u20131912, President of the Classical Association of New England in 1928\u20131929, and President of the American Philological Association in 1929\u20131930. Gulick retired in 1937 due to deteriorating eyesight, which forced him to give up his academic work.\nGulick was interested in various aspects of Greek culture. He wrote two books on the private life of the Greeks and a bilingual edition of Athenaeus' \"Deipnosophistae\" for the Loeb Classical Library in 1927. With his considerable proficiency in the Greek language, he was able to revise the Greek grammar of his senior colleague, William Watson Goodwin, in 1930.\nIn 1913, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1940, to the American Philosophical Society.\nSelected works\nDe scholiis Aristophaneis quaestiones mythicae.

    "American freethinker (1849\u20131931)\nJames B. Elliott (1849\u20131931) was an American freethinker. Through his involvement with a number of freethinking organizations and publications, he met the anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre, with whom he had a brief romantic relationship and fathered a child, Harry. He spent the 1890s raising his son, working as a carpenter and collecting memorabilia of his idol Thomas Paine. By the turn of the 20th century, he succombed to a mental disorder and became estranged from his family, leaving his son and losing contact with de Cleyre.\nBiography\nJames B. Elliott was born in 1849, in Philadelphia, where he was raised by his mother. He found work as a carpenter and later became a freethinker, giving lectures on rationalism at the Philadelphia Ethical Society and Friendship Liberal League, and writing articles for The Truth Seeker. Through one freethought newspaper, The Progressive Age, Elliott encountered the writings of Voltairine de Cleyre, noting her expressive anger towards the Catholic Church.\nIn June 1888, he greeted de Cleyre at the Philadelphia train station, having invited her to give a speech at a meeting of the Friendship Liberal League. The following year, she settled in the city and moved into Elliott's rooming house. The two were quickly attracted to each other, although historian Margaret Marsh notes that Elliott was \"intellectually inferior\" to de Cleyre and had an \"eccentric\" character, which left her to wonder why de Cleyre found him so appealing. They struck up a brief romantic relationship, but as de Cleyre refused to marry Elliott, it quickly broke down and ended. They remained friends and continued to live in the same house, with Elliott caring for de Cleyre's plants and pets while she was on lecture tours.\nOn June 12, 1890, de Cleyre gave birth to their son Harry, but she felt emotionally and physically unable to raise him, so left him in Elliott's care. De Cleyre's sister Adelaide D. Thayer, herself childless, asked if she could take care of Harry, but Elliott refused. In 1894, de Cleyre moved out of the Elliott household, finding a new home with the couple Mary and George Brown. In 1896, Elliott visited de Cleyre's mother Harriet De Claire and built an extension for her house in St. Johns, Michigan. Around this time, Elliott was made secretary of both the Paine Memorial Association and the Paine Historical Association. Elliott idolised Thomas Paine, going on a pilgrimage to all of Paine's homes in both North America and England and collecting his memorabilia.\nBy the turn of the 20th century, Elliott had become increasingly mentally imbalanced and left his son at the age of ten to fend for himself. In 1900, he managed to find de Cleyre's estranged father Hector De Claire, and together they sent Harriet a number of messages that worried her. For this, de Cleyre called Elliott a \"devil\" and said he was \"not right in his intellects\", telling her sister Adelaide that he had \"no self-respect whatever, but insists on intruding himself constantly everywhere.\"\nIn 1910, de Cleyre moved to Chicago and Elliott fell out of touch with her. After her death, her anarchist comrades claimed that Elliott had deliberately prevented de Cleyre from seeing their child, but Margaret Marsh notes that this depiction is inaccurate. Elliott himself died in 1931, at the age of 82. Elliott was posthumously denounced in anarchist newspapers for neglecting his son Harry and preventing de Cleyre from seeing her child; according to historian Margaret Marsh, this depiction was \"not strictly true, but it preserved an unsullied image\" of de Cleyre.\n",

    "\nThe Russian submarine Narval (Russian: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043b, lit.\u2009'narwhal') was the lead ship of the Narval class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. The boat was laid down in December 1911 and launched in April 1915, before undergoing sea trials and entering service in September  1915. Just after being launched, Narval was inspected by Emperor Nicholas II. The submarine was built for the Black Sea Fleet, and its construction was accelerated after the outbreak of World War I. Narval took part in raiding Ottoman coal shipping along the Anatolian coast during the war, and was credited with destroying 31 ships for a total of 5,717\u00a0gross register tons\u00a0(GRT), making it the second highest achieving Russian submarine in the Black Sea.\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the submarine remained in Sevastopol, where it was first captured by the Germans and then by the British and the White Army in the Russian Civil War. The British scuttled Narval and several other submarines near Sevastopol in April 1919 to prevent the Bolsheviks from taking them.\nDesign and construction\nNarval being launched.Emperor Nicholas II leaving Narval after his inspection.\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Narval-class boats and three Morzh class. The Nevsky Factory\u00a0 in Saint Petersburg developed the Narval class on the basis of a foreign design, the popular Holland type made by the American Holland Torpedo Boat Company. But there was a dispute in the Imperial Russian Navy before 1911 on which submarine type to purchase, the Narval class or the Morzh class that was designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee, who argued that they needed to study foreign technological advancements. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class.\nThe Narval-class submarines were the most advanced Russian submarines at the time because unlike the rest they had crash-diving tanks for faster diving, internal bulkheads that provided more protection for the crew, and used natural flow to fill the main ballast tanks instead of pumps. A problem that arose during their construction was that the twin 1,140 horsepower (850\u00a0kW) diesel engines to power each boat had been ordered from Germany and were not delivered by the time World War I broke out, so they had to be replaced by four American-built engines that each provided 210 horsepower (160\u00a0kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30\u00a0km/h; 18\u00a0mph) surface speed could not be attained, and neither could the 12-knot (22\u00a0km/h; 14\u00a0mph) underwater speed. Narval had slightly different weaponry from the other boats in its class, being equipped with two Japanese 75\u00a0mm (3\u00a0in) deck guns and two 7.62\u00a0mm machine guns (the latter were installed in 1917). It also had four 450\u00a0mm (18\u00a0in) torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars (reduced to four in 1917). It was heavier than the other two boats, having a displacement of 673 long tons (684\u00a0t) on the surface and 1,045 long tons (1,062\u00a0t) while underwater.\nConstruction of all three Narval-class submarines began in Saint Petersburg, where they were laid down in December 1911, before being transferred to the shipyards in Nikolayev for the final assembly. The engines were not delivered from the United States until January 1915. Narval was launched on 24 April  1915 and was inspected by Emperor Nicholas II several days later on 28 April. The submarine then carried out sea trials until August, which were accelerated to meet the demands of the war, and it was completed on 5 September  1915.\nService history\nWorld War I\nAt the time when Narval entered service with the Russian Black Sea Fleet, it was focused on disrupting the Ottoman merchant convoys transporting coal from the area of Zonguldak to Constantinople, which was the main source of fuel for the Ottoman Navy. The new Russian submarines that joined the fleet were tasked with patrolling the Anatolian coast and the entrance to the Bosporus. In December 1915 Narval experienced engine problems while on patrol near the Bosporus, and underwent repairs from January to April 1916 in Sevastopol. Its engines were modified with parts from those of unfinished AG-class submarines. Despite the engine issues, Narval and the other boats of its class became popular with Russian submarine crews. These three boats formed the 2nd Squadron of the",
    "Ancient strategy game\nPolis (Greek: \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2; lit. City-state) is one of the earliest known strategy games as well as wargames. It resembles checkers. Its name appears in the Ancient Greek literature from c. 450 BCE to the 2nd century BCE, and it seems to have been widely known in the region, in particular, in Athens. The original rules of the game have been only partially preserved until the modern day.\nHistory\nAchilles and Ajax playing a game, sometimes identified as polis (at other times, as five lines); a common subject in Ancient Greek painted pottery\nLike with many ancient games, not much is known about it, including who, where and when invented it. The earliest known reference to polis comes from Cratinos, an Athenian comic poet, in his comedy Drapetides (\u201cFemale Runaways\u201d), from 443/442 BCE. The game was praised by Plato and Polybius, and possibly Philostratus, \"as a game of strategy requiring great tactical skill\". It was also likely referred to by Aristotle and Socrates. References to it are found in numerous other texts, suggesting that by mid-5th century BCE it was a game well known to Ancient Greeks and played until at least 2nd century BCE.\nIn Ancient Greek mythology and painted pottery, Achilles and Ajax are sometimes shown as playing a game (whose invention has been credited to Palamedes). No literary source is known to provide context for the illustrations on the painted pottery, however. This has led to the game being sometimes identified as polis, also at other times, as five lines (a dice game).\nRules\nThe rules of the game are not fully known. Many aspects of the rules are unknown, such as the shape of the board, its initial setup, or how did the piece move. The game can be seen as resembling checkers but with a different mode of capture (pieces were captured by enclosure from two sides).\nSome rules of the game were described by Julius Pollux in his Onomasticon. The board, like the game, was called polis, and featured a grid (although it is also possible that each space on the board was called a polis as well). The pieces, which came in two colors and probably numbered thirty (per player, so sixty total - this claim however has been disputed), were called \"dogs\". Sources are contradictory on whether there were differences between pieces (some assume there were none; other are more cautious and state this was likely the case but that primary sources are unclear on this). It was a symmetrical game of elimination for two players, each playing with pieces of their color. It probably had no random elements, and the pieces moved in all directions on a square board. It is unclear whether the game involved dice rolling (such a claim was made by Eustathius of Thessalonica but it could have been be a mistake).\nThe strategy involved maintaining formation and avoiding having one's pieces isolated.\nThe game may be similar to Ancient Roman game of ludus latrunculorum and might have served as its inspiration; it has also been suggested that polis might have been one of the influences on chess. There might have also been connections to the traditional Egyptian game seega.\nA plausible but speculative reconstruction of the game rules have been suggested by Max Nelson in 2020.\nSignificance\nThe game was seen as having educational value in learning how to learn and follow a set of rules. Leslie Kurke argued that the game had a cultural significance \"playing the board game polis might help form a Greek boy as a citizen of the city\". Learning to play polis is mentioned as part of a philosophical education in works of Ancient Greek philosophers.\nThierry Depaulis recognized the game as one of the oldest known strategy games (alongside Chinese game of go, which is mentioned by Chinese sources that also date to similar era as the oldest mentions of polis and which unlike polis remained popular to this day). Depaulis argued that invention of such games was one of the signs of the Axial Age (emergence of more complex thinking patterns, such as philosophy), as people moved from playing pure games of chance (such as dice games and race games) to strategy games.\nThe game has also been called one of the earliest wargames. Max Nelson notes that \"it the first known game of its kind (a war game on a grid-board)\". He nonetheless suggested that thematically the game was less of a depiction of military conflict (wars between Greek city-states) and more of a celebration of the founding of the city state of Athens, with which he believes it was mainly associated.\nAccording to an illustration in an article by Depaulis, a game board for polis was found in Rhamnous; however an article by Max Nelson from the same year (2020) states that no game board associated with this game has been found as of this date.\n",
    "Colombian Catholic charity organisation.\n Caritas Colombia (Spanish: C\u00e1ritas Colombiana, officially Pastoral Social C\u00e1ritas Colombiana) is a Colombian nonprofit organisation. It is the official aid organisation of the Catholic Church in Colombia.\nThe organisation is a member of the global Caritas Internationalis confederation and of Caritas Latin America and Caribbean.\nCaritas Colombia is a network of different structures. The national secretariat is known as Secretariado Nacional de Pastoral Social (SNPS).\nBackground\nSince 1913, the Colombian Episcopal Conference has been promoting social welfare activities in the country. In 1956, during the civil war, the Bishops decided to establish Caritas Colombia as the coordinating body of Catholic social work. It was decided that this body was to report to the Social Pastoral and Charitable Commission of the Bishops' Conference.\nDuring its first years of existence, the work of Caritas was focused on food distributions to people in need in parishes. In the 1960s, Caritas Colombia started creating special \"food houses\". In the backdrop of evolving political dynamics within the country, new challenges emerged; in rural areas, the ongoing clash between guerrilla groups and armed forces prompted the Church to take initiatives to support rural families, including helping them to increase their agricultural output.\nOn 4 August 1977, the National Secretariat of Social Pastoral (SNPS) was legally created to coordinate the pastoral care activities and to promote integral human development. Around that time, the organisation also started supporting those affected by natural disasters and displacement. Caritas Colombia was involved in the relief and reconstruction efforts for the victims of the Popay\u00e1n earthquake and the victims of the 1985 Armero tragedy.\nIn 1982, Caritas Colombia launched its first fundraising campaign during lent. In the 1990s, urban violence caused by drug trafficking became a major issue in the country, to which the organisation adapted by starting to implement peacebuilding projects and being involved in truth and reconciliation initiatives. At the same time, it continued to provide humanitarian aid to populations affected by natural disasters. In 1996, it co-founded the Working Group for Colombia (GTC) to strengthen the SNPS's work for peacebuilding and reconciliation. In 2000, it convened the first National Congress of Reconciliation.\nStructure and work\nThe organisation is structured into 10 regions grouping 13 archdioceses, 52 dioceses, 10 apostolic vicariates and one military ordinariate.\nIn 2023, Caritas Colombia implemented 62 projects in 51 geographical areas of ecclesiastical jurisdictions, with a total budget of almost 66\u00a0billion Colombian peso.\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in Spanish)\n",

She started at the Club Gimnasia R\u00edtmica Torrevieja, moving 2 years later to the Club Atl\u00e9tico Montemar in Alicante, a club from which other important Spanish gymnasts such as Carolina Pascual, Marta Bald\u00f3 and Estela Gim\u00e9nez have emerged.\nIn 1996 she was regional champion in the children's category in the individual modality and Spanish champion in the children's category in the group modality with the Club Atl\u00e9tico Montemar. In 1997 she was the national junior champion with ball and in 1998 she was the junior Spanish champion in both individuals and groups. In 1999 she won among the juniors with ribbon and ball, that year she also won bronze at the Spanish group championships in Valladolid (a group then also made up of three other future gymnasts from the national team such as Isabel Pag\u00e1n, Marta Linares and Laura Devesa, as well as by Ana Marque\u00f1o). In 2000 she was Spanish champion in the senior category with both rope and hoop.\nIn 2001 she became part of the Spanish national team after being called by coach Nina Vitrichenko. That same year she won the Spanish Cup. In October, at the World Championships in Madrid, after the disqualification of Alina Kabaeva and Irina Tchachina, she was 4th in teams along with Almudena Cid and Carolina Rodr\u00edguez and 13th in the All-Around.\nIn November 2002, she competed in the European Championships in Granada, finishing 5th in teams with Almudena Cid and 10th place in the All-Around. In 2003, at the World Championships in Budapest, she took 6th place in teams with Almudena Cid, Carolina Rodr\u00edguez and Esther Escolar, an 11th place in the All-Around. In this competition, the Spanish team only managed to qualify for a place for the 2004 Athens Olympic Games.\nThe Spanish Gymnastics Federation decided that Jennifer and Almudena would compete against each other for a place in the Olympic Games. To do this, it arbitrated a classification system that would grant the Olympic place, which was made up of four internal controls and four international competitions. This decision did not please those around either of the two gymnasts, since it forced them to compete to the maximum in the months prior to the Games, making them suffer greater physical and mental wear and tear, and increasing the risk of injury. Almudena would declare that the system had forgotten her extensive career, and Colino said that she thought there was favoritism towards Cid. After obtaining a higher score in the classification system, Almudena Cid finally made it to Athens.\nIn 2003 and 2004 Colino was Spanish champion in the honor category. In May 2004 she was 6th in the All-Around 7th with hoop, 6th with ball, 7th with clubs and 8th with ribbon at the World Cup in Baku, at the European Championships in Kyiv she placed 5th in teams with Almudena Cid, also being 16th in the All-Around. A year later, at the European Championships in Moscow, she placed 6th in teams with Almudena Cid and Esther Escolar. That same month he competed in the 2005 Mediterranean Games in Almer\u00eda, where she took 5th place in the final. In September she was champion of the Mercedes-Benz Cup in Berlin, a qualifying event for the general competition of the Berlin Masters (last Grand Prix tournament 2005), in which she was finally 16th overall and 8th in the ribbon final.\nIn October 2005, at the World Championships in Baku she was ranked 17th in the All-Around and, together with Almudena Cid, Carolina Rodr\u00edguez and Esther Escolar, 6th in teams. In September 2006 she was 12th overall at the European Championships in Moscow. In March 2007, the worsening of a back injury that she had had since 2003 caused the Federation's technical team to urge her to stop training, although she would continue training independently.\nIn February 2008 Jennifer retired due to the aggravation of the back injury she had suffered since 2003. In announcing her retirement, she publicly criticized the Spanish federation and Club Atl\u00e9tico Montemar for the treatment she received, and the services RFEG doctors for not detecting the severity of her injury earlier, although she also noted that in the last year they advised her to stop training and she did not do so because she wanted to be in the Olympic Games.\nAfter her retirement she coached at the Club Gimnasia R\u00edtmica Torrevieja for several years, where she coincided on the technical team with other former gymnasts such as Mari Carmen Moreno or M\u00f3nica Ferr\u00e1ndez. In October 2015 she announced the creation of her own rhythmic gymnastics club, the Jennifer Colino Club, based in Torrevieja, which she currently coaches.\n",
    "2024 concert film\nThis article is about the concert film. For the concert tour, see The Chromatica Ball.\nGaga Chromatica Ball is a television special directed and produced by American singer-songwriter, Lady Gaga. The television special documents Gaga's performance at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California, on September 10, 2022 as part of The Chromatica Ball (2022), which supported her sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020). The concert film was released on May 25, 2024, through HBO and its streaming service, Max. Gaga partnered with the network 13 years prior for the release of her first solo concert film Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden.\nBackground and production\nThe Chromatica Ball, Lady Gaga's seventh headlining concert tour, was initially announced for the summer of 2020 as a limited concert series in support of her sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020). Due to the uprising concerns and restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was postponed until 2021, before later being pushed back again for 2022.\nNew dates for the tour were scheduled and officially announced in March 2022. The new itinerary expanded the tour to include additional cities, notably D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, where the tour made its debut. The concert tour began in July, visiting North America, Europe, and Asia before concluding on September 17 in Miami Gardens, Florida. It ultimately grossed an estimated $112.4 million from 20 shows and 834,000 tickets sold.\nGaga commissioned an unknown project recording in September 2022, located at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California. In June 2023, the artist shared a lengthy social media post in which she confirmed that the upcoming project was a concert film. She shared that she had been working on the film alongside various other projects, including completing the filming of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux (2024), while also spending alone time \"healing\". Gaga both directed and produced the film with Arthur Fogel and John Janick acting as executive producers.\nSynopsis\nSee also: The Chromatica Ball \u00a7\u00a0Concert synopsis\nThe show was recorded at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles\nThe special includes the entirety of the show, including the interludes. The show itself, approximately 120-minutes long, was divided into a prelude, four acts, and a finale, each accompanied by interludes directed by Nick Knight. It depicted Gaga's journey from confinement to liberation. The prelude featured Gaga performing her earliest songs. She appeared atop a set piece reminiscent of a giant slab of concrete singing \"Bad Romance\", while standing still inside a leather sarcophagus-type garment with only her face visible, which she gradually shed layers during \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\".\nThe first act opened with Gaga seemingly covered in blood, on an elevated operating table for \"Alice\", followed by \"Replay\" and \"Monster\" with intense choreography. The second act featured her in a vinyl dominatrix ensemble for \"911\" and \"Sour Candy\", followed by \"Telephone\" with flamethrowers. \"LoveGame\" combined dance-pop with heavy metal elements. The third act included \"Babylon\" and \"Free Woman\", transitioning to \"Born This Way\" at the piano.\nIn the fourth act, Gaga wore insect-inspired attire while playing the piano on another stage, singing \"Shallow\", \"Always Remember Us This Way\", \"The Edge of Glory\", \"Angel Down\" and \"Fun Tonight\". \"Enigma\" featured a dynamic performance with a spinning microphone stand. The finale included \"Stupid Love\" and \"Rain on Me\" in a crystal bodysuit, followed by an encore with \"Hold My Hand\" from Top Gun: Maverick (2022). The special concludes with Gaga teasing the release of new music as an unknown snippet plays and \"LG7 Gaga returns\" flashes on the screen.\nRelease\nGaga announced the special's release date on May 8, 2024 via her social medias. She revealed its trailer the same day, which primarily featured \"Stupid Love\"\u2014Chromatica's lead single. Gaga Chromatica Ball aired on HBO and was made available for streaming on Max on May 25. 13 years prior, HBO had aired Gaga's previous concert film, Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden (2011), with the network's executive vice president, Nina Rosenstein, sharing that they were \"thrilled\" to work with her again. On May 23, 2024, Gaga held a premiere screening for selected fans in Los Angeles. The event included exhibits displaying costumes and props from the tour in addition to a Q&A session with the singer.\nReception\nWriting for The Daily Beast, Coleman Spilde praised the special, stating that \"it's an exhilarating watch from start to finish\" that shows refinement of \"Gaga's big, offbeat ideas\". Spilde singled out the performances of \"Sour Candy\" and \"Replay\" as \"particularly fun to watch\" and complimented Gaga's ability to make her older hits like \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\" sound \"fresh\" within the show. Joey Nolfi with Entertainment Weekly called the special \"bonkers, brash, and unabashedly p",
    "\nScottish politician and landowner\nWilliam Maxwell, 5th Lord Herries of Terregles (died 1603) was a Scottish politician and landowner.\nBiography\nMaxwell was the eldest son of John, fourth lord Herries, by his wife Agnes, daughter of the third Lord Herries. While still Master of Herries he was, on 15 October 1580, elected a gentleman of the chamber (Reg. P. C. Scotl. iii. 323). On 26 January 1582-3 he was chosen a member of the privy council in place of his father, who died on the 20th (ib. p. 548). On 9 June 1587 he became warden of the Avest march (ib. iv. 188). On 31 January following he was, however, denounced a rebel for not entering before the council certain of his dependents charged with oppression and depredations (ib. p. 244), and on 5 February was again summoned to appear before the council on 5 March (ib. p. 248). On the 20th the general assembly also handed in a complaint against him and others for attending mass in Dumfries (Calderwood, iv. 657)\u00a0; but already on 16 February he had made his submission to the king (ib. p. 677). On 3 March he was therefore released from the horn (Rey. P. C. Scotl. iv. 258)\u00a0; and on the 5th he came under an obligation neither to hear nor suffer mass to be said within his wardening, and also to repair to the kirk of Dumfries for the hearing of the sermons (ib. p. 259). On 1 Aug. 1588 he was appointed a commissioner for executing the act against the Spanish Armada.\nAbout 14 October 1595 Herries, to avenge the slaughter of John, seventh or eighth lord Maxwell in 1593, came in command of about three hundred of the Maxwells to Lockerbie to attack the Johnstones, but the latter had much the best of the encounter, many of the Maxwells being slain, and others taken prisoner (Moysie, Memoirs, pp. 124-5\u00a0; Calderwood, v. 385). On 8 March 1595-6 he appeared before the council, and protested that by his assurance to Sir James Johnstone he should not be answerable for certain Maxwells, and that he did not include in the assurance any of the Johnstones who had taken part in the late conflict (Reg. P. C. Scotl. v. 280). On 7 July he was denounced a rebel for not appearing to give his advice regarding the quieting of the borders (ib. p. 300). Shortly thereafter he was warded in Edinburgh Castle, but on the 24th was released on promising to give caution within three days to keep good rule (ib. p. 741). On 22 March 1598-9 he was charged, under pain of rebellion, to appear before the council on 6 June to underlie such order as would be given him for the quieting of the west march (ib. p. 543). He failed to do so, and was subsequently imprisoned in Tantallon Castle, but on promising to make his men answerable to justice, he was released on 11 September (ib. vi. 31). On 20 November he and others were required to submit their feud with the laird of Johnstone to arbitration (ib. p. 46), which he agreed to do, but protested that he should 'reserve his duty of blood and friendship to the Lord Maxwell,' and the king admitted his protest (ib. p. 91). On 17 June he was temporarily reappointed warden of the west march, in succession to Sir John Carmichael, who had a short time previously been murdered (ib. p. 117), and on 5 July the keeping of the castle of Lochmaben was given to him (ib. p. 128)\u00a0; but on 13 August the wardency was conferred on Sir James Johnstone (ib. p. 155). This provoked the jealousy of the Maxwells, and on 20 May 1601 Herries was charged to answer for 'a new design against Johnstone (ib. p. 240). On 20 November he and others in Dumfries were denounced for contravening the acts of parliament 'against saying and hearing mass and entertaining priests,' and were summoned before the council on 17 December (ib. p. 312), with which summons they complied (ib. p. 327). On his appearance he was, however, warded in Edinburgh Castle for not entering James Murray to answer for the slaughter of Sir James Carmichael (ib. p. 316), but on 8 Jan. he was released on giving surety to repair to the burgh of Edinburgh and there remain during the king's pleasure (ib. p. 712). On 9 February he appeared, and bound himself not to harbour John Hamilton and other Jesuits, and to defend and support the minister of Dumfries in his office and in the discipline of the kirk (ib. p. 352). On the 28th he came under an obligation not to assist Lord Maxwell and his rebellious accomplices (ib. p. 355). In May 1602 the assembly of the kirk decided that he should be placed in charge of a minister for his better instruction and confirmation in the truth, in case he repaired to Edinburgh; but it was reported in November that he had stayed only a short time in Edinburgh (Calderwood, vi. 163, 166). He died on 11 October of the following year. By his wife, Catherine Ker, sister of Mark, first earl of Lothian, he had five sons John, sixth lord Herries, Sir William of Gribton, Sir Robert of Sweetheart, Edward, and James and two daughters\u00a0: Elizabeth, lady Urchell, and Margaret, lady Parton.\n",
    "Goan writer and playwright (1885\u20131953)\nBernardo Francisco Cabral (7 March 1885 \u2013 c.\u20091953), known professionally as B. F. Cabral, was a Goan writer, playwright, and politician who served as the mayor of Karachi during British India. In the Konkani literary scene in Bombay, British India, as an emigrant, he served as the editor-in-chief of Sanjechem Noketr (1907), the first Konkani newspaper. He then went on to found his own publication, Catholic Sovostcai (1908), which had its short-term success before eventually turning to writing tiatrs staged during British India.\nEarly life\nBernardo Francisco Cabral was born on 7 March 1885, in the island of Chimbel, Goa which was located in the Ilhas (now Tiswadi) region of the then Portuguese India during Portuguese Empire (now part of India). After completing his initial education at a parish school in his hometown, Cabral was sent at the age of nine to Bombay (now Mumbai), British India, where he finished his secondary education. As a young teenager and student, at the age of 14, Cabral commenced his literary endeavors by submitting written pieces to Konkani-language periodicals that encountered distribution challenges in Bombay during that era.\nThere is some scholarly debate around Cabral's exact place of origin, with a few sources identifying his hometown as the nearby town of Ribandar rather than Chimbel. However, the consensus among historians and literary researchers such as Wilson Mazarello and Michael Jude Gracias is that Cabral was born and raised in Chimbel, which maintained close ties to Ribandar. Cabral's early writings and journalism represented some of the first significant Konkani-language literary and media contributions from the Goan region during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Beyond these details about his origins and early career, little is conclusively known about his later life.\nCareer\nCabral was a leading Konkani writer and playwright who was most active during the period from 1910 to 1938. He was known for his versatility as an author, producing works that displayed a distinct, humorous style characterized by vivid, native imagery. It led to a significant increase in his standing and instilled an admiration for Konkani within the community. Cabral's writings were praised and appreciated by the reading public, helping to elevate the status of the Konkani language, which had previously been looked down upon by many. It was perceived that the language ought to be employed by those belonging to the lower socioeconomic strata. In 1907, Cabral was appointed as the editor of Sanjechem Noketr, the pioneering newspaper that was exclusively dedicated to publishing content in the Konkani language. According to accounts from his contemporaries, Cabral's literary output had a broad appeal, attracting the interest of Goan emigrants living in cities and regions beyond Portuguese Goa itself, including Bombay, Poona (both part of British India), Africa (then ruled by Western Europe), and the Persian Gulf countries (then part of Ottoman Empire).\nSeeking to further expand the reach of Konkani literature, Cabral founded his own magazine, Catholic Sovostcai, in January 1908. A publication that was originally released on a monthly basis eventually transitioned to being published every two weeks. The magazine, published by Rold\u00e3o Noronha, was especially popular among the wives of Goan emigrants, who eagerly anticipated each new issue. The same magazines were in high demand and quickly sold out as soon as they were made available for purchase. However, Cabral was forced to discontinue the magazine when he relocated to Delhi, British India, at which point he devoted more of his attention to writing tiatrs, a form of Konkani drama. Cabral later relocated to Karachi, British India, where he served in a professional capacity for the municipal council of the city. Throughout his career, he remained an influential figure in the Konkani literary landscape, contributing to the growing mainstream acceptance and appreciation of the Konkani language and culture.\nCabral was also a Konkani playwright and tiatrist who was active in the early 20th century. According to scholars Wilson Mazarello and Michael Jude Gracias, Cabral served as the Mayor of Karachi during British India, around the 1920s. He was a writer, producing several plays and dramas in the Konkani language during this period in Karachi, British India. Some of his most well-known works include: Gabruchi Sasumaim (1921): A 156-page comedy with 24 songs, Sat Pordheanim (1923): A comedic play consisting of 135 pages featuring 23 musical numbers throughout its duration, Senhor Gabriel (1923),  Luvena (1925), and Inosent Hermione. In addition to these dramatic works, Cabral also composed two operas in verse: Jesus, Maria Anim Juze vo Jezu Christachem Gupit Jivit (Jesus, Mary and Joseph, a Secret Life of Jesus Christ), the theatrical performance took place in both Karachi and Goa, showcasing its artistry to audience",
    "Long-term annual pattern of a river's discharge\nThis article is about the annual pattern of a river's discharge. For the mathematical relationship between the river discharge and its width, depth and slope, see River regime.\nThe Pivka River in its upper course near Zagorje at different times of the year. Most of the time it is dry (bottom) but after heavy rainfall in autumn and spring, it becomes full (top), slowly diminishing afterward (middle). Since its discharge is mainly dependent on rainfall, it has a pluvial regime.\nDischarge regime, flow regime, or hydrological regime (commonly termed river regime, but that term is also used for other measurements) is the long-term pattern of annual changes to a river's discharge at a particular point. Hence, it shows how the discharge of a river at that point is expected to change over the year. The main factor affecting the regime is climate, along with relief, bedrock, soil and vegetation, as well as human activity.\nLike general trends can be grouped together into certain named groups, either by what causes them and the part of the year they happen (most classifications) or by the climate in which they most commonly appear (Beckinsale classification). There are many different classifications; however, most of them are localized to a specific area and cannot be used to classify all the rivers of the world.\nWhen interpreting such records of discharge, it is important to factor in the timescale over which the average monthly values were calculated. It is particularly difficult to establish a typical annual river regime for rivers with high interannual variability in monthly discharge and/or significant changes in the catchment's characteristics (e.g. tectonic influences or the introduction of water management practices).\nOverview\nMaurice Pard\u00e9 was the first to classify river regimes more thoroughly. His classification was based on what the primary reasons for such pattern are, and how many of them there are. According to this, he termed three basic types:\nSimple regimes, where there is only one dominant factor.\nMixed or double regimes, where there are two dominant factors.\nComplex regimes, where there are multiple dominant factors.\nPard\u00e9 split the simple regimes further into temperature-dependent (glacial, mountains snow melt, plains snow melt; latter two often called \"nival\") and rainfall-dependent or pluvial (equatorial, intertropical, temperate oceanic, mediterranean) categories.\nBeckinsale later more clearly defined the distinct simple regimes based on climate present in the catchment area and thus splitting the world into \"hydrological regions\". His main inspiration was the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, and he also devised strings of letters to define them. However, the system was criticised as it based the regimes on climate instead of purely on discharge pattern and also lacked some patterns.\nAnother attempt to provide classification of world regimes was made in 1988 by Heines et al., which was based purely on the discharge pattern and classified all patterns into one of 15 categories; however, the determination is sometimes contradictory and quite complex, and the distinction does not differentiate between simple, mixed or complex regimes as it determines the regime solely on the main peak, which is contradictory to commonly used system in the Alpine region. Hence, rivers with nivo-pluvial regimes are commonly split into two different categories, while most pluvio-nival regimes are all grouped into a single category along with complex regimes \u2013 the uniform regime, despite showing quite pronounced and regular yearly pattern. Moreover, it does not differentiate between temperature-dependant and rainfall-dependant regimes. Nonetheless, it added one new regime that was not present in Beckinsale's classification, the moderate mid-autumn regime with a peak in November (Northern Hemisphere) or May (Southern Hemisphere). This system too, is very rarely used.\nThe four different river regimes according to Pard\u00e9 (1955)\nIn later years, most of the research was only done in the region around the Alps, so that area is much more thoroughly researched than others, and most names for subclasses of regimes are for those found there. These were mostly further differentiated from Pard\u00e9's distinction. The most common names given, although they might be defined differently in different publications, are:\nGlacial, for regimes where most of water is due to melting of snow and ice and the peak occurs in late summer.\nNival, with a peak in late spring or early summer and still high importance of snow-melt.\nPluvial, which is (almost) purely based on seasonal rainfall and not on snow. A peak is usually in winter, although it can occur at any point along the year. If it occurs in the time of monsoons, it is sometimes called tropical pluvial.\nNivo-pluvial, with a nival peak in late spring and a pluvial peak in the fall. The main minimum is in winter.\nPluvio-nival, which is similar to niv",

    "Spruce Tree Centre viewed from the northeast\nThe Spruce Tree Centre is a building in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. Located at the intersection of University Avenue and Snelling Avenue, the 126,000 square feet (11,700\u00a0m2) building was built in 1988. An attached parking garage has over 350 spaces. The parking garage is owned by the city of Saint Paul and has electric car chargers. The building replaced a drug store built in the 1920s.\nA 37-kilowatt solar panel system was installed on top of the building in 2010 as part of an initiative to install solar power prior to the opening of the Metro Green Line. The panels cost about $350,000 with most of the cost covered by an Xcel Energy grant. Since 2012 the building has been LEED certified and is currently rated Gold.\nSnelling Avenue Station of the Green Line with the Spruce Tree Centre to the left\nThe southbound A Line station with the Spruce Tree Centre in the background\nAcross the street is the Snelling Avenue Station of the Metro Green Line. Adjacent to the building is a Metro A Line station. The building was described as a model, albeit in need of improvement, for transit and pedestrian supportive infrastructure on the Snelling Avenue corridor.\nConstruction and tenants\nThe design and impetus for construction were led by Marie Slawik. Marie Slawik and her husband Harold Slawik were active in business in Saint Paul and Roseville. Their first names of 'Harold' and 'Marie' were used for the Har Mar Mall located due north in Roseville. The building was intended to be a mixed-use urban mall, similar to Seven Points in Minneapolis. Tax-increment financing helped fund construction and the attached parking ramp built with public money used bonds that were paid off in 2015.\nThe building architect was BRW Architects, a Minneapolis-based company. Construction began in July 1987 amid a wave of interest in redeveloping land around University Avenue and the Midway neighborhood. The project was expected to cost almost $18 million with $3 million in tax increment financing. The building was designed to have 40,000 square feet (3,700\u00a0m2) in retail space and 74,000 square feet (6,900\u00a0m2) in office space. At the time the intersection of University Avenue and Snelling Avenue exceeded federal standards for carbon monoxide levels but the building was expected to help reduce concentrations by changing traffic patterns and air currents. Leasing after the initial opening was slower than expected. Vacancies were high for several years after opening.\nThe original design as a mixed-use retail and office building faltered as did many other 1980s office-retail projects. The building was sold for $1.5 million in 1992 to a Boston real estate company at the same time as the sale of Har Mar Mall. The building was again sold in 1994 with roughly half the building unoccupied. The new owners pivoted away from leasing towards retail tenants toward office space. By 1996 the building was almost 97% leased. The building is now almost exclusively office space.\nApplebee's was the first tenant of the building in September 1988. The restaurant was located in the building for 19 years until 2007. About half of the tenants in 2010 were non-profits. A major tenant is a physical therapy company that installed a pool on the first floor. The building had 30 tenants and was over 80% occupied in 2015 when it went underwent a $1.4 million renovation. The Hamline-Midway and Union Park neighborhoods groups are moving to the Spruce Tree Centre in 2024.\nArchitectural design and reception\nThe exterior is clad in green bathroom tiles imported from Germany. The green color of the tile was intended suggest natural elements at what is a very urban and busy intersection. The shape of the building looks like an abstract spruce tree. The clock tower was mandated as part of the development agreement and has 6-foot long clock arms. The family logo for Marie and Harold Slawik was a spruce tree. Marie was surprised at the amount of green on the building and despite wishing the building appeared less green, thought the building was beautiful.\nReception of the architectural design of the building has been mixed with the unique look and design often highlighted. The building has been described as having \"grotesque green architecture\" and Reuters described the building as the 4th ugliest in the world in 2011. A Chicago Tribune columnist described it as a 1980s version of the Emerald City that \"almost forces residents to look at it\". Star Tribune readers identified it as the 7th ugliest building in the Twin Cities in 2000. One reader commented that it \"personified bad taste\" and looked \"like a tawdry example of what a bus station's tiled restroom would look like.\" Others have described it as \"spectacularly, ambitiously ugly\". Architectural critic Larry Millett described mixed feelings about the design but suggested the building deserved respect for making a statement and having the most architectural presence of buildings at ",

The second category is supported men, whom the females alienate as their suitors... we can notice in her novels interactions between realism and fantasy...  another feature in her novels is presenting the plots from the character's point of view.

    "Belgian painter (1902\u20131992)\nMax Moreau (1902\u20131992) was a Belgian painter. He worked mainly in North Africa and in southern Spain, specialising in portraiture. He died in Granada in 1992, bequeathing his entire estate to the city. His home in the Albaic\u00edn is now a museum commemorating his life and work, the Carmen de Los Geranios, Centro Cultural Max Moreau.\nLife and works\nMax Leo Moreau was born in Soignies, Belgium on 2 September 1902, the son of an artist. Entirely self-taught, although he did receive training in draughtsmanship from his father, at the end of World War I Moreau moved with his family to Paris where he gained employment as a set designer and formed a strong friendship with the actor and director, Denis d'In\u00e8s. In 1928 Moreau married F\u00e9licie Leclercq, and the next year they travelled to Tunisia, beginning a lifelong mutual appreciation of the Moorish culture of North Africa and southern Spain. They lived in France during World War II, and at its end travelled extensively in Morocco, the Caribbean, America and Europe, with Moreau frequently painting portraits of the leading members of the social circles in which they found themselves. In 1966, they settled in Granada, Spain, purchasing a property in the historic Albaic\u00edn district, the Carmen de los Geranios (House of the Geraniums). The house was dilapidated at the time of their purchase, and the Moreaus devoted much time and effort to its reconstruction.\nIn addition to his society portraiture, from which he earned a great deal of money, Moreau specialised in Realist portraits of the inhabitants of the Northern Africa cities he visited, and of Granada, where he finally settled. Moreau held his last exhibition in 1981 and his final decade was marred by Parkinson's disease.\nMoreau died in 1992, on the day of his birth, 2 September, at the age of 90. He bequeathed his entire estate to the city of Granada. His home is now a museum dedicated to his life and works, the Centro Cultural Max Moreau. The museum opened in 1998 and consists of the painter's house, accommodation for his housekeeper, his study/studio, gardens and an orchard. His studio contains a permanent exhibition of some of the best examples of his work.\nGallery\nCarmen de Los Geranios\nThe studio\nThe Music Room\nF\u00e9licie Moreau\nPortrait of a man\nPortrait of an Arab\nNotes\n^ F\u00e9licie Moreau (1905-1996) died at Los Geranios on 8 December 1996.\n^ Moreau and his wife reportedly undertook over 1,000 foreign excursions during the course of their marriage.\n",

The display comprised twenty-five turntables, each resonating with live sounds from cases of black Americans who died at the hands of law enforcement. The exhibition was designed as an ongoing project, with plans to incorporate new instances of police brutality as they occurred.  The audio recordings varied, encompassing live readings of the incidents leading to deaths as well as readings of court transcripts. Among the recordings was audio of the police shooting Alton Sterling, captured from police bodycam footage, and audio from a Facebook Live recording documenting the death of Philando Castille, both incidents occurring in 2016. Following the dismissal of the museum director, Kimberli Meyers, woods paused the installation in protest.\nAndy Warhol: Polaroids (2023)\nIn 2008, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts gifted the UAM 152 of Andy Warhol's prints and polaroids from 1974 to 1985, including portraits of famous figures like O.J. Simpson, Dennis Hopper, and Lana Turner.

Centered on the East Side of New York City during the 1980s and '90s, the exhibition showcased a dynamic mix of photographs, drawings, paintings, and multimedia that provided an intimate portrayal of drag performers\u2019 everyday experiences. Among the exhibits is a quilt panel crafted by the CSULB Theater Arts Department in 1992, serving as a tribute to seven department members who passed due to AIDS-related causes. This panel has since become a part of the National AIDS Memorial.\nControversies\nDirector firing\nIn an email to museum staff, the then-museum director Kimberli Meyer advised addressing concerns about the exhibit based on their race and the race of the concerne",

    "Not to be confused with Battle of White Sulphur Springs.\nThe Battle of Sulphur Springs was an ambush by members of the 1st California Cavalry Battalion on the Chiricahua in Sulphur Springs Valley , Arizona. It was the only engagement fought in General Mason campaign against Cochise 1865\u20131866.\nBackground\nGeneral Mason was planning a campaign against Cochise that involved the soldiers of Fort Mason. This Included men of the 7th California Infantry Regiment and the 1st California Cavalry Battalion.\nMost of Native Cavalry's service in the Arizona Territory had not engage in combat with the Apache. Many of the Californios had never seen any Apache, they would only get a brief look at them. The only time they fought was just a skirmish that Captain Jimemo gave an account of \"killing one Apache in a brief exchange in October.\" Cochise was being very elusive in the area because of the troop increase with General Mason's appearance in Arizona.\nMason's campaign against Cochise called for troops from Fort Mason and Bowie to conduct a campaign against the Chiricahua Apaches. Colonel Lewis's lead it with men from the 1st Battalion and his own 7th. They left Fort Mason in December with the 7th Regiment of New York Volunteers flag flying overhead.\nBattle\nIn late December they split into three detachments that scouted the San Pedro Valley and the Huachuca and Dragoon Mountains. Captain Jimeno's cavalry followed a party of Apaches to an encampment at Sulphur Springs on Christmas Eve. \"Attacking from ambush, the Californios killed one Indian, wounded two others, and scattered the remainder.\"\nAftermath\nDays after the ambush, Colonel Lewis and the rest of the expedition united with Jimeno's Cavalry at the ambush site. Heading north and west, the California Volunteers headed to Fort Bowie. By the 6 of January, command was in the field again, trailing Cochise's band in the Chiricahua Mountains. Although at one point the Californios observed sixty to seventy warriors at a distance, the Apache constantly remained a few steps ahead of Lewis's men. The chased continued as far south as Fronteras, Sonora where Lewis turn around ending the expedition's in failure. Captain Jimeno was blamed by lewis in spite of the fact that the Lancers had the only noticeable success of the campaign.\nThis was the last battle that the Battalion took part in.\n",
    "U.S. Army officer (1867\u20131951)\nGeorge W. Kirkman mug shot made c.\u20091904 at Fort Leavenworth Prison\nGeorge W. Kirkman (February 26, 1867\u00a0\u2013 November 14, 1951) was a thrice-court-martialed U.S. Army officer. In later life Kirkman became an amateur historian of Los Angeles County, California, publishing articles about the pre-statehood and military history of the region.\nBiography\nGeorge Wycherly Kirkman was born in 1867 in Texas, the son of Joel T. Kirkman and Lucy Frances Walker. United States Military Academy Cadet Kirkman was first court-martialed, on charges of drunkenness, in 1887. He was initially to be dismissed but authorities intervened and he was sentenced to four months \"in the light prison\" instead. His Cullum number is 3319. According to the Kansas City Star, Kirkman entered West Point \"in 1884 and was graduated class of 1889. He was commissioned second lieutenant, First Infantry, June 12 in that year and joined for duty in California.\" His first service was at Angel Island. In 1895 he was married at Benicia Barracks in California to Grace Goodyear. According to a history of the Goodyear family published by Grace Goodyear Kirkman in 1899: \nHe served in the Sioux Indian campaign, in South Dakota, from Nov., 1890, to April, 1891, and organized, equipped and drilled troop G, Ogalalla Sioux Scouts, for service in that war. Served in command of a detachment on a Southern Pacific train during the Great Strike of 1894... was stationed at Fort Russell, Wyoming, until outbreak of Spanish-American War. Served throughout war in command of Co. C, 8th U.S. Infantry, in Cuba, his record at El Caney being briefly given in the following extract from the official report of his battalion commander:\n\"My battalion at El Caney had the greatest per cent. of killed and wounded, from our being only four or five hundred yards from the enemy, under a deadly fire, for seven hours, a fire more dangerous than any I experienced in the Civil War.\nIn recommending that First Lieutenant George W. Kirkman be granted the brevet of Major, for distinguished gallantry on the field of battle, I deem it only what is due him. In order to get to his position, he made a charge over an open field, in which there was not the slightest bit of cover, and advancing further than any other Company, brought his men up to within three hundred yards of the enemy's forts, leading his men with great gallantry.\nIn this charge he lost eleven men killed and wounded, and sustained during the day a loss of seventeen men out of thirty of his command.

Kirkman had apparently been drunk. He was dismissed from the Army as a result of his conviction, but Senator Hawley successfully pushed for his reinstatement. Around the same time he was also under investigation for unpaid bills due to creditors in Manila.\nGeorge Wycherly Kirkman in uniform in 1899 prior to service in the Philippines alongside his father and brother\nIn 1904 Kirkman was wanted for questioning about some bad checks, and shortly thereafter he was arrested for being AWOL. According to the Baltimore Sun, \"About a month after Captain Kirkman's arrest in Baltimore, Brig.-Gen. Frederick D. Grant preferred charges against him alleging that the Captain had been absent from his command without leave since September 23. At the time it was stated in the dispatch from Washington that bills for hundreds of dollars for furniture, said to have been destroyed by Captain Kirkman in a New York hotel, had been received at army headquarters.\" He was court-martialed again, and convicted on 31 counts. He spent roughly three years in Fort Leavenworth, primarily as penalty for misconduct charges involving the suicide of a fellow officer's wife. Meanwhile, the Kirkman marriage produced two children but ended in divorce; Grace Goodyear Kirkman died in 1909 and her sister requested custody of the children.\nIn 1916 Kirkman was remanded to the Cook County Insane Asylum, in part due to excessive alcohol consumption. Kirkman remarried in Los Angeles in 1926, to Cora E. Curtis.

    "Indian actor and singer (1899\u20131982)\nAmbrose Carlisto Piedade Fernandes (born Ambrosio Calisto Piedade Fernandes; 31 July 1899 \u2013 6 April 1982) known professionally as A. M. B. Rose, was an Indian theatre actor, singer, theatre director, and playwright who worked on the Konkani stage. One of the early character actors of the Konkani tiatr stage, he gained fame during the golden phase of tiatr from the 1930s to 1970s. The patriarch of the 'Rose family', his son Alfred Rose followed in his footsteps to become a Konkani singer. Fernandes's family talents extended to his daughter-in-law Rita Rose, who made similar contributions to the Konkani stage like her husband Alfred, which inturn helped their children to become Konkani singers.\nEarly life\nAmbrosio Calisto Piedade Fernandes was born on 31 July 1899 in the island of Calvim, Goa, which was part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire (now part of India) to Caetano Salvador Fernandes and Victoria Isabel Fernandes. He inherited his family's rich tradition of performance arts, particularly in acting and music, with his father Caetano being a respected figure in these realms. Born into a lineage of Konkani singers and writers, he hailed from a family with a musical background. His grandfather was celebrated for his proficiency in composing and arranging zagors in the Konkani language. During that period, Fernandes' father too played a significant role in the Konkani artistic community, gaining recognition for his work as a stage performer, composer, and coordinator of Konkani zagors. During his early years, Fernandes and his mother, Victoria, made a move to Karachi, British India, where his father was engaged in employment, further nurturing his exposure to diverse cultural influences.\nFernandes, also known as Kantorist Rose (transl.\u2009Singer Rose) during his formative years, was also a musician and vocalist and received his early education at St. Patrick's High School in Karachi, British India. This educational institution, administered by the Jesuit order, provided Fernandes with a comprehensive foundation in music, encompassing reading, writing, and vocal training, with an emphasis on solfeggio. Additionally, he had the privilege of studying the violin under the tutelage of popular violinists, attaining a mastery of the instrument. He had the unique opportunity to undergo musical training under the tutelage of distinguished musicians in Karachi during that period. Fernandes' musical talent did not go unnoticed by the Jesuit priests at St. Patrick's High School, who were impressed by his abilities. Recognizing his potential, they offered him a singular opportunity to showcase his vocal prowess in a school concert. Fernandes delivered a memorable performance that exceeded all expectations, demonstrating his musical abilities. He demonstrated a commitment to the trust and confidence bestowed upon him by his Jesuit superiors. As a result, his fellow students bestowed upon him the moniker \"Kantorist Rose\", acknowledging his talent as a singer. During this period, the Jesuit priests granted Fernandes a stage name that would accompany him throughout his career: A. M. B. Rose. Derived from his first name, the initials A. M. B. represented his individuality as a performer. Fernandes embraced this stage name with great reverence, and it became his professional identity, forever associated with his musical achievements.\nCareer\nIn 1919, during the theatrical tour of Karachi, British India by Saib Rocha's Union Jack Dramatic Company, a Konkani tiatr titled Noketr Italia Xarachem (A Star  from the city of Italy) captivated young Fernandes. This experience ignited Fernandes' desire to contribute to the tiatr tradition, leading him to embark on the creation of his own script, eventually resulting in the production of Comedy of Errors vo Gondoll Zunvlleam Bhavancho. With dedication, Fernandes crafted the script until its completion. The inaugural staging of Comedy of Errors vo Gondoll Zunvlleam Bhavancho took place at the Goa Portuguese Association Hall in Karachi. During his time as the Mayor of Karachi, B. F. Cabral, who originated from Chimbel-Ribandar in Goa (then part of Portuguese India during Portuguese Empire), attended a tiatr performance by Fernandes. Cabral was impressed by Fernandes' talents in acting, singing, and directing, leading him to invite Fernandes to direct three of his own tiatrs: Gabriel Balcheanv Ani Tachi Sasumaim (Gabriel Balcheao and his Mother-in-law), A Conquista de Goa (The Conquest of Goa), and Inocent Hermione.\nFrom left to right: Miss Carlota, Jacinto Vaz, Bartlu, Fernandes (extreme right), and C. Alvares, performing in the tiatr Dubavi Gorcarn\nFernandes' artistic prowess shone through in each of those tiatrs, earning him acclaim and establishing his reputation throughout Karachi. Fernandes made history by being the inaugural Goan artist to perform at The Palace Theatre in Karachi, a venue traditionally restricted to European theater tro",

    "Canada-born American electrical engineer and inventor (1857\u20131932)\nCyprien O. Mailloux (July 30, 1857 \u2013 October 4, 1932) American electrical engineer and inventor. He served terms of office as president of the International Electrotechnical Commission and as president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers between 1913 and 1914,. He was also an editor of the \u2018\u2019Electrical World\u2019\u2019 journal, and supported the standardization of technical terms.\nEarly life and education\nCyprien Odilon Mailloux was born in L'Acadie, Quebec in 1857. His mother Helene \"Ellen\" Guernon and father Jean-Baptiste \"John\" Mailloux were of French descent who migrated to the US during the Quebec diaspora. At a young age, his family relocated to Lowell, Massachusetts, Boston then New York City.\nIn 1905, he obtained his bachelor's degree from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute before receiving MSc in electrical engineering. In pursuit of professional learning, he was one of the leading pupils of Dr. M. I. Pupin, who was a lecturer on advanced theory of electrical engineering at Columbia University.\nCareer\nAfter graduation, Mailloux established himself as a professional electrical engineer and inventor. In December 1891, Mailloux filed an application to patent a system of power distribution. It was granted on August 31, 1893, as Canadian patent number 44129. This system used both alternating current (ac) and direct current (dc) for reasons that are related to what has become known as \"the battle of the currents\" that was taking place at that time.\nDuring his early career, Mailloux designed very complex dc power systems for large buildings, many of them in New York City where he maintained his office. These included the original Astoria Hotel (on the site now occupied by the Empire State Building), the Park Row Building in downtown Manhattan, Aeolian Hall, formerly on 42nd Street, and the New York Life Insurance Building.\nMailloux developed the \"booster\" to be used in these kinds of systems. This refers to an assembly made up of a DC motor running off the power system itself and a low voltage DC generator. To provide the required increase in charging voltage throughout the charging cycle, the booster generator could be connected in series with the batteries. The battery discharge circuitry might then utilize the same booster in reverse to slightly reduce the voltage in order to prolong the life of the bulb. The booster can also be connected to both the motor (power) system and the lighting system in order to maintain two separate voltages at the same time. Moreover, it could be applied to \"boost\" the voltage on feeders on upper levels of a building.\nBy the late 1880s, Mailloux had become a respected and well-known consulting electrical engineer. He teamed up with Benjamin Tingley Rogers and patent lawyer Paul Wilcox to establish the Casamajor Filter Co., posthumously named after chemist Paul Casamajor for sugar filtration.\nPatents\nMailloux made at least 100 original inventions, more than 30 of which had been patented.\nWritings\nBesides his patents, Mailloux did expert work, and submitted testimony, reports, and arbitrations in over 1,000 cases. He became the editor of trade journal Electrical World and remained a frequent contributor to technical literature.\nHe presented papers at the annual convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. He also translated several books from various languages that contributed to the establishment of the Engineering Societies Library in New York City.\nThe induction motor; its theory and design, set forth by a practical method of calculation, McGraw, 1903\nThe induction motor; its theory and design, set forth by a practical method of calculation, McGraw, 1906\nMethode de determination du courant constant produisant le meme \u00e9chauffement qu'un courant variable, Tipografia Baravalle e Falconieri, 1911\nGraphical determination of sags and stresses for overhead line construction, McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., 1915\nStandard specifications and tests for Portland cement, Government printing office, 1921\nAs well, he worked on French translation of documents from the American Society for Testing and Materials.\nCahier des charges normalis\u00e9 pour essieux en acier lamin\u00e9 \u00e0 froid, Imprimerie du gouvernement, 1921\nCahier des charges normalis\u00e9 pour fil de cuivre demi-\u00e9croui, Washington, Imprimerie du gouvernement, 1921\nCahier des charges normalis\u00e9 pour tubes en fer forg\u00e9 soud\u00e9s, Imprimerie du gouvernement, 1921\nCahier des charges normalis\u00e9 pour tuyaux et pi\u00e8ces moul\u00e9es sp\u00e9ciales en fonte, Imprimerie du gouvernement, 1921\nOrganizations\nIn 1884, Mailloux became a charter member of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

    "1992 aviation accident\nOn 20 July 1992, a Tupolev Tu-154B cargo plane crashed during takeoff from Tbilisi-Novo Alexeyevka Airport in Georgia. The aircraft failed to become airborne and struck a residential area, killing all 24 on board and four more people on the ground. An investigation revealed that the aircraft's cargo was improperly loaded and partially undocumented, causing it to become overloaded. \nAircraft\nThe Tupolev Tu-154B aircraft was manufactured in 1977 with the serial number 4L-85222. It was powered by three Kuznetsov NK-8-2U turbofan engines. The aircraft had previously been operated by Russian airline Aeroflot. During the 1980 Summer Olympics, it bore the Official Olympic Carrier livery.\nFlight\nThe cargo flight operated either by Transair Georgia or Tbilisi Aviation Enterprise was scheduled from Tbilisi in Georgia to Russia's Mineralnye Vody, carrying tea. The aircraft was carrying eight crew and sixteen passengers; none of the passengers had tickets and did not receive official permission to be on the flight.\nThe aircraft began its takeoff procedure on runway 31L. While the nose gear lifted off the runway at V1 speed, the main landing gears failed to become airborne. The nose only reached an angle of 6\u20137\u00b0. It rolled past the runway and continued for about 490\u00a0m (1,610\u00a0ft) before barrelling into a localizer. The impact caused the aircraft to roll over. After traveling for another 190\u00a0m (620\u00a0ft), it impacted homes in the village of Alekseevka and caught fire. Everyone on board died, along with four people on the ground, although Georgian media said there were as many as 30 ground fatalities. Ten people on the ground were also injured.\nInvestigation\nOfficials began suspecting the crash was due to overloading as the aircraft failed to lift off the ground. The investigation revealed that the flight crew and ground personnel at the cargo warehouse had violated regulations for loading cargo. Twenty tons of cargo was present on board, exceeding the maximum allowed weight. The loading of cargo was also improperly done and not all the cargo was recorded; flight documents only recorded 6.4 tons. The cargo placement also violated the Tu-154B's alignment standards. Three tons of load was added without the crew's knowledge, overloading the aircraft by two tons. This altered the aircraft's center of gravity.\nThe airport transport management and cargo warehouse was a single corporation before separating into two different entities; the airport management did not oversee cargo flights although this arrangement was not officially removed. The airport loading and balance controllers ceased operations for cargo flights while the warehouse company (Lasare) did not provide such services as they did not have relevant employees. As a result, the loading of cargo went unmonitored.\n",
    "Genus of lichens\nPseudotopeliopsis is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae. It has two species.\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was circumscribed in 2012 by the lichenologists Sittiporn Parnmen, Robert L\u00fccking, and H. Thorsten Lumbsch. They assigned Pseudotopeliopsis laceratula as the type species; this lichen was originally named as a member of genus Thelotrema by Johannes M\u00fcller Argoviensis in 1887. The genus name is derived from the Greek word pseudo, meaning \"false\", combined with the name Topeliopsis, alluding to its resemblance to that genus.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Pseudotopeliopsis typically has dense outer layer, or cortex. The apothecia (fruiting bodies) emerge from the thallus and are rounded to irregularly shaped. These apothecia feature a disc that resembles a small pore and is covered by concentrically layered, fissured, and lobulated margins. The surrounding tissue of the apothecia, known as the excipulum, varies from colourless to brown.\nThe spores of Pseudotopeliopsis are elongated, ranging from fusiform-ellipsoid to oblong-cylindrical in shape, and are divided by cross walls (septa) that may be slightly thickened and form angular spaces within the spore. These spores are initially colourless and can turn brown as they age. They do not react to staining with iodine solution.\nChemically, this genus does not produce any notable secondary metabolites (lichen products) that are detectable with standard chemical spot tests. Pseudotopeliopsis is distinct from the closely related genus Chapsa primarily due to its denser cortex and the unique structure of its apothecia, which resemble those of the genus Topeliopsis with their striated tissue filling the disc\u2013a distinctive structural feature that sets it apart from similar genera.\nSpecies\nPseudotopeliopsis laceratula (M\u00fcll.Arg.) Parnmen, L\u00fccking & Lumbsch (2012)\nPseudotopeliopsis longispora Papong, L\u00fccking & Parnmen (2015)\nAlthough the genus was originally circumscribed with four species, three of those have since been transferred to other genera:\nPseudotopeliopsis aggregata (Hale) Parnmen, L\u00fccking & Lumbsch (2012) is now Nitidochapsa aggregata\nPseudotopeliopsis scabiocarpa (Rivas Plata & L\u00fccking) Parnmen, L\u00fccking & Lumbsch (2012) is now Chapsa scabiocarpa\nPseudotopeliopsis scabiomarginata (Hale) Parnmen, L\u00fccking & Lumbsch (2012) is now Chapsa scabiomarginata.\n",

She has worked for some of the most important media outlets in the country, including El Espectador, El Tiempo, and the magazine Semana, where she was employed from 2008 to 2020. From 2020 to 2021, she was a host on Caracol Radio's La W. She has also written for international publications. She is known for her criticism of the \u00c1lvaro Uribe government (2002\u20132010).\nBiography\nMar\u00eda Jimena Duz\u00e1n was born in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, in 1959. She began writing at age 16, when she wrote a tribute to her deceased father, newspaper columnist Lucio Duz\u00e1n, and submitted it to the then-director of El Espectador, Guillermo Cano. Cano published the piece and gave her a column in the paper titled \"Mi hora cero\" (\"My Zero Hour\"), making her one of the country's youngest columnists. Duz\u00e1n went on to study political science at the University of the Andes and in Paris, where she also worked as a foreign correspondent.\nShe kept working for El Espectador, reporting for its investigations team and continuing to write her opinion column. Her mention Guillermo Cano was assassinated in 1986, apparently in connection with his investigations into drug trafficking gangs, and Duz\u00e1n received death threats in response to her columns. In 1989, El Espectador was the target of a terrorist attack by one of the drug gangs. The following year, her sister, fellow journalist Silvia Duz\u00e1n, was assassinated at age 30 in Cimitarra, along with three others, by a paramilitary group. She had been covering political violence in the Middle Magdalena Valley for the BBC. Later that year, Mar\u00eda Jimena Duz\u00e1n was given a Courage Award from the International Women's Media Foundation, which she dedicated to her sister and others who have given their lives for democracy. In 1994, she published the book Death Beat: A Colombian Journalist's Life Inside the Cocaine Wars, in which she recollects her days as a reporter for El Espectador, and in 2010 she more directly addressed her sister's death in the book Mi viaje al infierno.\nBack at the University of the Andes, Duz\u00e1n founded the country's first postgraduate journalism degree, which she oversaw for five years. In this period, she was chosen for a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University. She wrote for various international publications including the Wall Street Journal, Newsday, and Marie Claire. For three years, she worked as a Colombian consul in Barcelona.\nFrom 1992 to 1993, Duz\u00e1n wrote for the magazine Semana, then later as a columnist for the newspaper El Tiempo, before returning to Semana in 2008. In her later stint at Semana, which lasted until 2020, she contributed as both a reporter and a columnist, and hosted the weekly program Semana en Vivo. In this period she was notably critical of \u00c1lvaro Uribe's presidency, publishing the critical book As\u00ed gobierna Uribe in 2004. After the magazine was acquired by the Gillinsky Group and its editorial direction changed significantly, Duz\u00e1n quit alongside many of her colleagues.

In one of the barns she discovers a wounded young German soldier, Werner Bracht, whom she tries to get out, but he soon dies anyway.

One day they find the burnt remains of Mary's husband and son. The woman buries them with the help of her adopted children. Soon the time comes for Mary to give birth.

    "Spanish engineer, lawyer, and politician\nPedro Vives Vich (20 January 1858 \u2013 9 March 1938) was a Spanish military engineer, politician, and aerial observer, who was the main pioneer of Spanish ballooning and aviation, both military and civil. In 1896, Vives was made head of the Servicios de Aerostaci\u00f3n\u00a0 (\"Aerostation Services\"), and at his suggestion, the army adopted the kite-type ballon and then had it built in Guadalajara. He was the first Spaniard to fly in an airplane in 1909. He served as the first Chief of the Spanish Air Force, which was founded in 1913 at his request.\nHe was also a publicist, and as such, he directed several technical studies, directed military works (in the Pyrenees, Lleida, Cuba, Morocco), including the First Melillan campaign in 1893. In Africa, he not only participated in war flights, but also created new aerodromes. He later became the military governor of Cartagena in 1922\u201323, and then as the Development Minister of Spain between 1923 and 1925. He left an enormous and multifaceted technical work for the beginning of Spanish aviation and for the modernization of the public works of the State.\nEarly and education\nPedro Vives was born in Igualada, Catalonia, on 20 January 1858, as the son of Pedro Vives Ram\u00f3n and Irene Vich Picornell. He was born into a family of small businessmen, owners of cotton spinning and weaving factories located in Igualada and Manresa. He was known as Pere familiarly, the Catalan version of his name. The Vives family took their three sons, Jaime, Francisco, and Pedro, to a boarding school in Manresa, run by the Jesuits, where they attended high school.\nWhen Pedro finished school, he chose to become a military engineer, going to Guadalajara to prepare for the Academy of Engineers, which he entered in 1874. A very diligent student with impeccable conduct, he received his lieutenant's office four years later, in 1878, where he finished his degree as number 1 in his class. His first assignment was at the Las Vascongadas, in the Mining Sappers Regiment.\nMilitary career\nFirst positions and stints in Paris, Cuba, and US\nIn May 1878, the general director of the Arma gave him a Service Commission for one month to visit the Universal Exhibition in Paris, where his interest in the advances in technology and science of his time led him to identify with its most modern achievements. Upon his return, Vives began his life as a sapper-miner, in the 4th Regiment in the Northern Army, where in addition to commanding troops and other jobs, he carried out fortification work (one of his specialties) on the Pyrenean and Aragonese borders (Canfranc and Jaca) and later he took care of defense work on the French border in Navarre. He was promoted to captain in 1880 and was assigned to Cartagena, where he stayed for a short time, as he was then assigned to Madrid and later to Barcelona.\nIn 1881, Vives volunteered for Cuba, serving in the Santa Clara Engineer Command, but he only remained there for three years due to being uncomfortable in garrison life. Before returning to Spain in 1884, he requested a six-month leave of absence to move to the United States, with the aim of perfecting his English, and expanding his technical and scientific knowledge in San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and other cities; while there, he made his living as an engineer. In this country, he studied mechanical traction in trams, and as a result of this experience he published in the Memorial de Ingenieros (Memorial of Engineers) an article called \"Trams moved by underground cables\" which, due to its originality, aroused great expectation among technicians. He also participated in installing the Spanish pavilion at the 1884 Boston International Exposition, of the objectives that the Spanish Artillery contributed to the event.\nMilitary works in Lleida, C\u00e1diz, and Melilla (1884\u20131895)\nAfter returning to Spain in 1884, Vives was assigned to the Lleida Engineer Command, which was one of the most fruitful stages of his professional activity. He studied the border area with France, focusing his attention on the Val d'Aran, where he intervened in the layout of the road from Viella to the French border, thoroughly studying the possibilities of constructing a tunnel as the only means of saving the Val d'Aran from the total isolation to which he was condemned during the winter. It was an enormous work that everyone considered a utopia; all except Vives, who years later held the position of Undersecretary of Development in the board of directors of General Primo de Rivera, and from that position, he promoted the work of the tunnel, six kilometers long, until it was completely drilled.\nIn 1887, for health reasons, he began to provide his services in the Campo de Gibraltar in the province of C\u00e1diz, where in Tarifa, he designed the fortifications and sites to defend the Strait of Gibraltar. A year later, he was assigned to the Malaga Engineer Command, where he created and developed a military dovecote, which went on t",
    "Orthodox church in Koterka, Poland\nChurch in Koterka, Poland\nThe Joy of All Who Sorrow Church is an Orthodox church in Koterka (a parish in Tokary), in the Siemiatycze deanery of the Orthodox Diocese of Warsaw\u2013Bielsko of the Polish Orthodox Church.\nThe Orthodox parish in Tokary was established no later than the 16th century; from the 17th century until 1839, it was a Uniate building. In the mentioned year, it was incorporated into the Russian Orthodox Church under the provisions of the Synod of Polotsk. The church in Koterka was built between 1909 and 1912 as a filial temple of this parish, on the site where a Mary apparition was supposed to have occurred in 1852. It was not recognized by the Russian Orthodox Church, yet pilgrims visited the site, and miraculous healings were said to have occurred. In 1906, Bishop Micha\u0142 of Grodno approved the construction of a church at this location, which was financed by the believers' donations. In 1948, due to the division of the village of Tokary following the delineation of the Polish-Soviet border, the church became the parish church. Despite the depopulation of the surrounding villages, it remains an important pilgrimage destination.\nThe church is located in a forest, near the settlement of Koterka, in the area of the same name, also called by the faithful the Holy Place.\nHistory\nThe Orthodox parish in Tokary is first mentioned at the end of the 16th century. In 1592, its church was described as \"ancient\". The parish operated within the structures of the Diocese of Volodymyr\u2013Brest and later Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Volodymyr\u2013Brest (the moment of the parish's transition to the Union is not established). The parish in Tokary was reintegrated into the Orthodox Church following the decisions of the Synod of Polotsk in 1839, along with all the other Uniate outposts in Podlachia. Earlier, in 1816, a new parish church was built in Tokary.\nEvents of 1852 and development of the cult\nThe construction of the church in Koterka, subordinate to the temple in Tokary, occurred in connection with an apparition of Mary that was said to have taken place on the Feast of the Holy Trinity in 1852. The Virgin Mary was said to have appeared to a local peasant girl named Eufrozyna Iwaszczuk in the Koterka glade, where she was gathering sorrel instead of going to church on the holy day. As Iwaszczuk recounted, Mary announced that the feast had been established for prayer in the temple on that day, not for work. She also foretold that the sins of the villagers would be punished by a pestilential air. She instructed Iwaszczuk to go to the parson and tell him to pray with the parishioners for forgiveness of sins. The parson of Tokary, Symon Budi\u0142owicz, erected a cross in the glade. This place began to attract numerous pilgrims, not only Orthodox, and reports of miraculous healings emerged.\nTo determine whether the events in Koterka were a miracle according to the church, a special commission was appointed in June 1852 by the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania. In September of the same year, it concluded that no miracle had occurred. The parson of Tokary, who had encouraged pilgrimage to the glade even before the verdict, was removed from his position. The cross placed in Koterka was ordered to be moved to the local Orthodox cemetery. However, pilgrimages did not cease, and healings were still reported. Those coming to Tokary considered the spring that appeared at the site where the cross originally stood as miraculous. Particularly numerous pilgrims arrived in Tokary during the Feast of the Holy Trinity. Due to the negative opinion of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania, no services were held at the glade, and requests by parsons to build a chapel there were rejected.\nConstruction of the church\nIn 1900, the Eparchy of Grodno\u2013Brest was established, within which the parish in Tokary was included. Bishop Micha\u0142 of Grodno agreed to the development of the sanctuary in Koterka in 1906. On 9 May 1909, the foundation stone was laid for the construction of the temple at the glade.\nThe construction of the church lasted for three years and was financed by donations. Anna Briantseva from Kazan, who claimed to have been healed in Koterka, donated liturgical utensils worth over 1,200 rubles to the temple. The forester from Mielnik, Porecki, donated wood from 264 pine trees for construction. The Administration of Agricultural and State Estates in Grodno allocated the rest of the wood for half of its value (600 rubles). Assistance also came from the parish in Mielnik. On 29 July 1912, the completed church was dedicated by the abbot of the St. Onuphrius Monastery in Jab\u0142eczna, Archimandrite Seraphim, who replaced Bishop Vladimir of Bia\u0142ystok, who was originally invited to the ceremony. The parish chronicle records that a significant group of faithful were present at the dedication. In 1915, Orthodox residents of Tokary fled during World War I, causing the local parish activity to cease.\nFunctioni",

    "1991 song by Johnny Hates Jazz\n\"Let Me Change Your Mind Tonight\" is a song by British pop band Johnny Hates Jazz, released in 1991 as the lead single from their second studio album, Tall Stories (1991). The song was written by Phil Thornalley and was produced by Calvin Hayes and Mike Nocito. It reached number 101 in the UK Singles Chart.\nBackground\n\"Let Me Change Your Mind Tonight\" features strings by the New World Symphonia, with Del Newman as the arranger and conductor. Johnny Hates Jazz member and co-producer Calvin Hayes ensured the band held a couple of pre-production meetings with Newman before he began working on the arrangement. This was because of the band's previous experience with Anne Dudley, who did the string arrangement for the 1988 track \"Turn Back the Clock\", which the band felt suffered from the \"huge mistake\" of not holding such a meeting beforehand. Speaking of Newman's involvement in the song, Hayes recalled to Will Harris in 2021, \"He turned to Phil  and said, 'I want to know exactly what the chords are', so Phil showed him every single note and chord. By the time we did the string arrangement, there were no notes or chords that clashed. We'd done our homework!\"\nRelease\nThe single was originally scheduled for release on 13 May, but this was pushed back to 20 May. The song failed to reach the top 100 of the UK Singles Chart and reached its peak of number 101 on 15 June 1991. It gained enough airplay to reach number 50 in the Music Week Playlist Chart on 8 June 1991.\nCritical reception\nUpon its release as a single, Marcus Hodge of the Cambridge Evening News commented, \"It opens with the word 'baby' but then develops into a far more interesting record than we had any right to expect. There's a bit of George Michael in here, and even a hint of Talk Talk. They lost their singer some time ago but don't appear to be suffering too much.\" Andrew Hirst of the Huddersfield Daily Examiner wrote, \"The wonderful wailing guitar work makes the worn-out aura seem even more world-weary. Genteel and refined, compact and, yes, bijou.\" Barbara Ellen of New Musical Express was critical of the song, describing it as \"nasty, cheap, coffee table pop\". She added, \"The video will doubtless feature some gormless model charging \u00a31000 an hour to look 'tragic' and cross and uncross her legs in a dimly lit winebar.

    "Football club\nAskania Bernburg is a German football club based in the city of Bernburg, located in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The club was founded on March 15, 1909, and has a rich history in regional football competitions.\nHistory\nEarly years\nAskania Bernburg was established in 1909 as FC Askania 09 Bernburg. The club initially played friendly matches against other local teams before joining competitive leagues. In the early years, Askania Bernburg primarily participated in local and regional competitions in Saxony-Anhalt.\nPost-War era\nFollowing World War II, Askania Bernburg faced challenges due to the political and social changes in the region. The club managed to rebuild and resumed its football activities in regional leagues. Throughout the post-war era, Askania Bernburg competed in various divisions of German football.\nRise to prominence\nIn the 1990s, Askania Bernburg experienced success and achieved several promotions, climbing up the German football league system. The club reached its peak in the early 2000s when it competed in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord, the fourth tier of German football at the time.\nRecent years\nIn recent years, Askania Bernburg has participated in regional leagues, including the Landesliga Sachsen-Anhalt. The club has maintained a presence in regional football and continues to compete against other teams in Saxony-Anhalt.\nOn July 25, 1952, the state parliament of Saxony-Anhalt passed the \u201cLaw on the further democratization, structure and functioning of state bodies in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.\u201d This meant the dissolution of the previous state into the districts of Magdeburg and Halle and thus the formation of the Bernburg district in the Halle district. The result was the definition of new leagues. The first team of BSG Empor Bernburg became a founding member of the third-class Halle district league, which consists of a total of 12 teams. Below the district league there were the district and district classes, above the upper league and the DS league.\nIn 1952 the club was renamed BSG Chemie Bernburg. As early as 1954 he was relegated from the district league. When competitive sports were separated from popular sports in 1954, all sports associations except SV Medizin and SV Post founded a sports club (SC), sometimes several. The chemistry, glass and ceramics union sector founded SC Chemie Halle-Leuna, today's SV Halle, in what was then the district town of Halle (Saale).\nIn 1957, BSG Chemie Bernburg, together with Stahl Helbra, managed to return to the district's top division, which this time was held for nine years until 1966. The best results were the runner-up championships won in 1959 and 1963 behind Motor Aschersleben and HSG Wissenschaft Halle, with which Chemie Bernburg narrowly failed to gain promotion to the Second GDR League.\nIn the period that followed, it was no longer possible to return to the district league; the BSG only appeared in the Halle district league until 1991. In 1990 the club renamed itself Askania Bernburg. From 1994 to 2014, Askania Bernburg operated consistently between the Saxony-Anhalt Association League and the state league. In 2014, as runners-up, they celebrated promotion to the fifth-class Oberliga Nordost and benefited from the renunciation of the champions BSV Halle-Amendorf\nStadium\nAskania Bernburg plays its home matches at the Sparkassen Arena.\nSee also\nList of football clubs in Germany\n",
    "Table-oriented programming (TOP) is a data-focused programming paradigm (as opposed to code-focused), part of the data-oriented group of paradigms.\nThere are three main subtypes of table-oriented programming:\nGeneral-purpose TOP languages with tables built in (xBase)\nSpreadsheets\nRelational database languages: Domain-specific tabular languages, often on a remote server, such as SQL\nHistory\nMainframe era: 1960s\u20131978\nDuring this era, table-oriented programming was called decision table programming.\nThe earliest known reference to Decision table programming is DETAB-X, in October 1962.  This led to languages such as Filetab in the late 60s, whose descendants continued in the 70s and 80s.\nThe spreadsheet stream of TOP seems to have begun in 1969, with LANPAR.\nThe relational database concept  was defined by E. F. Codd at IBM in 1970.\nPC era: 1978\u20131995\nThe general-purpose TOP languages during this era, when the paradigm was labelled at all, were sometimes called Data-oriented languages.  The primary languages during this era were the xBase family (including Clipper and later xHarbour), and the FoxPro family.\nThis was also an era of rising popularity for spreadsheets.  From the release of VisiCalc in 1979, and continuing to Lotus 1-2-3 and the rise of Microsoft Excel, spreadsheets followed the rise of the personal computer in popularity.\nDuring this era, early versions were released of Oracle (1977 onwards), Ingres (1980s), and other Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs).\nWeb 1.0 era: 1995\u20132008\nDuring the Web 1.0 era, the general-purpose TOP stream fell into disuse.  The reasons were twofold.  One was that the languages didn't move to capitalise on the web the way others such as Java did.  The second was the rise in popularity of object-oriented programming.  While the code-focused languages gave birth to object-oriented descendants (e.g. C to C++ et al., Lisp to CLOS), the TOP languages never did so.  While they had superior data-handling facilities, their code-handling facilities didn't compete with the object-oriented languages.\nOne contributing factor was advocacy by Bryce Jacobs (using the aliases Tablizer and TOPMind); the oppositional nature of these interactions led to TOP being dismissed as inferior to OOP (whereas the concepts of TOP could be quite useful within an object-oriented programming context), and his many valid points being dismissed by those not willing to spend the time deciphering his points.  He does, however, seem to have been the first to use the name \"table-oriented programming\", which is the most accurate label for the paradigm.\nThis was an era of consolidation for spreadsheets; Microsoft Excel became the de facto standard, and was eventually left without competitors.\nOn the relational database front, this was the era when MySQL (1995) and PostgreSQL (1996) became popular.\nWeb 2.0 era: 2008\u20132022\nDuring this era, any necessary table-oriented programming was pushed into the RDBMS, and a standard separation of concerns into \"frontend\", \"backend\" and \"database\" was developed.\nSpreadsheets continued as in the previous era, except on the web.  Finally a competitor arose for Excel: Google Sheets.\nFeatures\nGeneral-purpose TOP languages share many features with other general-purpose languages.\nThe core feature of TOP is that tables be given a prominent place in the programming language.\nDesign patterns\nDecision tables\nDecision tables are a commonly used pattern, especially in the general-purpose TOP languages.  A decision table is a table with columns (usually multiple) which represent inputs, and columns (typically singular, but many be multiple) which represent the outputs.  Each set of inputs is unique, and the rows of the table should cover all possible combinations of inputs.\nControl tables\nControl tables are an expansion of decision tables; instead of having output columns, they have code stored in the table.  When the row for that decision is selected, the code stored in the table is run.\nTOP languages\nGeneral-purpose TOP languages\nDETAB-X (1962)\nFiletab (between 1965 and 1968)\nThe XBase programming language family (1986 and following)\nClarion (1986)\nSpreadsheets\nMain article: Spreadsheet\nCategory:Spreadsheet software\nLANPAR (1969)\nAutoplan/Autotab (1968) -\nVisiCalc (1979)\nSuperCalc (1980)\nMultiplan (1982)\nLotus 1-2-3 (1982)\nMicrosoft Excel (1985)\nStarOffice (1985) \u2192 OpenOffice.org (2000) \u2192 Apache OpenOffice (2012) / LibreOffice Calc (2010)\nGoogle Sheets (2006)\nRelational databases\nCategory:Database management systems\nOracle Database (1977 onwards)\nIngres (1980s)\nMySQL (1995)\nPostgreSQL (1996)\n",
    "1956 album by the George Shearing Quintet, Red Norvo Trio\nMidnight on Cloud 69 is a 1956 studio album by the George Shearing Quintet and the Red Norvo Trio.\nRecording\nThe tracks by the George Shearing Quintet (numbers 1\u20134, 7\u201310) were recorded on 31 January 1949 for Discovery Records, following the formation of the quintet that year. The Red Norvo Trio tracks were recorded in May 1950 (11, 12) and on 13 April 1951 (5, 6). The Quintet tracks were originally released as an LP by Discovery (DL3002) in 1950.\nShearing later wrote in 2004:\nAlthough it was a complete session of jazz titles\u2014it contained hardly any standards\u2014and because we played mostly originals, there was nothing for the listening public to catch on to and to understand that this was a new sound, a new approach to playing melodies. The sound was there in embryo, in fact the Quintet format was pretty well developed, but it was going to take something else for it really to catch on.He later stated that the album's title is a euphemism referring to the 69 sex position.\nReception\nA review on 27 May 1957 in Billboard wrote that the album's tracks \"have  life and swing that  commercial success of 'quintet sound' has since watered down   Norvo tracks are a matter of delightful empathy; Mingus and Farlow enmesh well with leader, and all play solos of great rhythmic and melodic interest.\" Critic John S. Wilson, in 1959, called the Trio's playing \"relatively fuzzy\", as compared to their 1950 album Move!\nGeoff Chapman summarised Shearing's contributions on the album in 1993: \"His timeless easy-on-the-ear has the delicacy of a combination of Teddy Wilson and Maurice Ravel and there's rare accompaniment in the form of vibist Marjorie Hyams and guitarist Chuck Wayne. There's Shearing originals among the eight tracks but his best work is reserved for 'Cherokee' and 'I'm Yours'.\"\nRichard Cook wrote in 1998 that the album sets Shearing \"alongside two different groups, one with Hyams, Wayne, Levy and Best, playing in the manner that brought him hits such as 'Lullaby of Birdland', the other in the more demanding company of Norvo, Farlow and Mingus, although it's hardly a cutting contest. Titles such as 'Cotton Top', 'Be Bop's Fables' and 'Night and Day' still sound cooly pleasant.\"\nShearing's piano solo on the title track has been said to have codified his \"block-chord solo style\" (sometimes called \"Shearing voicing\"), a number of years before Lennie Tristano's use of the style (exemplified on his 1956 album Lennie Tristano).\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nGeorge Shearing \u2013 piano (1\u20134, 7, 9), accordion (8, 10)\nMargie Hyams \u2013 vibraphone (1\u20134, 7, 9), piano (8, 10)\nChuck Wayne \u2013 guitar (1\u20134, 7\u201310)\nJohn Levy \u2013 bass (1\u20134, 7\u201310)\nDenzil Best \u2013 drums (1\u20134, 7\u201310)\nTal Farlow \u2013 guitar (5, 6, 11, 12)\nCharles Mingus \u2013 bass (5, 6, 11, 12)\nRed Norvo \u2013 vibraphone (5, 6, 11, 12)\n",

The club will participate in the A-League Men for the 20th consecutive season and will make their 10th consecutive appearance in the Australia Cup.\nAdelaide United's start to the season was headlined by the loss of Nestory Irankunda, who joined Bayern Munich after agreeing terms with the club in November 2023 for a record domestic Australian transfer fee and last season's top scorer, Hiroshi Ibusuki, who netted 15 goals across the 2023\u201324 season.\nSeason summary\nPre-season\nOn 10 May 2024, 20-year-old goalkeeper Ethan Cox extended his contract for a further three years. Cox was promoted from the NTC in 2019 and made 19 appearances for the NPL team in their title-winning season before making his senior debut in the final round of last season in a dead rubber match.\nOn 14 May, the departure of Ben Halloran was announced. Two days later, Hiroshi Ibusuki departed the club by mutual consent. Hiroshi was last season's top scorer with 15 goals in 26 matches and intended to remain with the club; however, his request for a longer-term deal was rejected. On 17 May, Nick Ansell, Lachlan Barr, Harry Van Der Saag, and Ben Warland were released following the expiration of their contracts.\nOn 27 May, former Dutch international Ernest Faber was announced as the club's new technical director in order to improve the club's coaching and recruitment. The announcement came a few months after a strategic partnership with PSV Eindhoven was finalised.\nOn 28 May, three Adelaide United players, Luka Jovanovic, Bailey O'Neil, and Jonny Yull, were selected for the Young Socceroos' squad for their June tour of South America. The next day, Nestory Irankunda was named as one of eight A-League Men players to feature in the Socceroos' squad for their final second round World Cup qualifiers against Bangladesh and Palestine. This was Irankunda's first official call-up to the squad, having previously joined as a train-on player in March 2023. The callup came a week after Irankunda publicly commented that he would consider his international future with other nations if he wasn't called up to the Socceroos squad, as he is eligible to represent Burundi or Tanzania.\nOn 4 June, Spaniards Isa\u00edas and Javi L\u00f3pez both signed a one-year contract extension ahead of their joint retirement at the end of the season. Isa\u00edas has had two spells at the club since 2013 and was apart of the club's title winning season as well as their subsequent FFA cup win in 2018. Both players will study for coaching badges.\nOn 6 June, 19-year-old Newcastle Jets centre-forward, Archie Goodwin, signed with Adelaide United on a four-year contract. Goodwin made his debut for Newcastle at the age of 16 and has played 44 matches in the A-League Men, scoring seven goals in that period, although he suffered numerous injuries during his four years with the Jets.\nAustralia Cup\nMain article: 2024 Australia Cup\nAdelaide United will participate in the Australia Cup for the tenth time.\nA-League Men\nMain article: 2024\u201325 A-League Men\nAdelaide United will participate in the A-League Men for the 20th time.\nCoaching staff\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

    "British colonel in the Royal Engineers and the director-general of telegraphs in India\nDaniel George Robinson (8 March 1826 \u2013 27 July 1877) was a British colonel in the Royal Engineers and the director-general of telegraphs in India.\nBiography\nRobinson was born 8 March 1826, and entered the military college of the East India Company at Addiscombe in 1841. He was appointed a second lieutenant in the Bengal engineers on 9 June 1843, and, after going through the usual course of instruction at Chatham, embarked for India in 1845. He arrived in time to join Sir Hugh Gough's army and take part in the Sutlaj campaign. He was engaged in the battle of Sobraon, and received the war medal. He was promoted first lieutenant on 16 June 1847. In 1848 and 1849 Robinson served in the Panjab campaign, and took part in the battles of Chillianwallah, 13 January 1849, and Gujer\u00e1t, 21 February 1849, again receiving the war medal. In 1850 he was appointed to the Indian survey, upon which he achieved a great reputation for the beauty and exactitude of his maps. His maps of the Rawal Pindi and of the Gwalior country may be specially mentioned. He received the thanks of the government for his book, and the surveyor-general of India observed: \u2018I have no hesitation in saying that these maps will stand in the first rank of topographical achievements in India, and I can conceive nothing superior to them executed in any country.\u2019 On 21 November 1856 Robinson was promoted captain, and on 31 Deember 1862 lieutenant-colonel.\nIn 1865 Robinson was appointed director-general of Indian telegraphs. He entered on his duties at a critical time in the development of telegraphs. During the twelve years he was at the head of the department, the telegraphs, from a small beginning, spread over India, and were connected by overland and submarine lines with England. His zeal and activity, joined to great capacity for administration and organisation, enabled him to place the Indian telegraph department on a thoroughly efficient footing, and the lines erected were executed in the most solid manner. He took a leading part in the deliberations of the commission at Berne in 1871, and of the international conferences at Rome and St. Petersburg, on telegraphic communication. He was promoted to be brevet-colonel on 31 December 1867, and regimental colonel on 1 April 1874.

He served as the first permanent clerk of the Australian House of Representatives from 1901 to 1917 and then clerk of the Australian Senate from 1917 to 1920.\nEarly life\nGavan Duffy was born on 27 August 1855 in Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland. He was the son of Susan (n\u00e9e Hughes) and Charles Gavan Duffy, a prominent Irish politician. His siblings and half-siblings included John, Frank, Louise and George.\nGavan Duffy's parents moved to Australia in 1856, where his father continued his political career and briefly served as premier of Victoria in the early 1870s. He was sent to England in 1865 to attend Stonyhurst, later returning to Australia where he completed his secondary education at St Patrick's College, East Melbourne. He later studied law part-time and graduated Bachelor of Laws from the University of Melbourne in 1880, although he never practised as a lawyer.\nPublic service\nGavan Duffy joined the colonial public service in 1871 in the Chief Secretary's Office, serving as personal secretary to his father as premier. He remained in the post under his father's three successors as premier, before in 1878 taking up an appointment at the Victorian Legislative Assembly as assistant clerk of committees. He was private secretary to several speakers of the Legislative Assembly.\nGavan Duffy \"developed an exceptional knowledge of parliamentary procedure\". He was appointed clerk-assistant of the Legislative Assembly in 1891. His publications included Speakers' Rulings 1856\u20137 to 1893 (1894), a compendium of rulings encompassing debate, petitions, and unparliamentary language, and Index to Resolutions Passed in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria (1898). In the lead-up to the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, Gavan Duffy acted as assistant-clerk to the 1898 Australasian Federal Convention in Melbourne. He assisted Robert Garran in preparing the final amendments to the final draft of the federal constitution adopted by the convention.\nFederal Parliament\nAfter Federation in 1901, Gavan Duffy was initially appointed as the inaugural clerk-assistant of the Senate, under Edwin Gordon Blackmore. Following the lapse of George Henry Jenkins' interim appointment, he was instead appointed clerk of the Australian House of Representatives on 8 July 1901.\nIn July 1909, Gavan Duffy announced in parliament the death of Speaker Frederick Holder, who had collapsed in the middle of a parliamentary sitting. Pursuant to the standing orders at the time, he assumed the chair when the House met to elect a new speaker. Due to the heated parliamentary atmosphere following the fusion of the anti-socialist parties, the election of Liberal MP Carty Salmon as Holder's successor took several hours. Gavan Duffy at point exercised a casting vote against an adjournment and came under personal attack. Prime Minister Alfred Deakin subsequently thanked him for \"the able manner in which he discharged his duties under extremely trying conditions, which it was impossible for him to foresee, and prepare for\".\nGavan Duffy drew up the initial regulations for the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery which remained in place until reformed by Alan Reid in 1966. He took leave due to illness from 1911 to 1912. In 1915 he served as secretary to the Fisher government's Federal Parliamentary War Committee. He had long sought appointment as clerk of the Australian Senate, based on the colonial convention that the upper house conferred a higher rank. Following several previous, in 1917 Gavan Duffy was appointed to the role in place of Charles Boydell. He held the position until his retirement in 1920.\nPersonal life\nIn 1893, Gavan Duffy married Ella McLean, the daughter of Victorian politician Allan McLean. Their only child Charles Allan Gavan Duffy was a military surgeon who settled in England.\nGavan Duffy was widowed in 1930 and died on 23 February 1932 at the Ormington Private Hospital in South Yarra, aged 76.\n",
    "Transwestern Pipeline Company v. Corinne Grace was a hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on May 25, 1990. Transwestern Pipeline claimed that Grace, an independent oil and gas operator, had a well that was misclassified by the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division (NM OCD) as what is called a stripper well under \u00a7108 (Ceiling Price for Stripper Well Natural Gas) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). A stripper well is a well that is marginally productive. The underlying issue was the geology of the Morrow Formation in New Mexico and the reliability of the information the oil and gas commission of one state had based its decision on based on this type of geological formation and its characteristics. Around this same time, Corinne Grace was also in the 1990 FERC hearing for Corinne B. Grace v. El Paso Natural Gas Company.\nThe hearing had a significant effect on U.S. oil and gas supply because of the number of stripper wells and their ability to supply natural gas for the U.S. economy. In recent history, stripper well production makes up about 8.2% of United States natural gas production, and the stripper well classification is the classification of a large majority of the number of U.S. onshore wells.\nBackground\nThe NGPA defined a stripper well as essentially a well that produces less than 60 Mcf (60,000 cubic feet) per day during any 90-day interval. However, there was an exclusion or exemption for wells that had the application of what is defined as enhanced recovery in the NPGA.\nEnhanced recovery legislation\nThe following defined enhanced recovery as legislated by the NGPA:\nNonassociated natural gas (gas from different geological zones) which is produced from a stripper well that actually exceeds 60 Mcf during any 90-day production period may continue to qualify as stripper well natural gas if the increase in this well production was the result of the application of recognized enhanced recovery techniques.\nThis encouraged oil and gas operators to try to increase production from marginally productive wells by producing from new zones in the well. This in turn helped with U.S. natural gas supply.\nNGPA Pricing Mechanism\nSection 108 of the NGPA gave a price ceiling for stripper well natural gas. In May 1978, it was $2.09. Section 102 of the NGPA provides a financial incentive for oil and gas operators who develop new gas production from new zones. FERC describes the application of these two sections in its concluding remarks:New Mexico has approved recompletions\u00a0such as Grace's as enhanced recovery techniques under section 108 but it has not approved applications for a new onshore reservoir determination under section 102 for any well in the pool, even if\u00a0the well appears not to be in communication with any other well in the pool, because the pool produced before April 20, 1977.\nThis result is also consistent with the pricing scheme established in the NGPA because the section 102 ceiling price, which applies to gas from new onshore reservoirs which did not produce before April 20, 1977, was intended to reward producers\u00a0for incurring the risks involved in exploring for new sources of\u00a0gas.\u00a0 Since producers who drill in the pool know that if they\u00a0drill to a certain depth that they will encounter the Morrow\u00a0Formation, with the possibility of multiple pay zones, they do\u00a0not bear as great a risk as other producers.\nConclusion\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission agree that the State of New Mexico Oil and Gas Commission was correct in its application of allowing NGPA Section 108 pricing to take place as well as to deny Section 102 pricing. Grace was declared correct and Transwestern's requests were denied.\n",
    "Spanish footballer and manager\nJos\u00e9 Luis Riera Biosca (26 November 1920 \u2013 20 May 1987) was a Spanish footballer who played as a defender for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Real Zaragoza. With them, he won two La Liga titles in 1949\u201350 and 1950\u201351. He also played 3 times with the Spanish national team between 1945 and 1949.\nAfter retiring, he became a manager, taking charge of the likes of C\u00e1diz CF and Recreativo de Huelva.\nClub career\nEarly career\nBorn in Barcelona, Riera stood out since he was a child for his corpulence and size, thus playing as a defender in various regional teams, such as Mirand\u00e9s, Ripoll, and Athletic de Palma\u00a0, but his progress was halted by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. When the war ended in 1939, he played one season for RCD Mallorca and then signed for CE Const\u00e0ncia, which at that time was playing in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n.\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid\nFrom there he moved in 1942 to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, then called Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n, with whom Riera made his debut in the First Division. He quickly established himself as an undisputed starter under coach Ricardo Zamora, who placed him as a central defender, making him the first football player in Spain to play in that specific position. He formed a defensive trio with Alfonso Aparicio and Alfonso Silva, which went down in history both at Atl\u00e9tico and in Spanish football as the so-called \"Iron Curtain\". Later he formed another great defensive trio with Aparicio and Diego Lozano, this one known called Defensa de Cemento (Defense of Cement).\nRiera remained at Atl\u00e9tico for a total of 9 seasons, in which he managed to win the League title twice, in 1949\u201350 and 1950\u201351, the Copa Eva Duarte in 1951, and also the 1941\u201347 FEF President Cup, the longest tournament in the history of Spanish football, playing in the decisive match against Valencia CF in 1947, which had been in stand by since 1941, featuring in defense alongside Aparicio and keeping a clean sheet in a 4\u20130 win. In total, Riera played 181 games with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, including 152 in the League and 27 in the Copa del Rey, scoring just a single goal, which came in a league fixture.\nReal Zaragoza\nIn 1951, the 31-year-old Riera signed for Real Zaragoza, where he played his last two seasons as a professional before retiring in 1953 to dedicate himself to technical work. In total, he scored two goals in 177 league matches for Atl\u00e9tico and Zaragoza. On 3 June 1951, Riera played an friendly match for FC Barcelona, helping his side to a 5\u20133 win over Hull City.\nInternational career\nRiera made his international debut for the Spanish national team in a friendly match against Portugal on 20 March 1949, at the age of 28, starting in a 1\u20131 draw. He went on to earn a further two international caps in 1949 and 1950, the latter also against Portugal, but in a 1950 FIFA World Cup qualification match, helping his side to a 5\u20131 victory.\nManagerial career\nRiera began his managerial career at the helm of UD Huesca, which he coached for one season in 1953\u201354. He then two three-year stints with CD San Fernando (1957\u20131960) and C\u00e1diz CF (1960\u20131963), before going on to coach the likes of CD M\u00e1laga (1963\u201364), Recreativo de Huelva (1964\u201365), UD Tenerife (1966\u201368), Xerez CD (1968\u201369), and UE Lleida (1969\u201370).\nRiera later stood out as a great technical secretary.\nDeath\nRiera died in Madrid on 20 May 1987, at the age of 67. Those who saw him play always remember his mustache and his forcefulness and speed in marking with the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid shirt.\nHonours\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid\n1941\u201347 FEF President Cup:\nLa Liga: 1949\u201350, 1950\u201351\nCopa Eva Duarte: 1951\n",
    "1909 play by Paul Armstrong\nFor other uses, see Alias Jimmy Valentine.\nAlias Jimmy Valentine is a 1909 play written by Paul Armstrong, based on the 1903 short story A Retrieved Reformation by O. Henry. It has four acts, a large cast, four settings, and fast pacing. The story follows a former safecracker's attempt to go straight, and the choice he must make between saving a child's life and exposing himself to arrest.\nThe play was produced by Liebler & Company, staged by Hugh Ford, with settings from Gates and Morange. The play starred H. B. Warner and introduced Laurette Taylor. It opened Christmas night 1909 in Chicago, moving to Broadway during January 1910 where it played through June 1910.\nAlias Jimmy Valentine had a brief Broadway revival during December 1921. It was adapted for four motion pictures between 1915 and 1942, and was turned into a radio serial during 1938\u20131939.\nCharacters\nLead\nRose Lane is a young woman once saved from crooks by Valentine.\nLee Randall alias Jimmy Valentine is a former safecracker trying to go straight.\nSupporting\nHandler is the bullying warden at Sing Sing prison.\nRobert Fay is Lt.

Rose Lane and two women from the Gate of Hope Society are visiting the Warden. Rose has brought along her mom's brother, Robert Fay. The four of them are discussing prison reform and criminal types with the Warden. Also present is Blickendolfenbach, with his new keyed lock that he hopes to sell to the state prison. Smith fetches Blinky Davis, who casually alters a $5.00 check into $50,000. Then Smith brings in Dick the Rat, who picks the new lock with just a hairpin. Smith, the prisoners and the inventor depart. The women ask the Warden about other convict types, and he promises to show them a romantic one. While he's gone, Rose tells the others about how a criminal tried to molest her on a train two years ago, but was thwarted by a young stranger. The Warden returns with Jimmy Valentine. Rose instantly recognizes him as the young stranger. Valentine enrages the Warden by refusing to pick the combination lock of the prison safe, claiming he has no knowledge of safecracking. Fay intervenes when the Warden berates Valentine, and urges the latter to apply for a pardon. (Curtain)\nAct II (Hotel parlor in Albany, New York, a few weeks later.) Valentine has been pardoned and released. He is due to meet Rose and her father at the hotel. While waiting, he is approached by old friends Bill Avery and Red Joclyn, fellow yeggs. They urge Valentine to resume his old profession, but he has fallen in love with Rose and repudiates crime. Suddenly Detective Doyle is spotted. Red and Bill hide, while Valentine verbally spars with Doyle, who wants him to sell out Bill Avery. Valentine refuses, and Doyle threatens to prosecute him over a safecracking in Springfield, Massachusetts. He leaves frustrated by Valentine's aplomb. Bill and Red reappear, and Valentine hands Bill a message from Rose, promising him a job out west. Bill thanks Valentine and departs promising to go straight. Rose and her father now appear. William Lane offers Valentine a position in his bank. Valentine allows himself to be persuaded, and reveals his real name, Lee Randall. When they leave, he tells Red to follow him to Illinois, where he'll get him an honest job. (Curtain)\nAct III (Randall's office at Fourth National Bank of Springfield, three years later.) Randall is now Assistant Cashier of Lane's bank, while Red Joclyn has been appointed a watchman. Randall's clerk Williams brings in a man called Cronin, who is actually Bill Avery. He is now prosperous through marriage, and brings a \"doctored\" photo for Randall to alibi himself for the Massachusetts safecracking. They both know Doyle is in town.

    "Australian 1980s rock music band\nScreaming Believers were an Australian rock group formed in Adelaide in 1981. Mainstay members were Paul Hughes on vocals and saxophone, Craig Rodda on drums and Ken Sykes on guitar and vocals.

A compilation album, Stories from the Other Side (2010), was issued.\nHistory\nAdelaide rock group, Screaming Believers, were formed in mid-1981 by Graeme Burdett on guitar, Paul Hughes on vocals and saxophone, Rees Hughes on bass guitar, Craig Rodda on drums and Ken Sykes on guitar and vocals. Burdett, Paul Hughes, Rodda and Sykes had all been members of the Shreds with Richard Opolski on bass guitar. That group had formed in early 1980 and when Rees Hughes replaced Opolski on bass guitar in the following year they were renamed. Rees Hughes and Rodda had also been bandmates in guitar pop band, Fools Apart in early 1981.\nThey recorded four live tracks in September 1981 at the Union Hotel, Adelaide, which were issued in 1981 as their debut extended play, Show Me Your Money, via Empty Dogma/EMI. They supported shows by visiting artists, the Human League, Psychedelic Furs and John Cooper Clarke. The Australian group's debut single, \"My Eyes\" (February 1984) was released via Greasy Pop. Woroni's reviewer felt, \"It's refreshing, clever, slightly ska-ish, and sufficiently assertive to be a bloody good rock number.\" Screaming Believers provided two tracks, \"I Want to Have You\" and \"Unprofessional\" to Greasy Pop's sampler album, Greasy Selection (March 1985).\nThe rock group began recording their debut album, Communist Mutants from Space (June 1985), late in the previous year with Bob Allen as producer-engineer. Andrew W Ferrington of The Canberra Times notices \" is plainly surprising... most of the music is guitar based, sounds range from the whole spectrum of rock and roll - from beat to psychedelic, from 1950s sounding guitar music to modern... a lot of subtle sounds that only come out after a close listening.\" Burdett had been replaced on guitar by John Cavuoto (ex-the Innocents) before it appeared. Cloudi Katern took over bass guitar from Rees Hughes later that year.\nChris Lambden replaced Katern on bass guitar after the second studio album, Refugees from the Love Generation (March 1988) had been recorded. Lambden was replaced in turn by Jodie Petersen. Screaming Believers had recorded an unreleased album and disbanded in 1991. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane determined, that their recordings \"were brimming with refined songs and highly proficient, melodic guitar thrash. That they failed to attract a wider audience is a great shame.\" A compilation album, Stories from the Other Side, was issued in 2010 via Early Bird Records.

    "Former lifeboat station in Anglesey, Wales\nBull Bay Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station, located at Bull Bay (Porth Llechog), near the town of Amlwch, on the north coast of Anglesey, Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1868.\nBull Bay Lifeboat Station was closed in 1926.\nHistory\nThe RNLI decided in 1867, to open a new lifeboat station at Bull Bay. A new boathouse was commissioned, and in the November of that year, \u00a3400 for a new lifeboat was received from a Miss Holt, of Anglesey. An order was placed for a 32-foot 10-oared Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, (one with oars and sails), which arrived on station in March 1868.\nIn dense fog on 9 March 1877, the Ocean liner Dakota of the Liverpool and Great Western Steamship Company, ran ashore under the cliffs near East Mouse, on passage from Liverpool to New York with 530 passengers and crew. Fortunately conditions were calm, so many local boats, along with the Bull Bay lifeboat and Rocket Brigade, went to the aid of the vessel. 20 people were brought ashore in the lifeboat, which then stood by as all the other small boats ferried passengers and crew ashore. No lives were lost. The vessel broke in two the following day and was a total wreck.\nA new lifeboat was placed at Bull Bay in 1884. Costing \u00a3290, a 34-foot 10-oared self-righting lifeboat, built by Woolfe and Son, with a launch carriage costing a further \u00a3118. The boat was funded by Miss Curling of Camberwell, and was duly named Curling (ON 67).\nCoxswain John Hughes retired in 1890. He has served as coxswain since the station opened in 1868. In recognition of his many service calls, he was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal.\nIn 1904, a new boathouse with roller-slipway was constructed over the shore, standing on steel piles, very much in the design of the one pictured at Douglas, IOM. Constructed at a cost of \u00a32000, it was to house a new 38-foot non-self-righting Watson-class (P&S) lifeboat, which cost \u00a3993. The lifeboat, which would turn out to be the last one stationed at Bull Bay, was funded from the legacy of Miss Marianne Cullen of Nottingham, and was named James Cullen (ON 528)\nOn 20 February 1915, the cargo ship S.S. Cambank of Cardiff was torpedoed and sunk off Point Lynas, Anglesey by Submarine U-30 of the Imperial German Navy. 4 of the 25 crew were lost, but the remaining 21 were picked up from the ships boat by Bull Bay lifeboat James Cullen.\nBull Bay lifeboat had a good regular service record, the lifeboat being launched 41 times over a period of 58 years, and rescuing 63 lives. However, it was decided that the station would be closed, and the James Cullen was withdrawn in June 1926.\nThe lifeboat was sold in 1926, later being renamed Vika, Meine Leibe and finally Pride of Anglesey, before being broken up in Rochester, Kent in 1996.\nThe 1904 boathouse was removed, although the concrete pile footings can still be seen today.\nThe 1868 boathouse still stands. For many years it has been the home to the Bull Bay Yacht and Boat Club, but as of 2024, it is up for sale.

    "\nThe Sch\u00f6ningen site is a Paleolithic archaeological site in Germany, dating to around 300,000 years ago. It is best known for the Sch\u00f6ningen spears, some of the oldest known wooden spears, found in the \"spear horizon\", though the site as a whole covers a broader span of time.\nDiscovery and stratigraphy\nPhoto of the Sch\u00f6ningen mine in 2012\nThe site was initially excavated between 1994 and 1999, after having been found at an overcast mine near Sch\u00f6ningen in Lower Saxony, Germany. The depositional environment is thought to have been a lakeshore, with thermoluminescence dating and uranium\u2013thorium dating suggesting an age of the site of approximately 300,000 years ago, during an interglacial period corresponding to Marine Isotope Stage 9.\nSpear horizon (13 II-4)\nAt the so-called \"spear horizon\", referred to within the stratigraphic sequence as Sch\u00f6ningen 13 II-4, numerous remains (representing 20-25 individuals) of butchered horses belonging to the extinct species Equus mosbachensis have been found associated with wooden spears (the famous Sch\u00f6ningen spears), among the oldest known wooden spears, other wood tools, including throwing sticks likely also used in hunting, as well as split woods with pointed and rounded ends have also been found at the site. The split wood tools were likely used in domestic activities like processing hide.\nOther animals found in this layer do not display evidence of butchery, and likely accumulated naturally, these include: red deer, roe deer, European wild ass, aurochs, steppe bison, wild boar, Irish elk, Merck's rhinoceros and the narrow-nosed rhinoceros, straight-tusked elephant grey wolves, red foxes, stoats, least weasels, and the sabretooth cat Homotherium (among the youngest records of the genus in Eurasia), along with the European beaver and the extinct giant beaver Trogontherium, with small mammals including water voles, pygmy shrews, desmans, the European mole, the Narrow-headed, tundra, short-tailed field, common, European pine, European water and bank voles, along with the Norway lemming.\nThis layer is suggested to have been deposited in a steppe environment with mild summers and cold winters, colder than those in the contemporary environment at the site today, with the lakeshore being covered by sedges and surrounded by willow and birch swamp forest, while the surrounding steppe environment had scattered pine and larch trees, and juniper shrubs.\nElephant butchery site\nIn situ bones of the butchered adult female straight-tusked elephant from layer 13 II-3\nAt layer 13 II-3, a complete skeleton of an adult female (approximately 50 year old) straight-tusked elephant was found, which were found with natural fragments of flint which have wear indicating that they were used to butcher the elephant. The site displays no evidence of hunting, and it is suggested that the elephant died of natural causes and was later scavenged by humans.\n",
    "English major in the Royal Marines\nThomas Oldfield (21 June 1756 \u2013 1799) was an English major in the Royal Marines.\nBiography\nOldfield was the third son of Humphrey Oldfield, an officer in her majesty's marine forces. He was born at Stone, Staffordshire, on 21 June 1756. His mother was a daughter of Major-general Nicholls, of the Honourable East India Company's service. His father died in America shortly after the affair of Bunker's Hill. Oldfied accompanied his father to America in the autumn of 1774, or in the following spring. He served as a volunteer with the marine battalion at Bunker's Hill on 17 June 1775. In this action he was twice wounded, and his wrist was permanently injured. After the action Oldfield accepted a commission in a provincial corps -it is believed Tarleton's legion. In 1775 he took up a commission in the royal marines which was intended for his brother, although it was by an error made out in his name.\nOldfield, who did not join the marines until the close of the American war, served with the 83rd regiment at the siege of Charleston, South Carolinia, in 1780. He was promoted to a first lieutenancy in the royal marines on 16 April 1778, and, being distinguished by his intelligence and gallantry, was placed on the stall of the quartermaster-general's department. As deputy assistant-quartermaster-general he was attached to the headquarters of the Marquis (then Lord) Cornwallis and to lord Rawdon (afterwards Marquis of Hastings). He was constantly engaged under their immediate eye, and the repeatedly bore testimony to his zeal, gallantry, and ability. Oldfield was taken prisoner with Lord Cornwallis at the capitulation of Yorktown.\nAt the termination of the war Oldfield went to England, and was quartered at Portsmouth, when he purchased a small place in the parish of Westbourne. He named it Oldfield Lawn. In 1788 Oldfield went to the West Indies, returning in very bad health. In 1798 he was promoted captain, and again went to the West Indies in the Sceptre, 64 guns, Captain Dacres. In 1794 Oldfield commanded the royal marines landed from the squadron to co-operate with the army in the island of St. Domingo. Oldfield distinguished himself on every occasion that offered. In storming one of the enemy's works at Cape Nicholas mole, he was the first to enter it, and with his own hand struck the enemy's colours, which are now in possession of the family. He returned to England in the autumn of 1795 in precarious health.\nIn 1796 Oldfield was employed on the recruiting service at Manchester and Warrington. The following year he embarked on board the Theseus, 74 guns, and sailed to join the squadron under the orders of the Earl of Saincent of Cadiz. Upon the Theseus reaching her destination, she became the flagship of Horatio Nelson, then a rear-admiral. Oldfield was engaged in two bombardments of Cadiz in June 1797, in one of which he was wounded while in the host with the admiral.\nImmediately after the second bombardment he sailed in the Theseus, accompanied by a small squadron, for Teneriffe. In the pliant but unsuccessful attempt upon this island Oldfield commanded the force of royal marines which effected a landing from the squadron. His boat was swamped, but he swam to shore, and on landing received a contusion in the right knee. He materially contributed to the saving of the British detachment, whose temerity in attacking with so inferior a force was only equalled by the gallantry with which they carried the attack into execution. Its failure may be attributed to the loss of the cutter Fox, 10 guns, which was sunk by the enemy's fire, with a considerable part of the force destined for the enterprise. It was in this affair that Nelson lost his arm. In a private letter, written after the battle of the Nile, Oldfield said that \"it was by no means so severe as the affair at Teneriffe, or the second night of the bombardment of Cadiz.\"\nUntil the Theseus was detached to join Nelson (who had shifted his flag to the Vanguard, and gone in pursuit of the French squadron up the Mediterranean), Oldfield remaining with the fleet under the orders of the Earl of St. Vincent. At the battle of the Nile Oldfield was the senior officer of royal marines in the fleet, and obtained the rank of major for his services, his commission dating 7 October 1798. Oldfield relates in a private letter how, after the disappointment of not finding the French fleet at Alexandria, the Zealous made the signal at midday on 1 August that it was in the bay of Aboukir. At half-past three the French fleet was plainly seen, and an hour afterwards Nelson bade the Theseus go ahead of him. Oldfield in the Theseus was alongside the Guerrier at a quarter to seven o'clock, and having poured in a broadside which carried away her mainmast and mizzenmast, he passed on to the Sparticle and anchored abreast of her, the admiral anchoring on the other side ten minutes later. After the action Oldfield was sent with his marines on board the Tonnan",
    "German opinion journalist (1940\u20132020)\nEkkehard von Braunm\u00fchl born Wilhelm Ekkehard Hans Joachim Mariano von Braunm\u00fchl (29 December 1940, Gleiwitz - 24 June 2020, Wiesbaden) was a German freelance journalist and child rights activist. He is best known as the founder of Antipedagogy, a concept that challenges traditional approaches to education and child-rearing. Braunm\u00fchl's lifelong commitment to advocating for children's rights and challenging conventional educational norms left a lasting impact on the discourse around child-rearing and education. His work encourages us to rethink our approach to nurturing the next generation.\nAntipedagogy\nMain article: Antipedagogy\nBraunm\u00fchl advocated for the abolition of traditional education. He rejected the idea of \u201ctraining\u201d children through strict discipline to conform to adult expectations. Instead, he emphasized respecting the developing personality of the child and treating them as equals. According to Braunm\u00fchl, child-friendly behavior cannot be taught directly; it must be learned through experience. His book, Zeit f\u00fcr Kinder (Time for Children), served as a guidebook for those who wanted to embrace child-friendliness. He considered it a tool in the \u201cantip\u00e4dagogic struggle for freedom\u201d and encouraged people everywhere to advocate for children's well-being and freedom.\nBraunm\u00fchl believed that children should have space for exploration and independent learning rather than being \u201ctrained\u201d or \u201cconditioned\u201d through traditional education methods. In 1970, Braunm\u00fchl co-founded the parents\u2019 association 1. APC Kinderhaus e. V. (1st Antip\u00e4dagogical Club) in Wiesbaden. This association continued the antipedagogic tradition by operating as a child daycare center.\nBraunm\u00fchl's ideas were later adopted by Hubertus von Schoenebeck, albeit with some misunderstandings and distortions. This led to a heated discussion, culminating in the publication of the book, Was ist antip\u00e4dagogische Aufkl\u00e4rung? Mi\u00dfverst\u00e4ndnisse, Mi\u00dfbr\u00e4uche, Mi\u00dferfolge der radikalen Erziehungskritik (What Is Antip\u00e4dagogische Aufkl\u00e4rung? Misunderstandings, Abuses, and Failures of Radical Educational Critique) in 1997. His work aimed to shed light on the misconceptions surrounding antipedagogic ideas and their practical implications.\nPublications\nAntip\u00e4dagogik.

    "\nBeginning on 11 May 2024, heavy rain caused flash floods and lahars in West Sumatra, Indonesia, killing at least 67 people and leaving 20 more missing. More than 4,000 people were also displaced. The regencies of Agam and Tanah Datar were most affected.\nEvents\nHours of heavy monsoon rains caused flash flooding at around 22:30 WIB (15:30 UTC) on 11 May, exacerbated by a lahar from Mount Marapi. The rains also caused a river to overflow and flood villages in four districts. The lahar swept down Mount Marapi, carrying a wet mixture of ash and rocks. It buried homes and swept some residents away.\nDamage and casualties\nAt least 67 people died, 44 were injured and 20 remained missing. Among the dead included 22 in Agam Regency (19 of them in Canduang), 29 in Tanah Datar, 12 in Padang Pariaman, two in Padang Panjang and two in Padang.\nAt least 521 houses, 31,985 hectares of land including rice fields, 19 bridges and most major roads were damaged in three districts and one town. The flood also swept away people and more than 100 houses and buildings were submerged. In Tanah Datar, several mosques and almost 200 buildings were damaged. Two trucks were also swept away by the floods. In Agam, dozens of homes were also damaged and 159 people were evacuated to nearby schools. A number of national roads were also affected, cutting off access between the major cities.\nResponse\nThe BNPB declared a 14-day state of emergency in West Sumatra and distributed a total of Rp 3.2 billion in aid to local governments affected by the floods. They were also involved in searching for missing people in areas near rivers and clearing important roads from large rocks, debris and mud due to flooding. Excavators were deployed to remove large rocks and trees. As of 16 May, rescue work was ongoing to search for the missing. Abdul Malik, chief of the provincial rescue team, said that 400 personnel, eight excavators and drones were deployed to assist in the search for missing people.\nThe local government set up evacuation centres in the worst affected areas, and rescue teams have deployed rubber boats in search of survivors. West Sumatra governor Mahyeldi Ansharullah offered condolences and has instructed authorities to collaborate with the response. More than 4,000 residents were displaced and sought refuge at shelters or nearby infrastructure. The BNPB said the government intend to relocate those who could not return to their homes. The agency's head said new homes would be ready in six months, numbering around 200.\nIndonesia's meteorological agency, BMKG, used cloud seeding to prevent rain clouds from reaching the worst-hit areas. On 16 May, the agency forecasted rain in the next few days to week which prompted them to deploy an air force aircraft to release salt flares in an attempt to disperse rain clouds. A BMKG spokesperson said 15 tons of salt was allocated for the mission. Two cloud seeding operations were completed on 16 May.\nOn 26 May, the BNPB, BMKG and PVMBG agencies planned on creating an early warning system in West Sumatra as a result of the floods, installing early warning systems at 23 locations across Agam, Tanah Datar and Padang Panjang.\nSee also\n2020 Jakarta floods\n2024 in Indonesia\n2024 Sumatra flash floods\nList of floods\n",
    "Short story by Liu Cixin\n\"Contraction\" (Chinese: \u574d\u7f29, Pinyin: t\u0101nsu\u014d) is a science-fiction short story by Chinese writer Liu Cixin. It was published in Science Fiction World in Chongqing in 1999 and in the anthology To Hold Up the Sky in October of 2020.\nPlot\nAfter concluding the Grand Unified Theory, the theoretical physicist Ding Yi calculated the exact moment, in which the expansion of the universe will reverse and change into a contraction. During a conference to await this event, scheduled to happen that day, Ding Yi explains the basics of the calculations, how neutrinos having mass and dark matter will cause the contraction and how it can be observed by the change from red shift to blue shift. When a colleague enters and declares, that her father had just died, Ding Yi just shrugs and claims, she doesn't need to worry. The colleague gets angry and lectures Ding Yi, that fathers with a massive effect on our lives are more important than the color of some frequencies changing, not affecting us at all. Ding Yi calmly rejects that and reveals the aftermath of the beginning of the contraction: Time will start flowing backwards. What was once our past, will then be our future. Everybody will speak and walk backwards, but nobody will know anything ahead as one can remember the past, but can't remember the future. The audience reacts with shock as the countdown ends and the era of contraction begins.\nReception\nPaul Di Filippo, writing in the Locus Magazine, claims that \"despite its one-note gimmicky core\", the short story is an \"effectively mind-bending tale dealing with the unforeseen fallout from cosmological reversals of interstellar expansion.\"\nNicole Beck, writing in Strange Horizons, states that \"the characterization often falls back on stereotype\" and that the short story \"drives home the idea that knowledge is a special ability that gives characters security in the most extreme situations.\" She argues about the main character, that the \"entire setup reads like a performance for his own amusement, and  he becomes almost sinister in his control of the situation.\" She thinks that this \"suggests that intelligence and the ability to acquire knowledge are perhaps the greatest currency anyone can possess\" and that \"whether or not one agrees, it is a thought-provoking idea.\"\nSee also\nThe Hundred Light-Year Diary, short story by Greg Egan about using the contraction to send messages back in time\n",

    "American composer and hymnwriter\nRalph Erskine Hudson (July 9, 1843 \u2013 June 14, 1901) was an American composer and hymnwriter. He is best remembered for his hymn \"My Life, My Love, I Give to Thee\" and his addition of a refrain and composition of a new tune for the Isaac Watts hymn \"Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed\".\nEarly life and military service\nRalph Erskine Hudson was born on July 9, 1843, in Napoleon, Ohio. In his childhood, his family moved to Philadelphia. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Hudson enlisted in the Union Army, joining Company K of the 10th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment on June 20, 1861. Between June 1862 and February 1863, Hudson served as a nurse at the General Hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. While working at the hospital, he met Mary Smith, from Annapolis; the couple married on March 4, 1863. Hudson was honorably discharged on June 11, 1864.\nMusic career\nAn accomplished musician, after his discharge Hudson began teaching music at a college in Alliance, Ohio, where he remained for five years. While in Alliance, Hudson started a music publishing business. At the same time, he was a lay preacher in the Methodist Episcopal Church. He had a particular concern for evangelism, both in preaching and as an evangelistic singer.\nHudson's first hymn book, Salvation Echoes, was published in 1882. He later published a further four songbooks: Gems of Gospel Songs (1884), Songs of Peace, Love and Joy (1885), The Temperance Songster (1886) and Songs of the Ransomed (1887). Hudson was a prohibitionist, who advocated for total abstinence from alcohol, and wrote many songs about temperance. 'The Temperance Songster comprises songs addressing this topic.\nNotable works\nSome of Hudson's hymns and choruses continue to appear in modern hymnals. Generally, his work has been better-known in America and Canada than in the United Kingdom.\nHudson's best-known original hymn is \"My Life, My Love, I Give to Thee,\" which was published in his collected Salvation Echoes (1882). This hymn was included in hundreds of 19th- and 20th-century hymnals, and is still included in the Baptist Hymnal, the primary hymnbook of the Southern Baptist Convention. It is generally sung to the tube \"Dunbar\", written by C.R. Dunbar.\nHudson also added refrains to some traditional hymns, including \"Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed\" and \"O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing.\" His adaptation of \"O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing\" includes the repeated line \"Blessed be the name of the Lord.\" It was first published in Songs for the Ransomed (1887). It had particular popularity in Southern Baptist Convention churches, and is included in the Baptist Hymnal.\nHe composed music for the Clara Tear Williams hymns \"Satisfied\", which was first published in 1881. Describing the composition of this hymn, Williams wrote:\nAbout 1875, I was helping in meetings in Troy, Ohio, where Professor R. E. Hudson conducted the singing, when, just before retiring one night, he asked me to write a song for a book he was preparing to publish. Before sleeping, I wrote \"Satisfied.\" In the morning, he composed the music.\nDeath\nHudson died on June 14, 1901, in Cleveland, Ohio. He is buried in Alliance City Cemetery.

    "Pioneer woman and captive of Native Americans (1856\u20131950)\nBianca Babb (August 26, 1856 \u2013 April 13, 1950) was an American pioneer woman and former captive of the Comanche people. As a child, she was taken captive during a Comanche raid on her family's homestead in Wise County, Texas in 1866. Babb spent seven months living among the Comanches before being ransomed and returned to her father in 1867. She later wrote a memoir that provided a rare first-person account from the perspective of a young female captive, offering insights into Comanche culture and life on the Southern Plains frontier of the late 19th century.\nEarly life, capture, and captivity\nBianca Babb, originally named Bianca Louella and also known as Bankuella, Bianca Babb Bell, or simply Banc, was born on August 26, 1856, during her family's journey from Wisconsin to Texas, in a covered wagon near Lecompton, Kansas. Her parents, John S. Babb and Isabel A. Babb, were settlers and ranchers. In her formative years, Bianca resided with her family in a cabin near present-day Chico, Wise County, Texas. The region, situated on the outskirts of non-Native American settlements, was often fraught with tensions and conflicts between settlers and indigenous tribes, particularly the Comanche people who dominated the area.\nThe Babb family experienced tragedy on September 14, 1866, when a band of Nokoni Comanches, led by Persummy, raided their cabin. Bianca's father and eldest brother were away at the time, leaving her mother, Isabel Babb, and Bianca herself, along with her siblings, vulnerable to the attack. Isabel Babb lost her life, while Bianca, along with her brother Theodore Adolphus (\"Dot\") and a young houseguest named Sarah Jane Luster, were captured by the Comanches.\nComanche warriors, renowned for their exceptional horsemanship, were adept at traversing long distances without sustenance. Racing westward through the night, they swiftly crossed the Little Wichita River close to modern-day Henrietta. The journey proved arduous for the captives, who endured a relentless ride spanning at least 50 miles (ca. 80 km) without pause, eventually halting at 11 a.m. the following day near Holiday Creek. There, they prepared and consumed the flesh of a steer mauled by wolves. Bianca, consumed by hunger, pleaded for raw meat. Exhausted and numb, she sat amidst her own filth, earning the disparaging moniker \"stinks when walks\" from her captors.\nAfter the young houseguest escaped with Dot's help, prompting respect from the Comanches when the siblings defied execution, Bianca was separated from her brother. The warrior Kerno who captured her gave Bianca as a foster daughter to his widowed sister Tekwashana. For seven months in 1866\u20131867, Bianca lived immersed in traditional Comanche society, learning skills like camp setup, swimming, and cultural practices like ear-piercing from her adoptive mother. Tekwashana also darkened Bianca's blonde hair. The band followed a nomadic lifestyle, frequently relocating camps across the Oklahoma-Texas panhandle region, allowing Bianca to experience the daily routines, customs, and way of life among the Comanches firsthand.\nAfter Bianca's capture, her father John Babb joined efforts by frontiersmen and Native allies to search for his missing children. Around April 1867, Jacob J. Sturm, a civilian agent from Fort Arbuckle, located Bianca and secured her ransom and release from the Comanches for US$333 (roughly $7,259 today). Sturm then brought Bianca to the fort. Despite her months living with the tribe, Bianca returned willingly to her family. In June 1867, her brother Dot was also ransomed for US$210 (roughly US$4,578 today), with articles of clothing worth US$23.75, and released back to their father.\nLater years and memoir\nThe Babbs initially relocated to Reedsburg, Wisconsin after the ordeal, though Bianca later returned to Texas in 1881. On June 25, 1882, she married Jefferson Davis Bell, an abstractor of land titles. Bianca attributed her wanderlust and frequent family relocations between various North Texas towns like Henrietta, Denton, Greenville, as well as periods in California and New Mexico, to her nomadic experiences living with the Comanches.\nFrom 1897 to 1900, the former Kiowa-Comanche-Apache reservation lands were divided into household allotments. As a former adoptee, Bianca filed a claim seeking her own allotment and restitution for losses in the 1866 raid, including her mother's death. Though she revisited the reservation and had supportive testimonies from Comanche friends, her allotment claim was rejected.\nIn the 1920s, Bianca wrote an unpublished memoir manuscript recounting her seven months living among the Comanches as a child captive. While circulated in typescript form, it did not receive wide publication during her lifetime.\nUnlike her brother Theodore \"Dot\" Babb who published his own memoirs to fame, Bianca did not widely publicize her remarkable childhood experiences living among the Comanches when intervi",
    "2024 video game\n2024 video game\nCrow Country is a 2024 survival horror game developed and published by SFB Games for PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S. Set in a visual style and design similar to PlayStation 1 horror titles including Resident Evil and Silent Hill, the player is an investigator exploring an abandoned theme park. Upon release, Crow Country received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed to the game's design evocation of earlier horror games, writing and narrative, and mixed views on the implementation of combat and puzzles.\nGameplay\nCrow Country is a survival horror, similar to Resident Evil and Silent Hill, in which players explore Crow Country to find objects, solve puzzles, and defeat monsters. Gameplay features two modes: 'Survival', which features combat and enemies, and 'Exploration', which dispenses with enemies. Combat requires the player to aim and shoot at monsters encountered throughout areas using various weapons, including a handguns, a shotgun, and flamethrower, some of which are unlocked by the completion of optional puzzles. To shoot at enemies, players can run and shoot, or lock into position to focus their aim. Players have limited health depleted by hits from enemies and environmental hazards, which can be replenished using bandages, medkits and antidotes. Items and ammunition are collected by players through interacting with vending machines and containers. Players explore the game's environment and slowly expand their access to new areas by locating keys or solving puzzles, such as by combining items found in different locations.\nPlot\nTaking place in 1990, Mara Forest, a special agent, investigates Crow Country, an abandoned amusement park. Crow Country has been shut down two years prior, with its founder, Edward Crow, mysteriously disappearing. Upon arriving at the park she meets an injured reporter name Arthur, who warns Mara of dangerous creatures. She helps him back to her car and continues her investigation, meeting Natalie, Tolman, Julie, Harrison, and Marvin, who are all there investigating as well.\nWhile investigating Crow Country she discovers that it secretly had a dig site which manufactured gold, but in return the dig site also opened a poisonous pool that turns people into other-worldly creatures. With the pressure of the government questioning where the gold was coming from, as well as a high publicized story about a young girl getting seriously injured at the park years prior, it was forced to shut down. It is revealed that the creatures manifesting the park are actually former park visitors who got exposed to the poisonous pool and kept prisoners, eventually turning into monsters.\nAs Mara travels deeper into the park, Harrison is found shot dead by Marvin while Marvin is accidentally knocked off a ledge into his death during a confrontation. Mara tells the remaining survivors to escape to her car while she goes down to the core of the dig site, eventually meeting Edward Crow, who has now become grotesquely mutated by being exposed to the monsters. He reveals that any person who comes into contact with an infected is infected themselves, thus all the survivors have been infected. He then reveals that the first person who got infected was the only one who was able to talk, explaining to Edward Crow about what he saw on the other side of the pool when he fell in. During the conversation, it is revealed that Mara is actually the young girl who got seriously injured years ago, and had become infected due to being in contact with the poisonous pool. She escaped from the hospital she has been staying at in search of Edward Crow, with the intention of telling him that she is dying and that the hospital staff has no cure. Edward Crow is relieved as he initially thought she had come back to kill him as revenge.\nEdward Crow reveals to Mara that he has developed a cure after doing multiple tests on the creatures, but he only has five vitals. He tells Mara to use it to save herself and the others, as he plans to jump into the pool to see what the other side looks like, making Mara promise to kill him if he returns back mutated. He jumps into the pool and returns as a grotesques monster, forcing Mara to kill him. Mara escapes with the remaining survivors in her car. Their fate is left unknown as they are seen 4 miles out of Crow Country, relaxing by a fire as they each take the cure. Mara monologues about her hope for the future, but also her fears of the unknown.\nReception\nReception\nCrow Country received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Reviewers generally praised the game's visual presentation and design as evocative of PS1 horror games. Zoey Handley of Destructoid commended the \"detailed\" pre-rendered environments and \"clever lighting\" to replicate the \"awkward 3D of the era\". However, Leon Hurley of GamesRadar critiqued the player character's \"blocky toy shape\" and \"cartoonish\" enemies.",

    "Uzbekstani-Russian serial killer and rapist\nShavkat Galievich Shayakhmedov (Russian: \u0428\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0442 \u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0428\u0430\u044f\u0445\u043c\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432; 1960 \u2013 May 23, 2023), known as The Zalegoshchensky Maniac (Russian: \u0417\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a), was an Uzbekistani-Russian serial killer and rapist who committed at least five murders in Tajikistan and Russia from 1994 to 2021, four of which were children. Convicted for his four known murders in the latter country, he was given a life term and died behind bars in 2023.\nBiography\nEarly life\nLittle is known about Shayakhmedov's early life, aside from the fact that he was born in 1960 and hails from Uygur, a village in the Uzbek SSR's Andijan Region. He would later claim that he was sexually abused by one of his relatives, but this was never corroborated.\nAfter graduating from a vocational school, Shayakhmedov was drafted into the Soviet Army in the early 1980s. Upon completing his service in the mid-1980s, he moved to Istiqlol in the Tajik SSR, where he soon married a local woman who would give birth to twins\u2014a son named Roman and a daughter named Ruzilya\u2014on September 29, 1988. Shayakhmedov would claim later on that he had to move away from his native village after ethnic Uzbeks demanded that he learn their language or be forced out.\nMove to Russia\nIn the mid-1990s, Shayakhmedov and his family left Tajikistan and headed for Russia, where he found accommodation in Kazar, Oryol Oblast. Soon afterwards, he found a job as a mechanic for local enterprises, due to which he gained a reputation as a hard worker. Since the work was difficult but well paid, Shayakhmedov eventually gathered enough money to buy his own house in the village sometime in the mid-2000s.\nIn contrast to his financial success, Shayakhmedov's reputation as a person was met with mixed feelings from locals. On one hand, he was noted for never having a criminal record, but on the other, he was known to frequently drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, which eventually led to his own children developing the same addiction as him. Most alarmingly, he was suspected of physically and sexually abusing his daughter, as she was never allowed to leave the house after graduating school and was forbidden from going to university, leading to several suicide attempts in the early 2010s. Despite these claims, his wife claimed that Shayakhmedov had no negative influence on his children and constantly made excuses about his questionable behavior and actions.\nOn June 1, 2013, Shayakhmedov's son Roman died of a heart attack at age 25, having drunk a large quantity of alcohol mixed with coffee on the day of his death. Three months later, Ruzilya died from complications brought on from cirrhosis. Shayakhmedov would claim in a later interview that he would frequently experience nightmares in which his deceased children would call out to him.\nShortly after their deaths, Shayakhmedov quit his high-paying job and instead began working as a plumber at the Zalegoshchenskaya Secondary General Education School No. 2, where he was regarded positively by school administration. During his stay there, he also gained popularity with the students, as he often treated them to cigarettes and sweets. In the late 2010s, he was accused of sexual harassment by several female students, one of whom claimed that he had taken her behind a wooden toilet on the school grounds and started touching her intimate parts, but she managed to break free and inform her classmates and acquaintances. Despite the gravity of the accusations, the students' claims were largely ignored.\nMurders\nThe first murder that has been conclusively linked to Shayakhmedov that was committed in Russia occurred in April 2000, when he raped and strangled a 6-year-old boy in Zalegoshch. After killing him, he dumped the boy's body in a nearby ravine.\nIn September 2003, Shayakhmedov went out fishing and came across a 32-year-old woman who was visiting acquaintances in Kazar. Taking advantage of the fact that she was asleep and drunk, he attacked and subsequently raped her. Fearing that she would somehow remember his face if left alive, he then strangled her and dumped the body on the outskirts of the village near a railroad bridge, where it was discovered a few days later.\nOn July 27, 2005, 11-year-old Konstantin Bolotov left his grandmother's house in Kazar to go for a bike ride but failed to return home. A few days later, his bike was found by a local resident named Anatoly Abashin, who for some time was considered the prime suspect in the boy's disappearance, but no charges were ever brought against him. Aside from Abashin, several other suspects were considered, including some workers from the Rostov Oblast who were working on a road surface in the area. Local police theorized that Bolotov was killed by accident and then the workers rolled his corpse in asphalt, but no evidence corroborated this theory.\nOn the day Bolotov disappeared, his neighbor Shayakhmedov invited the young boy to help pick mushrooms.

    "American evangelist (1829\u20131913)\nHarriet Ann Baker (n\u00e9e Cole; 1829 \u2013 March 1, 1913) was an American evangelist and one of the first African American women to serve as a preacher, in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1914, her mission in Allentown, Pennsylvania, became the home of the St. James AME Zion Church, built in 1936.\nBiography\nHarriet Ann Cole was born into freedom in Havre de Grace, Maryland, in 1829. She was one of seven children born to William Cole and Harriet Eskins. Her parents were emancipated slaves, and throughout Baker's childhood, the family lived in fear of being forcibly returned to slavery. In 1842 at the age of 13, she became an evangelical Christian, converting at a women's prayer meeting. In October 1845, she married an enslaved man, William Baker. In 1847, they fled the slave state of Maryland for Columbia, Pennsylvania, walking 48 miles to freedom while carrying their 7-week-old daughter. Tracked down by slave catchers, the Bakers resisted, and Harriet was knocked unconscious in the struggle. She recalled that the attackers aimed pistols at her and pulled the triggers, but the pistols all misfired. Put on trial in Philadelphia, her husband was confirmed to be a fugitive slave, but abolitionists raised funds to pay for his freedom.\nPreaching\nWhile living quietly with her family in Columbia in 1872, Baker felt called to become a preacher. The African Methodist Episcopal Church did not permit female preachers at the time, and her husband and community members initially disapproved of her decision to preach. Nevertheless, she persisted, learned to read and write, and traveled to communities around Pennsylvania, preaching to racially mixed congregations. She preached in Columbia and Lebanon and gradually gained acceptance from congregations and clergy alike. Baker received an official appointment as a pastor of the St. Paul's AME Church on South 10th Street in Lebanon in 1889. She received authority to preach from AME bishops John M. Brown, Richard H. Cain, Jabez P. Campbell, T. M. D. Ward, and Henry McNeal Turner. Five years after her husband's death in Lebanon in 1892, Baker moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania, where she founded the Bethel Mission and preached there from 1900 to 1913. Her mission became the first home of St. James A.M.E. Zion Church, built in 1936. She made 5,000 converts and is one of the first African American woman preachers.\nDeath and legacy\nBaker died in Allentown on March 1, 1913, at the age of 84. She is buried in Allentown's Greenwood Cemetery. The Colored Lady Evangelist: Being the Life, Labors, and Experiences of Mrs. Harriet A. Baker by the Rev. John H. Acornley was privately published in Brooklyn in 1892. On May 4, 1990, the Pennyslvania Historical and Museum Commission dedicated a historical marker in her honor at the St. James A.M.E. Zion Church in Allentown.\n",

    "\nSince the early 20th-century, numerous Jewish athletes chosen not to play on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in Judaism. As one of the most culturally significant Jewish holidays, Yom Kippur is observed by many secular Jews who may not observe other holidays. Jews observing the holiday participate in full fasting and asceticism.\nThe most famous example is baseball player Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers who refused to pitch Game 1 of the 1965 World Series when it fell on Yom Kippur. Years prior, Hank Greenberg of the Detroit Tigers took a similar stance and sat out during a tight pennant race.\nIncidents such as those of Greenberg and Koufax throw into sharp highlight the conflict many Jewish people face between social pressures and personal beliefs on a daily basis. Athletes observing Yom Kippur are often lauded for their decision not to play, which is also seen as a source of pride by many in the Jewish community.\nNotable examples\nSandy Koufax, ace pitcher and Hall of Famer for the Los Angeles Dodgers, famously sat out Game 1 of the 1965 World Series due to it coinciding with Yom Kippur\nIn baseball, Sandy Koufax decided not to pitch Game 1 of the 1965 World Series because it fell on Yom Kippur. Koufax garnered national attention for his decision, as an example of the conflict between social pressures and personal beliefs. Throughout his career, Koufax did not pitch on any of the High Holy Days, reportedly even having it written into his contract. A secular Jew, Koufax opted to remain in his hotel room that day and, contrary to many rumors at the time, did not attend any Yom Kippur service.\nHall of Fame first baseman Hank Greenberg attracted national attention in 1934, when he refused to play baseball on Yom Kippur, even though the Tigers were in the middle of a pennant race, and he was leading the league in runs batted in. Columnist and poet Edgar A. Guest expressed the general opinion in a poem titled \"Came Yom Kippur: Speaking of Greenberg\". The poem, published in the Detroit Free Press, ends with the lines:\nWe shall miss him on the infield and shall miss him at the bat.\nBut he's true to his religion \u2013 and I honor him for that!\nThe Detroit press and a number of fans did not take kindly to Greenberg's decision, particularly since the Tigers lost to the New York Yankees 5\u20132, partly due to Greenberg's absence from the lineup. However, in his autobiography, Greenberg recalled that, much to his embarrassment, he received a standing ovation from congregants at Congregation Shaarey Zedek when he arrived for the services on Yom Kippur.\nLos Angeles Dodgers outfielder Shawn Green, similarly, made headlines in 2001 for sitting out a game for the first time in 415 games (then the longest streak among active players) on Yom Kippur, even though his team was in the middle of a playoff race. Other baseball players who have similarly sat out games on Yom Kippur include Kevin Youkilis, Brad Ausmus, and Art Shamsky.\nFootball player Gabe Carimi, at the time an All-American left tackle in American football who won the 2010 Outland Trophy as the nation's top collegiate interior lineman, faced a conflict in his freshman year of college in 2007. That year Yom Kippur fell on a Saturday, and he fasted until an hour before his football game against Iowa started that night. Carimi said, \"Religion is a part of me, and I don't want to just say I'm Jewish. I actually do make sacrifices that I know are hard choices.\"  In 2004, Matt Bernstein, standout fullback at University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, fasted on Yom Kippur, then broke his fast on the sidelines before rushing for 123 yards in a game against Penn State.\nIn 2011, golfer Laetitia Beck declined a request to join the University of North Carolina Tar Heels Invitational competition, because it conflicted with Yom Kippur.  Instead, she spent the day fasting and praying.  She said: \"My Judaism is very important to me, and ... on Yom Kippur, no matter what, I have to fast.\" Boris Gelfand, Israel's top chess player, played his game in the prestigious London Grand Prix Chess Tournament on 25 September 2012 (eve of Yom Kippur) earlier, to avoid playing on the holiday.\nIn 2013, the International Tennis Federation fined the Israel Tennis Association \"more than $13,000 ... for the inconvenience\" of having to reschedule a tennis match between the Israeli and Belgian teams that was originally scheduled on Yom Kippur.

Its work lay the ground for the 1926 Slavery Convention. \nHistory\nBackground and foundation\nThe TSC was preceeded by the Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889\u201390, which had adressed the slavery in a semi-global level via the representatives of the colonial powers. It had concluded with the  Brussels Conference Act of 1890. The 1890 Act was revised by the \nConvention of Saint-Germain-en-Laye 1919. After the League of Nations was founded in 1920, a need was felt to conduct an investigation of the excistence of slavery and slave trade in the world on a global level, with the purpose of eradicating it were it excisted. \nThe League of Nations conducted an informal investigation about the excistence of slavery and slave trade in 1922-1923, gathering information from both governments as well as NGO's such as the Anti-Slavery Society and the Bureau international pour la d\u00e9fense des indig\u00e8nes (International Bureau for the Defense of the Native Races, BIDI).\nThe result of the report demonstracted the situation with chattel slavery in the Arabian Peninsula, Sudan and Tanganyika, as well as the illegal trafficking and force labor in the French colonies, South Africa, Portuguese Mozambique and Latin America. \nHowever, governments and colonial authorites refused to accept information from private NGO's as official information from the League. \nIn December 1923, the League requested information from governments about the issue. When all governments answered with the reply that slavery did not excist within their territories, or had already been abolished, the League saw the need to establish a committee to conduct a formal investigation.\nThe Temporary Slavery Commission (TSC) was founded by the League in 1924, and held its first meeting in the Summer of 1924. It was composed by eight expert members.\nActivity\nThe TSC was to conduct a formal international investigation of all slavery and slave trade globally, and act for its total abolition. One of the issues was to create a formal definition of slavery.\nAt this point in time, chattel slavery was still legal in the Arabian Peninsula, such as in Saudi Arabia, in Yemen and in Oman, which was provided with slaves via foremost the Red Sea slave trade. The Mui tsai system in China attracted considerable attention in this time period. \nThe TSC filed their report to the League on 25 July 1925, after which it was disbanded. The TSC recommended that all legal chattel slavery and slave trade should be declared illegal; that slave trade by sea should be defined as piracy; that escaped slaves should be entitled to protection; that slave trade and slave raids schould be criminalized, and that force labor should be prohibited.\nAftermath and legacy\nThe investigation of the TSC lay the foundation of the 1926 Slavery Convention.\nOn 5 September 1929, the Sixth Commission of the League Assembly raised the need to evaluate the enforcement of the 1926 Slavery Convention, and the Committee of Experts on Slavery (CES) was created, which in turn founded the first permanent slavery committee, the Advisory Committee of Experts on Slavery (ACE).\nSee also\nBrussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889\u201390, 1889\nCommittee of Experts on Slavery, 1932\nAdvisory Committee of Experts on Slavery, 1933\nAd Hoc Committee on Slavery, 1950\n",
    "Chinese musician and educator\nZhao Manqin (Chinese: \u8d75\u66fc\u7434; born in 1953) is a Chinese musician and educator. He is a member of the Chinese Musician's Association, Director of the Chinese National Orchestra Society, Visiting professor at the China Conservatory of Music.\nZhao Manqin developed the kuaisu zhixu (Fast Finger Sequence Technique System) which drew on the playing techniques of piano, violin, and pipa.\nBiography\nZhao Manqin was born in 1953 in the Xinye County of Henan Province, China. He started writing and publishing music at the age of 16. Zhao Manqin attended the Xinye County Middle School in 1965 and continued his education at the Seaman School in Xinye County in 1962. He later attended the Xinye County Middle School. Due to his father's persecution during the Cultural Revolution, Zhao was sent to perform agricultural work in the countryside in 1966. Despite this, he continued his involvement in music and joined various performance groups, including the Xinye County Cultural Troupe in 1972.\nIn 1972, he developed the kuaisu zhixu  (Fast Finger Sequence Technique System), which drew on the piano, violin, and pipa playing techniques. This system is widely used by the Guzheng industry in China.\nIn 1978, his fast-fingering composition, \"The Sun is Shining Red on Jinggang Mountain\", was included in the curriculum of the Central Conservatory of Music.\nFrom 1980, he was invited lecturer at major music conservatories and academies in China and internationally, including the Central Conservatory of Music, Folk Music Department of the Central Conservatory of Music, Xi'an Conservatory of Music, Xinghai Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Normal University Music College, Guangxi Arts College, Kunming Medical University, Eastman School of Music in the United States and the National Australian University in Australia.\nIn the mid-1980s, he began work on Guzheng education and established the Guzheng Art Institute. He subsequently conducted educational courses in Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Xinzheng, Xingyang, Henan Youtian, Nanyang, and Haikou and provided training to professional and amateur Guzheng teachers across China.\nIn 1986 his work \"Symmetry and Inertia\" was presented at the First National Guzheng Academic Conference along with the performance of the Guzheng piece dahu shangshan (Fighting the tiger in the mountain) by his disciple Wang Zhongshan using the fast fingering he developed which led to the recognition of his technique.\nMany of his students and master class students hold leading positions in various music performance groups and music institutions, including, Wang Zhongshan (Professor at China Conservatory of Music),  Li Meng (Professor at the Central Conservatory of Music), Fan Yifeng (Professor at Xi'an Conservatory of Music), Wang Wei (Professor at Shanghai Conservatory of Music), Luo Xiaoci (Director of Shanghai National Orchestra), Gao Liang (Professor at Shenyang Conservatory of Music), Chen Weimin (Associate professor at Xinghai Conservatory of Music), Zhang Tong (Professor at Harbin Normal University), Sun Zhuo (Professor at Shaanxi Normal University), and Mao Ya (Lecturer at the University of Tokyo in Japan), and others.\nGuzheng performance techniques\nIn 1972, he developed the kuaisu zhixu  (Fast Finger Sequence Technique System) which drew on the playing techniques of piano, violin, and pipa. This system is widely used by the Guzheng industry in China. This system solved the limitation of Guzheng in playing fast passages of heptatonic scale and facilitated the inclusion of the Guzheng to perform with the rest of the traditional instruments in an orchestra setting. This system changed three finger wearing plectra playing in octave symmetry to all eight fingers wearing plectra plucking approach. This change expanded the potential Guzheng fingering sequences, allowing playing fast passages of pentatonic scale, heptatonic scale, and chromatic scale.\nIn 1978, his fast-fingering composition, \"The Sun is Shining Red on Jinggang Mountain\", was included in the curriculum of the Central Conservatory of Music.\nAfter the 1986 presentation of his work \"Symmetry and Inertia\" at the First National Guzheng Academic Conference, along with the performance of the Guzheng piece dahu shangshan (Fighting the tiger in the mountain) by his follower Wang Zhongshan using the fast fingering he developed, his technique gained recognition. This performance contributed to the nationwide spread of Zhao Manqin's fast finger sequence compositions such as \"The Sun is Shining Red on Jinggang Mountain\", \"Climbing the Mountain to Beat the Tiger\", \"Ode of Shan Dan Flower\", \"Evening Party\", and \"Hora Dance\".  It also led to the nationwide implementation of the fast-fingering system into Guzheng practice and performance. Composers subsequently started to compose contemporary repertoires using the fast-fingering sequence techniques, including \"Dance of Yi Tribe\", \"Spring in Xiangjiang River\", \"Eternal Lament",
    "Extinct genus of endemic Palaeogene European artiodactyls\nHaplomeryx is an extinct genus of Palaeogene artiodactyls belonging to the family Xiphodontidae. It was endemic to western Europe and lived from the middle Eocene up to the earliest Oligocene. Haplomeryx was first established as a genus by the German naturalist Max Schlosser in 1886 based on a molar tooth set from Quercy Phosphorites deposits. Three additional species were erected and classified to the xiphodontid genus while one other species, first recognized in 1822, was tentatively classified to it and remains unresolved in affinity.\nLittle is known about Haplomeryx due to its poor cranial and postcranial fossil records. Its dentition is thought to have been typical of xiphodonts such as Xiphodon and Dichodon because of most of its premolars being elongated, its dental differences being more specific compared to the other two genera. Although it may have displayed an evolutionary size increase by species, all of them remained very small in size especially in comparison to the two other xiphodont genera. It lived in western Europe back when it was an archipelago that was isolated from the rest of Eurasia, meaning that it lived in a tropical-subtropical environment with various other faunas that also evolved with strong levels of endemism. This meant that it coexisted with a wide variety of other artiodactyls and perissodactyls including the aforementioned xiphodont genera.\nIt and other xiphodont genera went extinct by the Grande Coupure extinction/faunal turnover event, coinciding with shifts towards further glaciation and seasonality plus dispersals of Asian immigrant faunas into western Europe. The causes of its extinction are attributed to negative interactions with immigrant faunas (resource competition, predation), environmental turnover from climate change, or some combination of the two.\nTaxonomy\nHaplomeryx zittleli upper molars\nIn 1886, the German naturalist Max Schlosser erected the genus Haplomeryx, known solely from selenodont molars from the Quercy Phosphorites. He proposed that its dentition is most similar to that of Agriochoerus and established the species Haplomeryx zitteli based on an upper jaw fragment consisting of three molars that in total measure 14\u00a0mm (0.55\u00a0in) long. He noted its small size and theorized that it was the only European member of mammals that were of close affinities with the North American Agriochoerus. The etymology of the genus name derives in Ancient Greek from \u1f01\u03c0\u03bb\u03cc\u03bf\u03c2 (simple) and \u03bc\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03be (ruminant) meaning \"simple ruminant\".\nIn 1910, the Swiss palaeontologist Hans Georg Stehlin made a review of Haplomeryx amongst other European artiodactyls, stating that he did not notice its fossils having been previously described under any synonymous name and that its overall anatomy is not known. The first species he erected was H. Picteti based on fossil previously described from Mormont in Switzerland, noting that the teeth are smaller than those of H. zitteli and that it has slightly different molar morphologies. The second and other species that Stehlin named was H. egerkingensis based on dentition from the Swiss municipality of Egerkingen. He also tentatively reclassified the species  Dichobune obliquum, previously described by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1822 as Anoplotherium (Dichobune) obliquum, to Haplomeryx as H? obliquus. H? obliquus is known only by a single specimen from Montmartre in France, thus making its affinities problematic to resolve.\nThe French palaeontologist Charles Dep\u00e9ret established the species H. Euzetensis based on dental fossils from the French commune of Euzet in 1917. He said that the species was intermediate in size between H. zitteli and H. picteti.\nClassification\nHaplomeryx belongs to the Xiphodontidae, a Palaeogene artiodactyl family endemic to western Europe that lived from the middle Eocene to the early Oligocene (~44 Ma to 33 Ma). Like the other contemporary endemic artiodactyl families of western Europe, the evolutionary origins of the Xiphodontidae are poorly known. The Xiphodontidae is generally thought to have first appeared by MP14 of the Mammal Palaeogene zones, making them the first selenodont dentition artiodactyl representatives to have appeared in the landmass along with the Amphimerycidae. More specifically, the first xiphodont representatives to appear were the genera Dichodon and Haplomeryx by MP14. Dichodon and Haplomeryx continued to persist into the late Eocene while Xiphodon made its first appearance by MP16. Another xiphodont Paraxiphodon is known to have occurred only in MP17a localities. The former three genera lived up to the early Oligocene where they have been recorded to have all gone extinct as a result of the Grande Coupure faunal turnover event.\nThe phylogenetic relations of the Xiphodontidae as well as the Anoplotheriidae, Mixtotheriidae and Cainotheriidae have been elusive due to the selenodont morphologies (or having crescent-shaped ridges) ",
    "American slave trader (~1783\u20131853)\nJilson Dove (c.\u20091785\u00a0\u2013 June 14, 1853) was a resident of Washington, D.C. in the United States. He worked at a number of occupations including federal police officer guarding Native American delegations visiting the city, municipal constable, fishmonger, restauranteur, real estate agent, and slave trader. In the 1830s he caught the attention of abolitionists, in part due to his work as a local slave patroller. Dove would probably have been considered a slave-trading agent, meaning a second-tier trader who primarily concentrated on local, small-scale buying for resale to the larger interstate slave dealers.\nLife and work\nDove was born in the state of Virginia around 1785. Dove was married in Baltimore, Maryland in 1810 to Mary Drugan. Dove served as a sergeant in the District of Columbia militia during the War of 1812. In 1813, when he was about 28 years old, he announced in the newspaper that he was ending his business partnership but would continue in the brickmaking business independently. Dove advertised twice in the Alexandria Gazette in 1816, in February he had for sale some Waterloo-striped calico fabric, and in June he offered newly arrived pickled oysters. In 1819 he was suspended from his Masonic lodge for \"unmasonic conduct\". The same year, he was to take the oath of an insolvent debtor in an Alexandria, District of Columbia courtroom.\nJilson Dove in Carded Records of Soldiers Who Served in Volunteer Organizations During the War of 1812, compiled 1899\u20131927\nIn spring 1820 he was advertising real estate to Alexandria buyers. He was enumerated as a resident of Washington, D.C. at the time of the 1820 census. His obituary later stated that he had moved from Virginia to D.C. in around 1820. By 1821 he was operating a fish market at the Red House Landing below Alexandria. Two years later he was to be confined in prison as a debtor. His fortunes seemed to turn somewhat after that, as he became a host of the Union Hotel, which boasted of its fine green turtle dinner, and canvasback ducks available for either dinner service or for sale to home cooks. By the end of the decade he operated and advertised an \"elegant refectory\" adjacent to a coffeehouse, and he also sought to buy and sell quality secondhand furniture.\nIn June 1833, Benjamin Lundy, a highly influential early abolitionist, mentioned Jilson Dove in his newspaper Genius of Universal Emancipation:\nLast week, a very decent, orderly-looking, colored woman, was coming over the bridge to our city to get employ, it is said. She was seen by a man, named Jilson Dove, a constable, who buys and catches negroes for the traders. The woman finding she was about to be taken to the pen or enclosure,\u2014where all kidnapped and others are put, before taken to the south,\u2014got loose, and attempted to run away from the constable\u2014but he followed her so close, she had no way to escape but by jumping into the river, where she was drowned. No fuss or stir was made about it,\u2014she was got out of the river, and buried\u2014and there the matter ended.\nVarious Jilson Dove advertisements of the 1820s and 1830s\nIt was in the 1830s that Dove turned to slave-trading on a continuing basis, although he continued to engage in other work. He was a third-ward constable for the District of Columbia Police Department in 1832, a salaried job that paid $50 a year. For example, in February and March of 1833 Dove was paid by U.S. Senator Henry Clay to drive his cattle between Kentucky and Pennsylvania. In 1832 a Welsh newspaper reprinted several slave-trade ads from the Washington Intelligencer, including one of Washington Robey's, and commented that they would be read with \"astonishment and disgust.\" The first listed was placed by Jilson Dove and stated \"Money\u00a0! Money\u00a0! Money\u00a0!\u2014 I wish to purchase from twenty to thirty likely young Negroes of both sexes from twelve to twenty -five years of age. For all or part I will give more money than anyone in Washington City or Montgomery County, Md. Apply to the subscriber near the corner of the 13th and E streets Nov 24 JILSON DOVE.\" In 1833, Dove was working out of the Hendley Tavern and was willing trade for houses for \"servants,\" which was one of the preferred euphemisms used in polite discourse to describe enslaved black people. In Slave-Trading in the Old South (1931), historian Frederic Bancroft wrote that: \"Jilson Dove, probably a real estate agent, wished 'to purchase from forty to fifty Negroes of both sexes, from the age of twelve to twenty-five', and to give in exchange two two-story brick houses in the business part of Washington. Obviously he was agent for some interstate trader when he later 'wanted immediately from 25 to 30 negroes of both sexes'. As this was more than the District was likely to supply, it was an appeal to Maryland and Virginia. The trading in District slaves\u2014which was relatively slight, spasmodic and carried on chiefly by agents\u2014also comprised, of course, sales to settle estates, collect debts",
    "French journalist\nJacques Ferran (30 March 1920 \u2013 7 February 2019) was a French sports journalist and author. He was the editor-in-chief at L'Equipe and the director of France Football. He contributed to the creation of the European Cup and the Ballon d'Or.\nCareer\nFerran was born to Pierre Ferran, a magistrate, and Lucie, daughter of a Neapolitan goldsmith, Alberto Coppola, who immigrated and settled as a jeweler in Montpellier. In 1943, he escaped the STO and took refuge with his family in Aveyron. He later studied at the Faculty of Letters in the Paul Val\u00e9ry University Montpellier, and had his first job experience at Tigre, a weekly newspaper created in 1945, then at Echo du Midi, a daily newspaper that quickly disappeared.\nIn 1948, he was hired by Jacques Goddet at L'\u00c9quipe, on the recommendation of Emmanuel Gambardella, President of the French Football Federation. He joined the football section, then directed by Jacques de Ryswick. In the meantime, the South American Championship of Champions, kicked off in 1948 after years of deliberation and organisation and set into motion the antecedent of the Copa Libertadores. Ferran became fascinated with the 1948 South American idea of a continental club competition. The UEFA document on the history of the European Cup confirms that Jacques Ferran and Gabriel Hanot, journalists for the French sports newspaper L'\u00c9quipe, were the founding fathers of the competition. In addition, Ferran drafted the first regulations and carried out the first draw for the inaugural season of the tournament.\nIn interviews to the Brazilian sports TV programme Globo Esporte in 2015 and Chilean newspaper El Merc\u00fario in 2018, Ferran said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Cup:\nHow could Europe, which wanted to be ahead of the rest of the world, not be able to accomplish a competition of the same kind of the South American one? We needed to follow that example.\u2014\u200a\nIn addition, he collaborated as a dramatic critic with France Catholique from 1948 to 1953. In 1956, the Ballon d'Or award was introduced, when he was in the editorial staff of France Football. He also worked for ten years as a sports specialist at L'Express, which was founded by Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber and Fran\u00e7oise Giroud. In the 1970s, Ferran provided analysis in favor of the renovation of French football, which was adopted by the Federation President, Fernand Sastre. He kept working on the editorial staff of L'\u00c9quipe until his retirement in 1985. In February 1999, he was handed a trophy by Johan Cruyff for the most illustrious football journalist in the world, during a televised gala evening, organized at the Liceu by the International Football Hall of Champions.\nOn 7 February 2019, the newspaper L'\u00c9quipe announced the death of Ferran, aged 98.\nPersonal life\nOn 26 December 1942, Ferran married Colette Guye, with whom he had five children: Philippe, Catherine, Christine, Jean-Jacques and Pascale.\nTribute\nMichel Platini paid tribute to him:\nI never considered Jacques Ferran as a journalist in the field, but as a football philosopher.

    "Former railway station in Roseworthy, South Australia\nRoseworthy railway station was located at the junction of the Morgan railway line and the Roseworthy-Peterborough railway line. Situated in the town of Roseworthy, South Australia, it was located 49 kilometres from Adelaide by rail.\nHistory\nOpening\nRoseworthy railway station opened on 13 August 1860 as part of the extension of what was then known as the Northern Railway to Kapunda. The station was built on land within the Hundred of Mudla Wirra that was purchased by landowners William and Grace Gartrell. The station facilities included a two-storey stone station building and a stone goods shed. The design of the original station building was similar to the buildings that once existed at Dry Creek and Salisbury. The station became a junction station on 3 July 1869, with the opening of the railway line to Forresters (Now Tarlee.) The railway to Kapunda reached Morgan on 23 September 1878, providing a connection to the Murray River. The railway to Tarlee reached the Crystal Brook-Broken Hill railway line at Petersburg (now Peterborough) on 11 May 1881. The passenger platforms were extended in 1913 to allow for longer trains to stop at the station. In approximately the 1950s-1960s, the original 1860 two-storey station building was replaced with a single-storey building. In 1960, grain silos were provided at the station yard, allowing goods trains to load wheat from the area for export.\nClosure and demolition\nIn 1978, the station and all associated infrastructure was included in the transfer of South Australian Railways to Australian National. The station closed for regular passenger use on 13 December 1986, but some special tours used the station up until 2004. In 1997, the station and railway line were included in the transfer of Australian National's South Australian freight assets to Australian Southern Railroad (later known as One Rail Australia.) During May\u2013June 2005, most station infrastructure, including the station building, water tower, and east-side platform were demolished. Grain trains last used the silos at Roseworthy on 2 February 2007, and the remaining stored hoppers were collected on 11 October 2007. The station remnants and railway line were included in Aurizon's purchase of One Rail Australia in 2022.\nPresent Day\nThe east-side passenger platform, railway tracks and grain silos in 2012Only the west-side platform, the railway tracks, and grain silos remain. The grain silos are still serviced by trucks, which use a gravel driveway constructed on the railway tracks. The goods crane has been moved to a park adjacent the former east-side platform, while the water column for steam locomotives was moved to the nearby primary school, displayed next to a semaphore signal similar to those used on the railway line.\n",
    "Parish church in Gryfice, Poland\nChurch in Gryfice, Poland\nThe St. Mary's Church (Polish: Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Mariacki, German: St. Marienkirche), or formally, Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Gryfice, is a parish church, one of the religious buildings in the city, built from the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries to the end of the 15th century.\nIt is a Gothic sacred building with a polygonal plan and rib and lierne vaults, which was rebuilt (from 1659 to 1668), expanded, and renovated (17th and 19th centuries) over the centuries. Apart from the chancel, the nave, and the tower, it had two additional chapels dedicated to the Virgin Mary (now: sacristy) and St. Mary. The church was dedicated in 1498. The sacred object covers an area of 1,108 m2 and a volume of 15,905 m3 (according to other sources: 1,115 m2 and 38,660 m3). On the external elevations, there are metope friezes, mascarons, buttresses adorned with a cross and lily, as well as traceries, which are rare in the architectural decoration of sacred buildings in Western Pomerania. The church has historical furnishings, including a Romanesque baptismal font from the 13th century, a late Gothic triptych from the end of the 15th century, a Baroque main altar, and eighteenth-century pulpit, pipe organs, choir stalls, numerous tombstones, and epitaphs.\nLocation\nView of St. Mary's Church at sunset (2008)\nThe parish church is located in the central part of the Old Town, south of Victory Square and separated by the southern row. Its roof faces Ko\u015bcielna Street. It is situated in the so-called market block from its southern side, at the corner of Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci Street, Ko\u015bcielna Street, and Wojska Polskiego Street.\nThe main portal of the church is located on Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci Street, in the western facade of the church tower. Side entrances are located on the southern wall of the nave.\nHistory\nBells of St. Mary's church\n18th century epitaph in the porch of the church\nRomanesque baptismal font\nThe construction of the St. Mary's Church in Gryfice dates back to the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. The exact start date of the construction of the parish church is not known. Under the date of 1297, there is a written mention of the parson Ludevinus, indicating that the construction of the building was advanced and partially fulfilling its function. The cornerstone was probably laid a few years later, although there are indications that the current church was built on the site of the former wooden one. This is associated with the granting of city rights in 1262 and the construction of the town on the left bank of the Rega river.\nInitially, the eastern part of the church was built (now the chancel), along with the St. Mary's Chapel, which served as a church treasury until 1534 (now the sacristy). Part of this construction was completed in the early 14th century. The nave, the central part of the current church, was built according to different architectural concepts between 1300 and 1350. Various span walls were used in the construction, with the southern one wider than the northern one. Different profiled jambs were also used. Some scholars suggest that the nave was the first part of the building to be constructed. They base this on a continuous frieze (called metope) with a floral or vine motif, which is the only one of its kind on the church. The rest of the building is filled with friezes with \"blind\" tracery.\nSeveral decades later, the church tower was built, probably in the early 15th century. Originally, it was built on a granite foundation, with the upper parts made of brick and the top made of wood. It had a gable roof with a slender pointed spire. The current appearance of the tower's facade and its crowning is the result of later reconstructions after fires in 1496, 1562, 1568, and 1658. The final stage of expansion was the construction of the St. Mary's Chapel (German: Kapelle der Maria), located on the northern facade of the nave. Its completion in 1498 marked the end of the temple's construction. In the same year, the church was dedicated by Bishop Martin von Karith.\nUntil 13 December 1534, the church belonged to the Latin Church, and then, as a result of the Reformation, it was taken over by the Lutheran Church. This led to significant neglect of the building, managed by the deacons of that time. Restoration work began in the early 17th century when the library was arranged anew, the organs were repaired, and the tower's crowning was renovated.\nOn 31 March 1658, a fire destroyed the southern, western, and central parts of the city, including the church, from which only partially load-bearing walls and pillars remained. St. Mary's Chapel survived the fire. Between 1659 and 1668, the reconstruction of the church took place. Load-bearing walls were rebuilt, and the upper parts of the charred pillars were restored. In 1663, the reconstruction of the church tower, which had collapsed, began. A year later, three new cast bells were consecrated and ",

    "American suspected serial killer\nMelvin Chelcie Carr (January 5, 1915 \u2013 April 20, 1977) was an American murderer, rapist, and suspected serial killer from Indiana who accidentally killed himself after murdering three people with carbon monoxide in 1977.\nEarlier crimes\nCarr was born on January 5, 1915, in Wheelersburg, Ohio. He worked as a construction engineer in the Eastern Hemisphere before joining the U.S. Army in 1942.\nIn 1947, Carr was charged with scamming a woman in a construction deal, as well as kidnapping and raping a woman who was hitchhiking in Kimball, Nebraska. In June 1949, while serving a five-year sentence for transporting a stolen car across state lines, he was diagnosed as \"paranoid and a hopeless prospect for rehabilitation.\"\nAfter his release, he worked as a businessman in Indianapolis, selling items imported from Mexico. Neighbors described him as a friendly and talented carpenter, albeit also \"weird\" and preoccupied with women. Carr was known to be a night owl who frequently chatted at a local 24-hour diner.\nIn March 1971, Carr was convicted of violating the Mann Act after he drove a 14-year-old girl to Mexico for sex. He was also suspected of raping another teenage girl around this time. For the former crime, he was sentenced to five years of imprisonment at USP Terre Haute. He later attempted to hire an inmate to murder the girl, an elderly woman, and two federal officers involved in his conviction, and was placed in maximum security. After his release, he served another prison sentence for embezzlement.\nMurders\nAround 4:00\u00a0a.m. on April 20, 1977, Carr's wife entered the garage of their Indianapolis home and discovered Melvin dead on the floor, with three people (later identified as Sandra Harris, aged 17, Karen Mills, aged 24, and Robert Mills Jr. (Karen's son), aged 2) dead in the trunk of his car. It was determined that Carr had kidnapped them at gunpoint the night prior, raped Sandra and Karen, and gassed the three with a hose connected from the exhaust pipe to the trunk. Melvin, upon opening the trunk and holding a handkerchief to his face, accidentally succumbed to the same carbon monoxide he killed his victims with. Police said that Carr had been dating Karen.\nSuspected crimes\nThe discovery prompted police to investigate other murders in the area for which Carr may have been responsible. One suspicious case was the disappearance of Lois Williams, 35, and her daughter Karen, 17. On the night of January 25\u201326, 1967, Lois and Karen disappeared from their apartment in Indianapolis. Lois's vehicle was found abandoned at a service station owned by Carr with mud on the tires; no blood was found at the scene, and nothing was reported missing from their apartment.\nAfter their disappearance, police suspected Carr's involvement and brought him in for questioning; however, he was released due to insufficient evidence. According to a letter Lois wrote to her father, Carr had raped her and attempted to buy her silence for $10,000. In 1977, police excavated Carr's backyard and garage in an unsuccessful attempt to locate the remains of the two women.\nAccording to Carr's then-neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, on the evening of January 25, 1967, they witnessed him leaving the service station with Lois. He returned two hours later, telling them that Lois had gone to a bar and wouldn't come out. The following morning, Carr's father ran to the neighbors and said that someone had robbed and beaten Melvin. He was in a daze, soaking wet, and covered with sand. After guiding Carr to his bedroom, the neighbors wanted to call the police, but Carr protested. Upon visiting the service station\u2014the supposed site of the robbery\u2014the door was found to be still locked from overnight, and nothing was moved besides Carr's vehicle, which had been washed thoroughly.\nMonths after the incident, Carr checked into a local hospital for dizzy spells. During this time, he called Mrs. Campbell, telling her to go over to his garage to make sure he locked the door because he had \"valuable tools and things in there.\" Mrs. Campbell did not, as her husband was at work, and she was suspicious of Carr after Sgt. Robert Grubbs told her of his possible involvement in the disappearance of Lois. While he was in fact admitted to the hospital, the night of the call, a nurse found Carr and his clothes missing from his room. He returned the following morning complaining of breathing problems.\nDays after his death, a 7-year-old girl identified Carr as the man who had enticed her into a vehicle and sodomized her two years earlier. Police also considered him a suspect in an August 19, 1975, attack on three teenage girls from Indianapolis. While hitchhiking, they were driven to a cornfield in nearby Hancock County, where they were bound, raped, and slashed. However, the perpetrator for that crime was identified in 2024 as Thomas Edward Williams, a sex offender who died in a Texas prison in 1983. Forensic genealogy and DNA was used to link h",
    "Welsh Benedictine monk\nJohn Jones, also known as Leander \u00e0 Sancto Martino, (1575 \u2013 17 December 1636) was a Welsh Benedictine monk.\nBiography\nJones was born in 1575. He belonged to a family settled at Llan Wrinach, Brecknockshire, and was connected with the Scudamore family of Kentchurch, Herefordshire. Ralph Weldon asserts that Jones was removed from Wales to England when scarcely a year old (Chronicle of the Benedictine Monke, p.\u00a0100). His parents. who were Protestants, sent him to Merchant Taylors' School, London, in 1584, and there he studied with Lancelot Andrewes and William Juxon, afterwards bishop of London, On 15 October 1591 he was elected a scholar of St John's College, Oxford, where he was chamber-fellow with William Laud. He obtained a fellowship in his college, and was admitted to the degree of B.C.L. on 16 July 1600. 'His mind being much inclined to the Roman religion,' he quit the university, and within a few days of his arrival in London his parents died of the plague. Thereupon Jones left England for Spain, was received into the English Collage at Valladolid, then under the direction of the jesuits, 20 December 1596, and took the college oath on the feast of St. Alban, 1597. In October 1599 he was admitted into the Benedictine abbey of St. Martin at Compostella, and became a monk of that order, taking, in religion, the name of Leander \u00e0 Sancto Martino. He passed brilliantly through his theological studies in the university of Salamanca, was ordained priest, and, after graduating D.D., continued his studies for about six years in Spanish monasteries.\nAlthough ordered to the English mission, Jones acted successively as novice-master at the abbey of St. Remigiua at Rhelms, and at St. Gregory's at Douay. He was also for nearly twenty-five years professor of theology, and taught Hebrew in the college of Marchiennes, or in that of St. Vedast, in the university of Douay. In 1612 he became vicar-general of the Anglo-Spanish Benedictines. When in 1619 the present English Benedictine congregation was formally approved by Pope Paul V, Jones was elected its first president-general for the usual triennial period, and wua re-elected in 1633. According to decrees of the general chapter of the Benedictine congregation, he acted as prior of St. Gregory's at Douay from 1621 to 1628, and from 1629 to 1633. In 1629 he was appointed abbot of Cisniar, and in 1633 received the titular diguity of cathedral prior of Canterbury.\nJones frequently visited England, and enjoyed special protection through the agency of his friends at court. When early in 1634 Urban VIII determined to send an accredited agent to England to open diplomatic relations he chose Jones for the important mission. Jones displayed a general spirit of good sense and moderation, and took the oath of allegiance on 17 December 1634, appending to it a declaration that the pope had no dispensing power in regard to the oath (Clarendon State Papers, 1. 210). In letlers addressed by him to Cardinal Barberini, he sought to refute charges of minimising the Pope's pretensions and the claims of the Catholics. The negotiations led to no practical result. But Francis Harris, a secular priest who had conformed to the established church, deposed in 1643, before the lords' committee appointed to take the examinations in the case of Archbishop Laud, that Father Leander, 'by the common report of papists and priests, both abroad and in England, was very familiar with the said archbishop, and came over on purpose into England ... to negotiate with the said archbishop about matters of religion, to make a reconciliation between the church of Rome and England' (Prynne, Canterburie's Doome, pp.\u00a0411, 412). Laud denied the truth of this accusation.\nJones died in London on 17 December (O.S.) 1636, and was buried in the chapel of the Capuchin friars in Somerset House. Wood describes him as 'the ornament of the English Benedictines in his time,' adding that 'he was a person of extraordinary eloquence generally knowing in all arts and sciences, beloved of all that knew him and his worth, and hated by none but by the puritans and jesuits (Athen\u00e6 Oxon. ed.

    "English lieutenant-general and colonel-commandant in the Royal Engineers\nGriffith George Lewis (10 November 1784 \u2013 24 October 1859) was an English lieutenant-general and colonel-commandant in the Royal Engineers.\nBiography\nLewis was born at Woolwich on 10 November 1784. He was educated privately and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. On completing the course of study at the academy, he was sent with the next two senior cadets to the west of England to be instructed in surveying under Major William Mudge, before obtaining his commission in the Royal Engineers. He was gazetted second lieutenant on 15 March 1803, and lieutenant on 2 July the same year. After a year at Chatham he joined the Portsmouth command, and in May 1805 embarked with the expedition under Sir James Craig. He served for a time at Malta, and then took part in the campaign of Naples and Calabria. He was present at the battle of Maida on 4 July 1806, and after it joined Colonel Oswald's brigade in a projected attack on the castle of Scylla. They arrived before the place on the night of 11 July. Lewis and the English engineers laboured unceasingly in the construction of the siege batteries, from which fire was opened on the 21st. So great was the effect that on the following day the garrison capitulated. It consisted of some four hundred sappers and miners and artillerymen, being all the men of the technical corps of the Calabrian army, under Colonel Michel of the French engineers.\nLewis was promoted second captain on 18 November 1807. He served under Sir John Stuart at the capture of Ischia and Procida in the Bay of Naples in August 1809, and in the Ionian Islands under Sir John Oswald at the siege of Santa Maura in 1810. In February 1811 he returned to England, staying at Gibraltar on his way, and was stationed at Woolwich. On 10 July he embarked with the expedition for Sweden and the Danish island of Anhalt, and returning in September was sent to the eastern district.

He was mentioned in Lord Lynedoch's despatches as having distinguished himself by gallant conduct, and was promoted brevet major on 21 September for his services. The same month he returned to England invalided. After some time on the sick list he joined the army of occupation in France, and in the autumn of 1817 was employed on special service.\nOn 18 January 1819 he embarked for Newfoundland, where he served for some years. On 29 July 1825 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. He returned to England on 18 September 1827.

    "\nIf We Burn: The Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution is a 2023 political history and journalism book by author and journalist Vincent Bevins. The book concerns the wave of mass protests during the 2010s decade and examines the question of how the organization and tactics of such protests resulted in a \"missing revolution,\" in that most of these movements appear to have failed in their goals and even led to a \"record of failures, setbacks, and cataclysms\". The title refers to a protest sign during the 2014 Hong Kong protests which quoted The Hunger Games line, \"If we burn, you burn with us.\"\nThe book begins by tracing the history of left wing activism from the end of the October Revolution, through the New Left and into the present day. In particular, it traces the history of Vanguardism in left wing movement politics and the shift toward distributed, horizontal structures in mass protest movements since the early 20th century. The final chapter assesses the problems with the horizontally-structured movements of the 2010s and observes that the lack of central leadership enabled media misrepresentation of movement interests which subsequently defused and dissipated the energy and efficacy of the movements. Simultaneously, the lack of leadership structure also allowed right-wing groups to coopt social movements for their own purposes, leading in part to a full reversal of momentum as in Brazil.\nThe book draws on four years of research and hundreds of interviews, including with many of the original organizers of major protest movements. Bevins admits to not being a neutral observer: he was an active participant in the Movimento Passe Livre in Brazil. The book stems in part from observations on the failure of that movement and Bevins is clear to indicate where his own actions alter the trajectory of the movement.\nMovements included in the book, inter alia:\nMovimento Passe Livre, in Brazil\nArab Spring, particularly in Tunisia and Egypt\nOccupy Wall Street, in the United States\n2014 Hong Kong protests\nEuromaidan, in Ukraine\nReception\nAccording to literary review aggregator Lit Hub, the book received mostly \"Positive\" reviews. It currently has a score of 4.31 stars on Goodreads.\n\"I was not expecting this, but I think If We Burn is even better than The Jakarta Method.\"\u2014Benjamin Fogel, editor at Jacobin\nWriting for The New Republic, Osita Nwanevu agreed that future protest movements should take Bevins' conclusions into account, but critiqued the implicit horizontalism of the protest movements themselves:Lenin aside, this is all rather commonsensical\u2014or at least it ought to have been for the movements surveyed. Change is best pursued with a particular tactical or ideological direction in mind, clearly; without a designated leader or group of leaders to set that direction\u2014a \"vanguard,\" if one prefers\u2014one cannot predict the direction a movement will ultimately take, or what ideas and actors might prevail in the aftermath of a movement toppling the existing political order.\n",

    "Former palace of the Electors of Trier near Koblenz in Germany\nThe Electoral Ehrenbreitstein fortress looking down on the Philippsburg on its feet, directly at the Rhine river (around 1700) - by Jan van Call (Rijksmuseum)\nThe palace location today. Prussia reconstructed the Ehrenbreitstein fortress in the 19th century. The Philippsburg is disappeared, but its outbuildings are still there such as the Pagerie and the Dicasterial building (around 2011)\nThe Philippsburg palace (German: Schloss Philippsburg)) was a former Baroque-style palace in Ehrenbreitstein, a district of the city of Koblenz in Germany. It was situated on the banks of the Rhine river, below the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress. Constructed between 1626 and 1632 by Philipp Christoph von S\u00f6tern (1567\u20131652), Prince-Elector of Trier, it served as the main residence of the Archbishops and Prince-Electors of Trier until 1786. The palace had similarities to Schloss Johannisburg in Aschaffenburg, as they have the same architect.\nIn 1786, Prince-Elector Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony (1739\u20131812) erected a new electoral palace in Koblenz on the opposite bank of the Rhine, which then became the primary residence.\nDuring the Napoleonic era, the French army blew up the Ehrenbreitstein fortress in 1801, causing the Philippsburg palace to suffer significant damage and necessitating its demolition. Today, nothing remains of the palace, once one of the largest and most significant Baroque buildings on the Rhine. Only the adjacent structures (the Pagerie, Dicasterial building, Krummstall, and Marstall) have withstood the test of time.\nHistory\nPhilipp Christoph von S\u00f6tern\nPhilipp Christoph von S\u00f6tern\nPlan of the Ehrenbreitstein fortress and Philippsburg by Merian (1639)\nPlan of the Ehrenbreitstein fortress and Philippsburg by Merian (1639)\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, Prince-Elector Philipp Christoph von S\u00f6tern (1567\u20131652) found it necessary to relocate his residence away from Trier, which faced constant threats from France. Opting for a more secure location, he chose to erect a new palace in Koblenz. Positioned below the Ehrenbreitstein fortress, the most formidable stronghold of the Electorate of Trier, directly on the banks of the Rhine River, Philippsburg was built between 1626 and 1632.\nThe architect was Georg Ridinger, who also designed Schloss Johannisburg in Aschaffenburg, for the Prince-Electors of Mainz, between 1605 and 1614. The works were executed by master builder Albrecht Beyer from Bamberg. They created a bastioned residential palace.\nInitially aligned with the Catholic League, S\u00f6tern's deteriorating relations with the Habsburgs prompted him to switch sides to France, opposing Emperor Ferdinand II. In 1630, upon the request of its inhabitants, imperial troops occupied Trier. With support from French forces, S\u00f6tern regained control of the city in 1632. In return and to shield his bishoprics from Swedish troops, S\u00f6tern permitted France to occupy the Ehrenbreitstein fortress. However, imperial forces under Christopher of East Frisia unexpectedly recaptured Trier in 1635, leading to S\u00f6tern's subsequent imprisonment in Linz from 1635 to 1645.\n17th and 18th century: main residence of the Electors of Trier\nFranz Georg von Sch\u00f6nborn\nVessels on the Rhine in front of the Philippsburg by Jacobus Storck (around 1680\u20131699)\nA plan from the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress and the Philippsburg from the British Library (around 1760\nSuccessive Prince-Electors continued to maintain Philippsburg as their primary residence, solidifying its position as the epicenter of the Electorate's political and cultural life.\nFurthermore, the palace underwent additional expansion. Prince-Elector Karl Kaspar von der Leyen (1618\u20131676) oversaw the construction of a pathway behind the palace, leading up to the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress and carved into the rock. Along this pathway, to the south of the palace, court architect Johann Christoph Sebastiani (1640\u20131701), commissioned by Prince-Elector Johann Hugo von Orsbeck (1634\u20131711), erected a fortress gatehouse between 1690 and 1692. This gatehouse, known as the Pagerie, served as the New Chancellery.\nAt the entrance of Philippsburg, Prince-Elector Franz Georg von Sch\u00f6nborn (1682\u20131756) oversaw the construction of the Dicasterial Building (German: Dikasterialgeb\u00e4ude) between 1738 and 1749. Designed by Balthasar Neumann (1687\u20131753) and supervised by his pupil Johannes Seiz (1717\u20131779), this structure served as the central administration of the Electorate. Adjacent to the Dicasterial Building, the so-called Curved Stables (German: Krummstall) were erected between 1744 and 1747 to provide accommodations for soldiers, personnel, and workshops. At the same time, Balthasar Neumann designed the Sch\u00f6nbornslust palace as a new summer residence for Franz Georg.\nFollowing Franz Georg's reign, his successor Johann IX Philipp von Walderdorff (1701\u20131768) expanded the palace complex between 1762 and 1763 by adding new stables adjacent to the Dicasterial Building.

    "Theban tomb\nAmenemhab hunting and in front of a hyena\nThe Theban Tomb TT88 is located in Sheikh Abd el-Qurna and is part of the Theban Necropolis, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite to Luxor. It is the burial place of the ancient Egyptian official Amenemhab, also called Mahu (that is a short version of his name) who lived in the 18th Dynasty. \nFamily\nAmenemhab bears several military titles, that include overseer of the troops of the lord of the two lands (lord of the two Lands is the Egyptian king), deputy of the king in the big army and  head of the bowmen. His wife was a lady called Baki. Several children are known. They include the sons Iamu and Meri and the daughter Nebet-nehet.\nTomb\nThe tomb complex consists of a decorated tomb chapel, carved into the Theban rocks and the underground, undecorated burial chambers, that were found looted. The funerary chapel consists of two broad halls, the first one with four pillars. There is a long corridor at the end leading to a statue niche.\nThe chapel was once fully decorated with paintings, but they are today much destroyed. The scenes are showing events from the life of Amenemhab, but also religious scenes connected to the Underworld. On the right North wall of the first hall, there is Amenemhab shown in front of king Thutmose III. Much of the scene is destroyed, but in the upper half is a long biographical inscription and on the very right side appear many Syrians bringing gifts to the king. The biographical inscription reports how Amenemhab went with king Thutmose III on his Syrian campaign to conquer those regions. While the king was hunting there, an elephant attacked Thutmose III and Amenemhab proudly reports how he killed the elephant and saved the king's life. On the left of the North wall, there was once a similar scene, but only a few figures are preserved. A remarkable scene appears on the lintel between the two middle pillars. Here Amenemhab is shown hunting, in front of a big hyena.\nIn the second hall appear scenes connected with funerary rituals. On left short end, the underworld god Osiris is shown, while on the opposite short end, Amenemhab is shown on a boat and hunting in the marshes. Another scene, on the right North wall shows a big banquet with several rows of guests and musicians.\nOn the left wall of the inner corridor is shown the burial procession, with the coffin and mummy of Amenemhab and many priests and offerings. The opposite wall of the corridor shows Amenemhab and his wife in front of a garden and in front of people bring offerings.\nSee also\nList of Theban tombs\nLiterature\nHeike  Heye (2023).

    "Geothermal site in California\nDemocrat Hot Springs, named for the Democratic political party, is a geothermally heated spring located 17 miles (27\u00a0km) northeast of Bakersfield, California, United States, on the south bank of the Kern River and on the north side of California State Route 178.\nHistory\nThe Democrat Hot Springs were named for the Democratic Party of the United States when they were developed beginning in 1903 by Delbert Hill. Hill and his father constructed a 15-room hotel surrounding by cottages for 100 additional guests. In the early days access was had by the \"Breckenridge Road to Rock Springs Station after an overnight stop continued down the Cow Flat Road\"; this route was known as the Nightmare Trail. Later a four-horse stage coach picked people up in Bakersfield and reduced the travel time to the resort to a \"mere five hours\". The property has had many owners since the Hills sold out. A three-story clapboard hotel stood at Democrat Hot Springs in 1930. Charles W. West was the owner in 1967.\nAs of 2018, Democrat Hot Springs are still located on private property. They can be rented for private events.\nEcology\nDemocrat Hot Springs is part of the habitat range for the rare and endangered Kern Canyon slender salamander. The Kern River near Democrat Hot Springs is a good spot for fishing rainbow trout.\nWater profile\nThe main group of springs is located about 100\u00a0yd (91\u00a0m) from the river. According to a U.S. government geologist in 1915, \"At Democrat Springs, which are 5 miles below Delonegha Springs, hot water issues on the southwest side of Kern River, within 150 feet of its edge, but 50 or 75 feet above its surface. In 1908 there was a substantial hotel, having accommodations for 100 people...The waters of these springs are sulphureted, but they do not seem to carry notable amounts of other mineral matter...With reference to the fault origin of these springs, it was learned that although the earthquake of April 18, 1906, was not severely felt here, the main spring ceased flowing at that time. It was reopened a few months later by making a cut into the slope about 8 feet below the former point of issuance of the spring\". The spring waters do contain \"iron, sodium and other salts\".\nAccording to Kern River Country (1979), the resort had five springs. One that produced 115\u00a0\u00b0F (46\u00a0\u00b0C) at 20 US gallons per minute (0.0013\u00a0m3/s) was used for bathing while the other four were piped to a reservoir near the hotel that was used as a swimming pool.  According to an earlier source, \"At a third place another small spring forms a drinking pool.\"\nSee also\nList of hot springs in the United States \u00a7\u00a0California\nKern Canyon Fault\n",

    "\nHouse in Powys, Wales\nHarpton Court, Old Radnor, Powys, is a Tudor Revival house dating from the late 19th century. It originally formed the north-west wing to a much larger Neoclassical mansion, which was reconstructed by John Nash in the early 19th century, but the main part of the court was demolished in 1956. The house was the ancestral home of the Lewis family, whose most prominent member, George Cornewall Lewis, served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary under Lord Palmerston. The court remains a private house and is a Grade II listed building. Its gardens and grounds are listed on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.\nHistory\nThe Lewis family had owned land in Radnorshire since the 16th century, the earliest recorded presence being of Thomas Lewis (1518/1519 \u2013 1607) who was Sheriff in 1547. He also served as the Member of Parliament for Radnor from 1545 to 1553, and for Radnorshire from 1559 to 1567 and 1584\u20131587. The family continued as local landowners and minor politicians until Thomas Frankland Lewis (1780\u20131855) who held the office of Chairman of the Poor Law Commission and gained a baronetcy. His son, George Cornewall Lewis (1806\u20131863) gained far greater prominence, serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and Secretary of State for War in the administrations of Lord Palmerston. Occasionally suggested as an alternative to William Gladstone as Palmerston's political heir, his career was cut short by his early death at the age of 56.\nIn 1910, the Harpton Court estate passed by inheritance to Cosmo Duff-Gordon, who two years later, together with his wife, Lucy, survived the sinking of the Titanic. The Duff-Gordons continued in residence until the death of Sir Henry William Duff-Gordon in 1953. The house was then sold, and the main block demolished shortly afterwards. In 2013 the remaining wing of the house was marketed for sale.\nArchitecture and description\nThe main block of the court was designed in the mid-18th century, and redeveloped by John Nash in the early 19th century. Considered one of Powys' finest neoclassical buildings, it was demolished in 1956. The remaining wing of Harpton Court is a Grade II listed building. The elaborate gates, and attached lodge, which originally flanked the main drive to the house down an avenue of lime trees, are also listed at Grade II, as are the stable block and former granary. The gardens, including a largely intact walled kitchen garden are listed at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. The gardens contained specimens of Heracleum mantegazzianum (Giant Hogweed), reputedly introduced by Gertrude Jekyll, a friend of the Lewis family, but these have been removed in the 21st century.\nGallery\nLodge at the head of the main drive circa. 1910\nThe lodge in 2012\nThe lime avenue\nMonument to George Cornewall Lewis at New Radnor\nNotes\n^ The Lewis family archive, with records dating from 1541 to 1910, is held at the National Library of Wales.\n^ George Cornewall Lewis is commemorated by a \"striking monument\" in New Radnor. Designed by John Gibbs, architect of the Banbury Cross, and with sculpture by William Forsyth, it has a Grade II* listing.\n",
    "Extinct genus of skunk\nMartinogale is an extinct genus of skunk from the Late Miocene of central North America. There exist three accepted species, M. alveodens, M.chisoensis and M. faulli, which may have overlapped in range but occupied somewhat distinct moments of the Late Miocene.As well as the dubious Martinogale? nambiana.\nDescription and species\nMartinogale, as happens with most fossil skunks, has been solely described off of fragmentary craneal remains. The genus is mainly characterized by its jaws: in the upper jaw there's an absent upper Molar, and greatly enlarged but thin upper Premolar and Molar; while the lower jaw has a small and forward P, the absence of a lingual or labial cingulum around the P and a well developed  M; neither jaw has a present Premolar. In regards to skull morphology, it is smoother and narrower than in living skunks, with a large, flask-shaped basicranial bulla.\nMartinogale alveodens\nThis species was described in 1930 as a small mustelid from a fragmentary lower jaw found in the Edson Quarry, from late Hemphillian Kansas. It was described as the type of the new genus. Due to its fragmentary nature, the placement of Martinogale within Mustelidae was uncertain, but seemed feasible due to some similarities to the earlier Martes nambianus. In 1938, a better preserved jaw indicated similarities with the spotted skunks of Mephitidae. The species name, alveodens, hails from Latin alveus, \u201ca hollow, cavity or channel\" and dens, \"tooth\"\nMartinogale chisoensis\nThe largest species, M. chisoensis hails from the early Hemphillian Crew Bean Local, it was described in 2003 based on a rather complete skull. Due to the cranial similarities with Buisnictis it was named \"Buisnictis\" chisoensis. In 2005, along with the description of M. faulli, it was reassigned to Martinogale. The species name, chisoensis, comes from Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park, Texas, and ensis, Latin for \u201cfrom\u201d.\nMartinogale faulli\nThe oldest and smallest of the species, M. faulli was described in 2005 from a partial skull found in the Late Clarendonian Dove Spring Formation, from Kern County, California. M. faulli has a smoother skull than M. chisoensis and relatively smaller teeth, with a better defined basicranial bulla. The species name faulli is in honor of Mark Faull, a former ranger at Red Rock Canyon State Park.\nMartinogale? nambiana\nIn 1874, a P, Pand an incredibly fragmentary Mwere discovered in the Santa F\u00e9 Marls, New Mexico. Cope originally identified it as Martes nambianus, uncertain of this association, a year later Cope moved it to Mustela nambiana. When Hall erected Martinogale, he moved M. nambiana into his new genus, where it has since remained. In 2005, Wang et. al. argued that the few characteristics present in these teeth were too non-specific, arguing that they simply represent the basal mustelid condition and that M? nambiana should not be considered a part of Martinogale; that the specimen can't be ascribed to a concrete genus.\nPhylogeny\nWhen compared to modern genera, both extant: Spilogale, Mephitis and Conepatus, as well as extinct: Brachyprotoma and Osmotherium, Martinogale presents reasonable differences in the premolar structure, thin postorbital skull, slightly expanded mastoid process and the general structure of the  basicranial bulla. In 2005 Wang et al.'s phylogenetic analysis recovered Martinogale as a somewhat paraphyletic association, although as their chronology advances so does their derivation:\n",

    "\nTinka's Boy (1989\u20132022) was a chestnut Dutch Warmblood stallion who competed in show jumping, largely ridden by Swiss equestrian Markus Fuchs. Over an eight-year show career, Tinka's Boy won 26 international Grand Prix events and over 2 million Swiss Francs in prize money. He stood just under 16hh (162cm high at the withers).\nBackground\nTinka's Boy started his career with British rider Nick Skelton. After winning the 1997 FEI Jumping Nations Cup in Gijon, Tinka's Boy was sold to Isolde Liebherr to be ridden by Markus Fuchs of Switzerland.\nIn 2000, Fuchs and Tinka's Boy were part of the Swiss showjumping team to take silver medals in the team showjumping competition at the Sydney Olympic Games. The next year, the pair won the 2001 FEI Jumping World Cup Final, displacing reigning champion Rodrigo Pessoa. That same year, Fuchs and Tinka's Boy jumped a clear round at the Aachen Nations Cup Show in Germany, which helped the Swiss team top the leaderboard at the event.\nIn 2004, Fuchs and Tinka's Boy were selected for the Athens Olympics, and were part of the Swiss team that finished fifth in the showjumping event. Fuchs and Tinka's Boy placed 46th individually, despite being favorites going into the competition. Tinka's Boy made an impression on the Sydney crowds by making an unscheduled stop to defecate before his round. It was usual behavior for the horse prior to a jumping round. Fuchs later said, \"He's always doing this to me...I've asked him a few times but he hasn't given me an answer yet.\"\nIn December 2004, Tinka's Boy suffered an injury while taking part in the jump off at a grand prix event in La Coru\u00f1a, Spain. It was found later that the horse tore his left front superficial flexor tendon and underwent rehabilitation. After treatment, it was decided he would not be able to return to international competition. \nAt the 2006 Gothenburg Horse Show, Tinka's Boy was formally retired in a ceremony where he was unsaddled to a standing ovation from the audience. Upon retirement, Tinka's Boy became a full-time breeding stallion. As a stallion, he was an approved sire by the KWPN (Dutch Warmblood) and by the French Studbook for Selle Francais. Tinka's Boy has over 500 registered descendants. One of his daughters, Tinka's Serenade was ridden by Ireland's Billy Twomey in the 2012 Olympic games.\nTinka's Boy died at age 33 in January 2022 at the B\u00e9ligneux Le Haras stallion station in France.\nPedigree\n",
    "Major General of the Albanian Army\nNexhip Vin\u00e7ani (born 10 August 1916 in Vin\u00e7an, near Kor\u00e7\u00eb, died 6 March 1997 in Tirana) was a Major General and Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Albanian Army, and a victim of communist repression.\nBiography\nHe was the son of Kahreman Vin\u00e7ani. After completing primary school in his hometown, he studied at the French high school in Kor\u00e7\u00eb, the gymnasium in Shkodra, and then at the Royal Military School in Tirana. The Italian invasion of Albania found Vin\u00e7ani in Rome, where he was studying law at the local university. In 1941, he interrupted his studies and returned to Albania to join one of the resistance movement units. In 1942, he organized partisan units in the Kor\u00e7\u00eb district together with his brothers. In 1943, he became the commander of the Kor\u00e7\u00eb District in the National Liberation Army. After the reorganization of partisan units in August 1943, he became the commander of the 4th Assault Brigade. In late 1943 and early 1944, faced with the threat of the brigade's liquidation, Vin\u00e7ani, with the consent of the command, moved his units to the Skrapar region. He fought in the eastern part of the country, was wounded in the Battle of Pogradec, and from September 1944 participated in the Battle of Tirana.\nAfter the communists came to power, Vin\u00e7ani was promoted to the rank of Major General and commanded a division stationed in Peshkopi. Soon after, he was sent to study at the Woroshylov General Staff Academy in Moscow. Upon his return, he became the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, and in 1956, he assumed the position of Coastal Defense Commander. In 1958, he was arrested and demoted, then forced to work on draining marshes near Fier. In 1982, he was declared an enemy of the people, sentenced to a year in prison, and later interned near Gramsh. After the fall of communism, he was active in veteran organizations and was the initiator of the United Organization of Veterans of the National Liberation Army. He died in Tirana.\nHe was married to Mamika. Posthumously awarded the Order of Nderi i Kombit (Honor of the Nation). A street in Kor\u00e7\u00eb bears Vin\u00e7ani's name.\n",
    "German literary circle in the 1850s\nAn 1859 caricature by Johann Richard Seel\u00a0 that depicts Siebel (top-left), Rittershaus and Carl Michels.\nThe Wuppertal poets' circle (German: Wuppertaler Dichterkreis or Wupperbund) was a literary circle that existed during the 1850s, remaining active into the 1870s and 1880s. The core of the loosely-knit group consisted of seven poets born in or around Wuppertal, Germany: the merchants Reinhart Neuhaus\u00a0, Emil Rittershaus, Friedrich Roeber, Adolf Schults, Wilhelm Wens, Carl Siebel, Karl Stelter, and the bookseller Hugo Oelbermann. The circle \"opposed gloomy Wuppertal Pietism with a free and joyful view of existence.\"\nHistory\nThe founders of the Wuppertal poets largely came from affluent merchant families. The forerunners to the circle included Biedermeier reading clubs, theatres and other societies in the 1830s and 1840s\u2014directly, however, the association had its origins in an earlier reading circle and amateur theatre existing in the late 1840s, composed of Hugo Oelbermann, Emil Ritterhaus, Wilhelm Wens and later Carl Siebel.\nThis culminated in the founding of the circle in 1850, initially called the Wupperbund (lit.\u2009'Wuppertal federation'), by Oelbermann, Rittershaus, Wens and Siebel. Aiming to give the circle credibility, they recruited figures already known in Wuppertal such as Adolf Schults and Friedrich Roeber, as well as lawyers, conductors and organists.\nThe members of the circle met at the coffeehouse of \"Knevels\" in the Old Market\u00a0 (Altenmarkt) in Barmen, Wuppertal.\nThe circle partially dissolved in 1853, after the departure of Oelbermann from Barmen, and was replaced by a Sunday circle (Sonntagskr\u00e4nzchen) at the house of Roeber, consisting of poetry recitations and drama readings. This successor itself dissolved in the early 1860s.\nAuthor Jost Hermand in 1998 summarised the circle as follows:\nIn their works is manifested the ideological dilemma of young merchants and factory owners' sons, who, despite their relentless desire for competition and their ruthless exploitation of the workers who laboured for them, continued to try to surround themselves with the early bourgeois-liberal appearance of education, even of poetic genius.\nThe term Wuppertaler Dichterkreis used to describe the group was coined by poet Wolfgang M\u00fcller von K\u00f6nigswinter in 1863.\nFriedrich Engels knew multiple members of the circle, keeping in contact with them during his residence in Bremen in 1838\u20131841, as some were fellow pupils of his at the Elberfeld high school. This is also evidenced by his association and correspondence with Siebel and Rittershaus.\nNotable members\nCarl Siebel\nKarl Stelter\nHugo Oelbermann\nFriedrich Roeber\nEmil Rittershaus\nWilhelm Wens\nAdolf Schults\nReinhart Neuhaus\nJan Albert van Eijken\nCarl Reinecke\nJohann Richard Seel\nHeinrich Koester\nThe 1970s Wupperbund\nIn the early 1970s, a literature workshop was established at the Wuppertal Adult Education Center, which was compared to the Wuppertal circle in the regional press.

The season started on 20 August 1995 and ended on 14 July 1996, being the first one played under the European format (from the Northern Hemisphere's fall to spring) following the format change approved in 1994. Deportivo Cali were the champions, winning their sixth domestic league title and first in 22 years with a scoreless draw against crosstown rivals Am\u00e9rica de Cali on the final day of the season.\nJunior were the defending champions, but their title defense was ended at the semi-finals after placing last in their group.\nFormat\nThe season was split into four stages: the Apertura and Finalizaci\u00f3n tournaments, the final stage, and the Liguilla Pre-CONMEBOL:\nIn the Apertura tournament, played from August to December 1995, the 16 teams were divided into two groups of eight teams each with regional derby rivals being allocated into different groups. Teams played each other in a double round-robin fashion, followed by two rounds of regional derbies and two more extra rounds between the teams occupying the same position in each group. The top four teams at the end of the tournament were awarded bonus points, with the first one receiving 1.50 points, the second 1.00, the third 0.75, and the fourth getting 0.50 points.\nIn the Finalizaci\u00f3n tournament, played from January to June 1996, the participating teams played each other twice in another double round-robin tournament for a total of 30 rounds. The top four teams were again awarded bonus points under the same allocation used for the Apertura, whilst the team topping the season's aggregate table (Reclasificaci\u00f3n) was awarded an additional 1.00 bonus.\nFor the final stage, teams were divided according to their placements in the aggregate table: the top eight teams advanced to the semi-finals, for which they were divided into two groups of four where they played every of their group rivals twice. Teams would start at zero points, except for the ones that got bonus points earlier in the season, who carried over those points to this stage. The top two teams in each group advanced to the final group, with the team that topped this group being crowned as league champion and qualifying for the 1997 Copa Libertadores along with the runner-up, whilst the team placing third would qualify for the 1996 Copa CONMEBOL and the fourth would advance to the Copa CONMEBOL play-off against the Liguilla Pre-CONMEBOL winner.\nThe eight teams that failed to advance to the final stage played the Liguilla Pre-CONMEBOL, which was also divided into two stages and played under the same format as the final stage. The team that topped the Liguilla's final group would play the final group's fourth-placed team for the league's last Copa CONMEBOL berth.\nTeams\n16 teams competed in the season, the top 15 teams of the 1995 season and the 1995 Primera B champions Atl\u00e9tico Bucaramanga, who replaced the previous season's relegated team C\u00facuta Deportivo.\nAtl\u00e9tico BucaramangaAtl\u00e9tico HuilaAtl\u00e9tico NacionalBogot\u00e1CaliCortulu\u00e1Deportes Quind\u00edoDeportes TolimaDeportivo PereiraEnvigadoIndependiente Medell\u00ednJuniorOnce CaldasUni\u00f3n MagdalenaBogot\u00e1 teams:MillonariosSanta FeCali teams:Am\u00e9rica de CaliDeportivo Caliclass=notpageimage| Locations of the 1995\u201396 Categor\u00eda Primera A teams\nTorneo Apertura\nThe Torneo Apertura (also known as Copa Mustang I) began on 20 August and ended on 17 December 1995.\nGroup A\nSource: RSSSFRules for classification: 1) Points, 2) Wins, 3) Goal difference, 4) Goals for, 5) Away goals for, 6) Goals against, 7) Away goals against, 8) Drawing of lots.\nGroup B\nSource: RSSSFRules for classification: 1) Points, 2) Wins, 3) Goal difference, 4) Goals for, 5) Away goals for, 6) Goals against, 7) Away goals against, 8) Drawing of lots.\nTorneo Finalizaci\u00f3n\nThe Torneo Finalizaci\u00f3n (also known as Copa Mustang II) began on 14 January and ended on 13 May 1996.\nStandings\nSource: RSSSFRules for classification: 1) Points, 2) Wins, 3) Goal difference, 4) Goals for, 5) Away goals for, 6) Goals against, 7) Away goals against, 8) Drawing of lots.Notes:\n^ Santa Fe were deducted two points.\nAggregate table\nAn aggregate table known as Reclasificaci\u00f3n including the games of both tournaments (Apertura and Finalizaci\u00f3n) was used to determine the teams that would advance to the Copa Mustang final stages, as well as the teams that would play the Liguilla Pre-CONMEBOL.\nSource: RSSSFRules for classification: 1) Points, 2) Wins, 3) Goal difference, 4) Goals for, 5) Away goals for, 6) Goals against, 7) Away goals against, 8) Drawing of lots.(R) RelegatedNotes:\n^ Since Atl\u00e9tico Nacional and Am\u00e9rica de Cali, who placed third and fourth in the final group, were ineligible to qualify for the 1996 Copa CONMEBOL, the berth was awarded to the aggregate table's fourth-placed team, Deportes Tolima.\n^ San",
    "The military criminal code instituted under the military dictatorship in Brazil in the 1960s created military courts to try certain crimes committed by military personnel, in particular crimes against humanity committed under orders of the Brazilian executive. Critics say that cases transferred to these courts often languish, and note that nobody has ever suffered a penalty for any of the killings and disappearances of that period.\nGiven the prevalence of military police in state-level law enforcement, human rights agencies have expressed concern that police impunity is in part responsible for jaw-dropping numbers of police homicides. Brazilian police killed more than\u202f6,400\u202fpeople in 2022, according to Human Rights Watch.\nHistory\nMilitary criminal law in Brazil dates back to the Empire of Brazil. The Brazilian imperial family organized the nation's first court, the Supreme Military and Justice Council, which later became the Superior Military Court (STM), currently headquartered in Bras\u00edlia with jurisdiction nationwide. The current Military Penal Code (CPM) passed in 1969 under the military dictatorship that took power in the 1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat, covers members of the armed forces, military police and military fire brigades, who must obey and respect military rules. The current Constitution of Brazil dates from 1988. \nThe Lei de Anistia of 28 August 1979 gave amnesty to everyone accused of committing political crimes during the dictatorship period, both political dissidents and military personnel, and in many respects amounted to \"a form of self-amnesty for those involved in the repressive actions that took place during the dictatorship.\" No member of the military has been held responsible for crimes committed under the military dictatorship.\n\"Brazilian security forces have been repeatedly accused of systematic violations of human rights and of the existence of a system which guarantees the impunity of these violations. The Commission believes that there is indeed a history of abusive practices by the police...\" wrote the inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States in 1997.\nScope\nMilitary police in Brazil carry out routine law enforcement duties at the state level and are responsible for keeping public order. Recent law-and-order crackdowns in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, carried out by the military police, have resulted in many police killings of young men in these neighborhoods. \"The existence in Brazil of two different court systems\u2014one civil and the other military\u2014with varying legal proceedings and sentences for similar crimes committed by civilian police and military police\", wrote Jorge Zaverucha in 2022, constituted a \"violation of the basic principle of equality before the law.\"\nLaw No. 13.491/17 adopted in 2017 by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies modified Article 9 of the Military Criminal Code and expanded the jurisdiction of military courts to investigate actions ordered by the\nPresident of the Republic or the Ministry of State for Defence, and with respect to the security of military institutions. \nHuman rights\nThe National Truth Commission named 377 state agents of whom almost 200 of them were still alive, in hundreds of cases of torture, killings, and enforced disappearance under the military dictatorship. President Jair Bolsonaro opposed the creation of the commission when he was a congressman and called the late torturer Carlos Brilhante Ustra a \u201chero.\u201d\nBrazil signed the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and passed legislation in consequence, Decree 8767 of May 11, 2016.\nMilitary personnel do not have the right to strike, due to the fact that they carry weapons and a work stoppage could harm public order and the democratic rule of law, so technically this amounts to mutiny. according to article 142, item IV of the Constitution of Brazil and article 149 of the Brazilian Military Penal Code. While theoretically the military police are responsible to the governor of each states, illegal labor strikes have been used by the military police against a governor, usually resulting in more crime.\nThe Brazilian military code imposes harsh penalties on members of the military who speak out, according to Human Rights Watch.\nOther\nOn 23 August 2019 Bolsonaro signed Decreto No. 9,985, de 24 de Agosto de 2019 authorizing the use of the military to fight fires in the Amazon.\nNew scholars have dedicated themselves to military criminal law, among them, Jorge C\u00e9sar de Assis, Adriano Alves-Marreiros, Guilherme Rocha, Ricardo Freitas, Ronaldo Jo\u00e3o Roth, Paulo Tadeu Rodrigues Rosa, Robson Coimbra, Lauro Escobar, James Magalh\u00e3es and Leandro Antunes, who have contributed to the construction of a theory of constitutional military criminal law.\nSee also\nConstitution of Brazil\n",
    "Short story by Liu Cixin\n\"The Village Teacher\" (Chinese: \u4e61\u6751\u6559\u5e08 / \u9109\u6751\u6559\u5e2b, Pinyin: xi\u0101ngc\u016bn ji\u00e0osh\u012b) is a science-fiction short story by Chinese writer Liu Cixin. It was published in Science Fiction World in Chengdu in January 2001, was later included in the best Chinese Science Fiction short stories from 2001 and also in the collection To Hold Up the Sky in October 2020. It won the Reader's Nomination Award for best short story for the Galaxy Award.\nPlot\nA teacher in a desolate mountain village in rural China gives lessons to his children every day. Traveling into the city to gain fame or fortune has never sparked his interest. Because of a disease the village teacher does not have much time left to live. Near the galactic center, an interstellar war waging for fifty thousand years between carbon and silicon based lifeforms nears its end. The former intend to form a protective wall in the Perseus arm, which would result in the destruction of a hundred million stars. As intelligent civilizations shall be spared, spaceships are dispatched to search through all of the systems. As the village teacher recites all of the most important lessons for his class in his last moment, one of these searcher spaceships reaches Earth. After his death, the spaceship choses the class for the intelligence test and asks for copies of their brains. Ultimately, humanity is classified as intelligent and escapes destruction. After a more careful examination, the aliens are surprised by the idea that teachers distribute knowledge, which is unknown to them and causes them to view humanity as a very special species.\nAdaptation\nThe short story inspired the movie Crazy Alien (Chinese: \u75af\u72c2\u7684\u5916\u661f\u4eba / \u760b\u72c2\u7684\u5916\u661f\u4eba, Pinyin: f\u0113ngku\u00e1ng de w\u00e0i x\u012bng r\u00e9n) by director Ning Hao, shot from 26 July 2017 to 9 December 2017 in Qingdao in Shandong Province and released in Mainland China on 5 February 2019.\nReception\nPaul Di Filippo, writing in the Locus Magazine, states that the short story is a \"perfect fulfillment\" of the stated intention of To Hold Up the Sky to \"imagine the relationship between small people and the great universe\". The life of the village teacher is \"truly despairing and pathos-inducing\" and \"his dedication and drive and small achievements seem doomed to dissipate uselessly with his death\", but when \"the teacher\u2019s sacrifices pay off\" it happens \"suddenly\" and \"unpredictably\". In conclusion, the short story is \"Simakian in its deep moral simplicity and emotional impact.\"\nRachel Cordasco, writing for World Literature Today, calls \"The Village Teacher\" and \"The Thinker\", which appeared as first and last short story in Hold Up the Sky, the \"two most successful stories in this collection\" as they \"serve as perfect bookends.\"\nNicole Beck, writing in Strange Horizons, says that the \"descriptions are packed with sensitive details, evoking daily life in poor, rural China\" and that \"once again the reader is made to feel the contrast of scale: a few human lives against a universe full of creatures so advanced they use stars as weapons.\" The \" entire portrayal\" of the main character \"is more nuanced than expected\", and \"even though there is a general lack of complexity in the psychology of this collection\u2019s characters, it's not necessarily something that detracts from the whole experience.\"\n",
    "Government chartered private colony\nAguairenda was the site of a colony of American families founded by William H. Murray in the Tarija Department of Bolivia. Murray selected the location after deciding to try and found a colony in the Gran Chaco. The colony was sanctioned by the Bolivian government between 1923 and 1928, when the colony's charter was revoked and Murray returned to Oklahoma.\nHistory\nAguairenda was the site of a Catholic mission in Bolivia selected by William H. Murray as the location of his Bolivian colony. Murray negotiated with Bautista Saavedra's government for a colony in Bolivia, this time in the Tarija Department twelve miles north of Yacuiba. He received 42,000 acres under a 99-year lease for $1,800. He agreed to settle 25 families by December 31, 1925, and the colony had its export taxes waived. While Saavedra supported the colony, Flores Adolfo from the Tarija Department argued against the colony being built on traditional Indian lands in his district. Proponents of the colony advocated it as a buffer between Paraguay and was approved by the Bolivian Congress in 1923.\nColonists were required to follow the laws of Bolivia and a code of laws personally written by Murray. Amongst Murray's laws were a ban on brothels and saloons, a requirement to build a poultry shed within two years, a law that Murray owned all agriculture equipment, and a requirement he must personally approve all land transfers. Any change to the laws required a majority vote and Murray's consent. He barred colonists who were members of labor unions, socialists, Republicans, or born outside the United States. 41 families signed up with 15 leaving on May 4, 1924. About 80 colonists boarded the Oroya in New Orleans before sailing through Havana, the Panama Canal, to Antofagasta, Chile. The caravan then traveled by rail to Tartagal and then on foot to the Tarija Department through the Andes Mountains. The group arrived at Aguairenda, the colony site, on June 18, 1924.\nThe colonists immediately discovered much of the best land in the area was already leased by local Indigenous people. Colonists, mostly living in the school run by the local Catholic mission, were dissatisfied with the colony's poor living conditions. Most colonists left by the end of 1924 and Murray returned home in June 1925 to recruit more colonists. Later that year he shifted to trying to recruit Indians from their village at El Palmer. With the shift in strategy, the colony grew to nearly 400 and ran Bolivia's first cotton gin. Conflict in the Bolivian Legislature led President Hernando Siles to demand he create a profitable cotton colony or relinquish his concession. His lease was cancelled on August 6, 1928, and Murray transitioned to raising cattle before finally leaving Aquairenda on July 24, 1929.\nNotable residents\nWilliam H. Murray\nJohnston Murray\n",
    "Historic building in North Yorkshire, England\nThe building, in 2012\nNutwith Cote is a historic building in Burton-on-Yore, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThere was already a farm on the site in the 12th century, when Fountains Abbey acquired it from Richard de Hedune.  It served as a monastic grange until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, when it was given to Richard Gresham.  In 1582, his descendant, William Gresham, sold the farm to Christopher Beckwith, and it remained in the Beckwith family for many generations.\nThe stables, in 2006\nThe oldest parts of the present house are the rear wings, dating from the early 17th century.  The main front was added in the late 18th century.  A grand stable was constructed in the early 18th century, and the farm became a noted centre for racehorse breeding, with the horse Bartlett's Childers being stabled there.  Of similar date is a coach house, which incorporates 16th-century beehives.  Further south are a mid-18th century barn and dovecote.  The house, stables, coach house and barn are all Grade II* listed, while the dovecote is grade II listed.\nRear view of the house, showing the 17th century wing\nThe farmhouse is built of stone, with a moulded cornice, a coped parapet, and a stone slate roof with stone coping and shaped kneelers.  The main range dates from the 18th century, and has two storeys and a cellar, and four bays.  The central doorway has an architrave, a pulvinated frieze and a pediment, and above it is a sundial.  The windows on the front are sashes with plain surrounds and moulded sills.  To the right and lower is the 17th-century wing, which contains two windows, one with a chamfered surround and above one with a moulded architrave.\nThe coach house, in 2006\nThe stables are also built of stone, and have chamfered quoins and a corrugated asbestos roof.  There are two storeys and seven bays.  On the front are three doorways with chamfered quoined surrounds and tripartite keystones.  The windows are casements with projecting plain stone surrounds and tripartite keystones.\nThe coach house, is similarly built of stone, with quoins, an eaves band, and a stone roof with stone coping.  It is a small building, with a single storey and a single bay.  It contains an arched entrance with rusticated voussoirs and a keystone.  Above, in the gable, is an arched opening with a keystone.  To the right is a range of six 16th-century arched bee hives with moulded surrounds and semicircular apses.\nThe dovecote, in 2012\nThe stone barn has a stone slate roof with moulded kneelers and stone coping.  There is a single storey and three bays.  In the centre is an arched wagon entrance with moulded imposts, voussoirs and a keystone.  This is flanked by two giant Doric pilasters on plinths, carrying an entablature with a band, a frieze and a moulded cornice.  In each outer bay is a doorway with a square opening above.\nThe stone dovecote is now a ruin.  It has quoins and a coved cornice.  It contains a doorway with a lintel, and above it is a partially ruined oval window.\nSee also\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Burton-on-Yore\n",
    "Legislative by-elections were held in Vanuatu on 12 December 1988 and 28 November 1989 to fill twenty-three vacant seats, including twenty-two made vacant by a political crisis.\nBackground\nThe legislative elections of November 1987 were won by the ruling Vanua'aku Pati, which took 26 of the 46 seats in the Parliament of Vanuatu. Walter Lini, Prime Minister of Vanuatu since the country's independence in 1980, remains head of government. The Union of Moderate Parties, led by Vincent Boulekone, won the other 20 seats and remained the parliamentary opposition. Maxime Carlot replaced Vincent Boulekone as leader of the UPM and therefore as leader of the opposition shortly after.\nIn 1988, five deputies led by Barak Sop\u00e9 left Vanua'aku Pati and created the Melanesian Progressive Party. TheseThe five were subsequently expelled from Parliament on 24 July 1988 by the Speakers Onneyn Tahi, at the request of the Lini government, invoking a 1983 law that automatically vacates the seats of MPs who change political party during the parliamentary term. Barak Sop\u00e9 as well as Maxime Carlot then described Walter Lini as a \u201cdictator\u201d, and 18 of the 20 UPM deputies started boycotting Parliament. On 27 July, after being absent from Parliament for three consecutive days, the 18 deputies were also expelled by Tahi, who considered that they had resigned their seats. In September the Supreme Court confirmed the legality of the dismissal of the 23 MPs, opening the way to the holding of by-elections. The only two UPM deputies who are not expelled were Vincent Boulekone and Gaetano Bulewak, who refused the UPM's boycott strategy. They were subsequently excluded from the UMP and founded the Tan Union.\nResults\nThe by-elections for the eighteen seats made vacant by the expulsion of deputies from the Union of Moderate Parties are being held on 12 December 1988, the expulsion of the five dissident Vanua'aku Pati MPs having been suspended by court decision. The UPM and the Melanesian Progressive Party (PPM) are boycotting them. Only Vanua'aku Pati and Union tan present candidates. For nine of the seats, there is only one candidate. The participation rate in constituencies where there are candidates to decide is only around 40%, with opposition supporters following the boycott instructions.\nThe expulsion of Barak Sop\u00e9 and his four fellow deputies having finally been confirmed by the courts, partial elections for these five vacant seats are being held on 28 November 1989. Here too, only the Vanua'aku Pati and the Tan Union participated, these elections being boycotted by the UPM and the PPM.\n1988 elections\n1989 elections\nAftermath\nOn 16 December 1988, four days after the by-elections, the President Ati George Sokomanu declared Parliament dissolved and announced that early elections would be held in February 1989. The Lini government considered this dissolution to be unconstitutional and did not take it into account. On 18 December, President Sokomanu appoints an \u201cinterim government\u201d led by his nephew Barak Sop\u00e9. The same day, the Lini government ordered and obtained the arrest of Sokomanu, Sop\u00e9 and other members of this so-called government. On 19 December, the Supreme Court of Vanuatu declares the actions of President Sokomanu unconstitutional, as the Constitution of Vanuatu does not allow the President to dissolve Parliament on his own initiative, nor to appoint a government which does not have the confidence of Parliament.\nIn February 1989, the courts sentenced President Sokomanu to six years in prison for inciting mutiny and seditious conspiracy. Barak Sop\u00e9 and Maxime Carlot are each sentenced to five years in prison, and Willie Jimmy to three years in prison.\nIn September 1991, Prime Minister Lini is forced to resign following an internal rebellion within his party, and a motion of no confidence against him in Parliament. Donald Kalpokas, new leader of Vanua'aku Pati, becomes Prime Minister ahead of December elections.\n",
    "2007 short story by Greg Egan\n\"Dark Integers\" is a science-fiction short story by Australian writer Greg Egan, first published in Asimov's Science Fiction in October/November 2007. The short story was included in the collections Dark Integers and Other Stories in 2008, Oceanic in 2009 and The Best of Greg Egan in 2020. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 2008. It is a sequel to the short story \"Luminous\".\nPlot\nTen days after the far side of mathematics launched its counterattack, Bruno Costanzo and Alison Tierney make contact with the alien being responsible, which they call Sam. They begin to exchange insights about their sides and try to hold up the peace between them, but can only see each other as digital icons. Sam hints that other worlds and alien life are a lot more common on the far side, but hesitates to reveal as much as Bruno and Alison. Ten years later, Bruno learns about a new theory by Tim Campbell, which involves the connection of certain integers with their manifestation in the universe. He calls them dark integers in analogy to dark matter and dark energy as they are also invisible but with measurable effect. His calculations landed directly in the far side, so Bruno has to convince Sam that no attack took place and later bugs Campbell's computer to avoid a future incident. Campbell finds out and confronts Bruno, who then tells him about the far side, which had been kept secret by him, Alison and Yuen Fu-ting. Campbell begins to map out the nearest system on the far side, revealing that it's not mirroring the solar system and also moving relatively to it. Because of the quick attack ten years ago, an alien spaceship probably followed the Earth's position on the far side, hinting that the aliens knew about the other side way longer than them. While on a hike with his wife Kate, an attack from the far side begins. Planes and trains begin to crash, killing five thousand people in total. While Alison and Yuen Fu-ting launch a counterattack, Bruno speaks with Sam, who claims to not have started the attack. They devise a plan to separate a component of the far side and smooth out the border between the sides to render them immune to further attacks. Bruno returns to Kate and begins to tell her the story behind the attack, for which the public believes a computer virus to be responsible, and assures her, that although the story starts with Alison, it ends with her.\nTranslation\nThe short story was translated in Japanese (2009), French (2009) and Italian (2021).\nReception\nReviews\nKaren Burnham, writing in Strange Horizons about suspension of disbelief discussed with multiple of Egan's short stories, says that \"Luminous\" and \"Dark Integers\" \"aren't necessarily Egan's best stories\" as they \u201eboth rely heavily on their plots, with very little characterization\" and \"it's very hard to find a narrative toehold when the infodumping gets confusing\". But \"reading the introduction\" (of Dark Integers and Other Stories of which the essential part is included in the review) makes \"them easier to read\". She argues: \"Then I knew that my feeling of disjointedness wasn't because I was stupid, but because the stories' conceit really was completely without basis in any real-world science or genre convention.\"\nRich Horton, writing on the SF Site, claims the short story concerns \"not so much the idea, though that remains fascinatingly loopy, but the sad political reality that Egan derives from the underlying state of affairs.\"\nSalik Shah claims in the Reactor Magazine, that the short story (together with its prequel \"Luminous\") \"would make an exciting premise for radio or film adaptation.\"\nAwards\nThe short story was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 2008 and won the Japanese Seiun Award in 2010. It reached the 3rd place in the Reader Poll of the Locus Award in 2008 and won Asimov's Reader Poll.\nSee also\nDivision by Zero, short story by Ted Chiang about an inconsistency in arithmetics\n",
    "World War II attack\nThe Raid on Truskaw was a surprising attack on the battalion stationed in the village of Truskaw by the Kaminski Brigade, carried out on the night of 2/3 September 1944 by a detachment from the Kampinos Group led by Lieutenant Adolf Pilch, codenamed Dolina.\nOn 27 August 1944, the vicinity of Truskaw and Sierak\u00f3w was occupied by units of the collaborating Kaminski Brigade, thus preventing communication between Home Army units in the Kampinos Forest and the insurgent Warsaw. The enemy soon began to attack the Polish outpost in nearby Pociecha. In this situation, commanding the \"Palmiry-M\u0142ociny\" Regiment, Lieutenant Dolina organized a night raid on the Kaminski troops stationed in Truskaw. With minimal losses of their own, the Poles completely defeated two enemy subunits, capturing large quantities of weapons and ammunition in the process. This success \u2013 combined with a successful raid on Marian\u00f3w the following night \u2013 forced the Kaminski Brigade to retreat from the southern outskirts of the Kampinos Forest.\n\"Independent Republic of Kampinos\"\nOfficer corps of the Kampinos Group during a field mass in Wiersze. Visible in the photo are Major Oko\u0144 and Lieutenant Dolina\nSoldiers of the Kampinos Group setting out to relieve Warsaw on 19 August 1944\nAfter the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising, fighting also spread to the northwest of the capital, in the Kampinos Forest. At that time, the structures of the Home Army from the pre-war gminas of Czosn\u00f3w and M\u0142ociny, as well as from the eastern part of the Gmina Zabor\u00f3w, were part of the VIII District \u0141\u0119gi of the Warsaw County Subdistrict of the Warsaw District. This district was commanded by Captain J\u00f3zef Krzyczkowski, codenamed Szymon. On the eve of the uprising, the Home Army units under his command could deploy two infantry battalions with the strength of five first-line companies. However, the weakness of these units lay in their armament. Captain Szymon estimated in his post-war memoirs that after the mobilization in July 1944, his district could muster only from 350 to 400 armed soldiers for combat. Fortunately for the Polish side, the balance of power in the Kampinos Forest changed dramatically at the end of July 1944 when the Stowbtsy-Naliboki Group arrived in Dziekan\u00f3w Polski from the Naliboki forest in the Eastern Borderlands. It consisted of 861 well-armed soldiers, led by Lieutenant Adolf Pilch, codenamed G\u00f3ra or Dolina \u2013 a Silent Unseen paratrooper, an experienced partisan who had been fighting against the Germans and Soviet partisans since autumn 1943. Initially, the Polish Underground State received Dolina and his soldiers with great mistrust due to accusations of collaboration with the Germans. However, the Home Army High Command eventually agreed to incorporate the Naliboki group into the VIII District.\nOn 3 August 1944, based on the units of the VIII District and the Stowbtsy-Naliboki Group, the Palmiry-M\u0142ociny Regiment was formed, commanded by Lieutenant Dolina. After the outbreak of the uprising in the Kampinos Forest, small Home Army units from various districts of Warsaw also appeared, leaving the city after the failure of the initial Polish attacks during \"W\" Hour. Gradually, units from other regions and districts of the Warsaw District, as well as from the neighboring Western Sub-District of the Warsaw Area of the Home Army, also arrived there. Based on these units, a partisan formation called the Kampinos Group was created. At its peak, it numbered about 2,700 soldiers and 700 horses.\nThe actions of the Kampinos Group did not change the fate of the uprising. After unsuccessful attacks on the Bielany airport (from 1 to 2 August 1944), Polish units had to temporarily withdraw deeper into the Kampinos Forest. Meanwhile, the Home Army command, which had high hopes for the presence of a strong partisan group in the immediate vicinity of Warsaw, directed Major Alfons Kotowski, codenamed Oko\u0144, to the forest, instructing him to organize relief for the capital and then carry out vigorous offensive actions towards Pow\u0105zki. Oko\u0144 reached the Kampinos Group on the night of August 15/16. However, before this happened, there was chaos in the command of the forest units, which would profoundly affect the actions of the Polish group. Due to mutual disagreements and indecision among Home Army commanders, it was not possible to organize an attack on the rear of the German Battle Group Reinefarth. Ultimately, nearly 1,000 soldiers of the Kampinos Group crossed into \u017boliborz, where they were intended to be used to break through the German barrier separating this district from the Old Town. However, two night attacks on the heavily fortified Warszawa Gda\u0144ska Station ended in defeat and the loss of nearly 500 soldiers (August 20/21 and August 21/22). After the failed assaults, some of the \"forest\" soldiers returned with Major Oko\u0144 to the Kampinos Forest, while others remained in \u017boliborz. Along with the soldiers of the Kampinos Group, a certain numbe",
    "Irish presbyterian minister\nJohn McBride (1651? \u2013 21 July 1718) was an Irish minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster and religious controversialist.\nBiography\nMcBride was born in Ulster about 1651. He was probably the son of John McBryde, a merchant, who was admitted a free stapler of Belfast on 6 March 1644, and who signed the covenant at Holywood, County Down, on 8 April 1644. John entered the university of Glasgow in 1666, signing himself \u2018Johannes McBryd, Hybernus,\u2019 and graduated on 15 July 1673. In 1680 he received presbyterian ordination as minister of Clare, co. Armagh. He left Ireland during the troubles of 1688 and became minister of Borgue, Kirkcudbrightshire. In 1691 he received a call to Ayr, but the presbytery decided against his translation; he sat as a member of the general assembly in 1692. He was called to Belfast as successor to Patrick Adair and installed there on 3 October 1694. Soon after his settlement, he obtained a considerable plot of ground in Rosemary Lane, on which his congregation erected a new meeting-house, removing to it about 1695 from their old one in North Street. There being as yet no Irish toleration act, the congregation held this property on goodwill; no lease was granted till 1767. McBride exerted himself at Dublin in September 1695 to obtain a legal toleration; in his phrase, his efforts were \u2018drowned with court holy water.\u2019 He came out as an author in 1697, defending a plea for toleration by Joseph Boyse. In the same year, he was moderator of the general synod of Ulster. His sermon on retiring from the chair on 1 June 1698 was printed without his concurrence; the title-page styled him \u2018minister of Belfast;\u2019 on 10 October he appeared on summons before the lords justices in Dublin, at the instance of five bishops, to answer for this and other enormities. The lords justices dismissed the case, \u2018with an advice to him and his brethren to carry rectably towards the established church, and to them  to carry moderately.\u2019 The renewed patent for the \u2018regium donum\u2019 was lodged in his hands in 1699. A few years later he published (1702) a spirited defence of the validity of presbyterian marriages.\nMcBride was a strong advocate of the Hanoverian succession, but scrupled at the oath of abjuration (declaring the Pretender to be no son of James II) imposed in 1703. By the advice of the Belfast presbytery, he summoned the general synod to meet at Antrim on 1 June 1703, six weeks before the appointed time, in order to consider the oath, which was to be taken by 1 August. Several leading presbyterians were non-abjurors; McBride avoided the oath by retiring to Glasgow, where in 1704 he made a gift of books to the university library. (The oath was not imposed in Scotland till 1712.) On 19 October a committee of the Irish House of Commons recommended that he be deprived of \u2018regium donum;\u2019 but this was not done. He was back in Belfast before the synod of June 1704. In the winter of 1705, information was sworn against him as a non-abjuror before the Rev. John Winder, J.P., at Carnmoney, co. Antrim. He escaped in disguise and proceeded to Glasgow by way of Donaghadee. McBride was three years in Glasgow, exercising his ministry there, but retaining his charge in Belfast, and refusing a divinity chair at Glasgow University. On 4 June 1706 the synod gave order for the appointment of James Kirkpatrick as his assistant and successor. The whole available stipend was 160l. Irish, or 147l. 13s. 10\u00bcd. sterling. McBride wrote from Stranraer on 18 June to his Belfast flock, advising that as there were \u2018three thousand persons\u2019 in the congregation, there should be two meeting-houses as well as two ministers. Kirkpatrick was appointed on 24 September, and by June 1708 a second meeting-house was erected, in the rear of the first, and on the same plot of ground. The synod of 1708, after long debates at the ordinary and a special meeting, agreed to divide the congregation, assigning the first meeting-house, with the manse, to McBride, and sending him \u2018a kind affectionate letter,\u2019 inviting and requiring him \u2018to come home so soon as he can.\u2019 Samuel Smith, one of his elders, went to Glasgow for him. As moderator of the Glasgow presbytery he had signed in March an address to the queen, expressing abhorrence of the attempt of the French fleet upon the Scottish coast in the Pretender's interest. Returning to Ireland, he appeared before the justices at Carrickfergus, and was discharged without trial. In August 1711 a warrant was issued by Westenra Waring, high sheriff of county Antrim, and another justice for the arrest of McBride and other ministers as non-abjurors. At the spring assizes 1712, they were presented by the grand jury of county Antrim as disloyal men. McBride crossed over to Scotland at the beginning of May. According to William Bruce, Thomas Milling had been appointed his colleague in 1711; there is no trace of this name in the synod records. The general synod which met at Belfast in Jun",
    "\n1993 unsolved deaths in Russia\nOn 5 August 1993, six Kazakhstani hikers died in the Khamar-Daban mountain range under uncertain circumstances. The event has been likened to the Dyatlov Pass incident, earning it the name \"Buryatia's Dyatlov Pass\".\nThe six hikers who died were members of a seven-person hiking group led by Lyudmila Korovina; Valentina Utochenko was the group's sole survivor. Although the police receiving a report, no formal search was carried out until 24 August. It took two days for helicopters to locate the remains, because Utochenko had not yet been able to recount her version of what had happened. According to an autopsy report, all of the victims died of hypothermia, except Korovina, who died from a heart attack.\nBackground\nKhamar-Daban, a mountain range in Southern Siberia, in the Republic of Buryatia, Russia, was a popular tourist hiking spot. In the summer of 1993, Lyudmila Korovina of the Petropavl \"Azimut\" tourist club, an experienced hiking instructor and a Master of Sports in hiking, planned a hiking trip to the Khamar-Daban mountains. She was joined by six of her students: Aleksander \"Sacha\" Krysin, Tatyana Filipenko, Denis Shvachkin, Valentina \"Valya\" Utochenko, Viktoriya Zalesova and Timur Bapanov. Korovina had previous experience hiking in the Khamar-Daban area, and the students trained with her for the trip.\nThe trip\nThe group of seven hikers, led by Korovina, arrived in Irkutsk by train in August 1993. Korovina's hiking group was one of three in the area, one of which was being led by her daughter, Natalia. Starting on 2 August 1993, their trip led from the village of Murino\u00a0, along the Langutai river, through the Langutai Gates pass, along the Barun-Yunkatsuk river, up the Khanulu mountain and along its ridge, ending on the watershed plateau of the Anigta and Baiga rivers. Korovina's group was meant to cross paths with her daughter's on 5 August.\nThe first two days of the hike turned out to have went better than the group had planned, with them making good time up Retranslyator peak, however, on 4 August, as they were beginning their descent, they were hit with an unexpected rainstorm. Korovina decided to make camp in an exposed location, with the group failing at an attempt to build a fire that night. They managed to build a fire in the morning of 5 August and ate breakfast together before continuing their path.\nThe deaths\nAccording to Valentina Utochenko, the sole survivor, while descending down the mountain, at the altitude of 2,396 metres (7,861\u00a0ft), Krysin, who was at the back of the group, started screaming. He was bleeding from his eyes and ears, frothing at the mouth. He fell to the ground convulsing and then went still. Korovina ran up to him, trying to get him to gain consciousness. A moment later, she cried out, having the same symptoms as Krysin. She convulsed and then collapsed on top of Krysin. Filipenko, who had gotten to Korovina first, was the next to collapse, grabbing at her throat as though she couldn't breathe. She crawled over to a nearby rock and bashed her head against it until she went limp. Zalesova and Bapanov started to run. While running, they collapsed and died throwing up blood and clawing at their own throats, tearing their clothes off. Utochenko and Shvachkin hurried away, but shortly after Shvachkin also collapsed convulsing.\nUtochenko ran down the mountain, set up a tent for the night under tree cover and fell asleep. On the next day, she returned to the site of her friends' death to retrieve supplies she needed from their bodies. For four days, she followed power lines down the mountain in hopes that someone would find her. She found a river and started following it. On 9 August, she was found by a group of Ukrainian kayakers, who took her to the nearest police station where a report was filed.\nSearch and discovery\nUtochenko did not speak for several days. The official search was conducted on 24 August, led by Yuri Golius. Because Utochenko had not been able to recount her version of events yet, it took two days to find the bodies using helicopters. The hikers' bodies were noted to have been partially undressed.\nAll of the dead hikers were found to have signs of bruised lungs. An autopsy, carried out in Ulan-Ude, concluded that Krysin, Filipenko, Bapanov, Zalesova and Shvachkin died of hypothermia, and Korovina had a heart attack. Protein deficiency due to malnutrition was listed as a contributing factor to their deaths.\nTheories\nMultiple theories have been proposed to explain what caused the hikers' deaths. Rescuers Valery Tatarnikov and Vladimir Zinov, who took part in the search operation for the bodies, claimed that it was impossible for the hikers to die of cold. Zinov suggested that they might have died of altitude sickness. Tourist Vladimir Borzenkov and member of the search operation Nikolai Fedorov suggested that the hikers went mad due to infrasounds. Yuri Golius, the leader of the search operation, blamed their deaths on Korovi",
    "English author whose daughter was murdered in 1990\nLesley Moreland is an English author whose book published in 2001 detailed her experience following the murder of her daughter Ruth in 1990. Moreland is notable for her resolve to meet the man who killed her daughter and for her correspondence with an American man on Death Row in Texas.\nBiography\nMoreland's daughter Ruth was murdered in 1990 when she was 23 years of age. Moreland's book, An Ordinary Murder, tells the painful story of what happened to her and her family in the period following Ruth's murder. She reveals her struggle to find ways of continuing to live positively while accepting Ruth's death. An Ordinary Murder also provides an insight into the bureaucracies of the criminal justice system and Moreland's struggle to uncover the facts surrounding her daughter's death and her battle to meet with the man who murdered her daughter.\nThe book details Moreland's resolve and ultimate jailhouse meeting with her daughter's killer, Andrew Steel (not his real name) in 1995. Steel was a friend of Ruth's former boyfriend. He had a history of violence towards women, and had taken LSD before he stabbed Ruth to death, inflicting over 100 wounds. By meeting the man who murdered her daughter, Moreland sought to discover more about his life and background, believing that she could only find peace by having him answer questions about the circumstances surrounding the final moments of her daughter's life.\nFor 6 years, Moreland also regularly corresponded with Michael Richard, a Death Row inmate in Texas, who was convicted of an unrelated murder. Moreland was a committed Quaker, and her exchange with Richard, was influenced by her personal faith and conviction that there is humanity in everyone, even the most condemned criminal. This correspondence was part of a wider letter-writing network established by LifeLines of Cambridge, that connected Britons with death row inmates, as part of a program that was opposed to capital punishment in the United States. Moreland stated in an interview that \"Michael and I have slowly established a relationship that is deep and honest...I hope I would have been interested in writing to someone in his situation anyway, but after Ruth's death what I was trying to cling onto was the fact {that} human beings are very complex, and even if someone has taken a life, it's not the whole of them. There is that of God within all of us.\"\nA reviewer of An Ordinary Murder stated that \"The need to explore the potential value of restorative justice to the long-term health of the victims left behind could scarcely have been better illustrated.\"\nIn another book, Death, Dying and Bereavement, which includes a chapter by Moreland, the editors note that Lesley's \"thoughts and experience following the murder of her daughter provide insight into a particularly traumatic form of sudden death.\"\nAt the time of Ruth's death Moreland lived in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire with her husband Vic. They had one other daughter. Prior to writing An Ordinary Murder Moreland had a role as the Director of the Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society (SANDS) as well as working in the voluntary sector for over 30 years.\nBibliography\nMoreland, Lesley (2001).

    "Australian avant-pop band\nThe Sunday Painters were an Australian avant-pop band formed in Wollongong in 1979 by Peter MacKinnon on guitar and Peter Raengel on vocals, guitar, bass guitar and keyboards. In 1982 Dennis Kennedy joined on bass guitar but switched to lead guitar in 1984. The group issued two studio albums, Something to Do (1982) and Fourth Annual Report (1983), before disbanding in 1986. American label, What's Your Rupture?, compiled their early extended plays and a live album, which was issued as In My Dreams, in 2015. Peter Raengel died in September 2008.\nHistory\nThe Sunday Painters were an Australian avant-pop band formed in Wollongong in 1979 by Bruce Ellis on synthesisers (ex-Art Throbs), Peter MacKinnon on guitar, Katherine Lorenc on vocals, flute and keyboards and Peter Raengel on vocals, guitar, bass guitar and keyboards (ex-Winged Death, Art Throbs). Ellis and Raengel had performed in various groups since secondary school and formulated the Sunday Painters' direction as \"part-pop/rock garage band, part-classical experimentalists\", with a political focus on oppression, alienation, pain and identity seeking. One of their previous bands, Art Throbs, were recorded by Ellis at Sydney University. Both MacKinnon and Raengel had attended Wollongong High School. Raengel later recalled \"We weren't actually musicians before we started, we started off learning our instruments and writing songs.\"\nTwo extended plays with three\u00a0tracks each were issued during 1980, Alternatives to Perfection (April) and Painting by Numbers (1980). Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane found them \"strangely appealing\" as they demonstrated a garage rock and early Velvet Underground sound. Their third EP, Three Kinds of Escapism, followed in 1981. The group's debut studio album, Something to Do, was released in 1982. McFarlane determined that it \"displayed an extraordinary breadth of stylistic reference\", citing influences from United Kingdom band Wire for their track \"Emotion Sickness\" to 1970s krautrockers, Faust and Neu!, for \"ECT\". In 1982 Dennis Kennedy joined on bass guitar; by 1984 Ellis and Lorenc had left and Kennedy switched to lead guitar. Allan Coop joined on bass guitar and Eddie Zeidan on alto saxophone.\nFourth Annual Report is their second studio album, which was issued in late 1983. McFarlane observed that it varied \"from the abrasive ('God is My Biro', 'Concertina') and the eerie ('Surface Paradise') to soundscapes of the epic kind ('Through a Shattered Lens').\" MacKinnon left soon after the album appeared. Further changes occurred to the line-up with successive bass guitarists Kerrie Erwin and Tony Tziolas; as well as Chris Flanagan joining on drums. However, no new material was recorded and the group disbanded in 1986. Peter Raengel died in September 2008, aged 47. American label, What's Your Rupture?, compiled their early EPs and a live album, which was issued as In My Dreams, in 2015. To explain the group's lack of contemporaneous recognition, Illawarra Mercury's Glen Humphries described their material, \"a mix of full-on electronic noise, rock, discordant pop, classical, punk, jazz and whatever else they wanted to play - was probably too out there for Wollongong in the 1980s.\"\nMembers\nBruce Ellis\u00a0\u2013 synthesisers\nPeter MacKinnon\u00a0\u2013 guitar\nKatherine Lorenc\u00a0\u2013 vocals, flute, keyboards\nPeter Raengel\u00a0\u2013 vocals, guitar, bass guitar, keyboards (died 2008)\nDennis Kennedy\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar, guitar\nAllan Coop\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar\nEddie Zeidan\u00a0\u2013 alto saxophone\nKerrie Erwin\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar\nTony Tziolas\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar\nChris Flanagan\u00a0\u2013 drums\nSource:\nDiscography\nAlbums\nSomething to Do (1982)\u00a0\u2013 Terminal Records\nFourth Annual Report (1983)\u00a0\u2013 Terminal Records\nCompilation albums\nIn My Dreams (2015)\u00a0\u2013 What's Your Rupture?\nLive albums\nOn the Beach (1983)\nExtended plays\nLike a Reptile (1979)\nIn My Dreams (1980)\nAlternatives to Perfection (April 1980)\nPainting by Numbers (October 1980)\nThree Kinds of Escapism (1981)\n",

On 7 March 1964, he was announced as the new Spanish Ambassador to the United States in Washington, D.C. He presented his credentials to President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House in May 1964, and served there until 1970 when he became Ambassador to Japan. While Merry del Val was in Washington, he was \"one of the most socially sought after Ambassadors\" and the Spanish embassy was located at 2700 15th St. N.W.\nPeerage and honours\nUpon the death of his father in 1943, he succeeded as the 2nd Marqu\u00e9s de Merry del Val. For his diplomatic work, he was awarded numerous national and foreign decorations, including Medal of the Campaign, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic, Knight of the Order of Charles III, Grand Cross of Military Merit, Grand Cross of Naval Merit.\nPersonal life\nPhotograph of his first wife, Carmen de Gurtubay y Alzola, Marquesa de Yurreta y Gamboa\nIn 1931, Merry del Val married his second cousin, Mar\u00eda del Carmen de Gurtubay y Alzola, 2nd Marchioness of Yurreta y Gamboa (1910\u20131959), the only child of Juan Gurtubay y Gonz\u00e1lez de Castej\u00f3n and Blanca de Alzola, 1st Marquesa of Yurreta and Gamboa (after her father's death her mother married Don Jos\u00e9 de Bustos y Ruiz de Ara\u00f1a Bustos, Duke of Andr\u00eda).

As he had no surviving issue, his nephew, Rafael Merry del Val y Melgarejo, became the 3rd Marquess of Merry del Val.\n",
    "Moonstone variety\nFor other uses, see Moonstone (disambiguation).\nBelomorite (Russian: \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0301\u0442 \u2014 from the toponym), sometimes peristerite or moonstone, also murchisonite, Ceylon opal, hecatolite \u2014 a decorative variety of albite (oligoclase) of white or light gray color with a distinct iridescence effect. By composition, belomorite belongs to the feldspar family; it is a sodium aluminosilicate from the plagioclase group, in most cases belonging to the isomorphic series albite (Ab) \u2014 anorthite (An) with an approximate percentage of 70Ab-30An.\nThe name \u201cbelomorite\u201d was given to this variety of albite by academician Alexander Fersman in 1925, based on the location of its discovery near the shore of the White Sea, and also by association \u2014 for the similarity of iridescence colors with the shades of sea water. The best varieties of belomorite are translucent or transparent, they have a pearl-glass luster and iridescence in blue, gray-blue, violet-blue, greenish-blue or pale violet tones. The most famous deposits of this gem are in the north, in the pegmatites of the Kola Peninsula and Karelia.\nBelomorite is a spectacular and popular jewelry and ornamental material, one of the varieties of moonstone. However, due to its fragility and perfect cleavage, the mineral often breaks and is difficult to process, so it is cut in the form of simple cabochons (oval, round, teardrop-shaped), as well as balls or polished plates.\nHistory and name\nA decade and a half after the discovery of this variety of albite near the White Sea coast, Alexander Fersman described the history of his \u201cfind\u201d in sufficient detail and accurately in a short lyrical essay entitled \u201cBelomorite.\u201d Together with his companion, he got off the train at the Arctic Circle station\u00a0 in the Loukhsky District of the Republic of Karelia and they set off together towards the \u201cBlue Pale\u201d \u2014 that was the name of the mined-out vein of feldspars, located in the middle of a swampy area, between hills (in Karelian - varaks) almost on the very shore of the White Sea, about six kilometers east of the station.\nThere, in an old working, among dark amphibole shales, there was a snow-white vein of albite at least ten meters long, it rose to the top of the neighboring hill and went with lateral branches into the dark stone of shale rocks. Alexander Fersman sat down near a stack of feldspar, folded for transportation, looked at it carefully and, as he writes, could no longer look away, \u2014 in front of him was \u201ca white, barely bluish stone, barely translucent, barely transparent, but clean and even, like a well-ironed tablecloth.\u201d\nThe stone was split along individual shiny surfaces, and some mysterious light played on these edges. These were gentle bluish-green, barely noticeable iridescences, only occasionally they flashed with a reddish light, but usually a continuous mysterious moonlight flooded the entire stone, and this light came from somewhere from the depths of the stone \u2014 well, just like the Black Sea burns with blue light in autumn evenings near Sevastopol.\nThe delicate pattern of the stone from some thin stripes crossed it in several directions, as if imposing a mysterious lattice on the rays emanating from the depths. I collected, selected, admired and again turned the moonstone towards the sun.\n\u2014 Alexander Fersman, \u201cMemories of a Stone\u201d, 1940\nThe stone found in an old mine was called \u201cbelomorite\u201d \u2014 because, as Fersman explains, \u201cThe White Sea shimmered with the colors of moonstone... or did the stone reflect the pale blue depths of the White Sea?..\u201d \u2014 Geologists took several samples to the Peterhof lapidary factory\u00a0, recommending it as a new jewelry stone.\nMeanwhile, the authors of the \u201cnew mineral\u201d did not insist that they had made some kind of mineralogical discovery, noting that the decorative variety of stone received from them a new poetic name or even a trademark. On the one hand, Fersman directly writes that belomorite \u201cwas not born there, it was we who invented it there\u201d; and on the other hand, he calls this variety of feldspar \u201ctrue moonstone\u201d.\nIt must be remembered that the coast and, more broadly speaking, the environs of the White Sea are by no means the only place where Fersmanovsky belomorite, which belongs to the class of perhaps the most common rock-forming minerals on earth, reveals itself. Deposits of this type of plagioclase, most often associated with mica-bearing and ceramic pegmatites, are located in other places in North Karelia (the vicinity of Khetolambina\u00a0, Mica Bor), as well as in the south of the Kola Peninsula.:\u200a71\u200a\nAnother name for iridescent feldspar \u2014 peristerite \u2014 also comes from its geographical name (Peristeri \u2014 a mountain in western Greece). Other regional synonyms of belomorite are used even less frequently \u2014 murchisonite, Ceylon opal and jarisol, associated with the sites of finds. There are also names like hecatolite:\u200a94\u200a associated with the crystallographic orientation of the iridescence. All of them, one way or another, can b",
    "English composer and music critic (1917-1995)\nHugo Cole (6 July 1917 \u2013 2 March 1995) was an English composer, cellist, critic and author on musical subjects.\nEducation and early career\nCole was born in London, one of three children of a successful barrister, Arthur Frederick Andrew Cole (1883\u20131968), and his wife, Margaret Henrietta, born Gaselee (1882\u20131971). His sister Catherine later became famous as the children's writer Catherine Storr.\nCole was educated at Winchester School, where he first began playing the horn and the cello, then at King's College, Cambridge (reading natural sciences).  Cole was a conscientious objector, and his application to join the Friends' Ambulance Unit during the war was turned down because of his severe stammer - this affliction led to his later interest in the Alexander Technique of relaxation, and to music therapy.\nDuring the war he played as a cellist with the Halle Orchestra and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company before continuing his studies at the Royal College of Music in 1944: cello with Ivor James, harmony with R.O. Morris and composition with Herbert Howells. There was some further study in Paris over two summers with Nadia Boulanger.\nComposition\nBy the late 1940s Cole's interest had shifted from performing towards composing, including works for amateur performers. He produced operas (mostly for children or amateurs and often using his own libretto), choral, orchestral and chamber music. His first children's opera (of five), The Asses' Ears, was written in 1950 for Rokeby Preparatory School in Wimbledon. A Company of Fools, given its first performance at Queen's College Oxford in November 1955 under Bernard Rose, sets eight poems by James Kirkup, using chorus, a quartet of soloists and strings. Flax into Gold: The Story of Rumpelstiltskin (1957), is a children's opera with a libretto by Cole's sister, Catherine Storr.\nHis 1959 opera The Tunnel won the John Lewis Partnership prize for amateur productions, and was staged on 24 October 1960 and following nights in the Auditorium of the (then new) John Lewis shop in Oxford Street. Jonah (1967), with a libretto by the composer, is scored for speaker, baritone soloist, chorus and orchestra, and is described as \"an opera-cantata for stage or concert use\". Commissioned by the Downside Choral Society it was first performed at Westminster Cathedral Hall on 30 March 1963, conducted by Roger Bevan, and repeated in Somerset.\nBut according to his Times obituary, Cole's \"decidedly English\" compositional style was never in fashion, and he mostly gave up composing once he was appointed as a critic on The Guardian in 1965. There were a few late compositions, including another children's opera, The Fair Traders (1971). His final piece was Winter Meetings - Dialogues for chamber orchestra, completed in 1975 and performed by the Havant Symphony Orchestra on 8 November 1975.\nCritic and author\nCole wrote for The Guardian for more than 30 years (1965-95), working with Edward Greenfield and Gerald Larner. He was also a regular contributor to The Listener (1974-86), and wrote the  regular 'The Musical Scene' column in Country Life for \nover 20 years.   He also contributed to Grove's Dictionary of Music (including entries on Arthur Bliss, Francis Chagrin, Children's Opera, Wilfrid Josephs, Elizabeth Maconchy and Humphrey Searle).\nHe also wrote several books, including a concise guide to musical notation that tackles its modern evolution, such as the notation of electronic music and the development of computer notation as it was in 1974. His book on the music of his friend Malcolm Arnold (1989) is one of the earliest analytical studies of Arnold's music, previously not always considered \"serious\".\nPersonal life\nCole was an enthusiastic supporter of the Pianola Society, and a keen cyclist - often using his bicycle to travel to concerts. He married Gwyneth John Eedy - an artist and teacher of the Alexander Technique - in 1949, and there were two daughters. His address for over 40 years was 15 Hammersmith Terrace, London W6. He died, aged 77, after complications from lymphoma.

    "American actor\nLeo Thomas Cleary (June 15, 1894 \u2013 April 11, 1955) was an American character actor in radio and film, and a vaudeville comedian and singer, perhaps best known as Dizzy Dean's minor league manager in The Pride of St. Louis, as the Catholic priest in The Red Menace, and as the original Old Ranger on the radio series, Death Valley Days.\nEarly life and career\nBorn and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, Cleary was the only child of Benjamin Francis Cleary and Mary Clair Lyon. In 1909, the family relocated to Southern California, settling in Pasadena.\nNoted for his expert mimicry and mastery of dialects, Cleary initially employed the standard \"Jewface\" portrayal of that era as his signature routine. Billed variously as \"the Hebrew comedian,\" \"the Yiddish Gazotsky,\" \"the funniest Hebrew on the stage,\" and the \"Ghetto kid,\" while also garnering kudos for his singing, Cleary began performing professionally no later than 1917. By 1919, his wife of seven years, soprano Naomi Plant, had joined the act.\nRadio\nIn an interview conducted 14 years after his death, some measure of Cleary's contribution to Lux Radio Theatre's success was provided by former Billboard staffer Dean Owen, who dubbed Cleary the \"pillar  Lux Theatre's stock company.\"\nOn April 20, 1942, Cleary appeared in Lux Radio Theatre's adaptation of the 1941, Oscar-nominated biographical drama, One Foot in Heaven, portraying Preston Thurston, the part played by Gene Lockhart in the film.\nBetween 1935 and 1938, Cleary was part of a popular radio comedy team sometimes known as \"Nuts and Bolts\"\u2014\"Nuts\" being Cleary and \"Bolts\" his fellow vaudeville alumnus, Ken Gillum. In March 1937, the pair went from being heard locally\u2014on programs produced, respectively, in Los Angeles and New York\u2014to being broadcast nationally over the NBC Blue Network.\nOne of Cleary's most substantial non-recurring roles was the protagonist of \"My Brother Abe,\" an episode of the short-lived series Proudly We Hail, featuring a tremendously wealthy centenarian and his impatient heirs; \"Abe\" refers not only to his late, lamented brother, who had died at Gettysburg, but to the like-named late President, with whom he had had the good fortune to correspond.\nFilm\nNotwithstanding a film career confined strictly to small supporting roles, the lion's share uncredited, Cleary did manage, in at least two of the four films in which he received an onscreen credit, to elicit reviewers' acknowledgement of his good work; namely, the 1950 prison drama, State Penitentiary, in which he doubles as the Warden and Narrator, and the 1952 baseball biopic, The Pride of St. Louis, in which Cleary portrays Ed Monroe, Dizzy Dean's minor league manager.\nMiscellany\nIn 1940, Cleary was invited to a gathering of 50 members of the local Rotary Club in Arcadia, California, convened to honor the branch's outgoing president, John Vanderbur, who, in turn, received the brunt of Cleary's \"ribbing,\" much to the amusement of those present.\nFilmography\nPersonal life and death\nFrom May 18, 1912 until his death, Cleary was married to Naomi Aloha Plant.  They had two sons, Jack and Richard. The latter had a brief acting career of his own during the late 1940s and early 50s, most notably with a substantial role in both the original Broadway run and subsequent tour of Stalag 17.\nAs of January 1920, and continuing through at least May of that year, Cleary owned the company, Leo's Auto Painting Shop, offering \"first class work\" and \"moderate prices\".\nJudging from an article published by The Pasadena Post in March 1920 (dubbing him \"the famous Elk comedian\"), Cleary was, at the very least, a member of the Elks Lodge for very near his entire adult life.\nOn April 11, 1955, Cleary died of kidney failure at Van Nuys Valley Hospital, Survived by his mother, wife, sons and four grandchildren, Cleary's cremated remains are interred at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.\nNotes\n^ Presumably akin to the later Celebrity \"Roasts,\" the latter term evidently not having been coined until almost a decade later.\n",
    "Former political party in Tuva, Russia\nKhostug Tyva (Tuvan: \u0425\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0433 \u0422\u044b\u0432\u0430, lit.\u2009'free Tuva') was a political party in Tuva which existed from 1989 until the late 1990s. Originally established as the People's Front of Tuva (Russian: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0422\u0443\u0432\u044b, romanized:\u00a0Narodnyy front Tuvy), Khostug Tyva led the anti-Russian riots that resulted in the flight of most of the republic's ethnic Russian population, as well as later efforts to achieve independence from Russia.\nHistory\nThe People's Front of Tuva was founded under the leadership of Kaadyr-ool Bicheldey in October 1989, amidst the dissolution of the Soviet Union and increasing enmity between ethnic Tuvans and Russians in the Tuvan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Khostug Tuva's leadership actively supported the anti-Russian riots in Tuva, calling for all Russians to leave the republic. Bicheldey was elected as a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Tuvan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\u00a0 in March 1990.\nAfter its legalisation in on 10 June 1992, Khostug Tuva began advocating for a referendum on the separation of Tuva from Russia. The party supported measures to increase affordable housing for rural Tuvan migrants to the capital, Kyzyl, and successfully pushed the population to oppose the 1993 Russian constitutional referendum, on the basis of opposition to private ownership of land.\nKhostug Tyva was also connected to nationalist groups from Khakassia and the Altai Republic, and united with the Khakas \u00c7on \u00e7ob\u012f party to form the Association of Peoples of Southern Siberia on 17 June 1993. The political alliance argued for inhabitants of Russian republics to receive greater rights, as well as for the unification of Turkic peoples into a single state.\nSplit and dissolution\nIn 1993, Khostug Tyva split in two as a result of conflicts between the moderate and radical wings of the party. The radicals remained within Khostug Tyva, while the moderates formed the People's Party of Sovereign Tuva (Russian: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0443\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0422\u0443\u0432\u044b, romanized:\u00a0Narodnaya partiya suverrenoy Tuvy). The People's Party of Sovereign Tuva was formally registered on 14 February 1993. Following the split, Khostug Tyva continued to call for Tuvan independence from the Russian Federation, and the chief of the party's executive committee, Igor Badra\u00a0, was a candidate for the Party of Russian Unity and Accord during the 1993 Russian legislative election.\nKhostug Tyva dissolved itself at some point during the late 1990s.\n",
    "English baron and justice\nSir John Marshal (1170?\u20131235) was an English baron and justice.\nBiography\nMarshal was a nephew of William Marshal, first earl of Pembroke, and consequently grandson of John Marshal. His father was probably Anselm, third son of the latter, for John, the eldest, appears to have died childless, while Henry, the youngest, was bishop of Exeter. Anselm Marshal is known only from the 'Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal' (ll. 337\u20138, 4037\u20138), where Sire Ansel li Mareschals, Franz e doz e proz e leials, is mentioned as taking part in a great tournament at Lagni-sur-Marne about 1180. John Marshal was probably born about 1170, for he first appears as a knight in 1197, when he accompanied his uncle, William Marshal, on his embassy to Count Baldwin of Flanders (ib. i. 10763). In September 1198 he was fighting under his uncle and Count Baldwin, and was sent by them to bear the news of Philip's retreat from before Arras to King Richard (ib. 11. 10901\u201317). On 31 January 1203 he was in charge of Falaise (Cat. Hot. Pat. p.\u00a024), and a little later received a grant of the lands of the Count of \u00c9vreux in England (Stapleton, Rotuli Normanni\u00e6, ii. clxxiii). In April 1204 he had license to go into Ireland as his uncle's representative, and to hold the stewardship of his lands in Ireland (Sweetman, i. 210, 216), He was still in Ireland on 13 February 1205, and probably remained there till late in 1207, when on 8 November we find him, in company with Meiler FitzHenry, at the king's court at Woodstock (ib. 254, 310, S48). On 12 November he received a grant of the marshalry of Ireland, and of the 'cantred of the vill of Kyhnie' (ib. 353). John Marshal appears at this time to have adhered rather to the king than to his uncle; in June 1210 he accompanied the former on his Irish expedition (ib. 401, 404). As marshal of Ireland he had an annuity of twenty-five marks (ib. 532). On 10 June 1213 he had charge of the castles of Whitchurch and Screward in Shropshire (Cal. Hot. Pat. p.\u00a0100), and on 25 January 1214 of the county of Lincoln and its coasts. He was also put in charge of the Welsh marches, and received a grant of the manor of Hingham and hundred of Fourho (ib. p.\u00a0109). On 25 June 1215 he received the custody of the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, with the castles of Norwich and Orford, but surrendered them on 24\u20138 July in exchange for Somerset, Dorset, and Worcester, with the castles of Sherborne and Dorchester. At this time he also surrendered Lincolnshire (ib. pp.\u00a0150\u20131). On 17 September he received the charge of the forests in the same counties (ib. p.\u00a0155 b ). Marshal had supported the king in his struggle with the barons, and had been with him at Runnymede on 15 June. He was now appointed on 4 September to go to Rome on the king's behalf with Richard de Marisco' and others (ib. p, 182 b). He was back in England by the end of the year, and accompanied John on his northward march in December. On 2 June 1216 he had power to take into favour all rebels who surrendered (ib. p.\u00a0185). John Marshal was present at the coronation of the young king at Worcester on 28 October, and next year fought under his uncle at Lincoln on 20 May. Soon afterwards he was commissioned with Philip d'Albini to make preparations for opposing the expected French fleet, and presumably was present in the battle with Eustace the Monk on 24 August. Marshal had been made sheriff of Hampshire and custos of Devizes earlier in the year; in 1218 he was a justice of the forest, and in 1219 a justice itinerant for the counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, and Derby (Cal. Hot Glaus, i.407; cf. Shirley, i. 20).\nOn 15 July 1221 he was sent on a mission to Ireland to receive surrender of the justiciarship from Geoffrey de Marisco, which he did on 4 October. In December 1222 he was appointed for another mission to Ireland, though he did not cross over till February 1223. His duty was apparently to advise the new justiciar, Henry of London, archbishop of Dublin, as to the provisioning of the royal castles. On 3 June he received charge, as the king's bailiff, of the lands of Cork, Decies, and Desmond, with their castles, and on the same day the justiciar was specially instructed to act by his advice (Sweetman, i. 1000, 1015, 1062\u20133, 1083\u20137, 1107, 1118). Next year he was still in Ireland, and after assisting his cousin, William Marshal, in his war with Hugh de Lacy, was sent to England in October in charge of Hugh (ib. 1205; Ann, Mon. iii. 91). Marshal was one of the sureties for Walter de Lacy, sixth baron Lacy on 13 May 1225, and in August went abroad on a mission for the king (Cal. Hot. Clam. ii. 47, 59). In January 1226 he was sent to the council held by the legate Otto at Westminster to forbid the bishops from incurring any obligation to the Roman church in respect of their lay fees.\nIn February 1228 he was once more sent to Ireland (Sweetman, i. 1563, 1572), in June 1230 was a justice for assize of arms in Norfolk and Suffolk (Shirley, i. 375), and in",
    "German-British social scientist and economist\nCharlotte Leubuscher (born 24 July 1888 in Jena; died 2 June 1961 in London) was a German-British social scientist and economist.\nBiography\nBorn as the daughter of the Privy Medical Councillor Georg Leubuscher, she attended the Gymnasium Bernhardinum in Meiningen, where she was the first girl ever to graduate from high school. She then studied economics, history, philosophy and law in Cambridge, Giessen, Munich and Berlin. In the summer of 1912 Leubuscher  spent 12 weeks in England studying industrial relations in the railway industry in collaboration with Lujo Brentano and this became the basis for her 1913 Berlin doctorate under Heinrich Herkner.\nLeubuscher spent the war years working as a statistician and returned to the University of Berlin in 1919, where she habilitated with the thesis \"Socialism and Socialization in England\". Her habilitation was the third by a woman and the first outside the natural sciences there. In 1923 she received a lectureship in foreign social policy, especially of England and Russia, at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Leubuscher returned to Britain several times for research study.  In 1924 she moved to the University of Berlin, where she was appointed associate professor in 1929.\nLeubuscher was half-Jewish and in 1933 her teaching license was revoked by the Nazi government. She emigrated to England and taught at various universities, including Cambridge, Manchester and the London School of Economics. From 1933 to 1936 Leubuscher received research scholarships from Girton College, Cambridge. Leubuscher began to focus om colonial economics and was one of the first economists to focus on development economics. Her archive is located in the Staatsarchiv Meiningen.\nCharlotte Leubuscher died in 1961 at the age of almost 73 years in London. She was buried in the Cemetery II of the Jerusalem and New Church in Berlin-Kreuzberg, where her grandfather Rudolf Leubuscher (1821\u20131861) had also found his final resting place a century earlier.

He was the first democratically elected mayor of Valencia after the Francoist dictatorship, serving from April to October 1979. He was removed from office by his party after taking a position critical of its leadership. He did not run in any election again until 2007.\nBiography\nTenure as mayor\nMart\u00ednez Castellano said that when he arrived at Valencia City Hall, the building was not fit for purpose and the council had debts.\nBorn in Valencia, Mart\u00ednez Castellano joined the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) in 1976. He was the first democratically elected mayor of his home city in the 1979 Spanish local elections. He was sworn into office with the support of the 13 city councillors from his party and the six from the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), thus outvoting the 13 members of the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD).\nMart\u00ednez Castellano reflected in 2019 that when he arrived at the mayor's office, it only had a table with no drawers, an FC Bayern Munich pennant and a red sofa kept for sentimental reasons as Francisco Franco had once sat there. The city council had a deficit of 3 billion pesetas (\u20ac18 million) and outstanding bills since 1972. The new administration took possession of landmarks such as the Museo de la Ciudad de Valencia\u00a0, and halted building projects in favour of green spaces. Mart\u00ednez Castellano faced an attempted bombing of his home in his first week in office.\nDays after taking office, Mart\u00ednez Castellano was able to pass a two-thirds majority with support from the UCD to ask for a loan of 1.528 billion pesetas. On 11 June 1979, he hosted a meeting of the mayors of the 20 biggest cities, in which Narc\u00eds Serra of Barcelona advocated for financial reform to combat a shared debt that was forecast to reach 400 billion pesetas by the end of the year. The mayors met the prime minister of Spain Adolfo Su\u00e1rez the next day.\nExpulsion from the PSOE\nIn September 1979, Mart\u00ednez Castellano attended the 28th PSOE congress, where he was part of the \"critical\" sector against leader Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez's proposal to remove Marxism from the party's ideology; Gonz\u00e1lez resigned as a result. Due to this position, Mart\u00ednez Castellano was expelled from the Socialist Party of the Valencian Country (PSPV), resigned from office, and was replaced by the second name on the PSOE list for the election, Ricard P\u00e9rez Casado.\nThe PSOE attempted to dismiss Mart\u00ednez Castellano from his seat on the city council. The matter went to the Constitutional Court, which found in Mart\u00ednez Castellano's favour. The case set the precedent that political mandates belong to the elected individuals, and not to political parties.\nLater life and death\nMart\u00ednez Castellano returned to politics for the 2007 Valencia City Council election with the Social Democratic Party. Initially the lead candidate, he was finally listed as second. He was also a columnist for the local newspaper Las Provincias.\nMart\u00ednez Castellano died on 20 May 2024. Valencia City Council declared three days of mourning.\n",
    "Spanish footballer and manager\nJuan Rodr\u00edguez Aretio (10 July 1922 \u2013 24 September 1973) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Spanish club Celta de Vigo, FC Barcelona, and Sporting de Gij\u00f3n. He was also a manager, taking charge of Celta de Vigo and Recreativo de Huelva.\nEarly life\nJuan Rodr\u00edguez Aretio was born in Ferrol on 10 July 1922, and began playing football at his hometown club Racing de Ferrol, Pontevedra CF, and Club Pe\u00f1asco.\nClub career\nAfter standing out in regional football, Aretio arrived at Celta in the 1943\u201344 season along with Pahi\u00f1o to sweeten the goodbye of two monsters: Nolete, who left football; and Juan del Pino, who signed for Sabadell. In their first year at the club, they formed a great attacking quintet made up of Roig, Miguel Mu\u00f1oz, Pahi\u00f1o, Aretio, and V\u00e1zquez, which played a crucial role in taking Vigo out of the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. In 1948, he was a member of the Vigo side that reached the final of the 1948 Spanish Cup, which still is the club's only Copa del Rey final appearance, but they lost 1\u20134 to Sevilla FC, courtesy of a hat-trick from Mariano Uceda. In the late 1940s, Aretio began to fall apart as the exodus of stars from Celta began: Pahi\u00f1o and Mu\u00f1oz signed for Real Madrid, and a year later they were joined by Gabriel Alonso and Sobrado, while Roig retired from football.\nAretio thus left Celta too in October 1949, and went to Barcelona, where he joined the ranks of FC Barcelona, who paid five hundred thousand pesetas for him. At Barcelona, he did not lose his goal-scoring instinct, scoring 7 goals in 19 competitive matches, always accompanied in this aspect by Pahi\u00f1o. After playing for Barcelona, Murcia, and Sporting de Gij\u00f3n, with whom he played twenty matches in 1951\u201352, and ten in 1952\u201353. Aretio then returned to Celta in November 1953, but he was no longer the player who had left, and was released at the end of that season. In total, he scored 63 goals in 148 matches for Celta. He ended his career at Salgueiros of the Portuguese Second Division in 1955\u201356, at the age of 34.\nAretio was the footballer with the sublime dribble and had prodigious and elegant ease with his header shots.\nManagerial career\nAfter his career as a player ended, Aretio remained linked to Celta, now as a coach, which he oversaw in two stages (1961\u201362 and 1972\u201373). The tremendous outcome of the latter season surpassed all the limits of the admiration that the Balaidos fans felt for Aretio. Although Celta had a foot and a half in the Second Division, the outcome was only decided on the last matchday against Real Madrid, then coached by Miguel Mu\u00f1oz, and own goals from Touri\u00f1o, Doblas and Jim\u00e9nez, in a stadium where they say there was no room for even a pin, led Celta to salvation. Once the fight was over, Aretio burst into tears hugging his beloved enemy Mu\u00f1oz.\nThis victory coincided with the 50th anniversary of the foundation of Celta Vigo, but Aretio was too sick to celebrate, since his perennial voice led him to an initial diagnosis of laryngeal cancer; later denied and displacing all fears to the lungs. He also coached Turista, Racing de Ferrol (1960\u201361), Recreativo de Huelva (1963\u201364), Melilla, Oviedo (1966\u201367) Avil\u00e9s, and Gran Pe\u00f1a Celtista (1973).\nDeath\nAretio died of lung cancer in A Coru\u00f1a on 24 September 1973, at the age of, on the same day that two teams he had coached were going to face each other: Oviedo and Celta, and although Celta won 5\u20131, the bouquet of flowers that Oviedo had left on his grave before the game sowed desires for a draw within many Celta fans.\nA month later a well-deserved tribute match was played to honor his memory, with all the clubs providing their best men for the game while the Hotel Nice offered free accommodation to all of them.\nHonours\nCelta de Vigo\nCopa del Rey:\nRunner-up (1): 1948\n",

    "American racing driver\nNASCAR driver\nBilly Tanner IV (born November 15, 1981) is an American former professional stock car racing driver who has previously competed in the ARCA Re/Max Series.\nRacing career\nTanner, a fourth generation driver who's father raced at various tracks in Pennsylvania, began his professional racing start at the age of nine, where he competed in the Super DIRTcar Big-Block Modified Series at Nazareth Speedway, where he started 28th and finished in 22nd. Afterwards, he competed in various events in the Northeast, primarily driving quarter midgets, dirt sportsmen and 358 Dirt modifieds. In 2006, he competed in the Race of Champions North Series, where he finished sixth in points, and the Southern division, where he finished seventh in points.\nIn 2007, Tanner participated in the pre-season for the ARCA Re/Max Series at Daytona International Speedway, driving the No. 75 Ford, where he placed in the top-25 in the timesheet across the three days of testing. He later made his debut for the team several days later, where he qualified in 26th and finished one lap down in 21st. Afterwards, he joined Stott Classic Racing for his next race at Kentucky Speedway, driving the No. 07 Chevrolet, where he finished two laps down in seventeenth place. He then ran the next three races at Toledo Speedway, Iowa Speedway, and Pocono Raceway, where he finished nineteenth, 24th, and 27th respectively. Tanner would not return until the series' return to Kentucky, where he started 29th and finished in 37th due to a crash early in the race. In his next race at Pocono, Tanner benefited from a number of accidents that marred the event to finish fourteenth after starting in 26th. He then failed to reach the top-twenty in the next three races at Nashville Superspeedway, the Illinois State Fairgrounds dirt track, and the Milwaukee Mile, where he was just outside the top-ten before suffering an engine failure midway through the latter race, finishing 21st, 26th, and 29th respectively. Afterwards, he came back to finish in sixteenth position at Gateway International Raceway before running his penultimate race of the year at Chicagoland Speedway, where he finished in nineteenth after starting in 21st. In his last start of the year at Talladega Superspeedway, Tanner had been in the top-fifteen for the majority of the race before Michael McDowell lost a tire with less than twenty laps to go, causing a multi-car accident, which involved Tanner and put him out of the race, placing him 36th in the final reuslts. After the crash, Tanner made comments criticizing McDowell during an interview on the SPEED Channel, which led to Tanner and Stott Classic Racing to issue a formal apology. Although he had hoped to compete the full ARCA schedule in 2008, this would ultimately not come to fruition, and he has not raced in the series since then.\nMotorsports results\nARCA Re/Max Series\n(key) (Bold\u00a0\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

    "Lifeboat station in Ireland\nDunmore East Lifeboat Station is located on West Wharf, at the harbour of Dunmore East, County Waterford, on the south coast of Ireland.\nA lifeboat station was opened here by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1884.\nSince 2021, it has operated the All-weather Shannon-class lifeboat, 13-41 William and Agnes Wray (ON 1348).\nHistory\nFollowing a visit to the area in 1882 by the Chief Inspector of Lifeboats, Capt. The Hon. Henry Weyland Chetwynd, RN, it was decided that a lifeboat be placed at Dunmore East. A boathouse and slipway, costing \u00a3613-5s-0d, were constructed by F. Kent. A 37-foot 12-oared Self Righting \"Pulling and Sailing\" (P&S) lifeboat, (one with oars and sails), was ordered from Forrestt of Limehouse, London, transported first by rail to Bristol, and then aboard the S.S. Reginald, arriving in June 1884. The boat was provided from the legacy of Mr. H. Dodd of Rotherfield, Sussex, and named Henry Dodd (ON 101). Captain Cherry was appointed Coxswain.\nAt 11:30am on January 4, 1888, a flag of distress was hoisted by the crew of the Alfred D. Snow, of San Francisco, off Broomhill Point, Co. Wexford. Such were the conditions, that Capt. Cherry refused to launch the lifeboat, and immediately resigned his duties. Second Coxswain William Jones refused to accept the responsibility, but a former Tenby fisherman, Mr G. R Woods, offered to command the lifeboat. It would be 2:30pm before the lifeboat was launched, by which time, there were no survivors found from the American vessel. Mr Woods was awarded The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum.\nThe Fanny Harriet (ON 617) was placed at Dunmore East in 1911. A 37-foot lifeboat costing \u00a31.107, built by Thames Ironworks, she was funded from the bequest of Miss F H Roe of Bath, Somerset. She would only be launched on service one time, but it would be in exceptional and tragic circumstances.\nOn Friday 20 February 1914, the Fethard lifeboat Helen Blake (ON 546) was smashed on the rocks, going to the aid of the Norwegian vessel Mexico, which was wrecked on the uninhabited Keeragh Islands. Nine lifeboatmen were washed away and drowned. The remaining 5 lifeboatmen scrambled ashore, and then still managed to rescue 8 crew from the Mexico. For three days, the lifeboatmen and crew tried to survive the harsh conditions on the island, without food or water. One of the Mexico crew died of exposure. The Wexford, Kilmore Quay and Dunmore East lifeboats made many attempts to rescue the isolated men on the island, finally succeeding on Monday 23 February. Five RNLI Silver Medals for gallantry were awarded, along with Silver medals from the King of Norway.\nA much older boat, Michael Henry (ON 407), built in 1897, was placed on service in 1914, but it had been converted to be a motor-powered lifeboat in 1908. Launched 3 times and saving 4, it was found to be unfit for service in 1919, and withdrawn. The station would close until the provision of a new 45-foot Watson lifeboat in 1925. Provided from the legacies and estate of Mr Peter Coats and Miss Emily Smart, the new lifeboat was named C. and S. (ON 690).\nIn 1940, the 46ft Watson-class lifeboat Annie Blanche Smith (ON 830) was placed on service. In the next 30 years on service, she would be launched 89 times, and rescue 88 lives. More remarkably, she would be involved in no less than four medal services. Coxswain Patrick Power was in command each time, and would receive the RNLI Bronze Medal for Gallantry in 1941, 1951, 1961 and 1964.\nAfter a handful of different lifeboats on service from 1970, 1975 would see the arrival of Waveney-class lifeboat 44-014 St. Patrick (ON 1035). This boat would also see exceptional service over the next twenty years, being launched 252 times, and saving 83 lives. Coxswain Stephen Whittle would add a second Bronze medal to his previous awards of Silver and bronze medals, for the rescue of a fisherman in 1976.\nAfter 25 years on station, Trent-class lifeboat 14-17 Elizabeth and Ronald (ON 1215) was transferred to the relief fleet, and Dunmore East would receive a Shannon-class lifeboat, costing over \u20ac2.4 million. 13-41 William and Agnes Wray arrived on station on 26 September 2021.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Dunmore East\nRNLI Silver Medal\nLt.

    "\nThe Russian submarine Nerpa (Russian: \u041d\u0435\u0440\u043f\u0430, lit.\u2009'Baikal seal') was the second boat of the Morzh class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. It was laid down and launched on the same day in August 1913, and completed its sea trials in December 1914. Built for the Black Sea Fleet, the submarine saw action during World War I, and spent much of the war raiding Ottoman merchant shipping that transported coal from Zonguldak to Constantinople. Nerpa was credited with sinking 24 ships during the conflict for a total of 2,443\u00a0gross register tons\u00a0(GRT), making it the fourth most successful Russian submarine in the Black Sea.\nNerpa was undergoing major repairs at the shipyard in Nikolayev when the October Revolution occurred. During the Russian Civil War the city was occupied over time by several forces, including Germany, the Western Allies, and the White Army, before being taken by the Bolsheviks and becoming part of the Soviet Union. Nerpa was the only prewar Russian submarine in the Black Sea captured by the Bolsheviks, and it was commissioned into the Soviet Navy in June 1922, before being renamed Politruk (Russian: \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a, lit.\u2009'political leader') in January 1923. The boat became part of the Detached Submarine Division of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, along with four AG-class submarines. Politruk remained on active service until November 1929, when it was removed from the fleet, and it was scrapped in 1931.\nDesign and construction\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Morzh-class boats and three Narval class. The naval engineer Ivan Bubnov was the designer of the Morzh class and developed it from his earlier submarine Akula, which was considered to be the most advanced of the Russian submarines at the time. In the years before the 1911 program, there was debate in the Imperial Russian Navy on whether to purchase and build the submarines designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard, or a foreign inspired design, based on the popular Holland type, which became known as the Narval class. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class.\nThe Morzh-class submarines were well-armed for the time, having one deck gun, four internal torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars. However, the vessel had numerous shortcomings. It suffered from having only a single hull, lacking bulkheads, having a slow diving time of 3+1\u20442 minutes due to poor ballast tank venting, and a diving depth of only 25 fathoms (150\u00a0ft; 46\u00a0m). An additional problem was that twin 1,140 horsepower (850\u00a0kW) diesel engines to power all three Morzh-class boats had been ordered from Germany, but were not delivered by the time World War I broke out. They had to be replaced by severely underpowered engines from the Amur River gunboats, each of which delivered only 250 horsepower (190\u00a0kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30\u00a0km/h; 18\u00a0mph) surface speed could not be attained. The designed 12-knot (22\u00a0km/h; 14\u00a0mph) underwater speed also could not be attained due to a poorly designed hull shape, which was more like that of a surface vessel than a submarine. The construction of all three submarines began on 25 June 1911 and took place at the Nikolayev department of the Baltic Yard, which was created specifically to build the Morzh class. Some of the components were made in Saint Petersburg before being sent to Nikolayev to be assembled.\nNerpa was laid down and launched in August 1913, and received its engines in November 1914, with the sea trials taking place until the end of the following month. This made Nerpa the first of the Morzh-class boats to enter service, and at the time were they considered to be the best submarines in the Black Sea Fleet.\nWorld War I service\nNerpa during the war\nAt the same time when Nerpa was undergoing sea trials and began active service, the Russian Black Sea Fleet was following a defensive strategy, but this changed in early 1915 when the Stavka ordered it to attack the Bosporus to support the Gallipoli campaign of the British and the French. Nerpa carried out its first patrol near the Bosporus from 5 to 8 March 1915, becoming the first Russian submarine to do so. The patrol was uneventful. But by April, the Russian focus changed to stopping coal shipments along the Turkish coast from the area of Zonguldak t",
    "11th episode of the 4th season of The Ren & Stimpy Show\nPowdered Toast Man vs. Waffle Woman is the 11th episode  of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 19 November 1994.\nPlot\nPowdered Toast Man accidentally ruins the business of waffle tycoon Vicky Velcro, inspiring her to vow revenge. Powered Toast Man tries to grant the wish of the sick child Little Johnny by bringing him the president of the United States and kills the president in the process. Powered Toast Man returns to the Breadbox of Solitude out of guilt.  Velcro uses a giant waffle press to transform herself into the super-villainess Waffle Woman and demands that Powered Toast Man fight her or else Little Johnny will never be allowed to watch television again.. Powdered Toast Man returns to earth to face her. During the ensuring battle, Powered Toast Man and Waffle Woman first destroy New York City, then England and finally the entire world. In the end Powered Toast Man defeats her by destroying the waffle iron and turns Waffle Woman into a pile of slime while she vows to return \"maybe\". Despite all the destruction and death caused by the battle, Powdered Toast Man is hailed as a hero for allowing Little Johnny to watch television again.\nCast\nPowered Toast Man-voice of Gary Owens\nWaffle Woman-voice of Gail Matthius\nLittle Johnny-voice of Billy West\nProduction\nThe story was a pilot episode for a possible spin-off series starring Gary Owens as Powdered Toast Man following the success of the 1992 episode Powdered Toast Man. Ren and Stimpy did not appear in Powdered Toast Man vs. Waffle Woman as a way to test the appeal to audiences of a story that only featured Powdered Toast Man. The episode was largely the work of the husband and wife team of Chris Reccardi and Lynne Naylor. In August 1994, Naylor who was working on the lay-outs for the episode resigned from the Games Animation studio in protest over the way that she was treated by the network. One college stated: \"She went around to each of us to personally tell us her reasons for leaving. The tight deadlines made the job too much of a hassle despite the pay. The way she put it, it was even if the studio offered a million dollars to work on the project, but the project was due on that day, the money just wouldn't be worth all the hassle\".\nReception\nThe American critic Thad Komorowski rated the episode two stars out of five. Komorowksi wrote that \"Powdered Toast vs. Waffle Woman\" had a \"profound inanity\" and that the story made no sense..\nBooks and articles\nDobbs, G. Michael (2015).

    "Spanish military man and sports leader\nPedro Chillida Aramburu (24 November 1889 \u2013 1956) was a Spanish military man who served as the second president of football club Real Sociedad between 1942 and 1945.\nHe was the father of the famous sculptor Eduardo Chillida, notable for his monumental abstract works.\nMilitary career\nPedro Chillida graduated from the Toledo Infantry Academy in 1909. He participated in the first phases of the Rif War in which he was decorated several times, having at that time the rank of first lieutenant.\nChillida belonged to the ultra-Catholic group Basque Right (DVA), which since the founding of the Second Spanish Republic conspired to return the monarchy. The infantry captain Pedro Chillida was one of the leaders who organized paramilitary groups for the coup, being one of the four men who organized the Coup d'\u00e9tat of 18 July 1936 in San Sebasti\u00e1n, which was neutralized by the anarchists, and the failure of the coup attempt was such that by noon of that same day, Chillida's group, made up of DVA and Renovaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola militants, had dissolved and its members tried to return to their daily lives so as not to be identified as coup plotters. However, on July 20, those loyal to the Republic took Chillida prisoner, being in the Ondarreta prison until 9 September when he was transferred to Bilbao aboard the prison ship Arantzazu-Mendi, remaining there until 14 December when he was transferred to the Carmelo prison in Bilbao. On 19 June 1937, Bilbao was liberated by the troops of Franco, and Chillida surrendered to the military authorities of San Sebasti\u00e1n.\nOf conservative ideology, at the end of the Spanish Civil War, he was appointed by the Franco authorities as a member of the classification commissions for prisoners of war in Catalonia. Chillida was a red hunter until he retired in 1951, he even became a military judge in unfair trials held in the first post-war months in Catalonia, where he decided whether the accused should die or not. In May 1939, he was reinstated to active service with the rank of commander.\nPedro Chillida reached the rank of army commander during his military career.\nSporting career\nChillida took over the presidency of Real Sociedad after the resignation of Francisco Molins in 1942 following the club's relegation to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Chillida's first measure as president was to call a coach who knew the club perfectly, Benito D\u00edaz, who was in France training FC Girondins de Bordeaux. Thanks to D\u00edaz, Real Sociedad returned to the First Division on the following year, achieving direct promotion along with Sabadell. However, the following seasons were not good for the club, being relegated again in the 1943\u201344 season: with 17 points in 26 games, Sociedad was one victory away from forcing promotion, but was relegated as second to last. On this occasion, the stay in the Second Division was going to extend for the following three seasons, and Chillida resigned as a result of the failed promotion in 1945, being replaced as president by Felipe de Arteche, but D\u00edaz continued at the helm of the team and went on to achieve the promotion two years later.\nPersonal life and death\nIn 1922, being a captain and stationed in the 14th \"America\" infantry regiment, whose garrison was located in Navarre, Chillida requested a marriage license to marry Carmen Juantegui from San Sebasti\u00e1n. The family settles in Plaza Zaragoza in San Sebasti\u00e1n, next to the Hotel Biarritz, property of Carmen Juantegui's family. This is where the couple's three children were born, including the famous sculptor Eduardo Chillida, born in 1924, and Gonzalo Chillida\u00a0, a painter born in 1926.\nChillida died in 1956, at the age of either 66 or 67.\n",
    "Ancient religious water festival celebrated in May\nThis article is about the ancient festival. For the ancient port near Gaza, see Maiuma (city).\nMaiuma or Maiouma, also written with a final s, was a Graeco-Syrian nocturnal water festival celebrating Dionysus and Aphrodite and held during the month of May-Artemisios. According to Malalas (Chronicle\u00a0284\u2013285), it was celebrated in Antioch every three years as a nocturnal festival, also known as  Orgies, or the Mysteries of Dionysus and Aphrodite. Its most famous venue was Daphne-by-Antioch (Daphne, a suburb of the Hellenistic metropolis \u00a0on the Orontes). Aquatic displays, mime and dance shows made the festival very popular in several cities of the East Roman Empire. There are scholars who distinguish between the original Graeco-Syrian festival, characterised by two main components, water and rejoicing, and later celebrations of similar character from the pagan Graeco-Roman and even the Christian Byzantine world, which also adopted the original name. The celebrations were so licentious that some Roman rulers attempted to ban them.\nOrigin and etymology\nThere is no information about the original purpose of Maiuma.\nMalalus' \"folk etymology\"\nMalalus of Antioch in Syria, a 6th-century Byzantine author from Syria, probably a native Syriac speaker but writing in Greek, saw the name Mayumas as a word derived from the name of the month of May, when the festival was held.\nAncient Semitic origin theory\nRobert M. Good's 1986 thesis is that the Punic word mayumas (my'ms), which occurs in a small number of inscriptions from Carthage, is a calque after the Greek term hydrophoria (see Merriam-Webster entry here) and therefore means \"rites of water movement\", based on his etymological interpretation - mai\u00a0= water,\u00a0yumas\u00a0= carry, thus suggesting that mayumas was a water carrying ceremony. Good notes that \"estivals of water movement were common in the ancient Syro-Palestinian world\" and sees a  Canaanite- Phoenician- Carthaginian tradition as very likely. While elaborating on the possible character of a range of Syro-Palestinian water movement rites, which could be associated with the Carthaginian mayumas festival, he warns that these cannot be more than speculations due to the limited findings. However, the name itself, an awkward composition in Punic, is still perfectly plausible as a calque after the Greek term, which places the time of its adoption sometime between the conquest of Phoenicia by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE and the fall of Carthage in 146 BCE, given that the inscriptions were found there.\nR.M. Good also mentions an Athenian Anthesteria, a Dionysian festival containing hydrophoria rites, and the fact that such rites, connected to libations, were widely known in the Mediterranean world. Good dismisses Malalus' explanation for the word Mayumas as derived from the month of May as folk etymology, which he sees as a result of the fact that by Malalus' time, the connection to the Phoenician/Punic parent word for water, may-, and the composite word based on it, had been thoroughly forgotten.\nAmerican Phoenician language scholar, Philip Schmitz, similarly suggests that the Punic word my'ms is derived by word combination from the Semitic word for water and the Greek name of the spring festival, \u039c\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1(\u03c2), 'Maiouma(s)'.\nAlternative meanings: water festival or harbour\nNicole Benayche (2004) shows how the word -- probably of Semitic origin and later Graecised, maybe also as a play of words on the Greek maia -- came to denote in the Greek and Roman world two different things: either spring festivals, both water-related and pleasant, but with no deeper connection to the Graeco-Syrian mysteries, so for instance the one at Ostia; or the harbour of a city, as for instance at Alexandria in Egypt, where the term referred to the island of Pharos. Ptolemy (2nd c.\u00a0CE) and Marcus Diaconus (in Gaza 395-420) explain the word as simply meaning a maritime city quarter.\nHistory\nEmperor Commodus (r. 177\u2013192), when he renewed by edict the Olympic Games, earmarked revenue originating in certain ceremonies for financing the Maiumas rituals.\nEmperor Julian the Apostate (r. 355\u2013363) apparently made an unsuccessful attempt to prohibit the Mayumas festival.\nMalalas, writing in the 6th century,\u00a0relates that the festival was held in his city of Antioch every three years and lasted for 30 days. An inscription from al-Birketein at Gerasa from the end of that century however mentions the festival being held there annually several years in succession.\nCities holding Mayouma festivals\nAuthors like Nicole Benayshe are warning against the mistake of conflating the Greco-Syrian festival with later water-centered celebrations, as well as using the widely used toponym Maiuma, which often occurs as a common noun for harbour or seaside quarter, as proof for that city hosting the nocturnal mysteries. She notices the wide popularity of events held next to the water in later periods, accompanied by the constru",
    "The only pottery kiln still preserved in Castandet, built in the 19th century, as seen in 2023.\nThe Castandet pottery was the ceramic production made in the town of Castandet (Landes, France), between the 15th and 20th centuries, mainly for utilitarian purposes.\nHistory\nSince the Middle Ages, three hamlets in Castandet, near Mont-de-Marsan, have been devoted to pottery as a means of exploiting the clay and marl in lands that were not very suitable for cultivation. Unlike other sites, the Castandet workshops did not specialise in the manufacture of a particular type of object\u00a0: there, terracotta, along a minor touch of glaze, was used to make dishes and utensils for preparing, cooking or storing food or water, household items for hygiene or lighting, and tools for agricultural or craft work. This proto-industry, which encompassed an entire community, kept the peasants busy for part of the year, with the rest devoted to work in the fields or vineyards \u2014 some managed to make a living from pottery alone.\nThe commercial heyday of Castandet pottery came in the 18th century, with around sixty workshops. These products were sold at markets and fairs throughout the Landes region and beyond, and their use is well documented in much of Gascony. Competition from faience and less expensive regional earthenware products then affected the village's activity. The social situation of the potters deteriorated in the 19th century. The emergence of new metallic and plastic materials took their toll on utilitarian ceramics. The potters survived by making pots for resin extraction and artistic works until the middle of the 20th century, marking the total decline of the Castandet centre. After a period of neglect, the history of this local craft was rediscovered and studied from the 1980s onwards.\nNotes\n^ a b c d e f g h i j Alain Costes; Christian Belot; Liliane Deschamps; Nicole Gourdon-Platel; Claudine Mimbielle; et\u00a0al.

    "\nThe Tafraout Group (Also \"Tafraoute Group\" or  Zaouiat Ahan\u00e7al Group) is a geological group of formations of Toarcian-Aalenian (Lower Jurassic-Middle Jurassic) age in the Azilal, B\u00e9ni-Mellal, Imilchil, Zaouiat Ahansal, Ouarzazate, Tinerhir and Errachidia areas of the High Atlas of Morocco.  The Group represents the remnants of a local massive Siliciclastic-Carbonate platform (\"Tafraout Platform\"), best assigned to succession W-E of alluvial environment occasionally interrupted by shallow marine incursions (tidal flat setting) and inner platform to open marine settings, and marks a dramatic decrease of the carbonate productivity under increasing terrigenous sedimentation.  Fossils include large reef biotas with richness in \"lithiotid\" bivalves and coral mounts (\"Patch reef\", Tafraout Formation), but also by remains of vertebrates such as the sauropod Tazoudasaurus and the basal ceratosaur Berberosaurus, along with several undescribed genera. While there have been attributions of its lowermost layers to the Latest Pliensbachian, the current oldest properly measured are part of the Earliest Toarcian regression (\"MRST10\"), part of the Lower-Middle Palymorphum biozone.  This group is composed of the following units, which extend from west to east: the Azilal Formation (continental to subtidal, including its synonyms the \"Wazzant Formation\" and the \"Continental Series of Toundoute\"); the Amezra\u00ef Formation (intertidal environment); the Aguerd-n\u02c8Tazoult Formation (intertidal environment); the Tagoudite Formation (including the \"Tamadout Formation\", shallow subtidal to open pelagic) & the Trafraout Formation (deposited in a subtidal to inner platform environment). They are connected with the offshore Ait Athmane Formation and the deeper shelf deposits of the Agoudim 1 Formation. Overall, this group represents a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic system of several hundred meters thick, dominated by deposits of shallow marine platforms linked to a nearby hinterland dominated by conglomerates.  The strata of the group extend towards the central High Atlas, covering different anticlines and topographic features along the mountain range.\nThe after-effects of the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event are also very present in the marginal marine strata of the Tafraout Group, with  the Toksine Section recording a dramatic collapse on the scale of the Tethys of the neritic carbonate system.\nGeology\nGeological map of the Central High Atlas and main structural domains\nThe Central High Atlas of Morocco is part of a double-vergent mountain belt that originated due to Cenozoic shortening and inversion of a rift that developed between the Triassic-Jurassic periods. Its geometry is distinctive due to the presence of several ENE\u2013WSW narrow rift basins, derived from four major tectonic phases: pre-rift, that was linked with the Hercynian Orogeny and the union of Pangea in the Paleozoic;  syn-rift, that was developed mostly between the Late Permian-Late Triassic with several NE\u2013SW to ENE\u2013WSW rift-basins, al derived from the almost coeval opening of the Atlantic Ocean and Tethys Sea. This rift-derived basins ended filled with continental siliciclastic sediments, and latter towards the Rhaetian stage of the Triassic affected by emissions of the Central Atlantic magmatic province. It was on the so-called Post-rift phase that the local tectonics had a thermal relaxation and allowed the deposition of the Jurassic-Cretaceous carbonate platforms. The structure of the High Atlas can be defined by two main groups of faults, thrust and oblique-slip faults, that occur from W-E to NE-SW. The presence of tectonic inversion in the Atlas Mountains has shown that are an intracontinental mountain belts that appeared from the uplift of pre-existing rift systems, where here is represented by a major rift system (~2000\u00a0km) originated on the Mesozoic, that was later uplifted and inverted in the Cenozoic. The impact and convergence movements of the African-Iberian plates after the Mesozoic end with an inversion of the previous deposited strata, transporting the sediments of that and forming new low angle thrusts.  Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous strata are confined within basins controlled by the extensional structures of the Mesozoic rift. The Jurassic basins can be grouped into two main provinces located on either side of an emerged Massif Ancien: west, where the basin was open to the Early Atlantic, being related to its passive margin, and east with several epicontinental troughs connected to the Tethys Ocean. Across the Toarcian-Bajocian strata, there was a great deposition of marine shales as marls, calciturbidites and reefal limestones were accumulated in the E Central High Atlas, while on the west margin around the Massif Ancien terrestrial, specially fluvial sedimentation dominated. The present Red Beds of Azilal and the younger marls of Bin el Ouidane indicate various marine oscillations across the Toarcian-Bajocian boundary, ending its sedimentation with t",

Due to the remodeling of the RFEF leagues, as of 2021\u201322 season the promotion play-off is divided into two stages: regional and national. Four teams from each group participate in the regional stage, which were classified between places second and fifth of the regular season.

    "Former lifeboat station in Anglesey, Wales\nCemaes Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station, located in Porth yr Ogof cove, Trwyn yr Wylfa (Wylfa Head), on the west side of Cemaes Bay, near the fishing port village of Cemaes, on the north coast of Anglesey, Wales.\nA lifeboat station was first opened here by the RNLI in 1872, when the station at Cemlyn was closed for the first time.\nAfter few launches and no rescues in the preceding 25 years, Cemaes Lifeboat Station was closed in 1932.\nHistory\nThe Belfast vessel Active was driven ashore at Cemaes Bay by a storm on 7 March 1835. The Rev. James Williams of Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy, founder of the Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, arrived on scene to find that several attempts to launch a boat to the aid of the vessel had been unsuccessful. At great personal risk, Williams rode his horse into the surf, managing to get a line to the vessel. All five crew were rescued. Rev. Williams was awarded the Gold Medal.\nRev. Williams had founded the first Anglesey lifeboat station in 1928, only a few miles away at Cemlyn, but it was not until 1872 that a lifeboat station would be opened at Cemaes, and only then because of the closure of the Cemlyn station due to difficulties maintaining a crew. A boathouse was constructed at Porth Yr Ogof cove, at a cost of \u00a3182, with the Cemlyn lifeboat Sophia being transferred to Cemaes in June 1872.\nSophia was only on station for four years, before being replaced by a new 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m) self-righting lifeboat named Ashtonian, provided from the legacy of Mr George Higginbottom of Ashton-under-Lyne. On 14 October 1877, she was called to the Sarah, a full-rigged sailing ship on passage from Quebec to Liverpool, now aground on Middle Mouse Rocks.\n18 men were rescued from the vessel. The Ashtonian would be launched eight times in the five years on station, and rescue 33 lives.\nThree more lifeboats would be placed on service at Cemaes. In 1881, a 32\u00a0ft (9.8\u00a0m) lifeboat, costing \u00a3286-15s-0d, also being named Ashtonian. Then followed the 34-foot George Evans (ON 132) in 1887, which had been provided from the legacy of Mrs Evans, the boat named after her late husband, Admiral George Evans, Conservator of the River Mersey. Finally, in 1907, the Charles Henry Ashley (ON 583), a 38\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) non-self-righting Watson-class lifeboat. It was one of five lifeboats provided from the estate of Charles Carr Ashley, late of Menton, France.\nA new boathouse with roller-slipway was constructed in 1907 to house the 38\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m)  Charles Henry Ashley, at a cost of \u00a33,840. It was located just along the beach from the former boathouse at Porth yr Ogof, in the shadow of Ynys Yr \u0174yn.\nIn 25 years on station, the lifeboat was launched just seven times, with no rescues. Charles Henry Ashley was retired in 1932, and the station was closed.\nCharles Henry Ashley (ON 583) in Cemaes harbour\nIn operation for 60 years, the Cemaes lifeboat was launched 60 times, and rescued 42 lives.\nToday, little evidence of the station buildings remains, although the base of the pilings and the concrete foot of the slipway of the 1907 boathouse are clearly visible.\nThe Charles Henry Ashley was sold into private ownership in 1932. The boat ultimately fell into neglect, but was saved from being broken up, and relaunched in 2009 after a full restoration by the Cemaes Boat Club.\nCemaes lifeboats\n^ ON is the RNLI's Official Number of the boat.\nSee also\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\nNotes\n^ 30-foot 6-oared Self-righting lifeboat, built by Forrestt of Limehouse.\n^ 30-foot Self-righting lifeboat\n^ 32-foot Self-righting lifeboat\n^ 34-foot Self-righting lifeboat\n^ 38-foot non-self-righting Watson (P&S) lifeboat, built by Thames Ironworks\n",
    "2024 killing of a United States Air Force serviceman\nOn May 3, 2024, United States Air Force serviceman Roger Fortson was fatally shot in his home in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, by Deputy Eddie Duran of the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office. Duran was fired by the end of the month, after the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office concluded that Duran's \"use of deadly force was not objectively reasonable\" because \"Fortson did not make any hostile, attacking movements\".\nShooting\nPolice radio audio showed a disturbance report made on May 3, 2024, around 4.30 p.m., for a residential complex, where a deputy said: \"Don't have anything further than a male and female; it's all fourth-party information from the front desk at the leasing office\".\nBody camera footage shows an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy being told by a woman in a residential complex to go to Apartment 1401. The woman tells the deputy that \"two weeks ago\" when walking beside that apartment, she heard some \"yelling\" and profanities, as well as the sound of a slap, but she was not sure where that sound came from.\nAccording to body camera footage, the sheriff's deputy arrived at Apartment 1401, and initially knocked without announcing who he was. The deputy then moves off to the side of the door, where it seems he cannot be seen from the apartment's peephole. About 30 seconds later, the deputy knocks on the door again, this time announcing: \"Sheriff\u2019s office, open the door.\" Around 10 seconds later, the deputy knocks on the door another time, and again announces: \"Sheriff's office, open the door.\" According to Fortson's mother and his girlfriend, who had been on FaceTime with him, Fortson heard a knock on his door and received no response when he asked who was at the door. His girlfriend also indicated that Fortson attempted to look through his peephole but was unable to see anyone, and had armed himself believing that someone was breaking in.\nAccording to body camera footage, Fortson opens the door holding a gun in his right hand, with the gun held by his side and pointed downwards. As the door opens, the deputy tells Fortson to \"step back\" and immediately shoots Fortson. Five or six gunshots are fired. Around the time Fortson is shot, he lifts his left hand in front of his chest. Fortson falls to the floor, and it is only then that the deputy tells Fortson: \"Drop the gun!\"\nAfter the shooting, Fortson was brought to a hospital, where he died.\nResponse\nOn May 4, 2024, the Okaloosa County's Sheriff's Office said that the shooting occurred at an apartment after a sheriff's deputy responded to a call of a \"disturbance in progress\": \"Hearing sounds of a disturbance,  reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun and after the deputy had identified himself as law enforcement.\" The Sheriff's Office further said that the unnamed deputy had been put on \"paid administrative leave\". Body camera footage of the shooting was later released by the Sheriff's Office on May 9, 2024.\nOne of the family's attorney's stated that Fortson died due to officers knocking on the wrong door, and that while mistakes happen, good people own their mistakes. Benjamin Crump, who is also representing the family criticized the sheriff's account that was released prior to the video being released.\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office announced on May 31, 2024 that it had fired Eddie Duran, the deputy who killed Fortson, after the agency's \"administrative\" internal investigation concluded that \"Fortson did not make any hostile, attacking movements, and therefore,  use of deadly force was not objectively reasonable\" and thus \"violated agency policy\". This announcement was the first time Duran was publicly identified as the shooter. The internal investigation concluded that \"Fortson did not point the gun in  direction\", instead, Fortson's gun \"was pointed at the ground sufficiently enough for  to clearly see the rear face of the rear sight\". Duran explained why he shot Fortson to investigators by claiming: \"I'm standing there thinking I'm about to get shot, I'm about to die \u2026 It is him or me at this point and I need to, I need to act as opposed to react\".\n",
    "Indian comedian and actor (1957\u20132010)\nPedro Menino da Costa (16 September 1957 \u2013 11 October 2010), known professionally as Comedian Peter, was an Indian comedian, actor, composer, ghostwriter, playwright, and lyricist known for his work in khell and tiatr productions.\nEarly life\nPedro Menino da Costa was born on 16 September 1957, in Marg\u00e3o, Goa, which was a part of Portuguese India during the period of the Portuguese Empire. He was born into a Goan Catholic family with a strong connection to the traditional Goan theater known as tiatr. His father, Casiano, hailed from Varca, Goa, while his mother, Maria Santana Joana da Silva, a homemaker, came from Colva, Goa. Tiatr played a significant role in da Costa's family, with several relatives actively involved as writers and actors in this form of entertainment. Notable among his siblings were Dioginho (born 1951), as well as the late Camilo, Joaquim, Josephine Dias, and David, all of whom were performers in the Konkani theater scene. Da Costa's father, not only had a presence as a performer in tiatrs but also made contributions as a playwright and director within the Konkani theater community. His involvement further enriched the family's background in the art form.\nCareer\nDa Costa began his early involvement in the performing arts as a young performer, introduced to the field by his father, Casiano, within the realm of tiatrs, a traditional Goan style of theater. Later on, da Costa shifted to engaging in zomnivoile khell, which are popular street plays found in Goa. He gained recognition for his performances in Shalibai's fells, synonymous with khell productions. In addition to his acting endeavors, da Costa began writing khells and assumed the role of a young mestre, imparting play acts, known as \"partio\", to a group of aspiring youths from Assolda and Paroda-Quepem on a regular basis. It was through his involvement in A. M. Pacheco's khell-tiatrs, specifically Odruxtt (1974) and Mr. Romeo (1974), that da Costa secured a breakthrough in the commercial theater domain.\nDa Costa showcased his versatility as an artist by portraying characters with both comedic and serious undertones, demonstrating his ability to excel in diverse roles across the spectrum of performing arts. He initially emerged as Comedian Peter in A. M. Pacheco's uninterrupted drama Fator (Stone) staged in 1981. Da Costa's comedic prowess shone through his delivery of dialogues and body movements, leaving audiences in fits of laughter. His talent for mimicking prominent personalities from the realms of tiatr, politics, society, and religion further contributed to his acclaim. Throughout his career, da Costa collaborated with popular Konkani directors such as Pascoal Rodrigues, Filipe Almeida Minino Mario, Milagres de Chandor, and F. Cardozo, participating in their respective tiatr productions.\nD'Costa was also a popular figure in the realm of tiatr and khell-tiatr, where he left a mark as both a performer and composer. Alongside A. M. Pacheco, he showcased his comedic talent in the works of acclaimed artists such as Premanand Lotlikar, Roseferns, and Christopher-Meena. Da Costa's creative prowess extended to composing the \"cantos\" (Konkani songs) for Premanand Lotlikar's seven khell-tiatrs, including popular productions such as Loz Ani Dukh (Shame and Sadness), Zindabad (Long Live), To Mhozo Oprad (That is my Fault), and Povitr Papi (Holy Sinner). In A. M. Pacheco's theatrical work Don Roste (Two Roads), da Costa demonstrated his acting range by taking on the character of a police officer, illustrating his ability to excel outside of comedic roles.\nAdditionally, he exhibited his talent as a writer by creating tiatrs and khell-tiatrs, frequently collaborating with others for their staging and production. However, he independently produced one tiatr, titled Palov. Da Costa's musical aptitude was recognized, particularly his ability to compose songs swiftly. He enhanced his reputation as a songwriter by crafting lyrics for songs and cantos that were utilized by several tiatrists in their performances. His extensive discography included several cassettes, CDs, and VCDs featuring his songs and plays, such as Upkar, Mahatma Gandhi, Circus, Very Good Bhakar, Abhi Tak Zinda Hai, and Teg Bhav Deva Pau. In the production Teg Bhav Deva Pau, da Costa embodied three distinct characters, leaving an impact on fans of tiatr. Da Costa introduced his final album, Peter D'Costa Abhi Tak Zinda Hai, Rok Sakta to Roklo, shortly before his death.\nPersonal life\nDa Costa resided in the fourth ward of Colva, Goa. On 12 May 1999, he entered into a civil marriage with Margarida da Costa, a homemaker originally from Macasana, Goa but born in Benaulim. The civil marriage was officially registered at the Salcete registrar's office. Subsequently, on 17 May, the couple solemnized their marriage with an official church ceremony at Our Lady of Merces Church in Colva, Goa. At the time of their union, da Costa was 41 years old, whi",
    "Spanish aristocrat (1806-1885)\nAndr\u00e9s Avelino de Silva y Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, 13th Duke of Aliaga (28 November 1806 - 8 January 1885) was a Spanish aristocrat.\nEarly life\nAndr\u00e9s Avelino de Silva y Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba was born on 28 November 1806 into the noble House of Silva. He was the second son of Jos\u00e9 Rafael de Silva Fern\u00e1ndez de H\u00edjar, 12th Duke of H\u00edjar (1776\u20131863), and Juana Nepomucena Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba Villarroel Sp\u00ednola y la Cerda, 8th Countess of Salvatierra (1785\u20131813). His elder brother was Cayetano de Silva y Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba.\nCareer\nUpon the death of his father in 1863, his elder brother succeeded to the senior title of Duke of H\u00edjar, and he succeeded to some of his subsidiary titles, including as the 13th Duke of Aliaga, 16th Marquess of Almenara, 9th Marquess of Sobroso, 10th Count of Salvatierra (from his mother), and 15th Count of Palma del R\u00edo.

    "\n\u201cThe day lasts for more than a century...\u201d, also \u201cEternal Blizzard\u201d (2018) \u2013 one of the significant performances of the Tatar Academic Theater named after. \u011e. Kamal in the Tatar language of the late 2010s. The premiere of the play at the \u011eali\u04d3s\u011f\u04d3r Kamal Theater was timed to coincide with the 90th anniversary of the birth of the classic of Kyrgyz prose Chingiz Aitmatov and took place on November 4, 2018. The performance was performed in Tatar with simultaneous translation into Russian.\nOn December 9, 2018, the play was presented at the X All-Russian Festival of Young Directors \"H\u00f6n\u04d3r\" (Craft). The performance was among seven that are nominated for the \"Performance of the Year\" (2019) award as a result of an open online vote by the magazine \"Inde\".\nLast performed May 30, 2021.\nPlot\nThe director and author of the play's staging, Ilgiz Zainiev, shortens some storylines in order to highlight one, according to his idea, the most important: \u201cthe history of human destinies in difficult times\". The action takes place in the 60\u201380s of the 20th century in the village of Sary-Ozek, but the plot covers the entire century and even fragments from the history of the peoples who lived in these lands in ancient times. The simultaneous development of action in the present and past - in two time layers - determines the play of some characters by two actors. The action, taking place in the present, is based on the funeral of Kazangap, a friend of the main character of the play, Edigei.\nKazangap's death prompted his relatives and friends to gather. After discussing and resolving some differences, they decide to bury Kazangap in the old cemetery of their ancestors, which is located at a distant distance. On this long journey, everyone is immersed in their own thoughts, including the main character. The chain of memories of Edigei, allusions to the past, are strung together on the main dramatic line: the emergence of friendship between young Kazangap and Edigei, the arrival of teacher Abutalib and his wife Zaripa in the village, a happy and cheerful New Year's Eve, and then the arrest of the teacher on a false denunciation, grief, unrequited love, the end era of repressions and executions. Often the viewer is introduced to legends and parables, which with renewed vigor reveal the theme of the trampled memory of the people. This is the merit of ruthless politics, eternal progress and people's blind pursuit of an easy life. Thus, many memories from centuries ago are experienced by the main character within one day.\nActors\nParticipated in the play:\nAlsou Gainullina\nIldar Khairullin\nAidar Khafizov\nRuzia Motyygullina\nAskhat Khismatov\nMinvali Gabdullin\nAlmaz Sabirzyanov\nMilyausha Shaikhetdinova\nFanis Safin\nGulchachak Gaifetdinova\nAirat Arslanov\nFanis Zihansha\nRamil Vaziev\nIltuzar Makhammetgaliev\nAlmaz Burkhanov\nAigul Shakurova\nIlnur Zakirov\nEmil Talipov\nLaysan Fayzullina\nAlmaz Garayev\nFannur Mukhametzyanova\nElvir Salimov\nGuzel Gyulverdieva\nIrek Kashapov\nMusic\nThe music for the play was written by a modern Tatar composer, member of the Union of Composers of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan Elmir Nizamov. The composer uses a chamber composition: national instruments quray (woodwind), qub\u0131z and dumb\u0131ra (plucked strings); violin, trumpet and piano. The main place in the performance is occupied by stylizations of folk melodies. At times, melodies are given by E. Nizamov without any changes and can be similar to their originals. In other cases, these stylizations are given in the processing of the style of light music or the minimalist style of our time.\nSee also\nThe Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years (novel)\nNotes\n^ a b c d \"\"\u0418 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c...\" (\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044c)\". \u0422\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440 \u0438\u043c. \u0413.\u041a\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0430.

    "The Bornplatz Synagogue\u00a0 in Hamburg, viewed from Beneckestrasse\nThe Jewish Community of Hamburg is one of the larger Jewish communities in Germany, with 2,289 members (as of 2021). It forms an independent state association within the nationwide Central Council of Jews in Germany. The chair of the community is Philipp Stricharz.\nIn addition to the Jewish Community of Hamburg, there is also the \"Liberal Jewish Community of Hamburg\" with over 300 members and the \"Jewish Educational Center Chabad Lubavitch Hamburg e.V.\".\nHistory of the Jewish Communities\nSephardim from 1590 to 1939 in Hamburg and Altona\nThe Neweh Schalom Synagogue in Altona\nSephardim originating from Portugal settled in Hamburg from 1590 onwards, initially without founding a community. At first, many Sephardim, whose families had converted to Catholicism under threat of death, did not openly practice Judaism. In 1612, the Hamburg Council granted Sephardic Jews equal commercial rights to other Hamburg citizens through the \"Kaufmannshantierung\". The Sephardim founded three synagogue communities called Kether Thorah, Neweh Schalom and Thalmud Thorah, which they united in 1652 into the Holy Community of the Sephardim Beith Israel. One notable member was Herbert Pardo, who served multiple times as its chairman until 1933. The Sephardic community existed independently until it was forcibly incorporated into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg in July 1939.\nIn Altona, which had belonged to Hamburg since 1937, Sephardim had lived since before 1647. They founded the Holy Community Neweh Schalom only in 1770, which the few remaining members dissolved in 1887 due to too few members.\nAshkenazim from 1610 to 1945\nHamburg until 1812\nAshkenazim first gained the possibility of residence in Hamburg around 1610, provided they were employed as staff in Sephardic households or businesses. The Sephardim called the Ashkenazi Jews \"Tudescos\" (Portuguese for 'Germans'). Around 1661/1662 they founded the German-Israelite Community of Hamburg (DIG). The city of Hamburg granted residence permits very restrictively, so the DIG in Hamburg was smaller than its branch communities in Altona and Wandsbek (part of Hamburg since 1937). Ashkenazim without residence permits generally had to spend the night outside Hamburg and therefore officially chose their place of residence in the aforementioned, then Danish-Holstein cities. However, since they earned their livelihoods predominantly in Hamburg, they usually spent their days in Hamburg. From 1671 to 1812, the DIG formed part of the so-called Three Communities AHU (Altona, Hamburg, Wandsbek). From 1812 to 1938, the DIG existed independently and then merged into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg.\nIn 1710, the city of Hamburg issued the Regulations for the Jewish Community in Hamburg of both Portuguese and High German People. This came about through the mediation of Emperor Joseph I, who thus did not want to give up the old imperial Jewish regalia.\nIn Altona until 1938\nFour Ashkenazim are documented in Altona before 1611. A community, the High German Israelite Community in Altona (HIG), was founded after 1611. Between 1621 and 1812, the HIG operated a branch in Hamburg for Ashkenazim who could not obtain a residence permit in Hamburg and therefore formally had their place of residence in the liberal Holstein-Pinneberg Altona (belonging to Danish-ruled Holstein-Rendsburg from 1640). From 1671 to 1812, the HIG was the leading member of the Three Communities AHU (Altona, Hamburg, Wandsbek). It existed independently from 1812 to 1938 and then merged into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg.\nIn Wandsbek until 1938\nThe Israelite Community of Wandsbek (IGW) was founded in Wandsbek sometime between 1621 and 1650. From 1688 to 1812, the IGW maintained a branch in Hamburg for Ashkenazim who did not receive a residence permit in Hamburg and therefore formally took up residence in the liberal Danish-Holstein Wandsbek. The IGW was also a member of the Three Communities AHU (Altona, Hamburg, Wandsbek) from 1671 to 1812. It existed independently from 1812 to 1938 and then merged into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg.\nThe \"Three Communities of Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbek\" from 1671 to 1812\nIn 1671, the DIG, HIG and IGW founded a community alliance through a contract, the so-called Three Communities of Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbek (AHU). The umbrella organization provided services for all three communities and their respective branch communities. This included a joint religious court (Beth Din), joint cemeteries, hospitals and other facilities. Through the Napoleonic conquest of 1806 and the annexation of Hamburg as part of the First French Empire from 1811 to 1814, all residence of Hamburg, including Jews, gained French citizenship and thus equal civil rights. In the Empire, all Jewish communities were subject to the central Jewish Consistory of France. Therefore, the DIG had to abandon the community alliance with the n",

Through study at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Paris) she earned an agr\u00e9gation in mathematics in 1963. She completed a state doctorate in 1971, at the University of Grenoble. Her doctoral dissertation,  Numerical methods for calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a linear operator, was directed by No\u00ebl Gastinel.\nThe University of Grenoble split into three at the beginning of the 1970s (later re-merged into Grenoble Alpes University). Although her doctoral work was through the part focused on the sciences, which became known as Joseph Fourier University, from 1971 to 1984 she held a position as professor of applied mathematics in the part focused on the social sciences, the Universit\u00e9 des Sciences Sociales de Grenoble, later Universit\u00e9 Pierre Mend\u00e8s France. There, she directed the applied mathematics department of IMAG, the Institut d'informatique et math\u00e9matiques appliqu\u00e9es de Grenoble\u00a0, from 1977 to 1981, and was an associate director of IMAG. From 1982 to 1983 she directed the university research school (EUR) of economics at the Universit\u00e9 des Sciences Sociales de Grenoble. Next, she was briefly part of Paris Dauphine University, from 1984 to 1985.\nFrom 1985 to 1991 she left academia to work in industry, as a researcher in scientific computation for IBM in Paris. From 1992 to 1993 she headed the mathematics and computer science group at the research laboratory of Thomson-CSF.\nReturning to a position as professor of applied mathematics, she was affiliated again with Paris Dauphine University from 1993 to 1996, before moving to Toulouse Capitole University in 1996. During this time, she also headed the qualitative computing group at CERFACS, the Centre Europ\u00e9en de Recherche et de Formation Avanc\u00e9e en Calcul Scientifique in Toulouse. She retired as a professor emeritus in 2015.\nShe died on 14 May 2020. A conference in her honor was held in Toulouse in October 2021.\nBooks\nChatelin's books included:\nSpectral Approximation of Linear Operators (Academic Press, 1983; SIAM, Classics in Applied Mathematics 65, 2011; Chinese translation, Tianjin University Press, 1987)\nProblem Solving Environments for Scientific Computing (edited with B.

I have loved boxing since I was a little boy, when I would keep punching a boxing bag placed under a guava tree.\", Paras was also poor, earning only $10 per amateur bout, he also used to punch a boxing bag that is wrapped by a discarded tyre around a coconut tree, his speedballs are suspended in hard wood and his gloves are \"hand-me-own\" gloves, he also worked on odd-jobs including scavenging.\nHe went amateur and won several fights before catching the eyes and interests of the legendary coach/trainer Freddie Roach, who after seeing Paras hanging outside his ward's upmarket gym was amazed and took Paras in for a few training sessions, gave him some equipment, advised him to finish high school and get off the streets of General Santos.\nOn 13 June 2017, Roach with Pacquiao reunited with Paras whilst Pacquiao was training and Paras brought a smile to Roach's face after he showed him the WBO Asia Pacific Youth title he won recently and was congratulated.\nProfessional career\nMini flyweight\nDebut\n11 June 2015, Paras made his debut against compatriot and fellow debutant Romeo Garde at Robinson's Mall Atrium in General Santos where he finished Garde in the 1:31 mark of the first round.\nAfter a successful and gallant debut, on 23 August 2015, Paras defeated debutant Tony Pagunawan via 3rd round TKO, their weights were 109lbs(Paras) and 110lbs(Pagunawan).\nLight flyweight\nAfter reaching 2\u20130, Paras went to the Light flyweight division and defeated veteran Saddam Barambangan.\nParas vs. Haya\nAfter amassing a record of 10\u20130, Paras fought his first titled bout on 10 June 2017 at Mandaue, where he fought Jimboy Haya in a 10-rounder clash for the vacant WBO Asia Pacific Youth, although the belt was a minor title, it was significant for Paras, he won unanimously in all judges, with the ringside officials all scoring: 96\u201393.\nReturn to mini flyweight\nParas vs. Kyoguchi I\nAfter remaining undefeated, amassing a record of 13\u20130, Paras could possibly be Philippines' third youngest world champion at age of 19 years and 219 days old (Morris East being first at 19 years and 2 days old and Ben Villaflor being second at 19 years and 5 months old), as he took on eventual two-time world champion Hiroto Kyoguchi for his IBF mini flyweight title at Ota City General Gymnasium, Tokyo, Japan, however, Kyoguchi prevails unanimously scoring 117\u2013110 on all ringside officials' scorecards.\nReturn to light flyweight\nParas vs. Taconing\nIn an attempt to gain a world-title shot at light flyweight, Paras fought fellow world-ranked Filipino, #1 WBC ranked and experienced Jonathan Taconing for Taconing's WBC International light flyweight belt at Elorde Sports Complex on 22 September 2018, Taconing would prevail victorious with a dominant unanimous decision in an exciting no-quarters blow-by-blow 12-round clash.\nFlyweight\nSigned to Sanman Promotions\nPrior to the defeat against Taconing, Paras won against veterans Reymark Taday and Vincent Bautista, both via stoppage, both in 2019, in 2020, Paras was not able to fight due to COVID 19 pandemic, but in 2021, Sanman Promotions signed Vince Paras in a promotional deal.\nParas defeated Reymark Taday on their rematch on 5 February 2022, which was also Paras' first bout since his inactivity starting September 2019.\nParas vs. Paradero I\nOn 4 April 2022, Paras was set to battle WBA (Regular) and WBA (Super) mini flyweight title challenger Robert Paradero in a 110 pounds catchweight clash in Sanman Promotions' \"Bubble Series\" IX, their fight would be taking place on 26 April 2022, their clash ended in a split draw with judges scoring respectively: 96-94 Paradero, 98-92 Paras and 95-95 even, both of them posted their first draw of their careers respectively, both of them uninterested in a rematch.\nOn 24 August 2022, Paras took on Jovanie Tagusi and won via 1st round corner retirement.\nParas vs. Paradero II\nDespite both of them bowing to not have a rematch, they still made a rematch in 9 Oct 2022 at BF Homes Gym, Para\u00f1aque, Philippines for the vacant WBA Asia South Flyweight title, Paras won via unanimous decision.\nParas would fight Japanese prospect Ayumu Hanada on 13 May 2023 at Okada Manila and won via decision unanimously, after being announced as the winner, Paras made a unique move of hugging the round girl which turned into a nation-wide boxing clout.\nParas vs. Ishizawa\nIn 12 Oct 2023, Paras fought up-and-comer Japanese top-caliber Kai Ishizawa at Ariake Arena, Tokyo, P",
    "Genus of beetles\nPedinorrhina is a genus of fruit and flower chafers belonging to the family Scarabaeidae, subfamily Cetoniinae, found in Africa.\nTaxonomy\nPedinorrhina is one of a small set of closely-related African genera whose constituency is considered controversial, due to historical and ongoing discrepancies in treatment by various authorities.\nUp until 1984, taxonomists considered there to be six distinct genera in this group (Bothrorrhina Burmeister, Chondrorrhina Kraatz, Dyspilophora Kraatz, Pedinorrhina Kraatz, Plaesiorrhina Burmeister, and Taeniesthes Kraatz), but in 1984, Jan Krikken recognized that Burmeister's genus name Plaesiorrhina was a junior homonym and needed to be replaced. The name Plaesiorrhina had been published by John O. Westwood several months prior to Burmeister's publication, a fact that previous researchers had been unaware of, and Krikken renamed Burmeister's genus Plaesiorrhinella. At the same time, Krikken also recognized that the other Burmeister genus, Bothrorrhina, was a junior objective synonym of Westwood's resurrected genus Plaesiorrhina, necessitating a change in combination for all of the included species.\nIn 1994, Holm suggested a novel set of relationships, proposing that Krikken's genus Plaesiorrhinella (Burmeister's genus Plaesiorrhina) was a synonym of Pedinorrhina, while Dyspilophora and Taeniesthes were both synonyms of Chondrorrhina, and placing Chondrorrhina as a subgenus of Pedinorrhina. These changes reduced six genera down to only two: Pedinorrhina Kraatz, and Plaesiorrhina Westwood, with the latter having the same name as a previously recognized genus by a different author. Holm also treated six former species as new junior synonyms, so under his revised definition of Pedinorrhina, there were 16 species rather than 22.\nSubsequent authors have largely disagreed with Holm's classification, treating Chondrorrhina as a valid genus separate from Pedinorrhina, and placing Krikken's genus Plaesiorrhinella as a subgenus of Chondrorrhina (e.g.), thereby recognizing a total of three genera (Chondrorrhina Kraatz, Pedinorrhina Kraatz, and Plaesiorrhina Westwood). It is this classification, with these three genera, that has been adopted by the majority of recent researchers (e.g.), retaining Chondrorrhina as a genus distinct from Pedinorrhina. In this restricted sense, there are only seven species recognized within Pedinorrhina, and a number of the species that Holm had synonymized have been treated as valid, many no longer in Pedinorrhina.\nSpecies\nPedinorrhina cinctipennis Moser, 1913\nPedinorrhina cinctuta (Voet, 1779)\nPedinorrhina sellata ( Kraatz, 1880)\nPedinorrhina subaenea Harold, 1878\nPedinorrhina submarginata (Moser, 1913)\nPedinorrhina swanzyana Schaum, 1848\nPedinorrhina viridicollis Burgeon, 1932\n",
    "Israeli cosmetics company\nMoroccanoil is an Israeli cosmetics company headquartered in New York City, specializing in hair care products containing argan oil. The company was founded in 2008 in Montreal by Chilean-Canadian Carmen Tal and her Israeli then-husband Ofer Tal.\nHistory\nFoundation\nThe original business at the basis of Moroccanoil was started by Israeli brothers Mike and Erik Sabag in 2003, when Mike, a hairdresser, experimented the protective properties of argan oil, which was brought to them by their mother after a trip to her native Morocco. The two began selling the product to hair salons in the Tel Aviv area.\nCarmen Tal recounts having discovered the product when receiving a treatment in a salon in Tel Aviv, where she had travelled to attend her sister-in-law's wedding; Tal, whose hair had been damaged by an aggressive dye in her own salon in Montreal, observed a quick recovery following the repairing treatment. Her husband Ofer Tal contacted the manufacturer of the product and acquired distribution rights in North America. After the treatment proved commercially successful in America, the couple purchased the company in 2008 and moved production to a new plant in northern Israel.\nOperations\nAs of January\u00a02013, 80% of Moroccanoil's output is reportedly manufactured in its factory \"two hours north of Jerusalem\", with Ma'alot-Tarshiha being cited as the plant's location in the company's safety data sheets. The company has production facilities in Israel, Italy and Canada, as well as offices in Montreal (where it has its legal department), Rishon LeZion (where it is legally registered), Edgware, Frankfurt, Tokyo and formerly S\u00e3o Paulo.\nMoroccanoil publicly displays commitment to cruelty-free products and sustainability, with reduction of single-use plastic, prevention of soil contamination and groundwater pollution, partnerships with environmental and animal rights groups (including PETA, Oceana, Green Circle Salons, the Humane Society of the United States and the Sato Project), and its main production plant being solar-powered to prevent greenhouse gas emissions.\nMarketing\nMoroccanoil sells its products in over 85 countries worldwide, mostly business-to-business to beauty salons; however, more recently the company began expanding its sales directly to consumers, particularly in travel retails and duty-free shops. In addition, a number of celebrities (including Angelina Jolie, Brie Larson, Emily Blunt, Fergie, Iman, Jack Grealish, Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Biel, Jessica Simpson, Katy Perry, Lily Aldridge, Madonna and Margot Robbie) and fashion houses (including Badgley Mischka, Carolina Herrera and Roberto Cavalli) have been reported to use the company's products.\nMoroccanoil became the main sponsor (\"presenting partner\") of the Eurovision Song Contest following the 2019 edition in Tel Aviv, since when its \"team of world-class professional hairstylists\" has worked on the performers and hosts in the backstage, and the contest's red carpet event has been renamed \"turquoise carpet\" after the company's brand colour. The sponsorship was initially set to expire in 2024; however, shortly after the 2024 contest, the company suggested that it would continue to sponsor the event in 2025.\nCriticism\nMoroccanoil has been accused of lacking transparency over the exact location of its production facilities other than labelling its products as \"made in Israel\" or \"made in Canada\", with activists, including from the BDS movement and CJPME, calling to boycott the company over the possibility that it operates in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories while \"distracting\" consumers through a \"glamourous\" portrayal of its products. The \"Moroccan\" branding has also drawn criticism due to the company's lack of ties with Morocco, with accusations of deliberate cultural appropriation to pose as non-Israeli and avert boycotts.\n",

Zubiaurre. At stud, although he never led the Argentine general sire list, Seductor was on it fourteen times.\nSideral's dam Starling was unraced. She was a half-sister to Yorkshire Oaks winner Angelola, dam of Aureole, Yorkshire Oaks and Cesarewitch Handicap winner Above Board, 1000 Guineas winner Hypericum, Great Yorkshire Stakes winner Kingstone, and Knight's Daughter, dam of Round Table. Sideral was her second foal after the 1946 Embrujo filly Star Glow. Starling would go on to produce Sagitaria, the undefeated winner of the Gran Premio Saturnino J. Unzu\u00e9 and the Cl\u00e1sico Eliseo Ram\u00edrez, and Siderea, Argentine Champion Three-Year-Old Filly and winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n and Gran Premio Criadores, both also by Seductor and thus full siblings to Sideral.\nWhen Seductor was purchased from Caballeriza Buarque de Macedo by Haras Chapadmalal, an agreement was made that Buarque de Macedo would be able to pick among Seductor's yearling colts, and he chose Sideral due to his early promise.\nSideral was a nervous horse with high energy levels.\nSideral stood 16.2 hands tall. John Aiscan in the British Racehorse described Sideral as \"impressive looking and very masculine. In his conformation we can detect some fine qualities inherited from his dam. He had strong hocks which he transmitted to his progeny. A prepotent sire, the majority of his progeny bore a close resemblance to him.\" He is also noted to have a great shoulder and hip and to have been well-balanced.\nRace career\nSideral won all three of his starts as a three-year-old.\nAs a four-year-old, Sideral won five of his seven starts. In 1952, he won Cl\u00e1sico Comparaci\u00f3n, Cl\u00e1sico Estados Unidos de Brasil, and Cl\u00e1sico Am\u00e9rica, and ran second in the Cl\u00e1sico General Pueyrred\u00f3n. He was also second to Branding in the Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini. In 1953, he was second in the Gran Premio Miguel Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz and ran second to Yatasto in the Gran Premio de Honor.\nAs a five-year-old, he won one of his four starts, as well as second twice and third once.\nStud career\nSideral entered stud in 1954, standing alternatively at Haras Chapadmalal, Haras Comalal, and Haras Malal Hue during his career.\nHe led the Argentine general sire list three times, in 1963, 1966, and 1967, along with ranking second in 1959, 1960, and 1961, and third in 1965. He was also fourth in 1962 and tenth in 1968. Sideral was the leading broodmare sire in Argentina six times, in 1967, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1975, along with finishing second in 1974 and third in 1968 and 1976.\nIn 1980, Sideral ranked on the Leading Sire's Sires list for worldwide sales, with fifteen broodmare sold for a gross of $494,100, one stallion sold for $7,500, and a total of 26 horses sold for a gross of $539,000.\nSideral was noted for stamping his progeny with both his physical appearance and his high-strung temperament.\nVictorica Roca, leading Argentine breeder and owner of Haras Ojo de Agua, disliked Sideral as a sire, considering him to produce just winners rather than horses for the classics.\nIn the Roman-Miller dosage system, Sideral is considered a Classic Chef-de-race.\nSideral died in 1974 at Haras Comalal.\nNotable progeny\nPasion, Argentine Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n, Gran Premio Polla de Potrancas, Gran Premio Ignacio Correas, etc.\nSensitivo, winner of the Gran Premio Miguel Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz, Cl\u00e1sico Chacabuco, Display Handicap, and Gallant Fox Handicap; notable sire in the United States\nEl Centauro, Argentine Champion Three-Year-Old Colt, winner of the Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini, Gran Premio de Honor, and Gran Premio General Belgrano; notable sire in Argentina\nProposal, stakes placed racer and notable sire in Chile\nPensilvania, Venezuelan Champion Older Mare, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n, Gran Premio Jorge Atucha, Gran Premio Ignacio Correas, etc.\nRibereno, Argentine Champion Three-Year-Old Colt, winner of the Gran Premio Nacional, Grande Pr\u00eamio Internacional Darda Rocha, etc.\nSweet Sue, Argentine Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, winner of the Gran Premio Polla de Potrancas, Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n, Gran Premio Miguel Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz, Gran Premio Ignacio Correas, etc.\nBagdad, Uruguayan Champion Three-Year-Old Colt, winner of the Gran Premio Nacional; notable sire in Uruguay\nLady Silver, Argentine Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, winner of the Gran Premio Polla de Potrancas\nTroubadour, winner of the Gran Premio Nacional; notab",

    "American pharmacologist and professor (1890\u20131971)\nHelen Tredway Graham (July 21, 1890 \u2013 April 4, 1971) was an American pharmacologist known for her research contributions in pharmacology and her active involvement in social causes. She earned her academic degrees from Bryn Mawr College and the University of Chicago before marrying physician Evarts Graham in 1916. Despite societal expectations, Graham pursued a successful career in pharmacology while raising two children. Her research focused on histamine and peripheral nerve cells, yielding several scientific publications. Graham also engaged in social activism, particularly in advocating against air pollution and promoting education.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nHelen Tredway Graham was born on July 21, 1890, in Dubuque, Iowa, to Harry Ennis Tredway, a merchant, and Marian McConnell. She pursued higher education at Bryn Mawr College, where she graduated with both a B.S. and an M.A. in chemistry. Graham furthered her studies in Germany before obtaining her Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1915.\nCareer and family life\nIn 1916, Graham married physician Evarts Graham, and the couple had two children. Despite societal expectations at the time, Graham balanced her family responsibilities with a successful career in pharmacology. During World War I, while her husband served overseas, Graham worked as an assistant in pharmacology at Johns Hopkins University. After the war, the couple settled in St. Louis, where Evarts had a position at Washington University Medical School.\nScientific contributions\nGraham returned to the laboratory in 1926 as an instructor in the pharmacology department at Washington University Medical School. She conducted research alongside Nobel Prize winner Herbert Gasser, focusing on the physiology and pharmacology of peripheral nerve cells. Graham steadily advanced through the academic ranks, becoming an assistant professor in 1931 and an associate professor in 1937. Graham was appointed as a full professor of pharmacy in 1954.\nSocial activism and later life\nOutside of her scientific pursuits, Graham was involved in various social causes, including participating in the movement against air pollution in St. Louis, helping establish the Junior College District of St. Louis, and serving as a trustee of Bryn Mawr College and the Community School in St. Louis. She also contributed to civic causes, serving as president of the St. Louis League of Women Voters and sitting on the city's board of freeholders.\nFollowing the passing of her husband in 1957 due to lung cancer, Graham continued her contributions to scientific research and social activism. She was promoted to emeritus professor in 1958 but remained active in her scientific pursuits and social causes until her death in 1971.\n",

    "Not to be confused with Jare (rapper).\nJar\u00ea is a religious practice of African origin found exclusively in the Chapada Diamantina region, in the central region of the Brazilian state of Bahia, especially among the descendants of Africans from the Len\u00e7\u00f3is region. It is characterized as a less orthodox branch of Candombl\u00e9, forming an amalgam resulting from a process of fusion involving elements of the Bantu and Nag\u00f4 nations, to which aspects of Candombl\u00e9 are added.\nIt is characterized as a less orthodox branch of candombl\u00e9, forming an amalgam resulting from a fusion process that involves elements of the Bantu and Nag\u00f4 cults, to which are added aspects of rural Catholicism, Umbanda and Kardecist spiritism.\nEtymology\nJar\u00ea is probably a term of Yoruba origin meaning \u201calmost falling to the ground\u201d or \u201ccutting through\u201d. Another possibility is that it is a corruption of \u201cnjale\u201d, a word that referred to a ceremony performed by the inhabitants of present-day Nigeria and Benin. The term jar\u00ea is used both to designate religion in general and to refer to its various ritualistic occasions.\nEmergence and development\nAt least in terms of evidence, it can be said that it emerged and consolidated in the interior of Bahia, specifically in the towns of Len\u00e7\u00f3is and Andara\u00ed in the Chapada Diamantina region, in the mid-19th century. Its emergence is linked to the development of mining in this region, which was marked by a considerable influx of slave labor, an element that was compounded by the presence of Africans since the end of the 18th century in what is now the town of Andara\u00ed, which at the time was a quilombo. From these towns, jar\u00ea spread to nearby areas that didn't have diamonds and were marked by peasant agriculture. This process of expansion led to changes in the way the cult was performed. As a result, it can be seen that the jar\u00ea in mining areas, performed by the mining population with origins marked by slavery, favored practices of worshipping entities that referred to African ancestry. On the other hand, its expansion into non-mining areas shows practices more closely linked to popular Catholicism, with an emphasis on healing rituals.\nReconstructing the history of the Nag\u00f4s and the emergence of the jar\u00ea depends largely on oral history accounts, since this religion of African origin was often confronted by the powers that be, suffering brutal police persecution and curtailment by the Catholic Church. It is not possible to guarantee that the current decline in the number of Jar\u00ea houses of worship is due to these factors, notwithstanding the socio-economic transformations that the region has undergone and which have affected many of its spheres. However, it is undeniable that in the fairly recent past the houses of worship at the headquarters of a single town like Len\u00e7\u00f3is could be counted in their dozens, while today there must be less than half that number, several of them buildings a few kilometers away from the town center. Despite all the difficulties encountered in keeping this religion alive, it is still possible to identify numerous jar\u00ea terreiros in the Chapada Diamantina, and it is possible to see that many followers continue to practice it.\nCharacteristics\nA religious practice developed mainly by enslaved and freed people - from the towns of Cachoeira and S\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, both in the state of Bahia - who were brought to the Chapada Diamantina region as a result of mining activities, settling in towns such as Len\u00e7\u00f3is and Andara\u00ed between the 18th and 19th centuries. This is where the so-called jar\u00ea de nag\u00f4 cult began, in which the orix\u00e1s, African deities, were worshipped exclusively. However, given the coexistence with descendants of indigenous people who inhabited the region, little by little certain entities representing indigenous culture were incorporated into the jar\u00ea, outlining its current form, which is therefore marked by Afro-indigenous cultural dialogues. In this circuit, it is a religious practice marked by the syncretism of different cultural elements, including aspects of African cults, Catholicism and Kardecist spiritism. Jar\u00ea is a term that covers a large number of beliefs, cults and rituals with diverse characteristics, developed according to the needs and convenience of the practitioners.\nCeremonies\nIn general, the ritual procedures are known by large segments of the population and the festivities are attended by adults, young people and children. The duration of the ceremonies varies, but it is unusual for them to last less than five hours or more than ten hours in a row on the same day. They can last for more than a day, but at present it is not common for them to last for more than three consecutive days. In celebrations, people who are sensitive to receiving entities can receive (incorporate) several entities, so in a celebration with a large number of participants it is possible for up to a hundred different incorporations to take place.\nTrabalhos and revistas\nTrabalhos and revistas are the mai",

    "Species of siphonophore\nPraya reticulata is a species of siphonophore in the family Prayidae. It has a distinctive net of radial canals that make up its central cavity, a distinctive somatocyst that sharply doubles back, and asymmetrical canals on its bracts. The species was described by Henry Bryant Bigelow following its discovery during an expedition of the USS Albatross. The specific epithet reticulata is Latin, and comes from the word reticulatus which means \"net-like\". In Chinese the species is called \u7db2\u7ba1\u5e15\u814a\u6c34\u6bcd, which can be Romanized as w\u01cenggu\u01cen p\u00e0 l\u00e0 shu\u01d0m\u01d4.\nDescription\nA colony of Praya reticulata can grow up to 100 centimetres (39\u00a0in) long. The nectophores that propel the siphonophore are apparent, with a size of roughly 5.5 cm in length and 2.0 cm in diameter, and extend past the base of the underside below the opening of the central cavity. The central cavity is made up of many radial canals that have numerous anastomoses and create a net-like or mesh-like pattern. There is a deep canal that runs along the length of the underside of the hydroecium, which may or may not be covered by flaps.\nThe somatocyst is one of the most distinctive features of P. reticulata. Its upper portion runs towards the front of the siphonophore, then sharply doubles back towards the rear. Lateral trunks branch off this portion, which sometimes branch out further at their ends. The bracts have unusually asymmetric canals, with the canal on the right side being much longer than the one on the left. The stems and bracts of P. reticulata seem to lack any swimming bell. Gonophores of females of the species are up to 1.3 cm long, while those of males are only 0.7 mm long. Both sexes have gonophores with an arrangement of branches that is unique among the Prayids, with three branches reaching outwards from the apex of the gonophore. The tentilla of the species lack the mouthless siphons and tentacles present in some other siphonophores.\nPraya reticulata is most similar in appearance to Praya dubia. It can be told apart by its radial canals that create a mesh-like pattern,  as opposed to the bifurcating canals of P. dubia. It also has a somewhat smaller central sac than P. dubia.\nHistory\nDuring the USS Albatross scientific expedition in 1904\u20131905 to the Pacific Ocean, marine biologist Henry Bryant Bigelow was in charge of siphonophore collection and recording. He described several new species including Nectodroma reticulata in 1911, based on several collected nectophores and bracts. Bigelow created the new genus Nectodroma in order to contain this new species, as well as a related Prayid called Praya dubia. However, he later recognized that because P. dubia was the type species of Praya, it could not be moved into his new genus. He therefore affirmed this typification, and moved N. reticulata into Praya, giving its currently accepted name Praya reticulata.\nSeveral times in the 2000s, colonies of Praya reticulata were observed using the DeepSee submersible. It is the only species of Praya to be positively identified this way because of the distinct appearance of its nectophores.\nDistribution, habitat, and ecology\nPraya reticulata is found in the pelagic zone of warmer, subtropical waters with high salinity, such as the Kuroshio extension off the coast of Japan. Specimens have been collected globally, and Praya reticulata has a cosmopolitan distribution, excluding the Mediterranean Sea. It is found at a 3.5 times greater density in the summer than in the fall.\nDespite fish\u2013siphonophore interactions being generally rare, Praya reticulata has been spotted in association with a fish of the genus Paracaristius. In the association observed in 2010, a juvenile fish took shelter around the siphonophore, and likely attained prey by stealing from the siphonophore.\n",

    "\nKomatsu Hiroko (\u5c0f\u677e\u6d69\u5b50) is a Japanese artist and photographer. She was born in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan in 1969. She has held exhibitions both domestically in Japan and internationally in countries such as Germany, Italy, and the United States. She received the 43rd Kimura Ihei Award for new photographers in 2018. She has also received a grant from the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission.\nKomatsu started her creative career as an experimental noise artist and only picked up photography in the mid-2000s after participating in a darkroom workshop. Due to her late introduction into the medium, she felt that she needed to \u2018catch up\u2019 to other photographers and rented a space in Tokyo and began to produce one new exhibition every month from 2010 to 2011. This ambitious exhibition project was titled Broiler Space, and it was in this highly self-motivated rapid-fire production environment and its spatial limitations that Komatsu started to experiment with exhibit photographs in non-traditional experimental ways and developed into mixed media installations.\nInstallation Style and Development\nKomatsu Hiroko has established herself through her singular experimental installations which utilize a magnitude of photographs more than traditional photography exhibitions. Where traditional photograph exhibitions present framed photographs spaced out in even intervals throughout the exhibition space, Komatsu plasters unframed black-and-white photographs across the walls, hangs them from the ceilings and spreads them over the floors so viewers must tread upon her photographs to access the exhibition space. In an example of the scale that she often works in, for a workshop with University of Hartford students, she developed 18 black-and-white photographs on a 50-foot roll of photographic paper.\nIn another example of her non-traditional installations for her exhibition at the gallery dieFirma in New York City in October 2021, visitors were enveloped by countless photographs exhibited on the walls like wallpaper and even on the floor, which the visitors had to tread upon to enter the exhibition space. Komatsu states that many of the photographs of industrial sites for this exhibition were taken during the COVID-19 pandemic which coincided with a construction boom in Japan leading up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The pandemic caused many projects to halt their construction, which allowed Komatsu to take many of her photographs of empty construction sites which she calls, \u201cshiny ruins.\u201d In an interview with photography curator Pauline Vermare, Komatsu describes how it is difficult to discern if these sites are in the process of construction or demolishment. She states that she was attracted to these sites not only because they were sites of construction for the country's infrastructure, but also because the working class human labor involved in the construction of such sites were a part of human infrastructure on which society is built.\nIn 2021, MEM Gallery in Ebisu, Tokyo held an exhibition, Silent Sound, that exemplifies her non-traditional installations. Komatsu filmed three live music performances and projected these films simultaenously using three different super 8 projectors. The film passed through these projectors cut dynamically through the exhibition space going through a pulley system. Although the moving images were not acompanied by any sound, the exhibition space was filled with the sound of the film moving through the super 8 projector. In an adjacent room, Komatsu exhibited her \"photographic sculptures\" which were sheets of printed images and a DVD wrapped in plastic. For the exhibition art critic Umezu Gen contributed an essay explaining the connection between Komatsu's work and his own. \nArt Objects\nKomatsu is known for her handmade objects which go far beyond the conventional format of the photobook. For example Black Book #1 (2021) is a bottle that is filled with little pieces of cut-out paper from texts such as Greta Thunberg\u2019s book No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference and Theodore Kaczynski\u2019s Industrial Society and Its Future: The Unabomber Manifesto. She chose this format because she felt the conventional forms of photobooks that catalogue a curated selection of photographs was not sufficient to capture her installation. This format of cutting texts from a book and putting them into a bottle was also inspired by her conception of photographs as text. For Komatsu, a single photograph is like a single word in that it does not provide enough context to be understood; it is only though stringing them together that meaning can be discerned. Building on this idea, she states, \u201cAlso, when you take a picture, you frame a part of reality, and then you move the image to another place, such as an exhibition venue or bookstore. I thought the process was very similar to cutting out texts from a book and putting them into an object, in this installation, a bottle.\u201d \nCritical Reception\nIn Komatsu's monograph, Creative Dest",

    "Fictional character\nFictional character\nDamian Hubbard (or Damian Leigh in the original film) is a fictional character from the Mean Girls franchise. He was portrayed by actors Daniel Franzese, Grey Henson, and Jaquel Spivey in the original film (2004), 2017 musical and its subsequent film adaptation in 2024, respectively. \nDescription\nThe character Damian has appeared in the film Mean Girls (2004) and subsequent adaptations. He is the gay best friend of Janis Ian who is described within the franchise as \"too gay to function\". He has also been called sarcastic. Dessi Gomez of TheWrap has said Damian \"stands by Janis' side through thick and thin, as she does with him. He manages to be in on all the girl drama just as much as guy drama around North Shore High. His talents, as showcased in the winter talent show, will take him far.\"\nRoles and portrayals\nSocial outcasts Damian and Janis teach new student Cady Heron about various cliques at the school and caution her about the \"Plastics\"\u2014Regina George, Gretchen Wieners, and Karen Smith.\n2004 film\nDaniel Franzese (pictured at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2022) played Damian in the original film (2004).In the original film (2004), Damian is played by American actor Daniel Franzese. He sings \"Beautiful\" (2002) by Christina Aguilera during the talent show. After someone in the audience throws a shoe at him, Damian throws it back. He wears a blue hoodie and black sunglasses as an \"incognito\" look. In Business Insider's 2022 list of the \"most iconic\" outfits from the film, Arielle Tschinkel said the look is \"not the most fashionable\" but \"still iconic\". Billie Walker of Digital Spy said Damian's \"catty one liners can still be recited by millennials everywhere\", but \"still failed in its queer representation\".\nAccording to Franzese, he was asked to reprise the role for the music video to Ariana Grande's \"Thank U, Next\" (2018), but he was unable to participate because of a schedule conflict.\nMusical\nGrey Henson (left) and Jaquel Spivey (right) played Damian in the musical and its 2024 film adaptation, respectively.\nUnlike the original film, Damian brings a male partner to the dance in the musical and 2024 film adaptation.\nOn stage, Damian has been played by Grey Henson, Eric Huffman, and Ethan Jih-Cook.\n2024 film adaptation\nIn a review of the 2024 film, in which Damian is portrayed by Jaquel Spivey, Andr\u00e9 Hereford of Metro Weekly said Damian and Janis \"are the ringmasters, narrating the entire story\" of the production.

    "German writer and historian (1819\u20131901)\nJohann Friedrich Gerhard Roeber (19 June 1819 \u2013 12 October 1901) was a German writer and historian who participated in literary circles in Elberfeld and Wuppertal, in Germany.\nLife\nJohann Friedrich Gerhard Roeber was born on 19 June 1819 in Elberfeld, Germany\u2014the son of a woodturner, he attended the Elberfeld secondary school. In 1834, he began an apprenticeship at the Bankhaus von der Heydt-Kersten & S\u00f6hne\u00a0 (a credit bank). There he became a clerk, received power of attorney, and in 1872 became a partner. He left the company in 1879 and moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in 1894.\nIn the early 1840s, he participated in an Elberfeld literary circle, which included, among others, Adolf Schults, Carl de Haas\u00a0, and Friedrich Engels. He later distanced himself from Engels, in 1886. In 1847, he married Maria Wilhelmine Elise (n\u00e9e Kretzmann). At this time, he became known as a playwright, novelist, and historian.\nRoeber served as the Procurator for Elberfeld at some point.\nIn the early 1850s, Roeber was a member of the Wuppertal poets' circle (Wuppertaler Dichterkreis). When this dissolved, a Sunday circle (Sonntagskr\u00e4nzchen) was formed, meeting at Roeber's house and consisting of poetry recitations, music and discussions\u2014the formation of which was described by Carl Siebel in a letter to Wolfgang M\u00fcller von K\u00f6nigswinter in June 1853:\nThe founding of a poets' association  has recently been projected by Roeber, Schults, and myself\u2014starting from the idea that all elasticity of the mind is formed purely through the exchange of ideas\u2014we planned to meet every 4 weeks or 14 days to discuss set topics. Each person should draw their acquaintances as corresponding members, thus aiming for the greatest possible expansion gradually.\nBetween 1860 and 1864, he distinguished himself with publications in the literary journal Morgenblatt f\u00fcr gebildete Leser.  A year and a half before his death, Roeber suffered a stroke. In a moment of mental confusion, he burned numerous letters from Schults and de Haas to him.\nHe died on 12 October 1901 in D\u00fcsseldorf. Five years after his death, a monument was erected to him on Carnapsplatz in the Elberfeld Nordstadt (later destroyed in World War II).

    "Poem by Rainer Maria Rilke\nThe Miletus torso (c. 480\u2013470 BC) at the Louvre has been suggested as the poem's subject.\n\"Archaic Torso of Apollo\" (German: Archa\u00efscher Torso Apollos) is a sonnet by the Austrian writer Rainer Maria Rilke, published in the collection New Poems in 1908. It opens the collection's second part and is a companion piece to \"Early Apollo\", which opens the first part. The poem describes the impressions given by the surviving torso of an archaic statue, which for the poet creates a vision of what the intact statue must have been like.\nSummary\n\"Archaic Torso of Apollo\" is a sonnet with the rhyme scheme AbbA CddC EEf GfG. It is an ekphrasis\u2014a rhetorical genre from ancient Greece that describes inanimate objects\u2014of an archaic Greek sculpture of Apollo, of which only the torso and crotch area survive. The poem argues that although the head is missing, the characteristics of the remaining body give an impression of what the complete statue must have been like. The impression creates a sense of being observed and a need to change one's own life.\nPublication\nRainer Maria Rilke's poetry collection New Poems was published in two parts in 1907 and 1908. The first part opens with \"Early Apollo\" (German: Fr\u00fcher Apollo) and the second with \"Archaic Torso of Apollo\". Other English titles include \"Torso of an Archaic Apollo\" and \"Apollo's Archaic Torso\".\nAnalysis and reception\nRilke had discussed the relationship between the fragment and the whole in prose texts, notably in reference to the sculptures of Auguste Rodin, writing that \"Rodin knows that the body consists of so many stages for the display of life...and he has the power to bestow on any part..the independence and completeness of a whole\". Part two of New Poems contains a dedication to Rodin, right before \"Archaic Torso of Apollo\", and the poem has been interpreted as a tribute to Rodin.\n\"Early Apollo\" and \"Archaic Torso of Apollo\" function as companion pieces through their roles as opening poems, descriptions of Apollo statues and thematic similarities. The scholar Charlie Louth writes that their respective adjectives are complementary, where \"early\" becomes a promise about the poetry that will follow, and \"archaic\" refers to a restoration of something original and complete, which Louth writes that the poem achieves despite the fragmentary state of the statue that inspired it. According to Louth, \"Early Apollo\" creates anticipation and \"Archaic Torso of Apollo\" demands that the reader contributes to a new beginning that can match the poem's achievement of fullness, as expressed in its final sentence: \"you must change your life\".\nDu mu\u00dft dein Leben \u00e4ndern (you must change your life) on a banner at the Theater Freiburg in 2009\nThe philosopher Peter Sloterdijk used the final line of \"Archaic Torso of Apollo\" in the title of his book You Must Change Your Life, published in 2009. According to Sloterdijk, the line expresses the \"absolute imperative\u2014the quintessential metanoetic command\".\nIt is not known for certain what statue Rilke thought of when he wrote \"Archaic Torso of Apollo\". The archaeologist Ulrich Hausmann\u00a0 argued in 1947 that the poem's subject was the Miletus torso (c. 480\u2013470 BC), a sculpture of a young man at the Louvre. The literary scholar Paul B\u00f6ckmann\u00a0 argued that this is improbable and suggested other possibilities.\n",

    "Former lifeboat station in Anglesey, Wales\nRhosneigr Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station located in the village of Rhosneigr on the west coast of the Isle of Anglesey, Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1872, following a series of shipwrecks in Rhosneigr Bay.\nWith just 7 launches and 2 lives saved in the previous 20 years, the Rhosneigr Lifeboat Station was closed in 1924.\nHistory\nThe RNLI agreed to open an additional lifeboat station at Rhosneigr in 1872. A 30-foot 10-oared self-righting lifeboat was ordered, and a boathouse was constructed, costing \u00a3254-5s-0d. A gift of \u00a3600, made to the RNLI from a Mrs Lingham, in memory of her late husband, was allocated to the station. On 19 September 1872, the station was formally opened, and Mrs Lingham named the lifeboat Thomas Lingham.\nAn extraordinary rescue took place on 30 March 1883. Called to the aid of the vessel Norman Court of Greenock, the Rhosneigr lifeboat was beaten by the conditions, and also lost a crew member when he was washed overboard. The Holyhead lifeboat was towed to the scene by steam tug, but they too failed to reach the wreck, returning to Holyhead. The Rocket Brigade then failed to get a line to the wreck. The Rhosneigr crew launched once more, only to be beaten by the conditions again, returning to station absolutely exhausted.\nA request was made for a replacement crew from Holyhead, with the Holyhead railway company arranging an engine to transport the crew. This time, the Holyhead crew in the Rhosneigr boat were successful, and 20 men were rescued from the Norman Court. Holyhead coxswain Thomas Roberts received the RNLI Silver Medal.\nA tragedy struck Rhosneigr on 28 December 1894, when a young man was run over by the lifeboat carriage during the launch. No effective service was carried out, and William Roberts died of his injuries a few days later.\nThere would be four lifeboats stationed at Rhosneigr between 1872 and 1924, and all retained the name Thomas Lingham. In 1897, Thomas Lingham (ON 277) was called to the aid of the Ann Jane of Portmadoc, in Cymyran Bay. The 3\u00bd ton lifeboat was pulled 3 miles along sand and through a river to reach a launching point, but managed to rescue the 5 crew and 1 passenger. When the lifeboat was replaced in 1904, the lighter 34-foot Self-righting (Rubie) lifeboat was provided, the Thomas Lingham (ON 533), weighing just 2 tons 6 cwts.\nRhosneigr had been a relatively busy station when it first opened, with 45 lives saved in 13 years, 10 lives saved in 1890, and 13 rescued in the following 13 years. But calls and rescues had dramatically reduced in the early 1900s,and the decision was made to close Rhosneigr Lifeboat Station in 1924. The boathouse still stands, and is currently a boathouse / store. The Thomas Lingham (ON 533) was transferred to the relief fleet until being sold in 1937. The boat is currently with Holyhead Maritime Museum for restoration.\nBlackburn Botha Crash 1941\nOn 28 August 1941, an RAF Blackburn Botha with 3 aboard, crashed into the sea off Rhosneigr, in gale force conditions and particularly rough seas. With no lifeboat at Rhosneigr, and with the Holyhead lifeboat away for repairs, the nearest lifeboat was 2 hours away at Porthdinllaen.\nStewart Wood and Derrick Baynham, both aged 17, set out in a small dinghy to effect a rescue. They reached the plane, taking the pilot on board, but then their dinghy capsized, and the two boys were lucky to survive. Nine men launched a boat to the rescue, but that too was capsized. Some people who tried to swim out to the aircraft were also drowned. In all, 11 men died trying to save the three airmen, who all perished.\nThe following awards were made:\nGeorge Medal\nRNLI Silver Medal\nCigarette case, awarded by General Sikorski, Commander of Polish forces.\nDerek Hubert Baynham, Schoolboy\nJohn Leslie Stewart Wood, Schoolboy\nRNLI Bronze Medal\nC.

    "Irish journalist and lottery broker\nJohn Magee (died November 1809) was an Irish journalist and lottery broker.\nBiography\nMagee became proprietor and printer in Dublin of \u2018Magee's Weekly Packet\u2019 in 1777, and of the \u2018Dublin Evening Post\u2019 at the beginning of 1779. Both papers were printed at 20 Dame Street. From the first these journals, and especially the \u2018Evening Post,\u2019 opposed the government measures, and showed whig sympathies, but during 1789 the proprietor's name became particularly prominent on account of a series of attacks made on the notorious Francis Higgins, a journalist in the government pay, and on other persons, among whom was John Scott, Lord Earlsfort, afterwards Earl of Clonmell, chief justice of the king's bench, Higgins's personal friend. Magee also charged Richard Daly, patentee and manager of the Crow Street Theatre, with tricking the former patentee out of his patent and with making money, in conjunction with Higgins, by dishonest means. Reflections on the character of Thomas Brennan, at that time on the staff of the \u2018Freeman's Journal,\u2019 but formerly a writer in Magee's own employ, and on a lady named Tracey, who was a ward of Higgins, and then lived with her aunt in Brennan's house at Kilmacud, appeared at the same time in the \u2018Dublin Evening Post.\u2019 On the affidavits of these persons fiats were issued by Lord Earlsfort in June requiring Magee to find bail to the amount of 7,800l., pending actions for libel. This he was unable to do, especially as it was requisite that the sureties should declare themselves worth twice the amount of the bail. He was consequently confined in a spunging-house. He continued while in confinement to conduct his newspapers, and Nicholas Lawless, first lord Cloncurry, sought to alleviate the hardships of his imprisonment.\nOn 3 July 1789 the trial of Magee for the libel on Higgins began before Lord Earlsfort. Magee was not present at the opening, a habeas corpus having been refused, and he was unrepresented by counsel. An order to bring up the body of defendant was, however, at length granted by the chief justice; but Magee, when he arrived, protested against the empanelling of the jury and the opening of the trial in his absence, and, refusing to plead, was at his own request ordered back into custody. No defence was offered. But Arthur Browne and other lawyers in court protested against the excessive fiats as unconstitutional (Browne, Arguments before King's Bench on admitting John Magee to Common Bail, 1790). Magee's charges were in popular opinion well founded. The jury at first brought in a verdict of \u2018guilty of printing and publishing,\u2019 but were sent back by the chief justice, and then returned a general verdict of guilty. Lord Earlsfort, who refused them a copy of the record, declared that \u2018had they given any other verdict they would have acted in a manner shameful to themselves and disgraceful to their country.\u2019 No good report of the trial is in existence. On his conviction he was set at liberty pending the pronouncement of his sentence. On 10 July 1789 the Dublin Volunteers passed a resolution approving \u2018the firm conduct of our worthy fellow-citizen in a late transaction,\u2019 and Hamilton Rowan wrote to Magee in his confinement offering to subscribe twenty-five guineas to a public subscription which it was proposed to raise in his behalf. Magee, however, refused to accept anything. On 30 July, Brennan, one of the men libelled by Magee, entered Magee's house and destroyed the furniture. He was arrested and tried on sworn information, but was acquitted.\nMeanwhile, Magee continued to lampoon Higgins and Lord Clonmell, and the \u2018Freeman's Journal,\u2019 which belonged to Higgins, replied with equal scurrility. To revenge himself upon the lord chief justice he arranged for Lammas day, in honour of the Prince of Wales's birthday, what he called a \u2018Bra Pleasura\u2019 in a field adjoining Lord Clonmell's house at Dunleary, or \u2018Fiat Hill.\u2019 Lord Cloncurry was an eye-witness, and an account is also given by Sir Jonah Barrington. A mob of several thousands assembled. A derisive programme of sports was performed. Dogs danced in barristers' uniforms, and asses raced with jockeys in wigs; and finally, in an \u2018Olympic pig-hunt,\u2019 the people followed the animals into Lord Clonmell's grounds and did much damage. The \u2018Dublin Evening Post\u2019 of 25 August announced an adjournment of further proceedings to 7 Sept., pending the arrival of the chief justice. On 27 August it declared that \u2018there would be thirty thousand men at Dunleary.\u2019 The chief justice, according to an informant of Fitzpatrick, in great alarm implored the viceroy to summon the privy council and obtain a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. The result was that Magee was arrested on 3 September by a warrant of Sir Samuel Bradstreet, judge of the king's bench, and, being unable to give heavy bail to keep the peace for five years, was committed to Newgate. On 29 October he was liberated in bail for 4,000l. On 3 October a petitio",

    "Judges, constables, and lay judges gathered outside the courthouse of the Western Hundred Court, Komstad, Sm\u00e5land\nThe assize courts of Sweden (Swedish: H\u00e4radsr\u00e4tt) were public courts in rural areas and in several cities, which were under county law (landsr\u00e4tt), until the judicial reform of 1971, when district courts were introduced both in rural areas and in cities. The assize court consisted of a district judge (h\u00e4radsh\u00f6vding) and a panel. In order for the assize court to have jurisdiction, usually at least seven lay judges had to be present in court. The panel participated in the adjudication of cases in their entirety. Each assize court had a fixed courthouse, usually located within its jurisdiction (judicial district), where the district court convened.\nHistory\nSweden\nAssizes existed in G\u00f6taland already before the mid-14th century and were introduced in Svealand through Magnus IV's national law. At the assize court, which was the public lower court in rural areas, a panel consisting of the district judge (h\u00e4radsh\u00f6vding) and twelve members (farmers) residing within the hundred judged in the first instance. To render a judgment at the assize court, it was required that at least seven of the panel members were present. Before 1823, the lay judges were appointed by the senior juryman (h\u00e4radsdomare). Starting from 1823, farmers were granted the right to vote at the socken meeting. The assize courts convened for sessions called thing, where legal and other issues common to the people were decided. There should be one assize court for each tithing. In 1909, the number of assize courts was 223, namely, 126 under the Svea Court of Appeal, 79 under the G\u00f6ta Court of Appeal, and 18 under the Scania and Blekinge Court of Appeal. Each assize court was required to hold regular meetings, called ordinary session (general meetings), and also special meetings, called extraordinary session (urtima ting, special or extra meetings), for certain specific cases.\nAccording to the law of 1734, the district judge in each hundred was required to hold court three times a year: the first time in winter, the second time in summer, and the third time in autumn. The court terms were announced to the county governor and proclaimed from all pulpits. If any serious crimes occurred between the regular court terms, an extraordinary court session was called. However, according to specific regulations, the number of court sessions could be reduced according to the needs of different areas; nevertheless, a regular assize court session was always to be held annually in each hundred. By royal ordinance on 17 May 1872, a more continuous operation was prescribed for some assize courts. According to the new organization, which actually applied to judicial districts consisting of one or two tithings, but which could also be prescribed for one or another individual tithing in districts with several tithings upon reconsideration by King in Council, the number of regular court sessions in each tithing was indeed limited to two (spring session and autumn session); however, many more legal proceedings were gained, as in tithings that alone formed a judicial district, the assize court was to hold six sessions during the spring session and four during the autumn session, and in tithings that, together with another, formed a judicial district, the court was to sit in each tithing three times during the spring session and twice during the autumn session; in addition, so-called final sessions could and were usually held, meaning sessions to conclude court matters. Appeals against the assize court judgments were made to the court of appeal.\nIn 1935, regulations were issued stating that assize courts should hold several regular sessions per year. Finally, in the Code of Judicial Procedure of 1942, it was prescribed that assize courts should hold session once a week. the assize courts were replaced from 1971 onwards by district courts serving as the ordinary courts of first instance.\nFinland\nIn Finland, by imperial decree of 27 April 1868, the provision that the members of the jury shall be 12 is repealed and the number of lay judges reduced from 7 to 5. The court convenes annually for 2 regular sessions, except in the \u00c5land judicial district, where only one session is held annually. Extraordinary sessions are held as needed. The number of assize courts amounted to 234 in 1909.\nThe assize courts were replaced from 1993 onwards by district courts serving as the ordinary courts of first instance.\nFootnotes\n^ h\u00e4radsr\u00e4tt: district (circuit, assize) court,  assizes; S\u00f6dra Roslags domsagas h\u00e4radsr\u00e4tt the Assize Court of the S\u00f6dra Roslag Judicial District.\n",
    "Former lifeboat station in Anglesey, Wales\nPenmon Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station located at Penmon Point, north east of the town of Beaumaris, on the eastern tip of the Isle of Anglesey, Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS) in 1831, managed by the Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck\nThe station was closed in 1915, after a motor-powered lifeboat was placed at Beaumaris\nHistory\nThe Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (AAPLS) was founded by the Rev. James and Mrs Frances Williams in 1828.They had witnessed the loss of 140 lives from the wreck of the vessel Alert in 1823, and spent the following five years raising funds and gaining support.\nIn 1830, the Anglesey Association wrote to the RNIPLS requesting their help to place a lifeboat at Penmon. Lifeboat No.4, a 26-foot 6-oar non-self-righting 'Palmer' type lifeboat, was built by Harton, and transported by sea via Kingstown (D\u00fan Laoghaire), to Holyhead, arriving at Penmon on 28 January 1831. Landowner Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley, 10th Baronet provided a site, and constructed a 32-foot x 10-foot stone-built boathouse, with doors at both ends to help launch in either direction, at the sound between Anglesey and Puffin Island. In 18 years, the first Penmon boat would launch 8 times, and rescue 27.\nLifeboat No.4 was transferred to the new station at Moelfre in 1848, and a new 26-foot boat was provided to Penmon. Only one service call is recorded, and no lives saved, but on 29 March 1850, over 35 vessels were driven ashore by the conditions at Penmon, and the lifeboat-men spent many hours helping vessels and crew.\nThe lifeboats of the AAPLS were transferred over to the management of the (now) RNLI in 1855. Soon afterwards, Capt. Ward, Inspector of Lifeboats, visited Penmon, and launching with the crew on exercise, found that the lifeboat was \"too light\". A replacement 28-foot 6-oar lifeboat costing \u00a3126 was ordered from Forrestt of Limehouse. She was a self-righting lifeboat, which would prove invaluable some years later. Called to the aid of the Jabez of Scarborough on the 23 March 1868, and with 5 rescuees aboard, the lifeboat was capsized. After self-righting, everyone managed to get back on board. However, the incident prompted calls for a larger boat.\nCosting \u00a3251, a 30-foot 10-oared self-righting boat was provided to Penmon in 1868, again built by Forrestt. A long way from the sea, the lifeboat was funded by the Settle, North Yorkshire branch of the RNLI, the boat being named Christopher Brown after their primary fundraiser.\nA new boathouse was constructed in 1880 to house a 34-foot lifeboat, again funded by Settle RNLI branch, and again named Christopher Brown (ON 266). The lifeboat ended up being moored afloat for 2 years, during the reconstruction of the slipway, which was washed away in a storm.\nIn 1914, the lifeboat station at Beaumaris was reopened, following the construction of a new boathouse and deep-water roller-slipway, to house a new motor-lifeboat, Frederick Kitchen (ON 621). Now surplus to requirements, Penmon Lifeboat Station was closed on 31 March 1915. The lifeboat on station at the time, Christopher Brown (ON 390), was withdrawn and sold.\nThe boathouse was handed back to the landowner, Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley, 12th Baronet, the grandson of the original landowner. The boathouse still stands, and is available as a Holiday Let.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Penmon\nRNLI Silver Medal\nOwen Roberts, Pilot - 1838\nThomas Price, Fisherman  - 1854\nWilliam M.

    "RiverHook Creek is a stream on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The creek travels through both the New York City borough of Queens and the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County.\nDescription\nHook Creek runs between Rosedale, Queens and Jamaica Bay. The creek begins in Rosedale, flowing in a drainage tunnel towards the south, west, and southwest roughly following along Hook Creek Boulevard, eventually reaching Sunrise Highway/Conduit Boulevard (NY 27) and the Atlantic & Montauk Branches of the Long Island Rail Road. It then meanders its way south to Woodmere, forming part of the border between New York City and Nassau County \u2013 in addition to forming parts of the Village of Valley Stream's western border.\nHook Creek eventually emerges from the tunnel near the Green Acres Mall. It then continues southwards, soon reaching its confluence with Valley Stream Brook, just south of Rosedale Road. From there, Hook Creek continues southwards through Hook Creek Park and hugging the edge of North Woodmere Park, thence passing under Rockaway Turnpike and meandering its way around Meadowmere and Meadowmere Park (where it passes underneath the Hook Creek Bridge) near John F. Kennedy International Airport before eventually reaching its mouth at Jamaica Bay.\nPortions of the long-proposed path of the Nassau Expressway follow Hook Creek.\nHistory\nDuring the 20th century, a considerable amount of Hook Creek's wetlands were lost to development (including the construction of the adjacent John F. Kennedy International Airport), contributing to increased flooding in the surrounding areas during major storms. The Queens side of the creek was also not connected to New York City's sanitary sewer network until the early 21st century, leading to wastewater being released into the creek and causing environmental degradation. Industrial pollution also negatively impacted the water quality and marine life within the water.\nIn the 21st century, New York City restored large sections of wetland, completing a $700,000 restoration project in Hook Creek Park in May 2023. The sections of Queens near the creek were ultimately hooked up to New York City's sanitary sewer system in 2010, allowing the wastewater to be treated instead of being dumped into the creek, and thus enabling the environmental quality of the creek and Jamaica Bay to be improved & restored.\nThe creek is the namesake of Hook Creek Boulevard.\nSee also\nGeography of Long Island\nMotts Creek (Nassau County, New York)\n",

He was a firm defender of the commitment to the youth team and, with him as president, Real opened up to the entire territory of Gipuzkoa. Together with his friend Javier Exp\u00f3sito, he provided the club with important foundations for the future, giving impressive value to the youth team.\nIn 1980, Orbegozo inaugurated a field in Orbegozo because he wanted to build a new stadium for Real Sociedad in Zubieta. The project took advantage of a subsidy for the use of the new field as the venue for the FIFA 1982 World Cup, but this did not come to pass due to the opposition of the city council. Once San Sebasti\u00e1n was ruled out as the venue for the FIFA World Cup, the project was paralyzed, and the field, whose works had already begun, was converted into a training ground and sports city for Real Sociedad. In 1983, Orbegozo was replaced as president by I\u00f1aki Alkiza and received the gold and diamond medal from the San Sebastian club. However, when he left leaving the club without its own field, without a heritage that would have been key in the future. In fact, when he left the Txuri Urdin entity, he already warned that the club had \"a death row\".\nDeath\nOrbegozo died in San Sebasti\u00e1n on 17 January 2010, at the age of 80 from a cerebral infarction while watching a Real Sociedad match. Sociedad announced that all its teams would wear black armbands on the next matchday, in addition to keeping a minute of silence in all the games in which they play, in memory of Orbegozo. His funeral took place on the following day on 18 January in the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd of San Sebastian and the entire Sociedad squad from the 2009\u201310 season attended, as well as the last presidents and leaders of the entity.\nLegacy\nThe main field (Z-1) of the Zubieta Facilities, where Real Sociedad trains, was named after Jos\u00e9 Luis Orbegozo in 2010 in tribute to him, a field that had been inaugurated by him in 1980.\n",
    "Kahal Shalom SynagogueThe Jews in Rhodes is an ancient Jewish community that existed in Rhodes at least from the 12th century and grew significantly since the expulsion from Spain in 1492. The arrival of Sephardic Jews following their expulsion from Spain revitalized and expanded the community, bringing with them rich cultural and religious traditions. Under Ottoman rule, the Jews of Rhodes enjoyed good relations, experiencing a period of relative peace and prosperity, particularly during the 16th and 17th centuries. This harmonious coexistence continued until the Italian occupation on May 12, 1912, which marked the beginning of a more challenging era for the Jewish community.\nFollowing the Italian occupation, the community faced increasing restrictions and hardships, Before World War II, there were about 6,000 Jews living in Rhodes. The community was almost entirely destroyed in the Holocaust, and today there are about 40 Jews living on the island.\nHistory\nThe Jewish community in Rhodes has a glorious and ancient history, and already Benjamin of Tudela reports at the end of the 12th century that he found four hundred Jews on the island. Obadiah of Bertinoro passed through the island in 1487, stayed about a month and a half, and praised the education of the island's Jews.\nAfter the Expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, the community grew as many exiles found their home on the island and established a Spanish Jewish community there. The conquest of the island in 1522 by Suleiman the Magnificent, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, was beneficial for the status of the Jews on the island and their number increased. According to the Encyclopaedia Judaica, Solomon ibn Verga, an exile from Portugal, arrived from Pisa in Italy to Rhodes and died there in 1533, after the conquest of the island. The Ottoman rule was beneficial for the Jews and allowed them to continue living within the city walls, something that was forbidden for Christians. In the Jewish quarter La Juderia, six synagogues operated, including the Kahal Shalom synagogue, as well as yeshivas, and the Jews were involved in all crafts, including trade, medicine, weapons manufacturing, weaving, and more. In 1927, a rabbinical seminary was established on the island with the support of the Italian government.\nIn 1840, the community suffered from the blood libel in Rhodes. Only after the intervention of the Rothschild family was the community cleared of the accusation of murdering the boy. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Jews were the second largest religious group on the island, with their community numbering 11,000 souls out of 28,000 inhabitants. After the Italian conquest at the beginning of the 20th century, many Jews left Rhodes, in their search for better livelihoods, or for fear of the declaration of antisemitic laws, among others to the community of the town of Milas, located near the city of Bodrum in Asia Minor. In 1930, the Jewish community numbered about 4,000 people out of 30,000 inhabitants of the island.\nIn 1887, the community numbered about 2,600 people out of 30,000 inhabitants of the city. As the Ottoman rule on the island came to an end, the Jewish community also declined in prominence, and many Jews left the island. The first to leave the island for Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo in Africa were the brothers Musa and Salmon Benatar, who arrived there as early as 1895. Following them, many other Jews from Rhodes migrated to the Belgian Congo, South Africa, and Rhodesia.\nJewish Cemetery\nThe new Jewish Cemetery is located about 2 kilometers south of the Jewish quarter La Juderia. Initially, it was located near the old cemetery close to the Jewish quarter, but in the 1930s, the Italians forced the Jews to remove the graves in order to create a park in the area of the old city.\nAt the entrance to the cemetery on the left, the rabbis of the Rhodes community are buried in a higher section, next to the section there are ancient tombstones that were found after the cemetery was moved. To the right of the entrance, there is a small museum about the transfer of the graves. In the cemetery, there is a memorial for the Jews of Rhodes who were murdered in the Holocaust. There is an additional memorial for the missing persons of the immigrant ship Pancho.\nWorld War II\nMonument to the Jews of Rhodes and Kos\nFollowing the implementation of racial laws in Italy and with the outbreak of World War II, about 4,000 out of 6,000 Jews of Rhodes left the city. On July 23, 1944, the Germans concentrated 1,673 of the community's Jews in the Martyrs' Square in the Jewish quarter, were taken to the port of the city of Rhodes, and were loaded onto cargo ferries that sailed towards the port of Piraeus, from which the Jews were taken to the Haidari concentration camp. Along the way, they picked up about 100 members of the Kos community. 7 Jews died during the journey from Rhodes to the port of Piraeus. On August 1, the Jews of Rhodes and Kos arrived at the Haida",

It\u2019s an album that\u2019s deceptively chill, with much more than meets the eye (or ear) on a cursory listen.\" Shahzaib Hussain reviewed this album at Clash Music, where he rated it an 8 out of 10, summing up, \"Bey channels the destabilising loss of her father and its attendant grief into something transcendent yet eminently relatable.

Noah Barker of The Line of Best Fit rated Ten Fold an 8 out of 10, stating that it displays \"Bey\u2019s talent as an instrumental storyteller; genres are sequenced and held for their parts, yet respected like caged animals\" and that \"she\u2019s a voice for all environments, a chameleon turning the world around it a different shade\".

    "Book by Taj al-Din al-Subki\nJam' al-Jawami' fi Usul al-Fiqh (Arabic: \u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0635\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u0647, romanized:\u00a0Collection of Collections in the Principles of Jurisprudence) is a major classical 14th-century treatise and compendium written by Taj al-Din al-Subki, the leading legal theoretician of his time. It is a highly revered work on the subject of Usul al-Fiqh and it continues to be the primary text on Shafi'i principal to this day, and many schools and madrasses (Islamic centres) around the world utilise it as a study book, including the esteemed Islamic university of al-Azhar.\nDescription\nIt is considered as one of the most greatest and comprehensive books in the principles of law among the Sunnis. It covers every single issue in details leaving no room without an explanation that are not properly covered by other legal theorists in their works. Jam 'al-Jawami', regarded as the most popular and widely read book does not only stop at Usul al-Fiqh but also combines Usul Ad-Din (principles of religion) and Adab. It is said that he congregated the methodology of the juristconsults and theologians from both the schools of Shafi'i and Hanafi, respectively.\nDue to its scholarly recognition, Jam' al-Jawami', a significant classical work, was chosen as the most important choice for study. It uses the methodology of qualitative research. It also gains from previous research on the subject. The writer is from the illustrious Shafi'i-Ash\u02bfari family, who flourished in the Mamluk dynasty in the eighth century A.H. He has produced numerous important books on a range of topics. One of his usuli works, Jam' al-Jawami', collects material from approximately a hundred sources and analyses all significant usuli themes in a rhetorically terse manner. It often adheres to the then-dominant structure while including problems of pure theology and morality, giving it a distinct character. Besides the sources of law and its applications, it also covers Usul al-Din related problems from kalam and fiqh. Through historical lessons, the author employs a unique methodology throughout the work. The current study lists seven such approaches and provides textual samples to support each one. In addition, it categorises and defines the terms the writer uses. The study notes that the greater number of works on the text\u2014which mention over a hundred such works categorised under various headings\u2014was probably caused by the book's broader reception among academics.\nAuthors unique approach to Hadith\nIbn al-Subki was more than just a legal theorist. He was highly proficient in many Islamic fields including Hadith science. In addition to being a legal thinker, he also served as a narrator, spokesperson, and critic. His interpretation of the hadiths and the methods by which he verified hadiths supporting or refuting the narrators in the line of transmission demonstrate this. Ibn al-Subki adhered to this methodology in all of his publications, even those on jurisprudential principles. Ibn al-Subki was a more eminent commentator than others who disregarded the authenticity and extraction of Hadith in their main writings. In contrast to the typical approach of legal theorists, Ibn al-Subki did not transcribe any Hadith without first verifying and offering commentary. As an accomplished jurist and linguist, he would extract the jurisprudential and linguistic benefits from the Hadiths.\nCommentaries\nAn edition published by Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyya, edited by Abdul-Mun'im Khalil Ibrahim\nScholars have received an unprecedented interest in the book of Jam' al-Jawami'. They have studied it, taught it, and given it various explanations. Some of them explained it in a long way, some of them explained it briefly, some of them put footnotes and comments on it, and some of them summarized it in verse or prose, and provided explanations for that summary.\nThe following commentaries have been written on the Jam` al-Jawami`:\nTashnif al-Musami` bi?Jam` al-Jawami, by Badr al-Din al-Zarkashi (d. 794).\nAl-Hadaf min al-Wusul 'Iilaa Sharh lil 'Usul al-'Asasia, by Zakariyya al-Ansari (d. 823).\nAbridgment of this: al-Ghaith al-Hani, by Wali al-Din al-`Iraqi (d. 826).\nSharh Jam` al-Jawami, by Jalal al-Din al-Mahhalli (d. 864), written 827, one of the most famous commentaries on the author's work, printed in Cairo 1308 A.H., and used with the Jam` al-Jawami` itself as a text book at the University of Cairo.\nal-Buruq al-Lawami` fi ma Urida `Ala Jam` al-Jawami, by Shams al-Din Muhammad al-Ghazzi (d. 808), a severe criticism on the Jam` al-Jawami`, put together into 32 questions.

    "German writer and anarchist activist (1900\u20131957)\nJohanna \"Hanka\" Grothendieck (1900\u20131957) was a German writer, teacher and anarchist activist. The wife of Russian anarchist Sascha Schapiro and mother of the mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, in 1933, she fled Nazi Germany to France, where she made a living as a German teacher. During World War II, she and her son were held in a number of French internment camps; the Nazis killed her husband in the Holocaust. \nBiography\nJohanna Grothendieck was born in the North German town of Blankenese, on 21 August 1900. Her surname, Grothendieck, comes from the Plattd\u00fctsch word for \"big dike\". After growing up, she moved to Berlin, where she married Alf Raddatz, with whom she had a daughter Maidi.\nIn 1924, she met Sascha Schapiro, a veteran of the Makhnovist movement. Schapiro introduced himself to Raddatz with the words \"I will steal your wife\", and the two began a relationship together. Throughout the 1920s, she was involved in far-left politics and became a writer. On 28 March 1928, she gave birth to their son, Alexander Grothendieck. The family lived together in the German capital until Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, when Grothendieck and Schapiro fled to France, leaving their son in foster care in Germany. They moved to Paris, where Grothendieck taught the German language.\nFollowing the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she and Schapiro went to Spain to support the Republicans. In September 1937, she moved to N\u00eemes, where she worked as a governess for a local police commissioner. There she collaborated with the Makhnovist veteran Volin, as well as the French anarchist Andr\u00e9 Prudhommeaux, on the anarchist journal Terre Libre. In May 1939, she returned to Paris, where she reunited with her husband and son.\nAt the outbreak of World War II, in September 1939, the family moved to N\u00eemes, but Schapiro was arrested and interned in Camp Vernet the following month. Following the Nazi occupation of France, he was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where the Nazis murdered him. In March 1940, Grothendieck and her son left N\u00eemes in order to support a colony of Spanish refugees in Mouri\u00e8s, which was later moved to Marseilles. On 1 August 1940, the Vichy regime arrested Grodethendieck herself, and interned her and her son in the Rieucros Camp. The authorities then transferred her to the Camp de Brens\u00a0, while her son managed to find refuge at the Le Coll\u00e8ge-Lyc\u00e9e C\u00e9venol International in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.\nFollowing the Liberation of France, Grodethendieck reunited with her son in Meyrargues. While Alexander began studying mathematics, Grodethendieck herself began writing an autobiographical novel and reunited with Prudhommeaux. In 1948, she and her son moved to Paris.

Among its renowned guests were former presidents Get\u00falio Vargas and Jo\u00e3o Goulart and artists such as Vicente Celestino, Virg\u00ednia Lane\u00a0 and Francisco Alves. The center was named after poet M\u00e1rio Quintana, who lived in the hotel between 1968 and 1980, in apartment 217.\nArchitecture and history\nDesigned by the German-Brazilian architect Theodor Wiederspahn, it was the first large building in Porto Alegre to use reinforced concrete. Conceived to occupy both sides of the Ara\u00fajo Ribeiro Passage, it has two blocks linked by large walkways connected to the ground by arcades and containing terraces, balconies and columns. This luxury hotel project, built by businessman Hor\u00e1cio de Carvalho, was considered revolutionary at the time, as the idea of suspended walkways over the public road was unprecedented in Brazil at the time.\nConstruction began in 1916 and in 1918, the first part of the building was completed. In 1926, the east part was projected. At the end of the work, in 1933, the Majestic had seven pavements in the east wing and five in the west wing.The design of the building combines historical styles.\nWith the city's urban development, its once privileged location became a security problem. The hotel entered into decline, cutting the number of guest rooms from 300 to 100, and began to house people on a permanent basis, including M\u00e1rio Quintana,.\nThe hotel was acquired in July 1980 by Banrisul so that the government of the state of Rio Grande do Sul could in turn acquire it at a more affordable price. The purchase was made on December 29, 1982. From 1983 onwards, the Porto Alegre city government promoted several projects to revitalize the historical center of the city, so that, among other structures, the Hotel Majestic was registered as a building of historical value and a cultural center under the responsibility of the state's Sub-secretariat of Culture began to be planned in there. The building was restored and the cultural project was developed between 1987 and September 25, 1990, when the Casa de Cultura Mario Quintana was inaugurated. The architects responsible for the internal transformation were Fl\u00e1vio Kiefer and Joel Gorski.\nCultural spaces\nThe property, which belongs to the state of Rio Grande do Sul, has a wide variety of cultural spaces, such as the Luc\u00edlia Minssen Library, the \u00c9rico Ver\u00edssimo Library, part of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Rio Grande do Sul, the Elis Regina and M\u00e1rio Quintana collections, the Natho Henn public record collection, the Xico Stockinger and Sot\u00e9ro Cosme galleries, the Bruno Kiefer and Carlos Carvalho theaters, in addition to three movie theaters, caf\u00e9s, bomboni\u00e8re, bookstore and several rooms for specific purposes or multiple uses.\nIn 2002, the Jos\u00e9 Lutzenberger Garden was installed on the terrace of the fifth floor of the CCMQ, in honor of the environmentalist who died that year. The garden gathers plant species from marshes, deserts, prairies and tropics. Vases and bathtubs from the former Majestic hotel were reused to decorate the space..\nImage gallery\n\u00abAra\u00fajo Ribeiro\u00bb passage.\nView from one of the walkways\n\u00abJos\u00e9 Lutzenberger\u00bb garden, on the fifth floor.\nArt gallery.\nSee also\nMario Quintana\nArchitecture of Porto Alegre\n",
    "\nJackey Jackey the NSW Bushranger is a 1852 Australian play by James McLachlin about the bushranger William Westwood known as \"Jackey Jackey\" (not the Aboriginal tracker of the same name.) He wrote it in collaboration with Thomas McCombie, after having successfully adapted McCombie's Arabin; or, The Adventures of a Settler.\nThe play was based on McCombie's piece on Jackey Jackey, published in Tait's Edinburgh Magazine in 1844.\nThe play was written that year in Melbourne and submitted for approval to the Colonial Secretary in Sydney for permission to be produced at the Queen's Theatre in Melbourne. This permission was refused on the grounds the play might encourage disrespect for authority, the reasons being \"dramas of analogous character have been prohibited from representation in the United Kingdom, and there are obvious reasons, why the principle which renders them objectionable there should apply with even greater force here.\u201d\nHowever the play was eventually produced in Melbourne in 1852 after Victoria separated from New South Wales. It was then shown in Geelong in 1853. Author Margaret Williams wrote this marked \"a turning-point for the bushranger as protagonist after a decade of censorship.\"\nWhen the play was produced in 1852 it was advertised as a new drama by McLaughlin. McCombie wrote a letter of complaint to the newspaper stating:\nThe drama which was licensed by the Colonial Secretary was \"Jackey Jackey, dramatized by J. R. McLaughlin, from the work of Thomas McCombie Esq.\" and as considerable portions of the drama are almost verbatim from my book, and as I contributed several songs, in order to advance the success of the piece, I leave the public to judge of the motives which could have actuated the manager in thus completely altering the title of the play as licensed. I, however, completely exonerate Mr McLaughlin from, any participation in this fraud, for I know that, he is incapable of being guilty of such conduct; and I have heard that he handed the piece over to the Manager as it was licensed.\n",
    "Type of furniture\nFor the chair made by Hans Wegener in Denmark, see The Peacock Chair.\nBlack Panther Party leader Huey Newton on a peacock chair, in a 1967 portrait photograph by Blair Stapp\nThe peacock chair is a chair made of woven rattan or bamboo with a flared back, originated in the Philippines. It became popular in the United States and abroad during the 20th century, as a thronelike symbol of status, being featured in photographies with politicians, revolutionary leaders, actors and musicians.\nHistory\nThe peacock chair is one of several wicker chair designs to be originated from Asia and popularized in the US after the 1876's Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition.\nIt is believed this particular design originated in the Philippines, as a chair produced by inmates of the Bilibid prison in the early 20th-century.  During the American colonial period, the prison was espoused by colonizers as a 'benevolent' institution, where prisoners in rehabilitation programs made articles like furniture, silverware and baskets. The products were exposed at the prison workshop and sold to tourists.\nOne of the first peacock chair photos to popularize the model was featured in the May 16\u201317, 1914 edition of the El Paso Herald, with a female inmate from the Philippine with her baby was sat on it.\nDesign\nThe chair has an hourglass shaped base, lifted arms and a woven flared back resembling a peacock's tail.\nSymbol\nWith the popularization of photography, photographers employed wicker chairs as a prop seat for its sturdy, lightweight appearance. The peacock chair acquired a status symbol, with its thronelike appearance, favored for shoots with politicians, artists and celebrities. The 1967 Blair Stapp photograph of Huey P. Newton, founder of the Black Panther Party, sitting on the chair with a spear and a rifle in each hand, became especially notable as a Black power movement icon.\nThe peacock chair was also featured on the screen, like Morticia Addams' chair in the 1964 television series The Addams Family. The chair also appeared in film, like My Fair Lady  (1964), Emmanuelle (1972) and Black Panther (2018).\nThe peacock chair was a trend in album covers, such as Al Green's I'm Still in Love With You (1972), Dorothy Moore's Misty Blue (1976), Al di Meola's Casino (1978), Funkadelic's Uncle Jam Wants You (1979) and Heaven 17's Play to Win (1981).\n",
    "English Jesuit\nJames Bosgrave (1547?\u20131620s) was an English Jesuit\nBiography\nBosgrave was born at Godmanston, Dorsetshire, 'of a very worshipful house and parentage,' about 1547. He was probably a brother of Thomas Bosgrave, who suffered along with Father John Cornelius at Dorchester on 4 July 1594. He left England in his childhood; entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus at Rome on 17 November 1564; and was ordained priest at Olm\u00fctz in Moravia in 1572. For twelve years he taught Greek, Hebrew, and mathematics at Olm\u00fctz, whence he was sent to Poland and eventually to Vilna in Lithuania. His health declining he was ordered by his superiors to return to England to try his native air. He was seized on landing at Dover in September 1580, was taken before the privy council, and was subsequently committed to the Marshalsea prison and cruelly tortured there. Afterwards he was removed to the Tower of London and was affain put to the torture. Some time after his arrest Bosgrave consented to attend the services of the established church, and was thereupon set at liberty. His fellow Catholics naturally held aloof from him as an apostate. He then addressed to the privy council a protest in which be declared that he had been deceived through his own ignorance and their fraud, and he likewise printed another protest for the Catholics. He was at once re-arrested. On 14 November 1581 be was arraigned in the king's bench, with Father Edmund Campion and others, and on the 20th of that month he received sentence of death, but at the request of Stephen B\u00e1thory, king of Poland, Queen Elizabeth consented to spare his life. He was reprieved and remanded back to the Tower. It was alleged by the government that he and Henry Orton, a lay gentleman, gave answers different from those made by the other priests to the questions put to them about the deposing power of the holy see. The government published these replies in 'A Particular Declaration or Testimony of the undutiful and traitorous afiection borne against her Majestie by Edmund Campian, Jesuite, and other condemned priests,' 1582. It has been supposed that the answers of Bosgrave and Orton are not correctly given (Foley, Records, iii. 292, 772), but there can be no doubt that Bosgrave wished to be neutral between two extreme parties.\nAt length Queen Elizabeth was prevailed upon to restore him to liberty, and on 21 January 1684-5 he was sent into exile with Father Jasper Haywood and others, twenty-one in all. He returned to Poland and died at Calizzi on 27 October 1621, or, as another account sets forth, in 1628, 'septuagenario major.'\nHe is the author of 'The Satisfaction of M. James Bosgrave, the godly confessor of Christ, concerning his going to the Church of the Protestants at his first coming into England.' It is printed with 'A True Report of the late Apprehension and Imprisonment of John Nicols, Minister at Roan,' Rheims, 1583.\n",

    "Norwegian anti-transgender organisation\nKvinneaktivistene (lit.\u2009'Women Activists') is a Norwegian gender-critical/trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) group that opposes transgender rights, and that has been described as transphobic. Members have opined that they consider trans women to be \"men\" and \"pervos\" and have  complained that they have faced backlash for expressing such views. The group is closely associated with the Norwegian chapter of Women's Declaration International (WDI). It has had a presentation cancelled by an Oslo events venue, Kulturhuset, due to its anti-trans views; Kulturhuset cited the group's bylaws that explicitly exclude transgender women and said the group is transphobic. It is considered part of the broader anti-gender movement in Norway. In 2024 Benedicte Aln\u00e6s, who has been both chair of WDI Norway and a spokesperson for Kvinneaktivistene, reported the leader (until 2024) of the Women's Group Ottar in Oslo to the police for hate speech after the Ottar representative had called her a \"Zionist pig\" due to her views on the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.\nHistory\nIt is a breakaway group from the Women's Group Ottar, itself with roots in the Women's Front. The Women's Front had roots in the Maoist Workers' Communist Party. Historically, the name Kvinneaktivistene was used for a 1991 breakaway group from the Women's Front, that then became the Bergen chapter of the Women's Group Ottar. In the 2000s, transgender people became a significant point of contention within Ottar, who at times have promoted some gender-critical beliefs, but more hardline anti-trans activists were disappointed that Ottar refused to campaign against gender self-identification or make the struggle against transgender people a priority, accusing Ottar of being complicit in what they refer to as \"gender ideology.\" As a result, multiple splinter groups from Ottar and partially from the Women's Front were formed, including overlapping groups Women's Declaration International and Kvinneaktivistene. Kvinneaktivistene adopted the former name of the Bergen branch of Ottar.\nKvinneaktivistene and the Norwegian branch of Women's Declaration International (WDI)\u2014which is regarded as an anti-LGBTQ+ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2014share many of the same positions and members, and both have their origins in Ottar and the Women's Front. For example, Kvinneaktivistene member/spokesperson and former WDI Norway chair (2023\u20132024) Benedicte Aln\u00e6s, has written that trans women are \"men\" and \"pervos.\" On behalf of Kvinneaktivistene, Benedicte Aln\u00e6s, Tina Skotnes and Cathrine Ude wrote an article in Klassekampen that complained that they had faced backlash for expressing such views. Skotnes and Ude have also signed the WDI anti-trans manifesto. According to the letter, Kvinneaktivistene exclusively consists of women who have faced what they described as a \"witch-hunt\" over their views.\nIn 2023 cultural events venue Kulturhuset cancelled a planned event that Kvinneaktivistene had rented the venue for, with the rationale that Kvinneaktivistene is a transphobic group with bylaws that deliberately exclude transgender women. \u00a7 1 in Kvinneaktivistene's bylaws states that \"by women we mean women.\" The event promoted the detransition\u00a0narrative, that has been noted as being weaponized by anti-trans groups. Kvinneaktivistene has stated that \"we are women, not transphobic.\"\nKvinneaktivistene has participated in the anti-trans FiLiA conference, which is closely linked to Women's Declaration International (WDI) and which is described as one of \"the most important 'gender critical' groups\" alongside WDI. On Twitter the group has promoted content from anonymous anti-trans accounts (e.g. \"Sappfo\") that have been analyzed in academic literature as key actors in the Norwegian anti-gender movement. Referring to some of the women active in WDI and Kvinneaktivistene, the leader of the Women's Front called them \"transphobes, racists and sexists\" and said that \"we strongly condemn them.\"\nThe Extremism Commission's report cited sources that pointed to \"the connections between radical feminism and Christian conservatism\" in relation to anti-trans activism, noting that \"these are groups and individuals who use violent and dehumanizing language and are also threatening and extremely active.\" Feminist scholars have described these anti-gender movements operating in the name of radical feminism in the Norwegian context as part of a \"complex threat to democracy.\" In 2023 the University of Bergen's Centre for Women's and Gender Research hosted its annual debate on international women's day, that focused on the anti-gender movements in Norway, where panelists highlighted how anti-gender actors had managed to get a foothold in the radical feminist milieu in Oslo. Gender studies scholar Janne Bromseth\u00a0 argued that \"the anti-gender movement has (...) shifted boundaries in the public debate in Norway in recent years,\" resulting in \"a harsher climate of d",
    "\nOn April 19, 1865, Secessionists skirmished with 25 troopers of the 1st California Cavalry Battalion in Grass Valley, California in the wake of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.\nBackground\nOn March 15 Brig. Gen. John S. Mason, the new commander of the District of Arizona, directed the 1st California Cavalry Battalion to move east to fight the Apaches. The battalion was getting ready for the thousand-mile march when the news came about President Lincoln's assassination and their movement was postponed. In California hundreds of southern sympathizers across the state celebrating the news in the streets. A man in Butte County made some disrespectful comments about Lincoln, bragging about what he would do to the soldiers who came after him. He was armed  \"large Colt revolver.\" In the streets of Marysville, a man named L. W. Thomas, from Tennessee, walked about the town with a \"silk Confederate flag\" pinned to his chest. When news came in about the actions of the sympathizers, California volunteers stationed in nearby forts were sent out to intercept the perpetrators and keep the peace. One of the more violent incidents happened at Grass Valley between local Southern sympathizers and detachment of company A of the 1st California Cavalry Battalion.\nSkirmish\nCompany A sent out a detachment of 25 men commanded by Second Lieutenant M. E. Jimenez to Grass Valley. When they got to Grass Valley a skirmish with a group of secessionist ensued. Two privates were severely wounded (Antonio Guilman and Juan Leon), while none of the Secessionists were killed or wounded. Jimenez and his soldiers arrested ten individuals ending the short skirmish.\nAftermath\nCompany A took the prisoners from Grass Valley to Camp Low. On June 3 the Lancers were scheduled  for departure to Arizona when \"two secessionists arrested in the wake of President Lincoln's death escaped from the Camp Low guard house.\" Major Cremony detailed both companies to hunt for the rebels. After a week of searching in vain, the Californios began their lengthy march to Arizona on 16 of June.\nThis was the last engagement the Cavalry Battalion fought against Southern sympathizers.\n",

    "Russian\u2013American physician and anarchist (1871\u20131906)\nSamuel H. Gordon (1871\u20131906) was a Russian American physician. Having emigrated to the United States in the early 1890s, he joined the Jewish anarchist movement in Philadelphia and began taking lessons in the English language from Voltairine de Cleyre. Before long, he was engaged in a romantic relationship with her and participated in her anarchist activism, but their relationship quickly became strained after she rejected his marriage proposal. de Cleyre herself paid his way through medical school and he graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in 1898, after which he left the anarchist movement and broke up with de Cleyre. When de Cleyre was hospitalized by an assassination attempt in 1902, he refused to help her, which ostracized him further from the anarchist movement. Gordon died from gastritis in 1906.\nBiography\nSamuel H. Gordon was born in 1871, into a Jewish family in the Russian Empire. After reaching adulthood, he emigrated to the United States and settled in Philadelphia. He quickly became involved in the local labor movement, for which he was arrested during a strike action in August 1890. Having found work as a cigar maker, he joined a Jewish anarchist group, the Knights of Liberty, and became a disciple of the German anarchist theorist Johann Most.\nIn 1893, Gordon approached the American anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre and asked her to teach him the English language. Gordon was one of de Cleyre's few Jewish students who achieved a good enough comprehension of the English language to publish their work in the American anarchist press. They were also physically attracted to each other and quickly became lovers, moving in together and working together on their anarchist propaganda work. de Cleyre referred to him affectionately as \"Pussy mine\". By the following year, Gordon's English comprehension was good enough that he gave a lecture about revolution at a meeting of de Cleyre's organization, the Ladies' Liberal League (LLL). Through the LLL, Gordon participated in de Cleyre's defense campaign, which secured the release of the English anarchist Charles Mowbray from jail. Gordon was unpopular among the other Philadelphia anarchists, who thought him shallow and unintelligent. He founded a short-lived Jewish anarchist group, New Generation, as a splinter of the Knights of Liberty.\nIn the mid-1890s, Gordon enrolled in medical school, at the Medico-Chirurgical College of Philadelphia. His education was paid for by de Cleyre, despite her own meager income; she recalled that \"I gave Mother and Gordon over $1,000 between them, yet they consider me 'impractical'\". By this time, he had begun to neglect de Cleyre. To de Cleyre, he seemed increasingly \"irresponsible and self-indulgent\", and apparently loved her less than she loved him. He also disliked her pet cats, even forcing her to lock one in a coal bin, which resulted in it fleeing the house. Over time, their relationship was increasingly marked by bitter arguments, with one escalating to such an extent that they both attempted to commit suicide by poisoning themselves. Gordon was treated by a doctor and survived the ordeal, but it caused severe burns to his lips and stomach. According to de Cleyre, the argument had been caused after she rejected Gordon's marriage proposal. In 1897, while she was in London, she wrote to him offering to mend their relationship, on certain conditions:\nIf you want me back I shall come all the sooner if you treat me as a free woman and not as a slave.  Last summer I wanted to enslave you\u2014at least so much that my days and nights were tears because you preferred other people to me, though theoretically I know I was wrong. I will never, never live that life again. It is not worth while living at that price. I would rather die here in England and never see your beautiful face again than live to be the slave of my own affection for you. I will never, let come what will, accept the condition of married slavery again. I will not do things for you; I will not live with you, for if I do I suffer the tortures of owning and being owned.\nGordon also caused a feud to break out between de Cleyre and Emma Goldman. De Cleyre wanted Gordon to accompany her while she visited Goldman in prison, despite Gordon having supported Johann Most's condemnation of Goldman's friend Alexander Berkman, after he had attempted to assassinate Henry Clay Frick. Gordon himself had also publicly denounced Goldman as a \"disruptor of the movement\" and refused to participate in any meeting where she was present. Goldman consequently rejected de Cleyre's request, and the two quickly fell out with each other. According to Goldman, \"Voltairine could never forgive me  my dislike of that dog Gordon who sapped her dry and then cast her away.\"\nGordon graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in 1898, and established his medical practice at 531 Pine Street. As he achieved material success as a physician, he left the anarchist movemen",
    "Municipal building in Cricklade, Wiltshire, England\n\"Les Cinq Sens\" (Allegory of the Five Senses), a painting by Pietro Paolini, which hung on a wall in the town hall from 1945 to 1993\nCricklade Town Hall is an events venue in the High Street in Cricklade, a town in Wiltshire in England. It currently hosts a variety of community events, including a weekly cinema and annual school assemblies.\nHistory\nThe town hall was commissioned to replace the old town hall in the High Street. The site that civic leaders selected was open land about 100 yards (91\u00a0m) along the High Street to the southwest of the old town hall. Construction on the new building started in 1932. It was designed by Eric Cole of Cirencester in the arts and crafts style, reminiscent of the work of Charles Voysey. It was built by Baldwin Brothers of Fairford in brick with a cement render and was completed in 1933.\nThe design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto the High Street. The central bay formed a porch, which was projected forward and contained a doorway with a fanlight, an archivolt, and a gable above. The outer bays formed pavilions, which were fenestrated by casement windows and surmounted by pitched roofs. The main hall, which was laid out behind the central bay, was lit by a large Diocletian window facing towards the High Street, and surmounted by a steep pitched roof. It incorporated a main hall, with a stage and a sprung dance floor, and a committee room.\nIn October 1945, a painting was donated to the hall by a local doctor, Frank Lewarne. It was identified, in 1993, as \"Les Cinq Sens\" (Allegory of the Five Senses), by Pietro Paolini, an Old Master from the school of Caravaggio, and was sold at auction for \u00a368,000.\nThe venue hosts a variety of community events, including since 2013 a weekly cinema. After it was extensively refurbished in 2015, the comedian, Julian Clary, visited the town hall in July 2017 to host the end of year assembly for a local school. Works of art in the town hall include two paintings by Edward James Battar depicting local local landscape scenes.\n",

He afterwards officiated at Whitestaunton, Somerset, but in 1577 he left the church, and travelled by London to Antwerp. A week later he visited Dr. William Allen, at that time head of the English seminary at Douay. Nicholls seems to have still professed himself a Protestant, and was banished the town. He then proceeded to Grenoble, where he stayed with the archbishop three months. Subsequently, he served the Bishop of Vicenza, and visited Milan, and was admitted to the English seminary at Rome. He appears to have voluntarily presented himself before the inquisition, 27 April 1578, and was commanded to preach in defence of the Roman church before the pope and four cardinals on 25 May 1578. He entered the seminary on 28 May, having publicly abjured Protestantism and received absolution, which was published by the notary 8 May 1579. He preached a Latin sermon on St. Peter's day, 5 August 1579.\nNicholls remained at the seminary two years, but professed to despise the scholars who, he says, could \u2018neither construe Latin nor preach as well as the shoemakers and tailors in England.\u2019 Having obtained from the pope a viaticum of fifty crowns, under pretence of ill-health he left Rome some time in 1580 for Rheims, where Allen was then living. Nicholls, however, proceeded to England, and not long after was arrested at Islington, and committed to the Tower of London by Sir Francis Walsingham and the Bishop of London. During his imprisonment he wrote: \u2018John Niccols Pilgrimage, wherein is displayed the lives of the proude Popes, ambitious Cardinals,\u2019 &c., London, 1581; also \u2018A Declaration of the Recantation of John Nichols (for the space almost of two yeeres the Pope's Scholar in the English Seminarie or Colledge at Rome), which desireth to be reconciled and received as a member into the true church of Christ in England,\u2019 London, 1581. The recantation was made 5 February, before Sir Owen Hopton, lieutenant of the Tower, citizens, and prisoners, and was printed on 14 February. This book is rare. Two copies were placed in the British Museum\u2014one in the Grenville Library there, and another with valuable manuscript notes. Soon after \u2018A Confutation of John Nicolls his Recantation\u2019 came out anonymously, and was answered by Dudley Fenner in \u2018An Answere unto the Confutation,\u2019 &c., London, 1583. Nicholls also published \u2018The Oration and Sermon made at Rome, &c., by John Nichols, latelie the Pope's Scholar,\u2019 with an address to the queen, and an autobiographical letter to the worshipful Company of Merchant Adventurers at Embden and Antwerp, London, 1581. The same year appeared, anonymously, \u2018A Discoverie of J. Niccols, Minister, misreported a Jesuite, latelye recanted in the Tower of London, wherein \u2026 is contayned a ful Answere to his Recantation, with a Confutation of his Slaunders.\u2019 The author of this book was Robert Parsons. No copy is in the British Museum, but one was placed in the Bodleian. It was answered by Thomas Lupton in \u2018The Christian against the Jesuite, Wherein the secrete or namelesse writer of a pernitious booke intituled A Discouerie, &c. \u2026 is \u2026 justly reprooued,\u2019 London, 1582.\nAfter his recantation Nicholls was employed to preach to the Catholics in the Tower. Upon Easter Sunday, 19 March 1581, he preached there before a large company of nobles and courtiers invited by Sir Owen Hopton (Records of the Society of Jesus, ii. 164). It was intended to give him \u2018the next living that fell in\u2019 (Strype, Grindal, pp.\u00a0390\u20131). In the meantime Archbishop Grindal was prayed by the council, 10 May 1581, to direct the bishops to contribute to the maintenance of their convert; 50l. a year was collected for him. But at the end of 1582 Nicholls again crossed to the Low Countries and Germany, in company with Lawrence Caddey, his former fellow-student at Rome, who had also recanted in England. He was thrown into prison at Rouen, and again turned to Romanism. In letters to Dr. Allen, dated 18 and 19 February 1583, he expressed penitence, and professed that his statements written in the Tower, and accusations brought against Sir George Peckham, Judge Southcot, and others, were extracted from him by Sir Owen Hopton under threats of the rack. On 20 February 1583, Nicholls was examined, and retracted his accusations against the English colleges at Rome and Rheims, to which Dr. Allen had already replied in his \u2018Apologie and True Declaration \u2026 of the two English Colleges.\u2019 \u2018A True Report of the late Apprehension",
    "American singer-songwriter (born 2002)\nMusical artist\nAbigail \"Abi\" Carter (born July 31, 2002) is an American singer and musician who won season 22 of American Idol in 2024. She is the first woman in four years to win the competition. She is from Indio, California, and graduated summa cum laude from California State University, San Bernardino, Palm Desert campus, with a degree in Marriage & Family Therapy.\nEarly life and education\nCarter was born and raised in Indio, California, and is the second oldest of seven children in a \"very religious family\" living with a single mother, Andrea Engel Carter. She has three sisters and three brothers, one of whom, Daniel, is a YouTube video creator.\nCarter says that her mother has always supported her in music; Andrea bought Abi her first keyboard. Abi began private piano lessons when she was 7 or 8; Marta Basham, her former piano teacher, spoke to the press and was in the audience for an American Idol show. Referring to her mother's help, Carter told the Coachella Valley Weekly that she \"wouldn't be the person I am today without her guiding me along the way\".\nCarter said that when she was about 11, while cleaning her house, she was listening to \"Battle Scars\" by Guy Sebastian and Lupe Fiasco. At the time, she noticed patterns in music and music theory principles in pop music. Since then, she has continued playing by ear and improvising.\nShe went to school at George Washington Charter School in Palm Desert, California until third grade and then was homeschooled. She attended La Quinta High School in La Quinta, California for less than a semester and returned to being homeschooled. About that time, her parents separated. She said that she left high school so that she could also work part-time, help care for her siblings, buy a car, and chauffeur her siblings to school and appointments.\nShe finished high school early and studied psychology at California State University, San Bernardino, Palm Desert campus. In May 2023, she graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor's degree in Marriage & Family Therapy.\nBefore Idol\nIn 2016, Carter and her mother, who is also a singer, performed for the McCallum Theatre's Open Call Talent Competition, an annual event in Palm Desert. Abi was 13 and her mother 35, and they won \"Best Vocal Act\" that year. She tried out for Open Call to help her mother overcome her stage fright. Abi has been an Open Call finalist five times.\nWhen Carter was 19, she decided to devote more time to her passion for music, so she quit her job as a gymnastics instructor and started busking. She gained valuable experience performing at country clubs in the Coachella Valley, as well as at the bar at Tommy Bahama Marlin Bar in Palm Springs, and at Kitchen 86 + Bar in Palm Desert, the \"first restaurant that hired her to play music\". She also performed at Villagefest, a weekly street fair in Palm Springs. Her goal was to earn a living by singing, and when local restaurant owners encouraged her to sing in their restaurants, she thought she had reached her goal.\nWhen some social media videos of her playing were well-received, she was pleasantly surprised and encouraged, so she decided to post cover videos to see what would happen. When she posted a video of her singing the 2023 song \"Vampire\", by Olivia Rodrigo, American Idol casting producer Ariel Panzer saw the video and invited her to audition for the show. After a couple Zoom meetings with American Idol producers, she decided to audition in Santa Barbara, and, as she puts it, \"The rest is history.\"\nHer music is inspired by the following female artists: Taylor Swift, Sara Bareilles, Gracie Abrams, Lizzy McAlpine, and Billie Eilish. She has been a fan of Billie Eilish since she was a young teenager.\nAmerican Idol contest\nIn late 2023, after the judges had listened to two days of auditions, Carter performed as the last audition of the day in Santa Barbara. She sang her rendition of Billie Eilish's \"What Was I Made For?\" that impressed all three judges, with Lionel Richie declaring, \"We don't have to vote.\" Wide Open Country reported that she made the song personal by adding complex runs to the melody and using her falsetto range. When she finished the song, Katy Perry approached her and said, \"Thank you for being an example of singing from your heart. What were you made for? You were made for this. One hundred percent.\" Luke Bryan said to Lionel Richie, \"That may be the winner of American Idol.\" Perry turned around and said to Bryan: \"Luke, she's Top 10, right?\" Richie and Bryan agreed that Carter could win the show. Bryan also mentioned that he had never heard the show's crew clap before. Richie said to Carter's family: \"That's the best we've ever heard on this show.\u00a0... I'm not kidding.\" Carter was awarded a golden ticket without the judges voting, and a week later her golden ticket was upgraded to a platinum ticket.\nIn the Top 24, after she sang \"Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)\" by Hillsong United, Perry told Carter, \"Yo",
    "20th-century California boxing venue\nThe Vernon Arena, located just south of downtown Los Angeles, California, was a major early 20th-century west coast of the United States boxing venue. For much of its history the Vernon Arena was a \"pavilion\"\u2014an outdoor boxing ring surrounded by seating for spectators\u2014but the Vernon Coliseum, which stood from 1924 to 1927, was an indoor arena with capacity to host about 8,000 people.\nHistory\nThe original Vernon boxing \"pavilion\" was constructed by boxer Jim Jeffries and ubiquitous West Coast hotel-restaurant-club impresario Baron Long around 1908. Jeffries himself refereed some of the first fights at the venue, although Vernon fights were not financially successful under Jefferies. The Vernon Arena's later heyday (in the 1910s and 1920s) was the work of two fight promoters in series: T. J. \"Uncle Tom\" McCarey and Jack Doyle. The first Vernon boxing arena was being leased by McCarey from owner Jeffries when it caught fire and burned on September 16, 1911. A newspaper profile of McCarey published 1913 reported that he had \"controlled the boxing situation\" in the city for a dozen years past. According to a history of California boxing, \"The Jeffries Club staged a number of notable fights but finally succumbed to the stiffer competition of McCarey's downtown club and went out of business, the plant being taken over by McCarey and operated rather spasmodically for championship bouts for a while until he gave up the Naud Junction location entirely and confined his efforts to putting on 15, 20, and 25 round contests in the Vernon arena.\" McCarey departed Los Angeles for New Orleans in December 1914, following the passage of 1914 California Proposition 20. The state of California banned prize fighting (temporarily as it turned out) effective January 1, 1915. The Vernon arena built by Long and Jeffries burned in October 1915.\nTraining Areas - Jack Doyles Vernon CA (George Rice & Sons printers, Los Angeles, c.\u20091916)\nPromotional map for Los Angeles Central Manufacturing District showing rail lines and streets in Vernon in 1923\nAerial view of Vernon in 1925, looking northeast near Santa Fe and Vernon Avenue\nIn the late teens, Doyle replaced McCarey as Vernon's boss of boxing. Doyle had long run a famous bar in Vernon (the city was a wet enclave within dry Los Angeles). According to Los Angeles historian Cecilia Rasmussen, Doyle's first venture in Vernon was \"a gigantic saloon, where 37 bartenders rang up liquor sales on 37 cash registers at a 100-foot-long bar. Behind it hung a sign\u2014'If Your Children Need Shoes, Don't Buy Any Booze'\u2014and in the ceiling were peepholes from which to keep an eye on the barmen, patrons, and pickpockets.\"\nDoyle's bar closed in 1919 due to the national prohibition on the sale of alcohol, but he had already set up a training camp that was located out back, past the card room. The two-story hotel structure that a contractor reported he had completed at 38th and Santa Fe in June 1916 may have been the facility known as Jack Doyle's Training Camp. A show-business history published 1934 stated, \"All the big fighters of the day, as well as preliminary boys, has-beens, and hope-to-bes, trained at Jack Doyle's camp. The crowds that gathered to watch were drawn from what reporters are wont to call 'all walks of life.' There were pickpockets, fences, promoters, and we-boys. Also there were such celebrities as Earl Rogers, famed criminal attorney and father of Adela Rogers St. Johns, Mr. and Mrs. Jack Cudahy, Anita Baldwin, and the entire movie crowd.\" According to boxer-actor-trainer Dewitt Van Court, \"The camp was patronized by the finest boxers in the land and their popularity drew such huge crowds, particularly on Sundays, that Doyle had to erect a regular arena and surround it with stands which would accommodate several hundred people. To pay for the stands, Doyle charged a nominal admission, and the crowds grew so large that he finally enlarged it to seat several thousand and roofed it over.\"\nVernon Athletic Club and Maier Park on the Sanborn Insurance Co. map (1920)\nAerial view of Vernon Arena and Maier Park fronting 38th Street c.\u20091925\nDoyle's Vernon Arena became the center of boxing in Los Angeles. According to the Los Angeles Times, \"With 'Wad' Wadhams as matchmaker, seven four-round bouts were staged at the Doyle Arena every Tuesday night from 1916 to 1923.\" With prizefighting illegal, the fighters were officially all \"amateurs\" engaged in \"exhibition\" matches. The prizes were medals and \"maybe a little 'expense' money\".  In 1921 fight tickets were priced $1 to $3, and there was a section of the arena reserved for ladies. The last fight at Doyle's original outdoor arena was held August 21, 1923.\nDoyle began planning an indoor arena as early as 1920, intending for a building that fronted on 38th Street \"near the north entrance of Maier park  a frontage of 160 feet and a depth of 138 feet.\" Doyle's Vernon Coliseum, as he called it, was opened August 28, 1923",
    "Large multimodal model from OpenAI\nGPT-4o (GPT-4 Omni) is a multilingual, multimodal generative pre-trained transformer designed by OpenAI. It was announced by OpenAI's CTO Mira Murati during a live-streamed demo on 13 May 2024 and released the same day.\nGPT-4o is free, but with a usage limit that is 5 times higher for ChatGPT Plus subscribers. It can process and generate text, images and audio. Its API is twice as fast and half the price of its predecessor, GPT-4 Turbo.\nBackground\nOriginally, multiple versions of GPT-4o were secretly launched under different names on Large Model Systems Organization's (LMSYS) Chatbot Arena as 3 different models. These 3 models were called gpt2-chatbot, im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot, and im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot. On 7 May 2024, Sam Altman tweeted \"im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot\", which was commonly interpreted as a confirmation that these were new OpenAI models being A/B tested.\nCapabilities\nGPT-4o achieved state-of-the-art results in voice, multilingual, and vision benchmarks, setting new records in audio speech recognition and translation. GPT-4o scored 88.7 on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark compared to 86.5 by GPT-4. Unlike GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, which rely on other models to process sound, GPT-4o natively supports voice-to-voice, making the response nearly instant and seamless. Sam Altman noted on 15 May 2024 that GPT-4o's voice-to-voice capabilities were not yet integrated into ChatGPT, and that the old version was still being used.\nThe model supports over 50 languages, which OpenAI claims cover over 97% of speakers. Mira Murati demonstrated the model's multilingual capability by speaking Italian to the model and having it translate between English and Italian during the live-streamed OpenAI demo event on 13\u00a0May 2024. In addition, the new tokenizer uses fewer tokens for certain languages, especially languages that are not based on the Latin alphabet, making it cheaper for those languages.\nGPT-4o has knowledge up to October 2023 and has a context length of 128k tokens with output token limit capped to 2,048.\nAs of May 2024, it is the leading model in the Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS) Elo Arena Benchmarks by the University of California, Berkeley.\nScarlett Johansson controversy\n \nAs released, GPT-4o offered five voices: Breeze, Cove, Ember, Juniper and Sky. A similarity between the voice of American actress Scarlett Johansson and Sky was quickly noticed. On May 14, Entertainment Weekly asked themselves whether this likeness was on purpose. On May 18, Johansson's husband, Colin Jost, joked about the similarity in a segment on Saturday Night Live. On May 20, 2024, OpenAI disabled the Sky voice, issuing a statement saying \"We've heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT, especially Sky. We are working to pause the use of Sky while we address them.\"\nScarlett Johansson starred in Spike Jonze's sci-fi movie Her in 2013, playing the role of Samantha, an artificially intelligent virtual assistant personified through a female voice. \nAs part of the promotion leading up to the release of GPT-4o, Sam Altman on May 13 tweeted a single word: \"her\".\nOpenAI claimed that each voice was based on the voice work of a hired actor. Specifically, OpenAI claimed \"Sky\u2019s voice is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice.\" Already in September 2023, OpenAI had claimed their upcoming new talking version of its ChatGPT assistant that sounded like Scarlett Johansson \"wasn't meant to resemble\" the actress. CTO Mira Murati stated \"I don't know about the voice. I actually had to go and listen to Scarlett Johansson's voice.\" OpenAI further claimed the voice talent was recruited before reaching out to Johansson.\nOn May 21, Johansson issued a statement explaining that OpenAI had repeatedly offered to make her a deal to gain permission to use her voice as early as nine months prior to release, a deal she rejected. She said she was \"shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference.\" In the statement, Johansson also used the incident to draw attention to the lack of legal safeguards around the use of creative work to power leading AI tools, as her legal counsel demanded OpenAI detail the specifics of how the Sky voice was created.\nObservers noted similarities to how Johansson had previously sued and settled with The Walt Disney Company for breach of contract over the direct-to-streaming rollout of her Marvel film Black Widow, a settlement widely speculated to have netted her around $40M.\nAlso on May 21, Shira Ovide at Washington Post shared her list of \"most bone-headed self-owns\" by technology companies, with the decision to go ahead with a Johansson sound-alike voice despite her opposition and then denying the similarities ranking 6th.

For the castle in Weilburg, Germany, see Schloss Weilburg.\nWeilburg palace dreaming in the valley, while the ruins of Rauheneck castle look down from the hill\nThe Weilburg palace (German: Schloss Weilburg) is a former neoclassical palace in Baden near Vienna, Austria. Constructed in 1820, it was a present from archduke Charles, duke of Teschen (1771\u20131847) to his beloved wife, princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg (1797\u20131829). The neoclassical design was by the architect Joseph Kornh\u00e4usel (1782\u20131860). It became the seat of the Teschen branch of the Habsburg family. A fire broke out in April 1945, probably lit by retreating soldiers of the Wehrmacht and as the Red Army prohibited the fire to be extinguished, the palace was destroyed. Due to misunderstanding and ignorance, the ruins were blown up in the 1960s.\nToday, nothing is left from this beautiful palace except the coat of arms, which once decorated the palace. The palace was once considered the most significant example of Biedermeier style in Austria.\nHistory\nPrincess Henrietta with archduke Albrecht in the 1820s\nArchduke Charles with his family in front of the Weilburg palace\nWeilburg palace seen from the north in 1820.

He was also the younger brother of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. However, he had been adopted and raised by his childless aunt Marie Christine of Austria and her husband Albert of Saxe-Teschen. He was the heir to the Duchy of Teschen and would succeed in 1822.\nThe archduke was epileptic, but achieved respect both as a commander and as a reformer of the Austrian army. He was considered one of Napoleon's more formidable opponents and one of the greatest generals of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He was the victor of the Battle of Aspern-Essling against Napoleon.\nOn 15 September/17 September 1815 in Weilburg, archduke Charles married princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg. The bride was almost eighteen years old and the groom forty-four. But the marriage proved to be a happy one. Henriette has been known as the person who popularized the Christmas tree in Vienna after it was already introduced by Fanny von Arnstein in 1814 during the Vienna Congress.\nShortly, after the marriage he decided to construct a summer residence as a present for his wife. The location for the palace was in Baden near Vienna, a spa town favoured by the Viennese elite and members of the imperial family, who constructed extensive villas nearby. The chosen plot was at the entrance of the Helenental valley, at the foot of a hill dominated by the ruins of Rauheneck castle and opposite the ruins of Rauhenstein castle. The land was owned by the Doblhoff family, who sold it to the archduke.\nThe architect Joseph Kornh\u00e4usel made the neoclassical design, who also rebuilt large parts of Baden in a Biedermeier style after a fire destroyed large parts of the town in 1812. The laying of the foundation stone took place on 13 September 1820, after which construction started. On 24 December 1821, archduke Charles presented the palace to his wife Henriette. The palace could be moved into on 4 June 1823. The building was named after Henriette's hometown Weilburg.\nWith a front length of 201 meters, the Weilburg palace was one of the most significant neoclassical buildings in Austria. Moritz Gottlieb Saphir (1795\u20131858), a contemporary, called it \"a stone poem, an epic built by a hero,\" alluding to the builder's military glory.\nOn the north side of the house, a coat of arms designed in stone by Josef Klieber (1773\u20131850) was placed on the attic of the seven-axial portico, combining the lion of the House of Nassau with the heraldic animals of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, the eagle and the lion.\nOn the night of 29 to 30 December 1829, Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg died in Vienna. In her will, she bequeathed the Weilburg palace to her eldest son Albrecht, who was still a minor. The management of the property was entrusted to his father, Archduke Karl, who passed away on 30 April 1847.\nArchduke Albrecht of Teschen\nArchduke Albrecht around 1895\nWeilburg palace seen from the ruins of Rauhenstein castle\nWeilburg palace - Detail from a landscape by Johann Raulino\nWeilburg palace by Franz Jaschke in 1823.

Her father was Bayezid, son of the Ottoman sultan Murad I, who would become sultan in 1389. Her mother is unknown, but she may be the daughter of Konstantin Dragas, who became Bayezid's consort in 1372.\nIn 1390, fifteen-year-old Hundi married \u015eemseddin Mehmed. Born in Bukhara, he was a seyyid and one of the most prominent citizens of Bursa, where he was known as Amir Bukhara. After the marriage, he became known as Amir Sultan.\nMarriage's legend\nThere is a famous legend about the marriage of Hundi and Amir.\nIt says that, while Bayezid was at war, he had invited Amir to stay in his palace. Here, Amir and Hundi had prophetic dreams in which Muhammad ordered them to marry. After two nights, Hundi went to Amir and said, \"This marriage has already taken place in the eyes of Allah. However, according to Islamic law, legal marriage is obligatory.\" So the two got married in front of all the personalities of Bursa. When Bayezid discovered this, he sent S\u00fcleyman Pasha and forty men to kill Amir and the wedding witnesses, but they failed due to a series of miracles. Then, Molla Fenari, qadi of Bursa, wrote to Bayezid that the marriage was wanted by Allah and that Amir was a worthy son-in-law. So Bayezid accepted the marriage and reconciled with his daughter and Amir.\nHistorical analyzes\nThere are two main historical analyzes of marriage.\nAccording to the first, the marriage was arranged by Bayezid himself and not behind his back. Bayezid respected Amir and wanted him as a son-in-law, and he knew that he and Hundi loved each other, so he arranged the wedding.\nIn the second, Amir took advantage of Bayezid's absence to seduce Hundi and kidnap her. To save the girl's reputation, Molla Fenari legally married him and then convinced Bayezid to give her blessing by inventing the miracles that saved Amir.\nHundi and Amir's marriage is the only one known between an Ottoman princess and a seyyid and is the only one that could have taken place without the consent of the bride's relatives. The derived legend is considered the last of Ottoman mythology, which began with Osman's Dream.\nLater years and death\nAfter the wedding, the couple settled in Bursa and had four sons and two daughters. Hundi was widowed in 1429, when her husband and probably at least some of her children died during a plague epidemic.\nShe herself died the following year, in 1430, of plague or grief. She was buried with her husband and children in the Emir Sultan Mosque in Bursa.\nIssue\nFrom her marriage, Hundi Hatun had four sons, including Emir Ali Bey, and two twin daughters. All her children predeceased her and were buried with their parents in Bursa.\n",

    "Spanish lawyer, footballer, sports leader, and politician\nLeopoldo Garc\u00eda-Dur\u00e1n Parages Golmar (15 November 1882 \u2013 16 April 1966) was a Spanish lawyer, sports leader, and politician who served as a Deputy of Spain during the restoration and as the 8th president of the Spanish Football Federation between 1931 and 1936. He also played football in his youth as a midfielder for Madrid FC.\nEarly life and education\nLeopoldo Garc\u00eda Dur\u00e1n was born in As Neves, Galicia, on 15 November 1882, as the son of Manuel Garc\u00eda Golmar\u00a0, a merchant and politician. He studied high school at the Escolapios school in Celanova and then studied law at the Central University of Madrid. He worked in the office of Gabino Bugallal and was appointed public prosecutor of the Madrid Court.\nFootballing career\nWhile he was studying in the capital, Garc\u00eda Dur\u00e1n joined the ranks of Madrid FC as a midfielder, being part of some of the first starting elevens in the club's history. For instance, in the club's first-ever complete season, in 1902\u201303, he played in three friendly matches between February and April of 1903. On 12 March 1905, he scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20132 victory over Moncloa FC, again in a friendly. In the following month, on 16 April 1905, he finally made his competitive debut for Madrid, the opening match of the 1905 Copa del Rey, helping his side to a 3\u20130 victory over San Sebasti\u00e1n Recreation Club, but he did not feature in the final against Athletic Bilbao, which Madrid won 1\u20130. He can be traced in the first elevens of the white team until 1909, when he played in the first three matches of the 1909 Centro regional championship, winning his last one against Sociedad Gimn\u00e1stica 4\u20132.\nPolitic career\nAfter football came politics, and on six occasions Garc\u00eda Dur\u00e1n was elected deputy in the Cortes as a member of the Conservative Party.

In his 1920 election, he got 2,091 votes to the 2,468 of Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo, who thus contested and protested since Garc\u00eda Dur\u00e1n's proclamation was \"maintained with an incomplete... and imperfect scrutiny... and with violation of the criteria repeatedly established by the Supreme Court\". On 4 April 1922 he was appointed director general of prisons, a position in which he remained until December 11 of that year. He held many other public positions, including that of general inspector of the Stamp.

Under his leadership, the Spanish national team made its debut in a FIFA World Cup, in the 1934 edition in Italy, and he was also the first president of the Federation who devised setting a match between the League champion and the Cup champion, the so-called Spanish Super Cup, but their idea was destroyed by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. This project only came to fruition in 1940 with the Copa de los Campeones de Espa\u00f1a, which was won by Athletic-Aviation Club.\nGarc\u00eda Dur\u00e1n was also the director of the Patronato de Apuestas M\u00fatuas Deportivas Ben\u00e9ficas (Charitable Sports Mutual Betting Board).\nPersonal life\nGarc\u00eda Dur\u00e1n was Viscount Consort of Matamala by marriage to Countess Mar\u00eda del Carmen de Marichalar y Bruguera, with whom he had three daughters Carmen, Mar\u00eda Teresa, and Mar\u00eda Asunci\u00f3n.\nDeath\nGarc\u00eda Dur\u00e1n died in Madrid on 16 April 1966, at the age of 83.

    "Fictional character from the X film seriesFor the 2022 film named after this character, see Pearl (2022 film).\nFictional character\nPearl is a fictional character from the X film series, played by Mia Goth. Pearl first appears as the antagonist in X (2022) and returns as the villainous protagonist and title character in its prequel, Pearl (2022). In X, Goth was cast as both Pearl and the final girl, Maxine, which Goth admitted she was unaware of initially. Director Ti West explained that this was to display the similarities between the two characters. Goth commented that she felt \"a lot of sympathy\" for Pearl in X and noted she preferred to think of Pearl as neither a villain nor a victim.\nBelieving the character would be the \"stand-out\" of X, Goth and West wrote a prequel to the film, set during World War I and Spanish flu pandemic, which was filmed immediately after X and had Goth reprising the role of Pearl. The prequel, named after the character, was set to focus on how Pearl's backstory led to her becoming a killer without making attempts to humanize her behavior. Goth characterized the younger Pearl as \"a dreamer\" and \"an emotional person who wears her heart on her sleeve and is quite sensitive\". Goth's performances and Pearl's character in both films received strong critical acclaim.\nAppearances\nPearl made her cinematic debut in X on March 18, 2022. In the film, which is set in 1979 Texas, Pearl and her husband, Howard (Stephen Ure), are an elderly couple living on a farm. Due to his age and heart condition, Howard is unable to have sex despite Pearl's attempts to seduce him. When a group of young filmmakers begin shooting a pornographic film, Pearl grows envious of their youth, motivating her to kill the film's director, RJ (Owen Campbell), crew member Wayne (Martin Henderson), and actress Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow), and become infatuated with the other actress, Maxine (Goth). Pearl and Howard later reunite and enter the guesthouse where Pearl is finally able to convince him to have sex with her. Once done, Howard shoots crew member Lorraine (Jenna Ortega) after catching her trying to escape. As they move her body, Howard has a heart attack before Maxine appears and threatens to shoot Pearl with an unloaded pistol. Pearl tries shooting Maxine with Howard's gun, but the recoil knocks her back onto the porch, breaking her hip. This allows Maxine the time to enter Howard's truck, reverse it to crush Pearl's head and escape.\nThe character returns in the prequel, Pearl on September 16, 2022. Set in 1918, the film showcases Pearl in her 20s. Pearl lives on her family's Homestead with her paralyzed father (Matthew Sunderland) and stern German mother, Ruth (Tandi Wright), while her husband Howard (Alistair Sewell) serves in the First World War. Pearl shows signs of psychopathy as she kills farm animals and physically abuses her father. Pearl meets a handsome projectionist (David Corenswet) after watching a movie whom she imagines to be a scarecrow that she masturbates with on the way home. Pearl's sister-in-law, Mitsy (Emma Jenkins-Purro) tells her about an audition to find dancers for a traveling troupe, which Pearl sees as her opportunity to escape her life. However, when Ruth finds a theater program Pearl hid, the two argue, resulting in Pearl accidentally igniting Ruth's dress and inflicting life-threatening burns when Pearl uses boiling water to douse the flames. Pearl drags Ruth to the basement before fleeing to the movie theater, where she has sex with the projectionist. The next day, he drives Pearl home, but when he attempts to leave, Pearl erupts into a fit of rage and stabs him to death with a pitchfork. She disposes of his body before smothering her father and leaving to attend the audition, where she is rejected, causing her to desperately plea that she is a star. Back home, Pearl goes into a lengthy confession to Mitsy regarding her resentment toward her husband, having an affair, and killing animals, her parents and the projectionist. Pearl then intimidates a stunned Mitsy into confessing that she won the audition before killing her with an axe. When Howard returns from the war, Pearl greets him with a pained smile.\nDevelopment\nMia Goth (pictured) plays both Pearl and Maxine in X. The dual casting was employed by director Ti West to emphasize the similarities between the characters.\nIn X, Mia Goth was cast as both the elderly antagonist, Pearl, and final girl, Maxine Minx, making her the only actress in the film given a double role. Director Ti West explained that this was to display the similarities between the two characters. As a theme in X was the juxtaposition between age and sexual liberation, Pearl was intended to act as a prediction of Maxine's future. Goth initially didn't know that she was being considered to play both Pearl and Maxine, explaining: \"The first time I read the script, I wasn't aware of that, and then I read it for a second time and my mind was just blown.

As a result of a 2022 constitutional referendum, the results of which were neither regarded as free nor fair, the ABPA was established as the \"highest representative organ of the people's government of the Republic of Belarus\", with the appointment of members scheduled for 2024. The newly constituted ABPA held its first meeting, the ABPA's seventh in total, on 24 April 2024, at which Lukashenko was appointed Chairman of the ABPA.\nLukashenko's appointment was widely rejected and ridiculed in independent media, with journalist Juryj Drakachurst\u00a0 referring to it as a \"second coronation\".\nSelection and authority\nIn line with a presidential decree adopted by Lukashenko, the Chairman of the ABPA is one of leading state positions, alongside the offices of President, Prime Minister, the heads of the Supreme and Constitutional courts, and the head of the Security Council, among other positions. The position is elected by a secret ballot of all delegates to the ABPA.\nThe Chairman of the ABPA has the authority to remove the president for violations of the Constitution of Belarus, as well as to override any legal acts by the Belarusian government which are viewed by the Chairman as contradicting Belarusian national security. The sole exception to this is legal judgements handed down by courts. Belsat TV argued that while the chairman's position is constitutionally not as strong as that of the presidency, it is de facto the strongest position in the country, particularly in a hypothetical instance where the presidency is held by someone besides Lukashenko.\n",

    "\nMusical artist\nPinetop Burks (August 7, 1907 \u2013 January 11, 1947) was an American Texas blues pianist and songwriter. He was part of the \"Santa Fe Group\", a loose ensemble of black blues pianists who played in the many juke joints abutting the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.\nLittle is documented of Burks life outside of his brief recording career.\nLife and career\nConish Burks was born in 1907, and apparently raised near Richmond, Texas, although only small detail of his life exists. He had a similar playing style to Rob Cooper and Robert Shaw. Shaw recalled meeting Burks and stated about him \"Connie Burks, a dark fellow, about my size, maybe a little thicker than me. When I met him, he couldn't play, so I showed him some. Three years later, when I was in Richmond again, he played better than me\".\nOn October 25, 1937, Burks recorded his only known output of six tracks.  This occurred in one session for Vocalion Records in San Antonio, Texas. Nevertheless, it was noted that Burks was a pianist with \"incredible technique and melodic feeling\". His recording included one track named \"Shake The Shack\", but it was in reality a variant of \"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\".  This presumably gave Burks his nickname. Most of his recorded repertoire saw Burks compose other varieties based on earlier material. It is documented that, in 1937, Vocalion released a 78rpm disc with side one containing \"Aggravatin' Mama Blues\" and side two being \"Jack of All Trades Blues\" (Vocalion 03979).\nBurks was part of the \"Santa Fe Group\", a loose ensemble of black blues pianists who played in the many juke joints abutting the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.\nHe disappeared from the scene in the late 1930s.  By 1941, he was enlisted and fought in World War II, but returned home due to being 'badly wounded'. Burks died on January 11, 1947, in Corpus Christi, Texas.\nAll of Burks's recordings were collated on the compilation album, San Antonio Blues 1937, released in 1994 by Document Records.\nSee also\nList of Texas blues musicians\n",

She also hosted a radio show for women from 1955 to 1973.\nShe was the first accredited journalist, from Ticino in Switzerland. She was actively involved in the fight for women's right to vote.\nCareer\nIva Cantoreggi studied at After attending the Lugano-Besso girls' college, and graduated in 1930 from the girls' vocational school in the city of Lugano, directed by Ines Bolla . She was hired in 1930 as secretary and stenographer at Gazzetta Ticinese , a daily newspaper then edited by Fulvio Bolla \u00a0.\nShe quickly made a name for herself as an editor. In 1938, she was admitted to the Association of Ticino Journalists. In 1949, she left the newspaper due to disagreements over women's suffrage.\nFrom 1954 to 1979, she was responsible for the Lugano office of the Italian-language editorial staff of the Swiss Telegraph Agency.

    "Spanish footballer\nRafael Oramas Navarro (13 April 1904 \u2013 21 April 1968) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for RCD Espanyol and Racing de Madrid.\nHe was the first in a family saga of football players, including Rafael Oramas Cabrera\u00a0 and Alexis Trujillo.\nPlaying career\nClub career\nRafael Oramas was born on 13 April 1904 in Las Palmas, and began his footballing career at his hometown club Santa Catalina, featuring alongside the likes of Espino and Jos\u00e9 Padr\u00f3n. His other brother, Pancho Oramas, was an excellent right winger who started in that famous primitive Uni\u00f3n Arenal. In 1924 he signed for the Club Marino, one of the main clubs in the Canary Islands, and in April 1925, he joined the ranks of Real Club Victoria\u00a0 and during a tour of the Canarian club on Catalonia, in which they faced clubs such as UE Sants, Sabadell, and Iluro SC, he was noticed by RCD Espanyol, who signed him in the summer of 1925, together with his teammate Padr\u00f3n.\nAlthough he had played as a midfield distributor in his previous teams, Oramas played as a center forward in Espanyol, being described as a player with a refined technique, serious, tenacious, and tireless. He was very skilled and at the same time very practical due to his regularity and his performance, occupying any position that was assigned to him. He participated in the American tour that Espanyol made to raise funds to cover the costs of the construction of the Sarri\u00e0 Stadium. He was also a member of the Espanyol team that won the 1929 Copa del Rey. On 10 February 1929, Oramas went down in history as one of the eleven footballers who played in the very first La Liga match in the club's history, in which he scored two goals to help his side to a victory over Real Uni\u00f3n.\nOramas played with Espanyol for four seasons until 1929, when the arrival of Domingo Broto meant Oramas ceasing to have the predominant role of previous campaigns, so he decided to leave at the end of the season, playing for Racing de Madrid (1929\u201330) and Recreativo de Huelva (1930\u201331) before retiring.\nInternational career\nDespite being from the Canary Islands, Oramas played two games for the Catalan national team, making his debut on 13 December 1925, in a friendly against Czechoslovakia at Sarri\u00e0, helping his side to a 2\u20131. Four years later, on 12 May, he earned his second cap for Catalonia in a friendly against FC Barcelona, where he either suffered a stroke in his leg that took him away from football or suffered a knee injury that made him lose his abilities and prevented him from performing at the highest level.\nDeath\nAfter retiring from playing football, Oramas dedicated himself to port freight traffic. He died in Barcelona on 21 April 1968, at the age of 64. A street in Las Palmas was named after him.\nHonours\n\nEspanyol\nCatalan championship\nChampions (1): 1928\u201329\nCopa del Rey:\nChampions (1): 1929\n",
    "Historic house in California, United States\nUnited States historic place\nThe Thomas Jefferson School is a historic elementary school building located in Sacramento, California designed in the Tudor Revival style. Designed by Sacramento School District\u2019s Architectural and Engineering Commission Chairman E.C. Hemmings and James S. Dean of local architecture firm Dean & Dean, and built by Robert Trost.\nHistory\nThe original Jefferson School building, constructed in 1870, was the oldest in Sacramento, before it was expanded as part of a school building program planned in the 1920s. The original building was considered too small and did not have enough windows to allow for sufficient sunlight.\nIn 1919 Superintendent of Schools Charles C. Hughes proposed a bond to fund a district-wide program of school construction, seeking to build three new schools including a high school. It also looked to add to two schools and abandon and rebuild seven existing schools, including Jefferson School, on new sites. Many of the old school buildings were too small for the growing population and wood-framed, which was vulnerable to fire. The $2,304,000 was passed by Sacramento voters in October 1919.\nIn November 1919, local architects appealed to the Board of Education to appoint an architectural commission that would design the school bond projects and be paid 6% of project costs. The directors were hesitant and wanted to reuse existing school plans, but architect E.C. Hemmings insisted the buildings be unique and that it would save on costs. In April 1920, the board appointed an Architectural and Engineering Commission consisting of architects Hemmings and Jens Peterson with structural engineer George Hudnutt, for a 4.5% commission. Hemmings was chairman of the commission and responsible for the plans and designs of the projects.\nAlthough the original plans looked to abandon the original building, the District was able to acquire the remainder of the south half of the site's block for $33,000. That spring, the contract for Hemmings-Peterson-Hudnutt was transferred to newly formed Dean and Dean.  The school architecture program carried on smoothly, as James S. Dean had been working on the Jefferson School design since the commission's inception.\nJefferson School became a distribution center for sugar rations during WWII.  The building was converted to administrative offices in 1949, where it was used until 2009 when it was converted to storage. $270,000 was budgeted and plans included construction of a school supply warehouse. Charles Dean was architect, with Harry Devine as supervising architect. The original building had its interior almost completely gutted and renovated. Additionally, a two-story addition was built at the rear (north) of the building, along with a one-story east wing. The 1948\u20131949 school year was the last time students attended school at the site.\nIn 2022, plans were proposed to restore and turn the building into modern housing.\nSee also\nSacramento, California\n",
    "Dominican politician\nNicholson Alexander Nathaniel Ducreay (20 December 1930 \u2013 1 July 2017) was a Dominican politician.\nEarly life\nDucreay was born on 20 December 1930 in Wesley. His mother, Enid Matilda Ducreay, was from Cochrane and her family owned the Stewart Hall Estate. His father, Nicholson Thomas, was headteacher of Wesley Primary School. Ducreay attended Dominica Grammar School in Roseau between 1944 and 1949. After graduation, he worked as a teacher at the Cochrane Primary School for three years, before establishing his own lumber business in Roseau.\nPolitical career\nThere was a turning point in Dominican politics on 24 May 1955 when Emmanuel Christopher Loblack and Phyllis Shand Allfrey established the new Dominica Labour Party (DLP). Ducreary was by this time well known in Roseau, particularly for his public speaking. Allfrey approached him in 1957 to ask him to join the DLP and run as a candidate for the Roseau North constituency in the 1957 Dominican general election. Ducreary won his election on 15 August and took his place in the legislature with two other DLP members: Edward Oliver LeBlanc and R. P. St. Luce. There were only eight constituencies at the time and the other five seats were held by the governing party, Frank Baron's Dominica United People's Party (DUPP).\nIn July 1960, DUPP legislators Lionel Laville and L. C. Didier resigned, forcing a new general election on 17 January 1961. Ducreay won re-election and the DLP won a majority of the increased eleven constituencies. In the newly-formed government, Ducreay was appointed as Minister of Trade and Production, under LeBlanc as chief minister. He held the position for five years, during which time the banana and citrus producers thrived and many new infrastructure projects were funded by the British Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. This included bringing \"roads, ports, new schools, health clinics and water supply systems among other developments to the island for the first time\".\nThe DLP was re-elected to government in a landslide on 7 January 1966, carrying ten of the eleven constituencies. The government quickly began to face issues, with internal dissension and the formation of the nascent Dominica Freedom Party (DFP) in 1968. In his role as a cabinet minister, Ducreay would sometimes step in for LeBlanc in foreign commitments, including representing Dominica at the 1968 establishment of the Caribbean Free Trade Association, a precursor to CARICOM. He was appointed Deputy Premier of Dominica on 1 March 1967.\nAhead of the 26 October 1970 general election, Ducreay and two other ministers, W. S. Stevens and Mabel Moir James, formed a new bloc to remove LeBlanc from the DLP on the basis that he was an autocrat. In response, LeBlanc established the LeBlanc Labour Party and beat all of his opponents in the election, with the exception of Stevens. Having lost the election, Ducreay left politics to return to his business. He later spoke favourably about the formation of the United Workers' Party in 1988. After the 2000 general election, a new generation of politicians sought out Ducreay's advice and he became an active supporter of the DLP again, as well as a radio commentator and platform speaker.\nPersonal life\nDucreay built his own house in lower Goodwill. He died on 1 July 2017 at his home in Roseau, at the age of 87. Prior to his death, he had suffered from kidney complications and hypertension.\n",
    "Species of plant\nHabit near Pardoo Station\nSwainsona pterostylis is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to northern parts of Western Australia. It is a low-growing or prostrate perennial herb, with imparipinnate leaves with mostly 11 to 19 broadly elliptic leaflets, and racemes of 5 to more than 30 purple or violet flowers.\nDescription\nSwainsona pterostylis is low-growing or prostrate perennial herb, that typically grows to a height of up to about 15\u201340\u00a0cm (5.9\u201315.7\u00a0in) high, and usually has 3 hairy stems. Its leaves are imparipinnate, mostly 40\u2013120\u00a0mm (1.6\u20134.7\u00a0in) long on a petiole, with mostly 11 to 19, broadly elliptic to narrowly egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, the side leaflets 5\u201330\u00a0mm (0.20\u20131.18\u00a0in) long and 2\u201310\u00a0mm (0.079\u20130.394\u00a0in) wide. There is a stipule 2\u201310\u00a0mm (0.079\u20130.394\u00a0in) long at the base of the petiole. The flowers are arranged in racemes 50\u2013300\u00a0mm (2.0\u201311.8\u00a0in) long with 5 to more than 30 flowers on a peduncle about 1\u20133\u00a0mm (0.039\u20130.118\u00a0in) wide, each flower 7\u201310\u00a0mm (0.28\u20130.39\u00a0in) long on a pedicel 2\u20133\u00a0mm (0.079\u20130.118\u00a0in) long. The sepals are joined at the base, forming a tube about 2\u00a0mm (0.079\u00a0in) long, the sepal lobes equal to or about as long as the tube. The petals are purple to violet, the standard petal about 9\u201310\u00a0mm (0.35\u20130.39\u00a0in) long and 10\u201314\u00a0mm (0.39\u20130.55\u00a0in) wide, the wings 8\u201310\u00a0mm (0.31\u20130.39\u00a0in) long, and the keel about 7\u20139\u00a0mm (0.28\u20130.35\u00a0in) long and 2.5\u20133.5\u00a0mm (0.098\u20130.138\u00a0in) deep. Flowering occurs from April to October, and the fruit is oblong to almost spherical, 6\u201312\u00a0mm (0.24\u20130.47\u00a0in) long and 5\u20138\u00a0mm (0.20\u20130.31\u00a0in) wide.\nTaxonomy and naming\nThis species was first formally described in 1825 by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who gave it the name Astragalus pterostylis in his Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis. In 1967, Reinier van den Brink transferred the species to Swainsona as S. pterostylis. The specific epithet (pterostylis) means \"having a style\".\nDistribution and habitat\nSwainsona pterostylis grows on coastal sandhills and red claypans, often in limy or salty soils in the Avon Wheatbelt, Carnarvon, Dampierland, Gascoyne, Geraldton Sandplains, Great Sandy Desert, Murchison, Pilbara and Yalgoo bioregions of northern Western Australia.\n",
    "Australian community spirit in 2023 World Cup\nThe Sydney Opera House lit up in support of the Matildas on 7 August, before the Australia vs. Denmark match\nIn the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, the performance of the Australia women's national soccer team (nicknamed \"the Matildas\") captivated nationwide attention and had a significant ongoing impact on the perception of women's sport in Australia. Some media outlets used the terms Matildas fever to describe the community spirit on display, and Matildas effect to express the team's impact.\nThroughout the tournament, more kits representing the Australian women's team were sold than for the national men's team (\"the Socceroos\"), for the first time. Every match featuring Australia sold out before the World Cup began. Australian TV viewership records were broken several times, with live viewing sites set up in major stadiums to cope with crowds growing each game. The Australia vs. England semi-final became the most-watched broadcast in Australian history, with 11.15 million watching on the Seven Network. It was the furthest an Australian soccer team had advanced in a World Cup. Both the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and other state leaders pushed for a public holiday if the Matildas won the tournament.\nAs a direct result of the Matildas' success, the Australian government pledged $200 million to improve women's sporting facilities. In the 2024 winter soccer season, clubs around the country reported a record number of registrations for female players, with a 34 percent increase compared to the year prior. This influx of new members overwhelmed many regional soccer clubs.\nThe Australian National University named Matilda the Word of the Year of 2023. A mural of the team was painted at Bondi Beach, and a statue outside of Suncorp Stadium was announced. As of March 2024, every professional game the Matildas have participated in following the World Cup has sold out.\nViewership\nAustralian TV broadcast viewership records were broken multiple times. The Australia vs. Denmark match on 7 August was watched by 3.56 million on average, eclipsing the audience of the NRL State of Origin series and every NRL Grand Final since 2016. On 16 August, the Australia vs. France quarter-final drew about 4.17 million viewers on the Seven Network, becoming the biggest broadcast of 2023 at the time. Four days later, the Australia vs. England semi-final became the most-watched broadcast in country's history, averaging 7.13 million viewers, with a total of 11.15 million watching at one point. That number did not take into account the crowds at pubs and viewing sites around the country watching, with three stadiums in Sydney screening the match to the public, in a first for the city.\nThe Seven Network delayed the start of their flagship 7 pm news bulletin to allow for the full quarter-final match to be shown live, in a rare move for the broadcaster. Further, the AFL delayed the opening bounce of the Carlton vs. Melbourne game that night. Stadiums in use that day including the MCG, SCG and Optus Stadium all showed the Matildas' match on their screens before and after the games of their respective fixtures.\nSocial impact\nThe Matildas competing in the Women's World Cup 2019\nCEO of Football Australia, James Johnson, said the Matildas' run was \"really bringing Australia  together\". Several New South Wales public schools held \"green and gold mufti-days\" on the day of the semi-final match.\nMany writers said that Australia's 7\u20136 penalty shootout win against France in the quarter-final round was an iconic cultural moment comparable to Cathy Freeman's 400 meter sprint win in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Referring to the game, Samantha Lewis for ABC News wrote: \"Years from now, when someone asks you to tell the story of the night the Matildas made World Cup history, what will you say? The France game. Maybe that will be all you'll need to say.\"\nAccording to research company Honeycomb Strategy, 69 percent of Australians said they were more likely to follow other women's sporting events following the Women's World Cup.\nWe are not so much watching a national team compete, as a changing nation at play...  overturned misconceptions of women\u2019s sport and more importantly, the place of women in contemporary Australia.\u2014\u200aCraig Foster, Australian retired soccer player\nEconomic impact\nDouble the amount of jerseys for the Matildas were sold during the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup compared to Socceroos jerseys in the Qatar World Cup the year prior. The Courier-Mail said the Matildas were responsible for a $50 million economic boom for Brisbane. British media company SportsPro said the Matildas' media value had built to $2.78 billion through the tournament.\nBoth the Prime Minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese, and other state leaders pushed for a public holiday if the Matildas won the tournament. Opposition leader Peter Dutton said this stance was a publicity stunt, and would have a dire economic impact.\n",
    "\nThe book that initiated the ban.\nThe 2024 Cumberland book ban was a controversial fifteen-day ban of same-sex parenting books from the eight libraries in the Cumberland public library system in New South Wales. The ban was enacted by the Cumberland City Council on 1 May and was rescinded on 15 May. The ban led to a wider discussion of book censorship in Australian libraries.\nMotion\nDuring a Cumberland City Council meeting on 1 May 2024, councillor and former mayor Steve Christou requested that the motion \"That Council adopt the 'Library Strategy 2024 - 2027' as outlined in Attachment 1 of this report\" be amended with \"subject to the following being undertaken: That Council take immediate action to rid same-sex parents books/materials in Council's library service\". The amendment was made without prior communication with Cumberland Public Library staff.\nChristou, who had previously called for bans to drag storytime and Welcome to Countrys, claimed to have received text messages from \"distraught local parents\"  who had found the book \"Same-Sex Parents\" by Holly Duhig in the junior non-fiction section. Five copies of the book had been in Cumberland libraries since 2019. Christou justified the motion by saying he was speaking for the Cumberland community.\nThe vote passed, with six councillors (Christou, Paul Garrard, Helen Hughes, Greg Cummings, Michael Zaiter, and Mohamad Hussein) voting in favour of the ban and five councillors (Ken Huang, Diane Colman, Glenn Elmore, Kun Suman Saha and mayor Lisa Lake) voting against the ban. Deputy Mayor Ola Hamed, abstained from the vote, saying she was a \"longstanding advocate for social justice\" but was concerned after receiving death threats after an earlier debate related to drag queen storytimes. Four councillors were not present.\nLabor Cumberland City Councillor Kun Huang announced the ban on social media, saying \"This kind of censorship by politicians should have no place in Australia.\"\nResponse\nCommunity\nA petition was created on 2 May by Cumberland resident Caroline Staples calling for the council to rescind the motion. Staples had family members who were LGBT. The plan to present the petition on 15 May. The petition gained over 10,000 signatures in 24 hours. By 15 May, the petition had over 40,000 signatures, though Christou said only 2400 of the signatories lived in Cumberland.\nChristou was mocked after he admitted that he had not read the book before banning it.\nSydney author Will Kostakis called the decision \"a dangerous precident.\"\nPoliticians\nNSW Arts Minister John Graham told the council that the ban could affect their funding and that it violated the freedom of access to information guidelines under the Library Act 1939 which states that materials \"should not be excluded from a public library on moral, political, racial, religious, sexist, language, or other grounds\" and threatened that the council could risk its library funding. Christou responded \"If the government wants to take away funding from one of the most socially disadvantaged communities in NSW because their democratically elected council stood up for the values which they believe represents their local community, well shame on them.\" Graham also criticised Christou after Christou admitted he had not read the book.\nNSW premier Chris Minns called the ban \"ridiculous\" and \"a joke\"  and suggested the move may have been timed because of an upcoming election.\nInner West Mayor Darcy Byrne criticised the ban by saying \"If someone as deliberately divisive as Councillor Steve Christou thinks the Inner West is too inclusive and respectful, we wear that as a badge of honour\" and called the vote \"pathetic\".\nNSW Health Minister Ryan Park disapproved of the ban, saying, \"If we're going to have a council operate and start to become a censorship body, then we will have a look at the public funds that we provide them. I don't think it's a wise idea for a council to start censoring what their local residents and ratepayers choose to read or not.\"\nLabor MP Rose Jackson wrote on Twitter \"Stop being weirdly obsessed with how other ppl live their private lives and thinking you look tough punching down on minorities. It's pathetic\" \nOrganisations\nThe Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) released a statement on 8 May promoting freedom of information, and said they were \"appalled\" by the ban, and cited APLA-ALIA Standards and Guidelines for Australian Public Libraries, \"public library collections should cover a wide range of popular topics, express a variety of viewpoints and cultural understandings, and represent a diversity of people, places, events, issues and ideas.\" On 9 May, the CEO of ALIA Trish Hepworth met with ABC News and said that the ban was part of a trend of increasing attempts to ban books in libraries, following similar trends in the USA, particularly regarding LGBT content. ALIA later released a further statement saying they had pro-bono lawyers helping write to the Cumberland Council d",

    "2024 sci-fi novel by Joshua Calvert\nThe Object is a 2024 hard first contact science fiction novel written by Joshua T. Calvert. It is about a scientist who discovers an extrasolar object which has entered the Solar System under mysterious circumstances.\nPlot\nDr. Melody \"Mel\" Adams is a scientist working at a NASA base in Hawaii. In January 2023, she discovers a strange object near Pluto, which is initially thought to be a comet due to a glow around the object and an elongation assumed to be the tail of the comet. However, Mel realizes that the object which she calls the \"visitor\" might be an extrasolar spaceship. She proposes this theory in a book titled Extraterrestrial, which becomes a best-seller. However, she is expelled from NASA due to her ideas.\nTwo years later, amidst a talk show, members of the Secret Service come to take Mel. She meets Jim Rothman, the Administrator of NASA, whom she secretly loves. He confirms that her hypothesis was correct, and NASA is planning to set up a combined mission with the ESA at Houston to research the object, which is named \"Serenity\". They receive the support of President Brosnahan. Mel is recruited back into NASA, but cannot become an astronaut, because years before, in the astronaut examination, another candidate named Bernard had cheated, stealing her spot. Serenity momentarily disappears behind Saturn's icy rings, but soon appears again.\nSoon, a crewed mission to Serenity is planned, and a team of six astronauts including Bernard, Dr. Selena Rogerton, Gabriella Mancarella and Dr. Thomas \"Tom\" Ehrmann. Due to political reasons, the Chinese also decide to collaborate, and so two of the astronauts are replaced by Chinese taikonauts, Col. Ye Zhigang and Col. Wang Hongbo. Bernard is injured and is replaced by Melody, who is also the commander of the mission.\nA spaceship called Pangaea or Pangu Dalu in Mandarin, is built, and is launched in 2031. It is designed to land on Serenity which is fast approaching Mars. During an EVA, Gabriella is killed by micrometeorites. Aboard the ship, Mel, Tom, Selena and Hongbo experience the same dream of floating in deep space. Pangaea lands on the rotating Serenity, and the astronauts begin studying its nature. Tom reveals that is covered by diatoms and polyps and appears to be bionic.\nA hole is created on the surface. Mel, Tom, Selena and Hongbo enter the hole, while Zhigang stays aboard Pangaea. The astronauts are attacked by a black fluid and discover that the hole has been sealed by a callus. Selena dies due to impact after falling, and is covered by green snail-like pustules.\nThe astronauts explore the network of tunnels and realize that the black fluid flows with a periodic tremor and air-flow every 11 minutes 8 seconds. Mel slips and enters a large chamber containing a tree-like neural structure with slow blue-colored flashes of light. Hongbo reaches there too, but after cutting some flesh, is thrown into the network and dies. Her suit is damaged by the green snails which enter inside and cover her corpse.\nMel escapes from the chamber. She meets Tom and they fire a rope to the callus using a potato cannon. When the rope begins shaking, Tom boosts it up again, while the gas throws Melody into Serenity. They realize that Serenity is an organism with a brain, blood vessels, immune cells, etc., but a slow metabolism to facilitate interstellar travel. The dreams might serve as a form of communication from Serenity's side.\nMel enters the brain chamber and sees that Hongbo's suit and MMU have disappeared. She makes actions indicating greetings, and Hongbo's corpse appears to mimic those, while blue flashes flow through the network below her. Mel's mind is transmitted inside a virtual chamber in Serenity's brain, after the green \"slugs\" enter her body. She meets Serenity, who has assumed Hongbo's form to communicate with her. Serenity reveals that it is a living fully-conscious biological probe, developed by an intelligent species in the distant past to collect data about other intelligent species. This data is sent to a \"Data Center\" where the species shifted after a gamma ray burst destroyed their home. Serenity had traveled for eons, and had encountered many species, but due to the damage caused by humans, it had only fifty years to live. It reveals that for it, time appears to pass very quickly. Mel is given temporary control of her body, and she uses her spacesuit equipment to contact Zhigang and Tom, who are on the way back to Earth on Pangaea. They continue to monitor her audio and visual system. Mel returns to the virtual chamber and contacts Serenity in Hongbo's form, to ask it about the dreams. Serenity reveals that the dreams were a form of quantum entanglement communication system.\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that Tom has lived to the age of 140 years. Fujao is the Secretary-General of the United Nations and has set up many \"dream centers\" based on knowledge received from Mel's audio and video system. He has set up a ",
    "Japanese short story manga by Kyoko Okazaki\nNot to be confused with the manga of the same name by Akira Toriyama.\nPink (Japanese: \u30d4\u30f3\u30af, Hepburn: Pinku) is a 1989 Japanese manga by Kyoko Okazaki. Originally published by Magazine House, the manga follows the life of Yumiko, who works as both a call girl and an office lady. The story explores her relationships and how they are shaped by the social and economic climate of Tokyo in the 1980s. Pink is considered to be one of the first josei manga, a subset of manga aimed at adult women.\nPink was developed and published at the height of the Japanese asset price bubble, a period characterized by heavy consumerism and unchecked optimism. This sudden boom in the economy fueled a surge in disposable income, leading to a desire for luxury goods. Set against a backdrop of materialism, Pink explores themes of youthful rebellion, and critiques the excessive pursuit of extravagance.\nPink was well received by both critics and audiences alike for its social commentary and realistic portrayal of Tokyo in the 1980s. Considered Okazaki's breakthrough work, Pink significantly influenced both josei and shojo (targeted towards teenage girls) manga genres. Pink was re-released in Japan on July 29, 2010, with a new cover. An English translation published by Vertical Inc was released on November 15, 2013.\nSynopsis\nThe story starts with Yumiko working at a love hotel. Afterwards Keiko, Yumiko's stepsister, reveals that her mother is having an affair with a younger man named Haruo. Through a chance encounter, Yumiko develops feelings for Haruo herself and learns of his struggles as a novelist. Despite their unconventional dynamic, their bond strengthens. Eventually, due to a flooding at her apartment, Yumiko moves in with Haruo.       \nTokyo in the 1980s, the main setting of Pink\nTogether, Yumiko, Haruo, Keiko, and Yumiko's pet crocodile Croc slowly start to resemble a family. Haruo overcomes his writers block by cutting and pasting passages from other stories to create his own novel. Their newfound life together takes a turn when Yumiko's stepmother, enraged by their relationship, steals Croc and turns him into a leather suitcase. This plunges Yumiko into a deep depression. Meanwhile, Haruo wins a writing competition for his novel. He plans to use the money from the competition to move with Yumiko to a tropical island.       \nBefore they can leave, Haruo is involved in a fatal car accident while returning home from an interview. The story concludes with an image of the Yumiko forever marked by the loss of her lover and pet, waiting in vain for the fulfillment of her dream life.\nCharacters\nYumiko (\u3086\u307f\u3053, Yumiko)\nA twenty-two year old office lady, nicknamed Yumi (\u30e6\u30df, Yumi) who moonlights as a call girl in order to buy food for her pet crocodile.

    "Irish newspaper proprietor and spy\nFrancis Higgins, also called the \"Sham Squire\", (1746 \u2013 19 January 1802) was an Irish newspaper proprietor and spy.\nBiography\nHiggins was the son of humble parents, who migrated from Downpatrick in Ulster to Dublin. Higgins passed his early years in menial employments, became an attorney's clerk, was converted to Protestantism, and, by practising gross deception, married a respectable lady, whose relatives in 1766 prosecuted him for fraud. Higgins was convicted, and was for some time imprisoned. To this incident was attributed Higgins's sobriquet of the \u2018Sham Squire.\u2019 After his release he formed lucrative connections with lottery-offices and gambling-houses. He was admitted an attorney at Dublin in 1780, and secured the posts of deputy-coroner and under-sheriff. Higgins became owner of the newspaper styled \u2018The Freeman's Journal,\u2019 which, with his own services, he placed at the disposal of the administrators of the government at Dublin. Thenceforth Higgins continuously assailed in his paper the opponents of the government, and Henry Grattan denounced in parliament the mendacities and unscrupulous conduct of the journal. In 1788 Higgins was appointed a magistrate by Lord-chancellor Lifford. John Magee, in his paper, the \u2018Dublin Evening Post,\u2019 published numerous satires in prose and verse on Higgins and his associate, Richard Daly. Magee exposed Higgins's antecedents, and denounced him as a venal journalist, a corrupt magistrate, and a proprietor of houses of ill-repute. In 1790 Higgins prosecuted Magee for libel in the court of king's bench. Through Higgins's alleged influence with John Scott, earl of Clonmel, lord chief justice, he obtained, by authority of that court, writs styled \u2018fiats,\u2019 under which the defendants were liable to imprisonment till they found surety for the entire amount claimed as damages. These proceedings formed the subject of discussion in the House of Commons of Ireland. Lord-chancellor FitzGibbon removed Higgins from the magistracy in 1791, and in 1794 he was struck off the roll of attorneys. In 1795 he warned the government of a projected attack on the new lord-lieutenant, Lord Camden. Through the under-secretary, Edward Cooke, with whom he had had previous relations, Higgins secretly communicated to the Irish government in 1798 particulars as to persons connected with the revolutionary movements in Ireland. The governmental account of secret service money, under date of 20 June 1798, contains an entry of a payment of 1,000l. to \u2018F. H.\u2019 for the discovery of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. The initials are those of Higgins. Cooke recommended Lord Castlereagh to appropriate a pension of 300l. per annum to Higgins, on the ground that he had given him much information and all the intelligence which had enabled him to effect the arrest of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Higgins died in affluence at Dublin on 19 January 1802, and was buried in the cemetery of Kilbarrack.\n",
    "\nThe De\u010dan operation is the operation when Serbian Special Police Units and the Special Operations Unit were against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in early June 1998. The aim of the operation was to eliminate the Albanian militants to gain wider space for the De\u010dan municipality in the southwestern part of Kosovo, which has been held by the KLA between April and May 1998. The KLA attacked the police and civilians affecting the local population. Due to the complete blockade of this area and the impossibility of the normal functioning of daily life activities, the security forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia carried out an unblocking operation during which the KLA units were overwhelmed and forced to retreat.\nBackground\nDuring the spring of 1998, the Kosovo Liberation Army grew into a large militant organization. The entire Albanian population of Metohija and Drenica took up arms. The KLA concentrated significant forces in the southwest of Kosovo, in the border area between Serbia and Albania (In the areas of De\u010dan and \u0110akovica) in order to receive the weapons that were transported daily over the difficult-to-pass the Junik and Pa\u0161trik mountains. The town of De\u010dan and the surrounding villages were the target of terrorist attacks on civilians and police patrols in 1996 and 1997, and it can rightly be said that the militant activity of the KLA began in this area. The Jablanica KLA formation under the command of Ramu\u0161 Haradinaj occupied a certain number of villages around the road \u0110akovica - De\u010dan - Pe\u0107, keeping this road under a complete blockade.\nAt the beginning of the spring of 1998, all Serbian villages from Pe\u0107 to De\u010dan remained almost deserted. The Serb fugitives moved mostly towards De\u010dan, where it was particularly dramatic. This place was completely surrounded by KLA forces for several months, cut off from the territory under the control of the security forces of the Republic of Serbia, crowded with Serbian refugees, without electricity and telephone connections. In the spring of 1998, the KLA carried out several military operations around De\u010dan, which further worsened the security situation. The period from April 19 to 22 was particularly critical when there were heavy clashes between the police and the KLA in the village of Babalo\u0107\u00a0, and as many as 123 Serbian refugee families from Babalo\u0107 had to temporarily move to De\u010dan.\nThe situation in the De\u010dan and Pe\u0107 regions worsened the most at the end of May 1998. It all started on May 24, when the police surrounded and destroyed a KLA unit in the village of Prilep, when one militant was killed and several others were wounded. In the following days, the militants carried out several revenge attacks. On May 25, police officers Rade Popadi\u0107 and Nikola Jovanovi\u0107 were kidnapped near the village of Babalo\u0107, and police officer Gojko Gojkovi\u0107 was attacked near the village of Istini\u0107\u00a0. On the same day, KLA terrorists ambushed three civilians near the village of Ljubeni\u0107\u00a0. On May 26, Julka \u0110uri\u010dkovi\u0107 was killed with a firearm in De\u010dan. Her body was found by her husband Veljko, who then committed suicide. On the following day, attacks with firearms on vehicles on the roads continue around De\u010dan. On May 29, KLA militants attacked a police unit that tried to break through the ring around De\u010dan and supply the town. On the same day, police officer Dragan Djelanovi\u0107 was killed in an attack on the police station in Celopek\u00a0, and Radojica Jankovi\u0107 was seriously wounded. In the evening of May 30, two policemen were slightly wounded in the area of De\u010dan. In the village of Lo\u0107ane\u00a0, near De\u010dan, on May 31, an old woman, Vidosava Simovi\u0107, was killed in an attack. On May 31, police officer Du\u0161an Uro\u0161evi\u0107 was killed in the vicinity of De\u010dan in a conflict with terrorists.\nThe Operation\nThe De\u010dan operation began on June 1 of 1998 and it was one of the first battles in the heart of Kosovo against the KLA. Already on June 3, the Reuters agency reported that the Serbian security forces unblocked and cleared the town of De\u010dan and the surrounding area from KLA forces. The fighting for the unblocking of De\u010dan, which had the characteristics of a real war operation, lasted for 2 days and in them one policeman was killed and five were wounded. The policeman who died was a member of the JSO, \u017deljko \u0160ijan (1960), who was killed in a conflict with terrorists in the village of Gornji Crnobreg\u00a0 near De\u010dan, when the Serbian police destroyed a larger unit. Fighting also took place in the area of the areas of Pe\u0107, Istini\u0107\u00a0 and Beleg, which are located along the Albanian border. During the operation, one member of the police said: (in Serbian) \u0423\u0436\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0458\u0435. \u041f\u0443\u0446\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043e \u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043c \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430\nRepresentatives of the Kosovo Albanians claimed that dozens of their compatriots died in the fighting, while the police announced that there were no civilian casualties, only militant ones.

Tung has collaborated extensively with directors John Woo, Tsui Hark, and Wong Kar-wai, contributing to films such as A Better Tomorrow (1986) and Hard Boiled (1992) (directed by Woo), The Blade (1995) and The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021) (directed by Tsui), and As Tears Go By (1988) and 2046 (2004) (directed by Wong). Tung won Best Action Choreography in the Hong Kong Film Awards seven times with Downtown Torpedos (1997), Purple Storm (1999), The Accidental Spy (2001), Seven Swords (2005), Bodyguards and Assassins (2009), Kung Fu Jungle (2014), Operation Mekong (2016), and Bursting Point (2023), making him the most awarded individual in this category.\nIn addition to action choreography, Tung has also taken on acting and directing roles. He directed the horror film Magic Cop (1990) and the action film Hitman (1998), and is best known for his leading roles as Fong Sai-yuk and Lam Ping-chi in the martial arts series The Young Heroes of Shaolin (1981) and The Smiling, Proud Wanderer (1984) respectively.\nEarly life\nTung was born on 2 February 1954 in Shanghai, China. He was smuggled to Hong Kong with his grandmother at the age of four. Due to their family's financial situation, his grandfather sent him to learn wing chun and practice Cantonese opera with actress Ju-hua Fen\u00a0, instead of going to school. Tung was only enrolled in primary school at the age of eleven, upon his aunt's request, but his grandfather withdrew him after the third year to support their livelihood. Tung starred in the war film Squadron 77 as a child actor in 1965 and began working as a stunt double when he was sixteen.\nCareer\nEarly ventures (1970-1992)\nTung followed actor and action choreographer Han Ying-chieh to Taiwan to pursue a career in action choreography in the 1970s. He dedicated several years to researching action choreography, drawing inspirations from Hong Kong and Japanese action films. He became a stunt coordinator in 1974, making his debut with the action film Golden Mask Killer. Tung returned to Hong Kong in 1981 and joined TVB as a contracted actor. He starred as Ding Siu-bak, alongside Adam Cheng and Angie Chiu, in the drama series The Hawk, and as martial artist Fong Sai-yuk in the martial arts series The Young Heroes of Shaolin\u00a0, in the same year. His performance impressed producers Yau Ka Hung\u00a0 and Lee Ting-leun\u00a0, and was offered a lead role in the drama series The Restless Trio and portrayed Lam Ping-chi\u00a0 in the martial arts series The Smiling, Proud Wanderer.\nIn 1986, Tung served as the action choreographer for John Woo's A Better Tomorrow and Tsui Hark's Peking Opera Blues. Tung maintained good relations with Woo, and the duo collaborated closely in the future, but Tung and Tsui had a falling out and dropped out of the project midway. Tung continued to work as a choreographer in the horror comedy film Mr. Vampire III and action film Magnificent Warriors the following year. In 1988, Tung participated in Wong Kar-wai's crime drama film As Tears Go By. Tung acknowledged Wong's creativity and boldness in producing action scenes, and the duo continued a close collaboration as well. In 1989, Tung choreographed Lam Ching-ying's horror film Vampire vs. Vampire and the horror comedy film Vampire Buster. In return for Tung's involvement, Lam starred in Tung's directorial debut, the horror comedy film Magic Cop later in 1990. Tung admitted that he did not enjoy directing as he struggled with interpersonal relationships and chose to remain focused on action choreography. Tung also returned to collaborate with Wong Kar-wai in the drama film Days of Being Wild in 1990 and with John Woo in the action thriller film Hard Boiled in 1992.\nRise and critical recognition (1994-2002)\nIn 1994, Tung choreographed and executive produced the drama film The True Hero\u00a0, for which he received a nomination for Best Action Choreography in the 31st Golden Horse Awards. In 1995, Tung served as the action choreographer for Tsui Hark's martial arts film The Blade. Despite their falling out while filming Peking Opera Blues, the two reunited through the Hong Kong Film Directors' Guild and developed a better understanding of each other after communicating. Tung joined The Blade only in the last two weeks of filming, when Tsui thought of asking Tung to help out in the final stages. The film earned Tung a nomination for Best Action Choreography in the 15th Hong Kong Film Awards. In the same year, Tung directed the action film Fox Hunter and choreographed the crime drama film Shanghai Grand, for which the latter received a nomination in the 16th Hong Kong Film Awards.\nIn 1997, Tung choreographed Teddy Chan's action film Downtown Torpedoes\u00a0, which earned Tung his first award fo",
    "2024 novel by David Nicholls\nYou Are Here is a 2024 romance novel by British writer David Nicholls. The novel centers on two middle-aged protagonists, who unexpectedly find themselves together on a long-distance walking trail across northern England after being brought together by a mutual friend.\nThe novel explores themes surrounding modern love, loneliness, second chances, and the search for human connection, continuing Nicholls' exploration of romantic relationships across different life stages that he pursued in previous works like One Day, Us, and Sweet Sorrow. It received positive reviews from critics,  who praised Nicholls's writing style, characterization, and ability to capture the complexities of modern love and loneliness.\nPlot\nRoute taken in the novel\nThe novel is written in alternating perspectives from two middle-aged, divorced and lonely characters \u2013 Marnie Walsh, a 38-year-old copy editor from London, and Michael Bradshaw, a 42-year-old geography teacher from York. Their mutual friend Cleo organizes a group to go on a long-distance walking trip across northern England, inviting both Marnie and Michael in hopes it will help them engage with the world again after their marriages failed.\nAt first, Marnie is interested in another member of the group, Conrad, but he soon drops out along with the others. This leaves just Marnie and Michael to continue the walk together, starting from the Irish Sea and making their way across the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, and the North York Moors. Though Marnie had planned to participate for only the first few days, she keeps extending her time on the trail to spend more time with Michael.\nOver the course of their journey, Marnie and Michael develop romantic feelings for each other and they kiss, though they stop short of being intimate when a hotel worker enforces the \"no guests after 10pm\" policy. Just as Marnie is considering staying for the final leg, she discovers that Michael is meeting with his estranged wife Natasha, to whom he admits he is still attached. Heartbroken, Marnie returns home to London, while Natasha is revealed to be pregnant by her new partner.\nMonths later, Michael arranges a school trip to London where he and Marnie reunite in Hyde Park. He apologizes, professes his feelings for her, and invites her to complete the unfinished coast-to-coast walk with him. They kiss, and Marnie agrees to consider his proposal.\nThemes\nYou Are Here explores themes of love, loneliness, and second chances in middle age. The novel deals with the complexities of modern love and the challenges of finding connection in an increasingly isolated world. Nicholls delves into the lives of two characters who have been bruised by past relationships and are struggling to re-engage with the world around them, examining the ways in which people can become trapped in their own solitude and the courage it takes to break free from those patterns. The novel also touches on the theme of redemption, as the protagonists, Marnie and Michael, embark on a journey of self-discovery and personal growth.\nBackground\nNicholls considers You Are Here the best thing he has written, \"a love story in a classic style, a chamber piece that happens to take place on an epic journey from the west to east coast\". The novel continues Nicholls' exploration of themes surrounding love and relationships that he has pursued across his work, including his successful third novel One Day. Nicholls described his novels as covering \"love and the experience of love, and what it's to like fall in and out of love between the ages of 16 and 58\" \u2013 with protagonists ranging from Douglas at 58 at the end of his fourth novel Us, to Charlie at 16 at the start of his fifth novel Sweet Sorrow. With You Are Here, Nicholls said \"I wanted to write about the bit in the middle.\"\nNicholls revealed that You Are Here arose indirectly from the experience of the COVID-19 lockdowns, and a self-conscious re-engagement with social interaction afterwards, saying \"I wanted to write a love story about loneliness... A little bit wary and nervous about the whole business of human interaction, as if it was a skill that I'd forgotten.\"\nThe novel is set along the roughly 190-mile coast-to-coast route in England that the characters traverse, a path devised by Alfred Wainwright in the early 1970s as his preferred east-west route across northern England. Nicholls himself walked the route, taking photographs and using his experiences to inform the story's setting and pacing. He structured the novel's story beats around key locations and experiences from his own multi-day trek. However, he has warned readers trying to visit locations in the novel, stating that many places mentioned are fictional.\nNicholls aimed to balance the melancholy and introspection of the characters' journeys with humor and a sense of hopefulness. He wanted readers to find the novel \"properly laugh out loud funny\" while also resonating with the characters' experienc",

The Islanders are cut off from the outside world and are under constant video surveillance. To survive in the villa, the Islanders must be in a relationship with another Islander. The Islanders couple up for the first time on first impressions but will later \"re-couple\" at special ceremonies where they can choose to remain with their current partners or to switch partners. At the villa, the couples must share a bed for sleeping and are permitted to talk with other Islanders at any time, allowing them to get to know everyone. While in the villa, each Islander has his or her own telephone, with which they can contact other Islanders via text and can receive text messages informing them of the latest challenges, dumpings, and re-couplings. While the Islanders might appear to have unmediated access to the outside world, they are limited in both their alcohol consumption and communication with the outside world.\nThe Islanders are presented with many games and challenges that are designed to test their physical and mental abilities, after which the winners are sometimes presented with special prizes, such as a night at the Hideaway or a special date.\nIslanders can be eliminated, or \"dumped\", for several reasons; these include remaining single after a re-coupling and by public vote through the Love Island mobile app. During the show's final week, members of the public vote to decide which couple should win the series; the couple who receive the most votes win.\nAt the envelope ceremony on finale night, the couple who received the highest number of votes from the public receive two envelopes, one for each partner. One envelope contains $100,000 and the other contains nothing. The partner with the $100,000 envelope may choose whether to share the money with his or her partner as a test of trust and commitment.\nIslanders\nThe original islanders were announced on June 4, 2024.\nIslanders include Robert Rausch, who previously appeared on the previous season as a Casa Amor bombshell, Aaron Evans, who won season 1 of The Traitors UK, and Kordell Beckham, who is the younger brother of Odell Beckham Jr..\nCoupling\nThe couples will be chosen shortly after the islanders enter the villa.\nEpisodes\nMain article: List of Love Island (American TV series) episodes\n",

    "2024 American television special\nEpisode of South Park\n\"South Park: The End of Obesity\" is a 2024 American adult animated comedy television special episode. It is the seventh South Park television special,  and the 328th episode of the series overall. The special premiered on May 24, 2024, on Paramount+.\nThe special satirizes celebrities' glamorized usage of weight loss drugs (such as Ozempic), as well as Lizzo, Big Sugar, and the inaccessibility of the American health care system.\nPlot\nEric Cartman and his mother Liane visit the doctor, concerned with his weight. Refusing exercise, Cartman is informed of the weight loss properties of Ozempic, which lets him immediately dream of not being counterattacked on his obesity while insulting any person, including those in Pakistan. However, his mother is unable to afford the new drugs, as they are not covered by insurance for weight loss purposes.\nButters Stotch and Kyle Broflovski see Cartman's abnormal desperation, and decide to go with him to the insurance company. They are brought to an outdated receptionist for making a claim. After a long and complicated journey through the American health care system, they are still unable to get Ozempic for Cartman, and decide to make it themselves after learning from TikTok. Meanwhile, Randy Marsh tries to embarrass his daughter, Shelley, by wearing one of her crop-tops to pick her up from school. Many of the town's moms have been slimming their waists by using various semaglutide drugs, and exposing their midriffs at all times. When they see Randy wearing a crop-top, they assume he is doing the same thing and invite him to one of their parties. Randy joins in taking the injections, believing it to be some new party drug with no hangover, and possibly experiencing the placebo effect. \nThe first dose made by the boys and taken by Cartman seems successful in curbing his appetite, encouraging Kyle to produce more in order to benefit all the people who could not afford the drug. News of their counterfeit Ozempic reaches a mafia cartel consisting of breakfast cereal mascots profiting from the sugar industry, who agree to take down the boys' new drug manufacturing base.\nAs legitimate Ozempic starts to run short, the moms and Randy start robbing pharmacies and eventually the boys. The mascots shoot up the semaglutide plant in India that the boys rely on, and secretly promote the body positivity drug \"Lizzo\", which suppresses the hope for weight-loss. In a last-ditch effort to get semaglutides, Kyle orders them wholesale. The truck delivering the last batch of semaglutides is ambushed by the moms and Randy, who gets cold feet and drives off with it. The boys get in the truck as it is being pursued by the cereal mascots and the moms. They eventually ward the mascots off, at the cost of Kenny McCormick being killed by Tony the Tiger. Once the boys open the truck, it is revealed that it contains the outdated receptionist from the insurance company, revealing that the way to get semaglutides in the country is yet again a long and complicated journey through the American health care system.\nAfter Sharon takes the Lizzo drug, supplemented by listening to Lizzo's music, she begins defecating out of her ears. This condition allows the doctor to prescribe her Ozempic. Randy finds Sharon before she takes her first injection and convinces her it's no fun. They decide to do some good drugs instead; namely, molly. Kyle gives a speech calling for the end of fat shaming, causing Cartman to joyously insult classmates without repercussions; he then boards a flight bound for Pakistan in order to fulfill his dream.\nPromotion and release\nThe teaser trailer, released on May 15, 2024, has Eric Cartman meeting with a doctor, who says that they need to resort to \"drastic measures\" to reduce his weight. It then shows Kyle Broflovski discouraging Cartman from using something, but Cartman says, \"Let's do it\". It also shows Randy Marsh and Butters Stotch discussing the weight loss drugs and the American health care system.\nVoice cast\nTrey Parker\nMatt Stone\nApril Stewart\nMona Marshall\nKimberly Brooks\nJessica Makinson\nVernon Chatman\nJennifer Howell\nFeraz Ozel\nBetty Boogie Parker\nAbdullah Saeed\nDevelopment\nOn August 5, 2021, Comedy Central announced that Trey Parker and Matt Stone had signed a $900 million deal for extending the series to 30 seasons through 2027 and 14 feature films, exclusive to the Paramount+ streaming platform. It was eventually confirmed that they would be released as two films per year. Parker and Stone would later state that the projects would not be feature films, and that it was ViacomCBS who decided to advertise them as movies.\n",
    "\n2000 studio album by The Aislers Set\nThe Last Match is the second full-length studio album by American indie pop band The Aislers Set, released by Slumberland Records in 2000. It has received positive reviews from critics.\nReception\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 4.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Tim DiGravina writing that the band's style rises above its pop influences, such as Pet Sounds and His Name Is Alive and while he continued that \"the album suffers due to the band's style browsing, these songs \"suggest... that there's a great album lurking just beyond their influences and retro desires\". At Exclaim!, Cam Lindsey reviewed all three of the band's full-length studio albums upon their 2014 rerelease, scoring them a 9 out of 10, stating that this album has more of a band feel than the previous album that was dominated by songwriter and vocalist Amy Linton which brings \"more cohesion to the songs\". Editors at Pitchfork Media scored this release 8.1 out of 10 and critic Jason Heller called this release a \"near-perfect unpacking of\" the band's influences and continued that \"listening to the album is like popping bubble wrap, and just as satisfyingly addictive\". Writing for PopMatters in 2014, John\u00a0L. Murphy rated the band's first two albums a 7 out of 10 and characterized it as \"a challenge that perplexes as well as pleases the listener\" that \"can feel epic, if uneven, too\".

    "1st episode of the 1st season of Sh\u014dgun\n\"Anjin\" (Japanese: \u5b89\u91dd) is the series premiere of the American historical drama television series Sh\u014dgun, based on the novel by James Clavell. The episode was written by series developers Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks, and directed by co-executive producer Jonathan van Tulleken. It was released on Hulu on February 27, 2024, and it also aired on FX on the same day.\nThe series is set in 1600, and follows three characters. John Blackthorne, a risk-taking English sailor who ends up shipwrecked in Japan, a land whose unfamiliar culture will ultimately redefine him; Lord Toranaga, a shrewd, powerful daimyo, at odds with his own dangerous, political rivals; and Lady Mariko, a woman with invaluable skills but dishonorable family ties, who must prove her value and allegiance. \nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.764 million household viewers and gained a 0.14 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349. The series premiere received critical acclaim, with major towards the visuals, performances and production values. \nPlot\nIn 1600 Osaka, the reigning Taik\u014d has died, leaving five equal regents to maintain control of Osaka Castle. The Dutch trading ship Erasmus gets stranded off the coast of Ajiro after running into fierce storms and running out of food. A few survivors, including English pilot John Blackthorne, are taken prisoner when a party of samurai seize the Erasmus. \nOne of the regents, Yoshii Toranaga, is summoned before his colleagues: Ishido Kazunari, Kiyama ukon Sadanaga, Sugiyama Josui and Ohno Harunobu. Toranaga has been accused of consolidating his power and the other regents are seriously considering a motion by Ishido to impeach him, which would also condemn him to seppuku. Toranaga is not scared of their threat, as he claims his sole purpose is to protect the Taik\u014d's young heir, Nakamura Yaechiyo. One of Toranaga's men, Usami Tadayoshi, insults Ishido and is forced to commit seppuku for not only himself, but also his infant son, devastating his wife Fuji.\nBlackthorne is released from his cell and taken to face Kashigi Yabushige, Lord of Izu and a powerful vassal of Toranaga's clan. He realizes that Japan and Portugal have formed a secret trade route, with the Catholic Church's Jesuit order being the political and religious rivals of the Protestant Blackthorne. Yabushige's translator, a local Jesuit priest, immediately condemns Blackthorne as a pirate and suggests his execution. However, Yabushige decides to spare him, eager to use the Erasmus to gain Ishido's favor, and instead has one of Blackthorne's men boiled to death.\nToranaga's general, Toda \"Iron Fist\" Hiromatsu, arrives in Ajiro and forces Yabushige to turn over ownership of both Eramus and Blackthorne to him; the latter is placed under the supervision of Spanish navigator Vasco Rodrigues. As they return to Osaka, the ship is hit by a severe storm, forcing Blackthorne to assume command as he reorganizes the crew. However, Rodrigues is swept by the tides and washes ashore near a cliff. Blackthorne manipulates Yabushige into helping him rescue Rodrigues. Yabushige's rope breaks and he falls into the water; unable to swim, he draws his sword to commit suicide. However, he and Rodrigues are saved when a group of samurai bring them a new rope. Blackthorne is then taken to Osake Castle. Coming face to face with Toranaga and his translator, Toda Mariko, Blackthorne bows before them.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn January 2024, Hulu confirmed that the episode would be titled \"Anjin\", and was to be written by series developers Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks and directed by co-executive producer Jonathan van Tulleken. It was Kondo's first writing credit, Marks' first writing credit, and van Tulleken's first directing credit.\nWriting\nJustin Marks explained that the writers hoped they would not make tropes related to the \"stranger on a strange land\" depictions on other projects. Marks said he wanted \"a story about globalization\", exploring the culture through different lens.:\u200a3:43\u20134:40\u200a For the Japanese dialogues, the writers would make the scripts in English and, after consulting with researchers, send them to a team of translators in Tokyo to change it to a modern Japanese. Subsequently, the scripts were sent to an unnamed Japanese playwright specialized in jidaigeki to rewrite the dialogues into \"a more polished prose.\":\u200a5:50\u20137:18\u200a\nFilming\nHiroyuki Sanada, also serving as producer, was essential in the authenticity of the series. He convinced the crew in hiring Japanese crew in different departments, and showed on set every day to check on the production values, even before the director arrived. Before filming started, actors were subjected to a boot camp to train. One of the requirements were learning falcon training, and Sanada explained that the scene with the falcon was his first day of filming.:\u200a8:51\u201312:50\u200a\nReception\nViewers\nIn its original FX broadcast, \"Anjin\" was seen by an estim",
    "Tetradrachm marked KAIAP  (\"Caesar Pertinax\")\nPublius Helvius Pertinax the Younger (also Pertinax Minor; 180\u2013212) was a Roman politician, suffect consul of 212 AD and son of Emperor Pertinax. After the latter came to power in 193 AD, the Senate wanted to proclaim Pertinax the Younger as Caesar, but the emperor rejected this proposal. Pertinax the Elder was killed on the 88th day of his reign. His son survived and under Septimius Severus became a flamen of his father's cult, and under Caracalla a suffect consul. He was later executed as a possible contender for Imperial power.\nBiography\nPublius Helvius Pertinax the Younger was the son of Pertinax, a successful military commander in the Roman-Parthian and Marcomannic Wars, and a Provincial Governor of Moesia, Dacia, Syria and Britain. His mother was Flavia Titiana, daughter of the senator Titus Flavius Sulpicianus. A daughter was also born into this family, but is mentioned in only one source, but there is no information about her; even her name is unknown.\nPertinax the Younger first appears in connection with the events of January 193 AD, when his father was proclaimed emperor after the assassination of Commodus. The son of the new emperor was then still a teenager, so historians date his birth to approximately 180 AD. The senators, having proclaimed Pertinax the Elder emperor, wanted to make his wife Augusta and his son Caesar, but these honors were rejected: \"Let him deserve it\", Pertinax said about his son. Nevertheless, coins with his image and the title Caesar were minted for some time in the eastern provinces (in particular, in Egypt).\nDuring the reign of his father, Pertinax the Younger lived in the house of his maternal grandfather and remained a private citizen. At the end of March 193 AD, Emperor Pertinax was killed by the Praetorian guard, but his son's life was spared. The governor of Pannonia Superior, Lucius Septimius Severus declared himself avenger of the deceased emperor, occupied Rome, proclaimed himself emperor and won the civil war. Septimius Severus established the cult of Pertinax and made Pertinax the Younger a flamen (priest) of this cult.\nPertinax the Younger later served as suffect consul (presumably in 212 AD). However, in the same year he was executed by order of Caracalla. According to Julius Capitolinus, the emperor believed Pertinax was seeking power and that he was very popular and therefore dangerous. A mocking joke by Pertinax at Caracalla's expense made in connection with his murder of his brother Geta: Pertinax proposed calling the emperor the agnomen \"Getacus\" analogous to the title \"Germanicus\".\n",
    "Municipal building in Epping, Essex, England\nEpping Civic Offices is a municipal building in Epping, Essex, a town in England. The building, which accommodates the headquarters of Epping Forest District Council, is a grade II listed building.\nHistory\nAfter the Epping Union and Rural Sanitary Authority was succeeded by Epping Urban District Council in 1896, the council decided to use Epping Town Hall as its offices and meeting place. However, the company that had developed the town hall got into financial difficulties and the council had to use temporary facilities for its meetings, before relocating to Hawthorn Lodge on the opposite side of the High Street. Hawthorn Lodge continued to serve as the headquarters of the council for much of the 20th century, but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Epping Forest District Council was formed at No. 323 High Street in Epping in 1974.\nBy the late 1980s, the council needed more substantial offices. The council held a two-stage competition, judged by Piers Gough.  It received 51 entries, and the winner was Richard Reid and Associates, with a postmodern design. This incorporated the existing mid-19th century house, No. 323 High Street, which the council occupied, and an office block, built in the 1970s, which the council also occupied. Work on the new building started in 1987. Ove Arup and Partners acted as the structural engineers, and the building was completed in 1992.\nIn 2021, the council refurbished the building, removing some corridors to create open-plan offices, and creating a community hub and new meeting and conference spaces.  Following the refurbishment, the council sought to let the top floor to private companies.\nArchitecture\nThe central part of the building is a three-storey office block, with a concrete frame, and brick and stone cladding.  To its south-west is a two-storey, three-bay former house, No. 323 High Street, converted into offices, and to its rear is a 1970s three-storey, rectangular office block.  The three are connected by first- and second-floor corridors, while at ground floor level there is vehicular access to the rear car park.  Attached to the front of the building is a tall red-brick tower, rectangular at ground level, but octagonal in top two stages.  The tower has a stone cornice, and minimalist clocks on four sides.  North-east of the tower is a brick arch, providing access to the reception area, with a balcony above, and stone steps providing direct access to the council chamber and its gallery.  These are in a bow-fronted section, clad in reconstituted stone, with ground floor pilasters.  Further to the north-east is a seven-bay section with two oriel windows, and then a four-bay section placed further forward, again clad in stone, containing the staff canteen and council members' room.\nAfter the building was completed a series of letters criticising the design appeared in local newspapers. However, the project won a Regional Award (East Anglia) from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1993, and the architectural historian, Charles Jencks, described the design as a \"superb example\u2026of contextualism\". The building was grade II listed in 2017.\n",
    "Species of flowering plants\nOurisia simpsonii is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to high-elevation habitats in the South Island of New Zealand. Mary Kalin Arroyo elevated O. simpsonii to species rank in 1984. Plants of this species of New Zealand mountain foxglove are perennial, small-leaved herbs that are covered in a mixture of long glandular and non-glandular hairs. They have hairy, crenate, ovate leaves that are in a basal rosette. The flowers are single or in pairs in each node, with a zygomorphic calyx and corolla. The corolla is white and the corolla tube is yellow and glabrous inside, and purple outside. It is listed as Not Threatened.\nTaxonomy\nOurisia simpsonii (L.B.Moore) Arroyo is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. Lucy Moore first described O. sessilifolia var. simpsonii L.B.Moore in 1961, and Mary Kalin Arroyo elevated it to species level as O. simpsonii in 1984 due to the numerous morphological differences that distinguish them.\nThe type material was collected by Robert Brockie at Mt Garfield, South Island, New Zealand. The holotype is housed at the Allan Herbarium of Manaaki Whenua \u2013 Landcare Research, and there is an isotype at the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew.\nOurisia simpsonii is morphologically similar to other New Zealand small-leaved species, namely O. sessilifolia, with which it shares the subrosette or rosette habit, ovate to very broadly ovate or obovate to very broadly obovate leaves, irregular white corollas, and having a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs on many plant parts.\nO. simpsonii can be distinguished from O. sessilifolia by irregular calyces (vs. regular), flowers and bracts in pairs only (vs. sometimes in whorls), glabrous and yellow corolla tubes (vs. 1 or 3 lines of hairs and purple), and long glandular hairs that are the same size as the non-glandular hairs (vs. glandular hairs that are much shorter than the non-glandular hairs).\nDescription\nClose-up of flowers showing white corollas with corolla tubes that are glabrous and yellow inside, and purple outside near the base\nOurisia simpsonii plants are perennial herbs. The stems are creeping, with leaves that are opposite and tightly packed into rosettes or subrosettes. Leaf petioles are 3.3\u201317.3 mm long. Leaf blades are 6.8\u201330.4\u00a0mm long by 5.3\u201323.3\u00a0mm wide (length: width ratio 1.1\u20131.3: 1), ovate to very broadly ovate, or obovate to very broadly obovate, widest above or below the middle, with a rounded apex, cuneate base and regularly crenate edges. Leaves are densely hairy with a mixture of long glandular and non-glandular hairs on both surfaces, especially on the prominent veins on the lower surface, and punctate. Inflorescences are erect, with hairy racemes (sometimes densely hairy) up to 126\u00a0mm long, with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs, and with 1\u20133 flowering nodes and up to 5 total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node has 1\u20132 flowers and 2 sessile, sometimes clasping bracts that are narrowly to broadly obovate or oblanceolate. The lowest bracts are similar to the leaves, 7.5\u201311.4\u00a0mm long and 2.9\u20138.2\u00a0mm wide, and become smaller toward the apex of the raceme. The flowers are borne on a densely hairy pedicel that is up to 28.9\u00a0mm long and usually has a mixture of non-glandular and glandular hairs. The calyx is 5.7\u20138.7\u00a0mm long, irregular, with 3 lobes divided to one-third to one-half the length of the calyx and 2 divided to near the base, and often densely hairy with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs. The corolla is 17.7\u201319.6\u00a0mm long (including the 4.9\u201311.7\u00a0mm long corolla tube), bilabiate, tubular-funnelform, glabrous and white to purplish on the outside, and glabrous and yellow on the inside. The corolla lobes are 5.4\u201311.3\u00a0mm long, spreading, and usually obovate and slightly emarginate. There are 4 stamens up to 9.2\u00a0mm long which are didynamous, with two long stamens reaching the corolla tube opening or exserted, and 2 short stamens included inside the corolla or reaching the corolla tube opening; a short staminode 0.3\u20131.3\u00a0mm long is also present. The style is 4.9\u20137.5\u00a0mm long, exserted or reaching the corolla tube opening, with an emarginate stigma. The ovary is 2.0\u20132.9\u00a0mm long and glabrous. Fruits are capsules c. 5.0\u00a0mm long and c. 4.3\u00a0mm wide with loculicidal dehiscence and pedicels up to 29.5\u00a0mm long. The number of seeds in each capsule is unknown, and seeds are 0.8\u20131.0\u00a0mm long and 0.5\u20130.7\u00a0mm long, with a two-layered, reticulate seed coat.\nOurisia simpsonii flowers from November to April and fruits from January to March.\nFlowering plant of O. simpsonii showing rosette habit and hairy leaves, peduncle and pedicel\nThe chromosome number of Ourisia simpsonii is 2n=48.\nDistribution and habitat\nOurisia simpsonii is a New Zealand mountain foxglove that is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand.  It is found only in the northwestern regions of the South Island, namely Western Nelson, Canterbury and Westland in high-elevat",
    "\nRejhan R. Kurtovi\u0107 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0420\u0435\u0458\u0445\u0430\u043d \u0420. \u041a\u0443\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b; born 12 October 1986) is a Serbian academic and politician from the country's Bosniak community. He has served as a member of the National Assembly of Serbia and as a state secretary in the Serbian government. Kurtovi\u0107 is a member of the Justice and Reconciliation Party (SPP).\nEarly life and career\nKurtovi\u0107 was born in Sjenica, in the Sand\u017eak region of what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He earned a Bachelor of Laws degree in 2009.\nChief Mufti Muamer Zukorli\u0107's Bosniak Cultural Community opened an office in Sjenica in February 2010, and Kurtovi\u0107 was chosen as its manager. Shortly thereafter, Serbia held its first direct elections for the country's national minority councils. In the election for the Bosniak National Council, the electoral list of Zukorli\u0107's movement won seventeen seats as against thirteen for the Bosniak List led by Sulejman Ugljanin and five for the Bosniak Renaissance list of Rasim Ljaji\u0107. The results were extremely contentious, and the legitimacy of the Bosniak Cultural Community's victory was contested by both the Serbian government and Ugljanin's party. Zukorli\u0107's group held a constituent session for the council on 7 July 2010, which was also attended by two delegates from Bosniak Renaissance. This iteration of the council continued to meet afterward but was not recognized by the Serbian government. In January 2011, Kurtovi\u0107 was chosen as secretary of the breakaway council's committee on the protection of human rights and freedoms.\nIn 2012, Kurtovi\u0107 defended his master's thesis with the title, \"The role of national councils in realizing the rights of members of national minorities.\" Two years later, he defended a doctoral dissertation with the title, \"Minority rights and freedoms in the new international order and legislation of Serbia.\" He became an assistant professor at the law faculty of Zukorli\u0107's International University of Novi Pazar in 2014 and was promoted to associate professor in 2020. He is also an assistant professor at the University of Travnik and has lectured at the University of Business Engineering and Management in Banja Luka, both of which are in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nPolitician\nKurtovi\u0107's appeared in the sixth position on the Justice and Reconciliation Party's electoral list in the 2020 Serbian parliamentary election and was not elected when the list won four seats. When the national assembly was dissolved two years later, he was the next SPP candidate in sequence with the right to enter the assembly in the event of a vacancy.\nHe also appeared in the sixth position on the SPP's list for the Sjenica municipal assembly in the 2020 Serbian local elections, which were held concurrently with the parliamentary vote, and was elected when the list won nine mandates. Although the SPP narrowly lost the vote to the Party of Democratic Action of Sand\u017eak (SDA), it was able to form a local coalition government after the election with support from the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), and other parties. When the assembly convened in August 2020, Kurtovi\u0107 was chosen as its president (i.e., speaker). Three months later, the Party of Democratic Action of Sand\u017eak (SDA) and the Sand\u017eak Democratic Party (SDP) sought to overturn the SPP-led government and form a new administration in Sjenica; their efforts were unsuccessful, and in December 2020 Kurtovi\u0107 announced that the municipality's existing coalition would remain in place.\nIn September 2022, the SDP joined the municipal governing coalition in Sjenica. Kurtovi\u0107 resigned as assembly president and was replaced by Kamberovi\u0107.\nAfter the 2022 Serbian parliamentary election (in which Kurtovi\u0107 was not a candidate), the SPP joined Serbia's coalition government led by the SNS. Kurtovi\u0107 was appointed as a secretary of state in the ministry of human and minority rights and social dialogue in November 2022 and resigned from the municipal assembly the following month. Among his responsibilities in his first term as secretary of state was to inaugurate a social housing project specifically directed to the Roma community in Ra\u0161ka in August 2023. In March 2024, he spoke at a conference in Sarajevo on the protection of national minorities, promoting Serbia as a regional leader in the field.\nKurtovi\u0107 appeared in the third position on a coalition list led by the SPP in the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election and was not immediately elected when the list won two seats. He received a mandate on 1 May 2024 as a replacement for party leader Usame Zukorli\u0107, who had been appointed as a minister without portfolio in Serbia's government. In the assembly, Kurtovi\u0107 served on a working group for the improvement of the electoral process.\nOn 16 May 2024, Kurtovi\u0107 was appointed to a second term as secretary of state in the ministry of human and minority rights and social dialogue. By virtue of holding this role",
    "English writer\nJoseph Palmer, formerly Joseph Budworth, (1756 \u2013 4 September 1815) was an English writer.\nBiography\nPalmer  born in 1756, nephew of the Rev. William Budworth master of Brewood school, Staffordshire, was son of Joseph Budworth, originally of Coventry. At an early age he joined the 72nd regiment, or royal Manchester volunteers. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and proceeded with the regiment to Gibraltar. In the course of the siege of that fortress by the combined forces of France and Spain, he was severely wounded. He returned home with his regiment in 1783, and accepted a cadetship in the Bengal artillery, though he did not long remain in India. Subsequently, he retired from the service; but in the war occasioned by the French revolution, he volunteered as a captain in the North Hampshire militia. Shortly after leaving the army he married Elizabeth, sister of Roger Palmer, esq., of Rush, near Dublin, and of Palmerstown, co. Mayo, and succeeded, in her right, on the decease of her brother in 1811, to the estates and name of Palmer. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 4 June 1795 (Gough, Chronological List, p.\u00a058). He died at Eastbourne, Sussex, on 4 September 1815, and was buried on the 14th in the churchyard of West Moulsey, Surrey, to which parish he had been a liberal benefactor.\nHis only daughter and sole heiress, Emma Mary, became the wife of W.

She was the first American woman to achieve the rank of Master Mariner and command a cargo ship sailing internationally.\nEarly life and education\nDeborah Doane was born in Connecticut in 1949. In 1978, she married Jack Dempsey.\nIn 1971, Dempsey received a B.A. from the University of Vermont. In 1976, Dempsey received a B.S. degree from the Maine Maritime Academy as valedictorian of her class. At the time of her graduation as a cadet, she became the first woman in the United States to graduate from any maritime or service academy.\nNaval career\nDempsey began her career with Exxon Mobil as a Third Mate. She later moved to Lykes Brothers Steamship Company, where she advanced to a Master Mariner, becoming the first American woman to achieve the rank and to command a cargo ship on international voyages.\nShe was the first woman to become a regular member of the Council of American Master Mariners.

The crew performed rescue maneuvers and had Dempsey out of the water within minutes.\nRescue effort\nIn January 1993, Dempsey gained national recognition when she and her crew of four successfully rescued a drifting 634-foot freighter (with over 387,000 gallons of oil on board) threatening to crash onto the Frying Pan Shoals off the coast of North Carolina. She received a letter of commendation from President Bill Clinton for her efforts. Dempsey was credited with not only saving the 22 million dollar vessel but also with preventing a possible oil spill that could have devastated the North Carolina Coast.\nBoard memberships\nDempsey has served on the boards of various organizations and agencies, including the Bellingham Bay Community Boating Center, Oregon Board of Maritime Pilots, NOAA Hydrographic Services Review Panel (HSRP), and the HSRP Strategic Effectiveness Working Group.\nAwards, honors, and distinctions\nDempsey is the recipient of various awards and distinctions, including:\nFirst female graduate of any maritime or service academy in the United States\nFirst female to attain the rank of Master Mariner\nHonorary Doctor of Science degree, Maine Maritime Academy (1994)\nKeynote speaker, Maritime Administration Women on the Water Conference\nRecipient, Navy Meritorious Public Service Award\nRecipient, Lalonde \"Spirit of the Seas\" Award\nRecipient, Reader's Digest \u201cHeroes for Today\u201d Award\nRecipient, United Seaman's Service AOTOS Honored Seamen Award\nRecipient, Seamen's Church Institute Lifesaving Award\nRecipient, American Merchant Marine Seamanship Trophy\nInductee, Maine Maritime Academy Distinguished Alumni Wall of Honor\nNotable Naval Books of 1998, U.S. Naval Institute\nWorks\nDempsey, Deborah.

    "Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset by William Larkin\nThe Earl and Countess of Somerset, by Renold Elstracke\nThe costume of Kawasha may have been based on the frontispiece of Thomas Hariot's Briefe and True Report, 1590.\nThe Masque of Flowers was an entertainment on 6 January 1614 to celebrate the marriage of Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset and Frances Howard, Countess of Somerset.\nMasque for a wedding\nThe masque was performed by the gentlemen of Gray's Inn at the Banqueting House at Whitehall Palace. Francis Bacon gave \u00a32000 towards the expenses, refusing an offer of \u00a3500 from Henry Yelverton so that he would pay the whole charge and have the honour. Courtiers called it \"Mr Attorney's Masque\". Bacon owed his promotion to Attorney General to Somerset. Flowers was the last of a number of entertainments, including Thomas Campion's The Somerset Masque, Ben Jonson's A Challenge at Tilt and The Irish Masque at Court, and Thomas Middleton's lost Masque of Cupids.\nThe author is unknown. The masque was published with a dedication to Francis Bacon. The music is attributed to John Coprario and John Wilson. James VI and I, Anne of Denmark, and Prince Charles attended and afterwards held a banquet with the performers.\nThe theme has the Sun devise a contest between Winter \"Invierno\" and Spring \"Primavera\". That wine was more worthy than tobacco was debated. Men transformed to flowers would be men again.\nSilenus, companion of Dionysus the ancient god of wine, entered riding an artificial ass. \"Kawasha\" dressed with tobacco leaves was carried into the hall by two actors dressed as the inhabitants of Florida, followed by his sergeant carrying a tobacco pipe as big as a caliver rifle. Thirteen masque dancers represented flowers.\nKawasha was the name of a Native American god of tobacco in Virginia, according to Thomas Harriot. Samuel Purchas described the worship of \"Kiwasa\" in Florida. The wedding entertainments reference colonial enterprise because the bride's father, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, was an investor.\nFlower costumes\nAccording to the 1614 publication, the flower dancers were \"apparelled in doublets and round hose of white satin; long white silk stockings; white satin pumps; the doublet richly embroidered in curious panes with embossed flowers of silver, the panes bordered with embroidery of carnation silk and silver; the hose cut in panes answerable to the embroidery of the doublets; the skirts of the doublets embroidered and cut into lily-flowers, and the wings set forth with flowers of several colours, made in silk and frosted with silver; ruff-bands edged with a lace of carnation silk and silver, spangled very thick, and stuck full of flowers of several kinds; fair vizards and tresses; delicate caps of silk and silver flowers of sundry kinds, with plumes of the same, in the top whereof stuck a great bunch of egrets; every Masker's pump fastened with a flower suitable to his cap; on their left arms a white scarf fairly embroidered sent them by the Bride, and on their hands a rich pair of embroidered gloves, sent them by the Bridegroom\".\n",
    "American Hedge Fund\nHudson Bay Capital Management (HBC) is an American multi-strategy investment management firm headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nThe firm has no relation to Canada's more well-known Hudson's Bay Company.\nBackground\nIn 1997, Sander Gerber, an equity options trader at American Stock Exchange started his own proprietary firm named Gerber Asset Management. In 2005, he and Yoav Roth founded Hudson Bay Capital. At the same time, Gerber Asset Management was dissolved and Hudson Bay Capital absorbed its resources and employees.\nIn 2013, HBC was one of over twenty companies accused by the U.S. SEC of violating short-selling regulations, specifically Rule 105 of Regulation M, and among the majority of those accused that settled with the agency rather than fight the charges through litigation. The settlement cost HBC almost US$950,000.\nIn March 2020, HBC introduced a special share class based on a drawdown structure to take advantage of sharp share price decreases following recent historic highs.\nIn February 2022, HBC received a $1.3\u00a0million state grant from the state of Connecticut to hire an addition 40 employees in Greenwich.\nIn February 2024, HBC raised over $800\u00a0million for a special situations fund. It was a closed-end drawdown fund that would last six years. One of its investments was New York Community Bank which at the time was struggling and had received a $1\u00a0billion equity injection from a group of investors that included HBC.\nFirm operations\nHBC manages the bulk of its assets in the multi-strategy fund but also invests in distressed debt and has engaged in shareholder activism. Struggling companies the firm has invested in include New York Community Bank, Plug Power and Transocean. It also provided a $155\u00a0million loan to  MCR Hotels, Three Wall Capital and Island Capital Group to refinance the Lexington Hotel .\nHBC has a risk framework called \"The Deal Code System.\" which was mainly designed by Gerber. It is designed to be a scalable and repeatable portfolio management system that manages the returns and losses of the firm. HBC generally does not use much leverage or borrowed money nor does it perform risky trades.\nBed Bath & Beyond\nIn February 2023, HBC received attention from the media after it arranged a fundraising deal for Bed Bath & Beyond which at the time was on the verge of bankruptcy. The deal worth over $1\u00a0billion involved the sale of convertible preferred stock and warrants to HBC and other investors. The deal had large potential upside if the company recovered and limited downside for HBC as its exposure was hedged.\nOn March 30, 2023, Bed Bath & Beyond terminated its deal with HBC and instead tried to sell up to $300\u00a0million of common stock in the open market with the offering led by B. Riley Financial. Before the deal was terminated, Bed Bath & Beyond had raised at last $360\u00a0million where HBC had converted its preferred stock and warrants into at least 300 million new common shares and sold them on the open market by relying on retail investors. Bed Bath & Beyond and HBC amended the deal terms to preserve the deal even though the company stock had dropped below $1.00 which would have been a violation of the deal. However Bed Bath & Beyond stated it anticipated it would not be able to meet the conditions of the deal and terminated it. By April 2023, Bed Bath & Beyond had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nIn May 2024, Bed Bath & Beyond sued HBC to recover over $300\u00a0million in trading profits from their deal to pay off its creditors such as Sixth Street Partners. The lawsuit was filed under the short swing rule which was allegedly applicable to HBC as it was a shareholder that owned more than 10% of Bed Bath & Beyond's outstanding shares and therefore had to give any profits from short-term trading during a given six-month period to the company. The lawsuit alleged HBC orchestrated the terms of the deal so it could acquire a large stake in it at a deep discount without having to disclose the ownership. HBC aimed to make a quick profit by capitalizing on the company's popularity as a meme stock. In response, HBC stated Bed Bath & Beyond's creditors were behind the lawsuit and that it never owned more than 10% of its shares.  HBC had ended up with almost 98% of the common stock underlying the preferred shares and warrants issued in the deal. While HBC incorporated blockers to prevent it owning more than 9.99% of Bed Bath & Beyond, the lawsuit alleges the company never enforced them as it had no incentive to do so as it needed cash and also had no mechanism to enforce them. As a result, the purpose of the blockers were alleged to help HBC defendants sidestep the disclosure and disgorgement obligations of federal securities laws.\n",
    "Von Reis about 1814 by Fran\u00e7ois Boudiot who also painted Aron's wife Lowisa Marcus\nAron von Reis, originally Aron van Rees (born 30 August 1777 in the Netherlands, died 9 June 1848 in Marstrand, Sweden, was a Dutch-Swedish industrialist in Gothenburg. He and a business partner specialized in creating cotton textiles and printing floral patterns on them called kattun, receiving royal decorations for their success.\nBiography\nOrigin\nAron von Reis was the son of tobacco processor and factory owner Andreas van Reis (alternatively called Anschel, Andries van Rees, Andreas wan Reijs, Anders von Reis) and Sara Aronsdotter Herfurt, he from Nijkerk, she from Amsterdam, both deceased in Gothenburg. She was a descendant of Philip Uri Joosten Halevi. The family was among the first Jews allowed to settle in the Marstrand Free Port, so declared by King Gustav III of Sweden.\nCareer\nIn 1815 von Reis and Aron Magnusson founded the successful cotton printing plant known as Aronsdal in Gothenburg. Magnusson's and von Reis's wives Fredrika Marcus and Lowisa Marcus were first cousins. Their factory annually produced over 100,000 ells of cotton fabric, plain as well as printed. King Charles XIV John of Sweden and Norway awarded each of the partners a gold medal with the ribbon of Vasaorden in 1821 for their industrial achievements. The following year, the partners also opened a weaving facility W\u00e4fveriet Lovisa Fredrica in Aronsdal (today the Kroksl\u00e4tt area of central Gothenburg), and the von Reis family resided in the factory's apartments 1816\u20131823.\nFamily\n13 of the 17 children of Aron von Reis and Lowisa Marcus\nAron von Reis and his brother Moses von Reis both married daughters of Norrk\u00f6ping community leader Jacob Marcus. Aron and his wife Lowisa had 17 children whose notable descendants include Isa Quensel, Magnus Uggla, Stefan Anderson and  Birgit Ridderstedt. Two of their sons were among the first students at Chalmers University of Technology and the Gothenburg Institute of Commerce. Another son had a very early photo studio in Gothenburg. Hugo Valentin has described the von Reis family in his writings. Aron's brother Moses is among the ancestors of Siri von Reis and her daughter Serena Altschul.\nThe marked graves of Aron von Reis and his wife and parents are all in the Old Mosaic Cemetery of Svingeln in Gothenburg.\n",
    "Railway line in southwestern Quebec, Canada\nThe Rouses Point Subdivision is a railway line in southwestern Quebec. It runs north\u2013south from the northern end of Canadian Subdivision, on the border with New York, to the St-Hyacinthe Subdivision, in the vicinity of Montreal. The oldest part of the line was the original main line of the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad, completed in 1836. Today, the Canadian National Railway owns the line. Amtrak's Adirondack operates over the full length, providing daily service between New York City and Montreal.\nRoute\nThe Rouses Point Subdivision begins north of the Amtrak station at Rouses Point, at a junction with the Canadian Subdivision. At Cantic, 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) from Rouses Point, it connects with the Swanton Subdivision. It crosses the Adirondack Subdivision west of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. It joins the St-Hyacinthe Subdivision near Saint-Lambert.\nAmtrak's Adirondack uses the entirety of the line, providing daily service between New York City and Montreal. Poor track conditions on the line caused multiple service suspensions in the 2020s.\nHistory\nMain article: Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad\nThe original main line of the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad ran from St. Johns (now Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu) west to La Prairie, on the Saint Lawrence River. This line opened on July 21, 1836. The company operated its own ferry service between La Prairie and Montreal. From Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, on the Richelieu River, the Champlain Transportation Company provided service over Lake Champlain to points south.\nIn 1851, the Champlain and St. Lawrence built south from St. Johns to Rouses Point, New York. There, it connected with the Northern Railroad and the Vermont and Canada Railroad. This extension opened on August 16, 1851. In the north, the company extended its line to Saint-Lambert and abandoned the original line to La Prairie. The new northern line opened on January 14, 1852.\nThe Champlain and St. Lawrence merged with the Montreal and New York Railroad in 1857 to form the Montreal and Champlain Railroad. The Grand Trunk Railway leased that company in 1863 and acquired it outright in 1873. The Canadian government nationalized the Grand Trunk in 1923, and it became part of the Canadian National Railways (later shortened to Canadian National Railway).\nIn 1960, construction of the Champlain Bridge prompted the  Canadian National to abandon the northern 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of the original extension to Saint-Lambert. It constructed a new 4-mile (6.4\u00a0km) line to connect with the Granby Subdivision in Longueuil.\nNotes\n^ Roberts & Stremes (2023), p.\u00a014-48.\n^ Johnston, Bob (March 22, 2023). \"'Adirondack' tickets now on sale for service beginning April 3\".

He spent most of his career in the Bekasi, with his final position as the regional secretary from 1999 to 2003. He was then transferred to the Ministry of State Apparatus Utilization and Bureaucratic Reform, where he lost two times for the bid as the regent of Bekasi. On 21 June 2010, Memet committed suicide by hanging himself.\nEducation and career\nMemet was born between 1953 and 1954 at the Cibingbin village in Kuningan. He studied at the Home Affairs Governance Academy and the Institute of Governance Sciences. He spent most of his career as civil servant in Bekasi, beginning as the chief of West Bekasi district and North Bekasi district. He was then recalled to serve in the Bekasi regional government as the chief of regional revenue. During his tenure, Bekasi received the Adi Karya Mukti Wibawa trophy from the provincial government as the regency with the highest rate of property tax payment. He then became the assistant for economy and development to the regional secretary.\nMemet was promoted to become the regional secretary of Bekasi in 1999, under regent Wikanda Darmawijaya. He held this position until 2003 and was transferred to the Ministry of State Apparatus Utilization and Bureaucratic Reform as the assistant deputy for accountability. In early 2006, Memet was nominated as the acting regent of Bekasi, alongside with his successor as regional secretary Herry Koesaeri and Chief of the Purwakarta Regional Coordinating Board Tenny Wishramwan. Memet was nominated with the support of the Golkar Party in Bekasi's local council. He lost the bid to Tenny Wishramwan.\nMemet ran once again for the position in the 2007 Bekasi regent election. He picked Jejen Sayuti, a politician from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP), as his running mate. During his candidacy, Memet bought seventy Yamaha RX King motors for foremans and several cars for chief foremans in Bekasi. Despite his efforts, Memet placed second in the election, with 144,181 votes, and lost to Sa'duddin. Angry PDIP supporters then stormed the regional election commission building, and the pair disputed the results in the supreme court. Memet reportedly spent two billion for the legal process and paid 500 million rupiahs for his lawyers. At the end of his campaign, Memet left behind a debt of Rp40 billion. Memet sold shares in housing and PT Maruta Bumi Putera, but it was still insufficient to settle his debts.\nDeath\nOn 21 June 2010, Memet was found dead by a family member at his child's room in his house. Memet was found hanged at the bathroom with a white cable tied around his neck. The chief of criminal service of Bekasi police, Ade Ary Syam Indradi, stated that Memet's body was found with his tongue protruding and signs of sperm and feces release.\nHis body was immediately brought to the Bekasi regional hospital. Upon further investigation, no signs of violence or foul play were found on the body or at the scene, leading authorities to conclude it was a case of suicide. His body was immediately brought to his birthplace in Cibingbin, Kuningan, where he was buried at the village's public cemetery.

He trained as a bookseller in Leipzig in 1792. After his training, in 1798 he was hired as an employee in the Berlin branch of Lange'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung\u00a0, a bookseller and publisher, where he met and became friends with Georg Andreas Reimer\u00a0. In 1804, he became managing director and silent partner at the Dieterich'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung\u00a0 publishing company and bookstore in G\u00f6ttingen. As a volunteer in the L\u00fctzow Free Corps during the War of the Sixth Coalition, he was captured during the battle near Kitzen in June 1813. He was held as a prisoner of war in Fenestrelle and Sisteron until being released in April 1814.\nOn January 1, 1815, he acquired the publishing business founded by Julius Eduard Hitzig in 1808 and operated it under the name \"Ferd. D\u00fcmmlersche Verlagsbuchhandlung\" thereafter. Also in 1815, he married Caroline Friederike Reinhardt, sister of his friend Georg Andreas Reimer's wife. He had seven children with her, including the historian Ernst Ludwig D\u00fcmmler. D\u00fcmmler's publishing activities were varied.

    "\nJos\u00e9 Ambrosio Brunetti y Gayeso, 15th Duke of Arcos GE (6 February 1839 \u2013 5 September 1928) was a Spanish aristocrat and diplomat who served as Minister Plenipotentiary in Bolivia, Uruguay, Chile, Mexico, the United States and Belgium, and ambassador to Italy and Russia. He was also an important benefactor of the Prado Museum, to which he made a posthumous bequest of ten paintings, including Young Man with a Feather Hat, by Pieter Hermansz Verelst.\nEarly life\nBrunetti was born on 6 February 1839 in Pisa, Tuscany. He was the son of Mar\u00eda Josefa Gayoso y T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n and Count L\u00e1zaro Brunetti (1781\u20131838), who was originally from Massa and who served Austrian ambassador in Madrid during most of the reign of King Ferdinand VII. In 1834, his father had been raised to the rank of count of the Austrian Empire by Emperor Francis I. His mother was considered one of the \"most admired and celebrated Camarasa sisters\", daughters of the Marchionesses of Camarasa and granddaughters of the influential Mar\u00eda Josefa Pimentel, Duchess of Osuna. Although his father was later assigned to the Court of Turin, his family remained in Madrid. Jos\u00e9, the only boy, was the last of the five children of his parents and, a few months after his birth, lost his father after Count Brunetti died in Castelfranco, near Florence, in December 1839.\nIn 1847, his mother remarried to Fernando de Nieulant y Sanchez-Pleit\u00e9s, son of the Counts of Nieulant, later Marquesses of Sotomayor, and entered the service of the Spanish Royal family: appointed Lady-in-Waiting to the Queen Isabella II in charge of Infanta Mar\u00eda del Pilar. The Marchioness of Sotomayor died in June 1866, shortly after the death of her first-born daughter, Sof\u00eda. Later, and through his maternal ancestry, Jos\u00e9 Brunetti was able to access the distribution of the numerous titles of his uncle, Mariano T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 12th Duke of Osuna (and 14th Duke of Arcos), who died without issue in 1882, and managed to succeed him as Duke of Arcos in 1892. Likewise, his sisters Cristina, who married politician Ferm\u00edn de Lasala, and Laura, respectively became Duchesses of Mandas and Monteagudo.\nCareer\nAfter graduating with degrees in Civil and Canon Law from the Complutense University of Madrid, he began a diplomatic career in 1862, following in his father's footsteps. In his youth he was attached to the Spanish legations in Austria (in 1864), Italy (from 1866 to 1869), Switzerland (from 1869 to 1876) and the United States (from 1877 to 1882). In 1882, he was promoted to Minister Plenipotentiary and assigned to direct the Spanish legation in Bolivia, followed by those in Uruguay (from 1890 to 1891), Chile (from 1891 to 1894) and Mexico (from 1894 to 1897). In 1899, he returned to Washington as Minister, and was the first Spanish representative in North America once diplomatic relations were resumed after the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Spanish-American War of 1898. He was formally received by President William McKinley on 3 June 1899 in the \"Blue Parlor\" of the White House. While in the United States, he lived at 1785 Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C.\nIn 1902, he was transferred to Belgium, followed by Russia in 1904, both with the rank of Ambassador. His last posting was as Ambassador to Italy, which he held from 1905 until his resignation in 1907.\nTitles and peerages\nAfter the death of the childless 12th Duke of Osuna in 1882, his relatives divided up the many titles accumulated in the House of Osuna, which had been joined by those of Infantado, Benavente, B\u00e9jar and others among the Spanish nobility. Brunetti, nephew  of the 12th Duke of Osuna, ran as heir to the historic duchy of Arcos, but other family members preceded him in formally requesting succession to the title before the Ministry of Grace and Justice: the Marquess of Castillo del Valle de Sidue\u00f1a and the Marquess of Alventos, descendants of minor branches of the Ponce de Le\u00f3n, the original lineage of the House of Arcos. Alventos managed to obtain a Royal Charter of Succession in the title in 1886, but it was immediately suspended due to the lawsuit that he had continued with Brunetti since 1884, and which was resolved in his favor by a ruling in January 1892. Thus, his notorious better right as great-grandson of the Duchess of Osuna, who was herself, in addition to Countess of Benavente, 12th Duchess of Arcos, prevailed over the distant genealogical connection of Alventos with the medieval Counts of Arcos.\nAfter eight years of litigation, on 9 June 1892, Brunetti was officially invested with the title of Duke of Arcos and the Grandee of Spain. He never claimed, however, the rest of the dignities of the House of Arcos: the Marquessate of Zahara, traditionally held by the first-born sons of the Dukes, and the Counties of Casares and Bail\u00e9n, so these titles were dispersed among various descendants of the Duchess of Osuna.\nPersonal life\nWhen he arrived in Washington as Secretary of the Embassy in 1877, Brunetti met Virginia Woodbu",
    "1989 disappearance of a Canadian family\nThe Jack family of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, disappeared under mysterious circumstances on August 2, 1989. The Indigenous Canadian family consisted of the husband, unemployed woodcutter Ronald Jack (aged 26); his wife Doreen (also aged 26); and their sons Russell (aged 9) and Ryan (aged 4). They were last seen stepping into a pickup truck belonging to an unidentified man who had reportedly offered Ronald and Doreen jobs at a logging camp.\nThe whereabouts of the family remain undetermined. An anonymous call in January 1996 claimed that their bodies were buried on a ranch, but the caller did not elaborate on the claim and efforts to track down the caller were unsuccessful. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) maintained an open case file on the disappearance as of August 2020.\nThe Jack family disappearance is often linked to other unsolved crimes against Indigenous Canadians along the Highway of Tears, a stretch of British Columbia Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert. The case has been dubbed \"Canada\u2019s most tragic\u2014and spooky\u2014modern disappearance.\"\nBackground\nRonald (b. March 29, 1963) and Doreen Jack (b. April 24, 1963) were both members of the Cheslatta Carrier Nation, an Indigenous First Nation located outside of the village of Burns Lake, British Columbia. Little is known about the upbringing of both partners, though Doreen's sister, Maria, has stated that both hers and Doreen's early life was marked by parental abandonment by her mother, physical abuse by her father, sexual abuse by family friends, and the poverty that was endemic in the local Indigenous community. Doreen, Maria, and another sister named Lorene were further mistreated when they were sent to the Lejac Residential School near Fraser Lake as children.\nFollowing the closure of the Lejac Residential School in 1976, Doreen attended a live-in Catholic high school. It was during this period that she first dated Ronald. At age 17, Doreen was raped by a fellow student at the Catholic school, resulting in the birth of her first son, Russell, on February 28, 1980. Two years later, she rekindled her relationship with Ronald and the couple moved in together with his parents in Southbank. Mabel Jack, Ronald's mother, has stated that he and Doreen seemed happy with this arrangement, and that there did not seem to be any difficulties between the couple, with Ronald treating Russell as his own son. The family's second son, Ryan, was born on July 26, 1985.\nBy the late 1980s, the Jack family's living situation had significantly deteriorated. Ronald had lost his job at a sawmill after injuring his back, forcing the family to go on welfare and relocate to Prince George to find better employment opportunities. Mabel has described Ronald at this time as \"desperate to work\". Maria witnessed Ronald striking Doreen more than once, while Doreen had begun to drink heavily. At the time of their disappearance, the family's financial status had become dire; Doreen reportedly resorted to stealing cough medicine for her children, while Ronald told Mabel that he was in debt to someone for an undisclosed amount of money.\nDisappearance\nOn the night of Tuesday, August 1, 1989, about a year after the relocation to Prince George, a still-unemployed Ronald visited the First Litre pub, located four blocks away from the Jack family's rented house at 2116 Strathcona Avenue. There, he was accosted by an unidentified man who offered Ronald and his wife purported jobs at a logging camp located at or near Cluculz Lake, forty kilometres (twenty-four miles) west of Prince George along British Columbia Highway 16. The man promised Ronald that the job would last between ten days and two weeks, would be highly paid, and would include benefits such as daycare for the Jack children.\nThe man Ronald spoke to has been described as a Caucasian man in his late thirties, who was between 183\u00a0cm to 198\u00a0cm (6' to 6'6') tall and weighed between 91 and 125\u00a0kg (200 to 275\u00a0lbs). The male had reddish-brown hair and a full beard, and was wearing a ball cap, red checkered work shirt, faded blue jeans, blue nylon jacket, and work boots with leather fringes over the toes.\nBecause the Jack family did not own a vehicle, the unidentified man offered to transport Ronald and Doreen to the logging camp that night in his four-wheel pickup truck. Ronald and the man left the pub at about 11:16pm and returned to the Stratcona Avenue residence. In the early morning hours of August 2, Ronald called his brother in Burns Lake to arrange for his sons to stay with him while he was working, instead finding that doing so wouldn't be possible. Soon after, Ronald called his mother Mabel, also in Burns Lake, ending the conversation by telling her to look for him if he didn't come back. Two relatives of Doreen, including her sister Lorene, visited the house and witnessed the family packing belongings into the pickup truck. Ronald, Doreen, and their children h",
    "Ancient Mesopotamian city\nGar\u0161ana (also Garshana and GAR\u0161ana) was a city in the ancient Near East which is still unlocated. A proposed reading of the toponym is \"Nig2-\u0161a(-an)-naki\". It was also referred to as \"U\u1e63ar-GAR\u0161ana\" indicating it was a newly built town. It is primarily known from the late 3rd millennium BC during the time of the Ur III empire. It is known to have been sited in the Umma province though was under direct royal control by Ur III rulers and had close relations with the unlocated ancient city of Iri-Sa\u011drig. Though the city has not yet been found a number of cuneiform tablets have appeared on the antiquities market which have enabled important insights into everyday life in that period. There is some indication that there was a military camp with the same name adjacent to the town of Gar\u0161ana.\nHistory\nMap showing location of Umma\nAll the current sources from Gar\u0161ana come from the period of the Ur III empire. It was one of at least 20 royal settlements in the Umma province including Zabalam, Karkar, and NAGsu, of which Gar\u0161ana was the largest. Contemporary texts indicate that the city had 1,347 royal settlers (heads of household) for a total population of about 5,000. There were also a number of slaves present, including 175 in the household of \u0160u-Kabta. It was governed by a general (\u0161agina), some colonels (nu-b\u00e0nda), a mayor (hazannu), and an council of elders. In the final years of Shulgi the general was named Arad-Nanna (Aradmu) and in Amar-Sin's 5th year the mayor is known to have been one Lu\u0161allim. The city had two \"households of Nergal\" with ere\u00cd-dingir and egi-zi priestesses though it is not clear that a shrine to Nergal existed at Gar\u0161ana. It is known that el\u016bnum rites for Nergal took place there. A daughter of Ur III ruler Ur-Nammu named Simat-I\u0161taran (Me-I\u0161taran) lived on a royal estate at Gar\u0161ana with her doctor/general husband \u0160u-Kabta (son of Naram-ili) who was in charge of Gar\u0161ana. \u0160u-Kabta, who is known to have had a larger residence in Nippur, died in the year Shu-Sin 8 and his wife, Simat-I\u0161taran, subsequently took over that role. The names of two other doctors located at Gar\u0161ana were Nawir-ilum and Ub\u0101rtum (sister of \u0160u-Kabta). After the Ur III period there was a single mention of Gar\u0161ana in a text from the 19th year of Ishbi-Erra (c. 2000 BC), founder of the Dynasty of Isin which immediately followed Ur.\nIn the Old Babylonian period there is known to have been a town named Uzargarsana in the neighborhood of Erech. Uncertain if that is the same city as Gar\u0161ana.\nSources\nAlthough Gar\u0161ana has yet to be found, beginning in 1999 a large number Sumerian language (with occasional Akkadian language elements) cuneiform tablets have become available via the antiquities market, having been looted from the site. Most of the personal names in the texts are Akkadian vs Sumerian. Most tablets are datable as they are marked with the year names of Ur III rulers, mostly the later years of Shu-Sin and early years of Ibbi-Suen (c. 2030 BC). Other can be dated by context. About 1500 of the tablets are from a single archive and stem from Shu-Sin years 6 and 7 and involve a royal construction project. The workers on the project included skilled worker such as master builders, and unskilled workers such as brick carriers, free and  enslaved. The workers were fed soups and stews and the texts have allowed recreation of the recipes. Many of the tablets have been collected and published. Some of the looted tablets have been repatriated to Iraq.\nMost of the tablets concern minor, everyday matters but taken as a whole they provide a useful look at life in the Ur III period. An example text, from Shu-Sin year 8 (the year of his death):\n\"1 sheep. 1 goat. From Ili-bilani. Booked out. Month: \u201cHarvest.\u201d Year: \u201cHe fashioned for them the lofty barge.\u201d SEAL - \u0160u-kabta,  physician, child of Naram-ili: Adad-tillat\u012b, scribe, child of Abia, (is) your slave.\"\nGar\u0161ana is mentioned in various other Ur III period texts and inscriptions. On an inscribed door socket dated to about Shu-Sin year 4 found at Girsu:\n\"S\u00fc-S\u00edn, ... his lord, Ir-Nanna, grand-vizier, governor of Lagas, sanga priest of the god Enki, military governor of U\u0161ar-Gar\u0161ana, general of Ba\u0161ime, governor of Sabum and the land of Gutebum, general of Dimat-Enlila, governor of Al-S\u00fc-S\u00een, general of Urbillum, governor of Ham(a)zi  and Karahar, general of NI.HI, general of Sima\u0161ki and the land of Karda, his servant, built for him his Girsu temple\"\nLocation\nWhile there is consensus that the royal settlement of Gar\u0161ana lay within the borders of the Ur III Umma province the specific areal location is uncertain. One earlier proposal put it not far to the northwest of the provincial capital of Umma in the northwest sector of the province, near the ancient city of Karkar, whose location is also yet unknown but is likely Tell Jidr. The alternative view is that the above location is actually that of the unlocated ancient city of NAGsu, also a large royal settlement (Sit",
    "American painter and writer (1890\u20131974)\nHarry de Cleyre (1890\u20131974) was and American house painter and writer. The son of Voltairine de Cleyre and James B. Elliott, he was abandoned by his mother and neglected by his father during his childhood. He struggled to apply himself in his education and was forced to start work at the age of 10. After his mother's death, he devoted himself to studying her work and preserving her memory; he became a key primary source on her life, writing several letters about her to Joseph Ishill and Agnes Inglis.\nBiography\nHarry de Cleyre was born on June 12, 1890, in Philadelphia, the son of the anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre and the freethinker James B. Elliott. He was born by the name Vermorel Elliott, named after the Communard Auguste-Jean-Marie Vermorel. His mother was neither physically nor emotionally able to cope with raising Harry, so she left him in the care of his father. Feeling abandoned, Harry would refer to himself as a \"bastard\" throughout the rest of his life.\nDe Cleyre's mother remained a stranger to him during his early life, even though she lived close by. According to Harry's own daughters, \"he just did not fit into her life, her plans, at all.\" She briefly attempted to give him piano lessons, but he didn't apply himself, so she stopped. By the turn of the century, his father had succombed to mental illness and left him to fend for himself. He went to work at the age of 10, his income supplemented only by a small weekly allowance from his mother. His aunt Adelaide D. Thayer remembered him always feeling depressed, which she attributed to his mother. At one point, Thayer asked if she could take care of him; while his mother cared little for what was done with him, his father refused to relinquish custody. At the age of 16, he enrolled in a technical school, as he had grown up loving machines and wanted to learn mechanical engineering. Although he was financially supported by his mother, he failed to apply himself to his studies, so his mother refused to pay for any more of his education. He later went to work as a housepainter.\nHe became closer with his mother once he reached the age of 15. By 1906, he was living with his mother and for some time paid her rent. She later recalled his passion for repairs and machinery, and assured her sister that rumors he had become a priest were untrue, saying: \"he is an ignorant boy and an alcoholic wreck; they wouldn't take him in for a minute.\" According to Emma Goldman, while he was \"overawed\" by his mother's intellect, he was also \"repelled by her austere mode of living.\"\nIn the spring of 1912, when his mother was on her deathbed, he travelled to Chicago to be by her side when she died. After his mother's death, Emma Goldman speculated that Harry had gone his own way, becoming \"one of the 100% Americans, commonplace and dull.\" Although neglected by his mother throughout his life, he never stopped loving her, even naming his eldest daughter \"Voltairine\". He also dropped his father's surname and adopted his mother's. While the rest of his maternal family continued to spell their name \"De Claire\", Harry adopted his mother's fashion of spelling it as \"de Cleyre\". Although he never took up his mother's anarchist philosophy, he expressed pride in her \"stubborn defense of those being oppressed.\" He also inherited his parents' love of Thomas Paine, which he passed on to his own daughters, and treated his mother's Selected Works as his own personal Bible.\nLater in his life, he spent much of his time talking about his mother. In a letter he sent to Joseph Ishill on October 15, 1934, he pointed out a number of mistakes in Emma Goldman's biography of De Cleyre, including the date and circumstances of her death, the false assertion that her father Hector De Claire had wanted her to become a nun, and the details of her lingustics tutoring. Nevertheless, he still described Goldman's biography as a \"glowing tribute\". In the same letter, he also described his mother's student Nathan Navro as \"a man whose integrity is unquestioned\", praising him for being \"free of petty jealousies\", unlike some of his mother's other admirers. In an October 28, 1934 letter to Joseph Ishill, de Cleyre described his mother's time in a convent, where according to him, she was allowed access to the Bible, which \"was denied to those of the Catholic faith.\" In an October 12, 1947 letter to Agnes Inglis, de Cleyre described his grandfather as a \"petty tyrant\". He also mentioned about how, during her time in a convent, his mother had considered becoming a nun. On December 29, 1947, he told Inglis that his mother had confided to him that it was Dyer Lum who had smuggled an explosive to Louis Lingg, which had allowed him to commit suicide. Inglis herself didn't believe this, thinking the prison authorities had killed Lingg, but this hypothesis was disputed by Alexander Berkman. On February 15, 1948, he confessed to Inglis of how his mother had been acquitted in a tri",

    "English Royal Navy admiral\nJames Hutton (3 September 1715 \u2013 3 May 1795) was an English Moravian minister and bookseller.\nBiography\nHutton the son of the Rev. John Hutton by Elizabeth Ayscough. He was born in London on 3 September 1715. The father, a nonjuring clergyman who had resigned his living, resided in College Street, Westminster, where he took Westminster boys to board. He was a friend of Dr. Burney. James Hutton was educated at Westminster, and was apprenticed to Mr. Innys, a bookseller of St. Paul's Churchyard. About 1736 he opened a bookshop of his own at the Bible and Sun, west of Temple Bar. But he never paid much attention to business. Before the end of his apprenticeship he had met the Wesleys at Oxford, and when they left for Georgia in 1735 he accompanied 'them to Gravesend; in 1738 and 1739 he published Whitefield's 'Journal.' In London Hutton soon started a small society for prayer, and corresponded with many Methodists; his mother remained a strong churchwoman, and wrote to Samuel Wesley, who was not of his brother's way of thinking, that John Wesley was her son's pope. But Hutton had in 1737 been introduced by John Wesley to Peter Bohler and two other Moravian brethren then on their way to Georgia, and thenceforth he inclined to Moravianism. In 1739 he set out for Germany, where he visited the Moravian congregations, and began a correspondence with Nicolaus Zinzendorf. When John Wesley was separating himself from the Moravians, he made a vain attempt in 1739 to induce Hutton to follow his example, and in 1740, after Wesley had induced several members of Hutton's society, which met then at the Fetter Lane Chapel, to abandon it for his Foundry Society, the disruption between Hutton and himself was complete. They were subsequently reconciled, and Wesley noted in his \u2018Journal' after Hutton had paid him a visit that he believed Hutton would be saved, but as by fire.\nHutton was till his death an active Moravian leader. He often visited Germany, and in 1741 became, by August Gottlieb Spangenberg's advice, one of the founders of the Society for the Furtherance of the Gospel, and acted as 'referendary' for many years. 'Pray,\u2019 Lord Shelburne asked him, in the course of an interview in which the projected Moravian mission to Labrador was discussed, 'on what footing are you with the Methodists? 'They kick us whenever they can,' answered Hutton. George III, the queen, and Benjamin Franklin were among Hutton's acquaintances. On 3 May 1795 Hutton died at Oxted Cottage, near Godstone, Surrey, where he had lived for nearly two years with the Misses Biscoe and Shelley. He was buried in the burying-ground adjoining the chapel at Chelsea. Hutton married at Marrenborn, 3 July 1740, Louise Brandt, a Swiss Moravian, whose grandfather had been advocate of Neuchatel, Zinzendorf performing the ceremony. He left no family. His wife seems to have lapsed occasionally, as on 4 November 1771 'a letter from Brother Hutton, apologising for the uncongregation-like fashion of his wife's gown, was read.' Hutton may be called the founder of the Moravian church in England, although Cominius and other teachers had visited this country before, A portrait of Hutton, with his ear-trumpet, by Richard Cosway, was engraved in mezzotint by John Raphael Smith in 1786; another engraving by W. Wickes is prefixed to Benham's 'Memoir.' Hutton wrote ' An Essay towards giving some just ideas of the Personal Character of Count Zinzendorf ...,' London, 1755, 8vo.\n",
    "\nThe presidency of Campos Sales began on 15 November 1898, after he won the 1898 Brazilian presidential election, the 3rd presidential election held in Brazil, becoming the country's 4th President; and ended on 15 November 1902, when Rodrigues Alves took office.\nCampos Sales' government marked an era of transition in Brazil's political history. The Governors' Policy, financial stabilization and international relations are key aspects of this period. While his government was instrumental in stabilizing Brazil's economy with the first Funding Loan, it also consolidated an oligarchic political system that would later generate significant challenges.\nCampos Sales is remembered as a president who, at a critical moment in Brazilian history, sought to balance economic needs with the political demands of regional elites. The young First Brazilian Republic, which had been proclaimed in 1889, was still consolidating its structure and faced critical periods and challenges.\nDuring his term, with a strong concern for the country's finances, and with austerity measures, Brazil's GDP grew on average 3.1% per year.\nBackground\n1898 presidential election\nMain article: 1898 Brazilian presidential election\nOn 1 March 1898, Campos Sales was elected President of Brazil, with the support of then president Prudente de Morais, he received 420,286 votes against 38,929 votes from his main opponent, the positivist Lauro Sodr\u00e9, a candidate most supported by Floriano Peixoto's followers and the positivists, already having served as governor of Par\u00e1 from 1891 to 1896. His vice-president was Francisco de Assis Rosa e Silva. Campos Sales took office on 15 November 1898, succeeding Prudente de Morais.\nNegotiating the foreign debt\nIn April 1898, after the electoral result, Campos Sales travelled to Europe with the goal of addressing the serious issue of the country's external debt. For around two months, alongside Bernardino de Campos, then Prudente de Morais' Minister of Finance, negotiations began with representatives of the Rothschild Firm, the main creditor of Brazilian debt, resulting in the approval of a consolidation loan (called Funding Loan). From this negotiation came the final agreement that secured a new loan of \u00a310 million. In exchange, the Brazilian government gave the income from the Rio de Janeiro customs as a guarantee, and committed itself not to resort to new external loans. It was also expected that the Brazilian authorities would incinerate a quantity of paper money equivalent to the loan.\nPresidency\nDomestic policy\nA caricature of Sales and Prudente de Morais in the Revista Illustrada magazine\nAt the time, the Brazilian economy, based on the export of coffee and rubber, was in the aftermath of the Encilhamento crisis. Campos Sales believed that all of Brazil's problems had a single cause: the devaluation of its currency. He defined his government as disconnected from party political interests, thus expressing his administrative vision, he sought to choose technicians not linked to party politics for his ministries, and was inspired by the advice of American president Benjamin Harrison to organize his cabinet. In the book Da Propaganda \u00e0 Presid\u00eancia, Campos Sales cited Harrison's book called Government and Administration of the United States.\nIn practice, however, Campos Sales typically represented the political ideals of each state's dominant oligarchies. In return, he received political support from state factions in Congress. With the creation of the Chamber of Deputies' Powers Verification Commission, the congressmen themselves legitimized the election of representatives and thus only elected representatives who were appointed by the state governors were sworn in. The result of this pact was the weakening of opposition factions, electoral fraud and the exclusion of the majority of the population from any political participation. Oligarchic political control was also ensured by open voting and the recognition of elections not by the Judiciary branch, but by the Legislative branch itself. As Congress was influenced by the president and state governors, this mechanism gave rise to the so-called \"beheading\" of undesirable candidates. Campos Sales remarked:\nI understood that I had to dedicate my government to a purely administrative work, separating it from partisan interests and passions, only to take care of solving the complicated problems that are the legacy of a long past. I understood that it would not be through the incandescent vivacity of political struggles, which were pointless, that I would be able to save the nation's finances, compromised due to a debt with external creditors!\nGovernors' Policy\nCampos Sales devised his States' Policy, better known as the Governors' Policy, through which he removed the military from politics (who had held the presidency since the proclamation of the republic) and established the oligarchic system of Brazil's First Republic, declaring that:\nIn this regime, I said in my last me",
    "English-American ceramicist\nJames Taylor (1839\u20131898) was an English-born ceramicist who is considered \"the father of the American architectural terra cotta industry.\"\nBiography\nTaylor was born in England and experienced in architectural terracotta manufacturing there, acting as superintendent of J.M. Blashfield & Company for five years. He emigrated to the United States in 1870 and immediately encountered stubborn misconceptions about terracotta's suitability for use in the United States, with many architects advising him to return to England.\nAfter having no luck finding financing for a new company in New York City, Taylor traveled west and replaced the superintendent of the Chicago Terra Cotta Company. Terracotta manufacture was new to Chicago, but the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 demonstrated the flaws of presumed fireproof materials such as stone and iron and increased demand for brick and clay products. The Chicago Terra Cotta Company had formed a few years earlier but its first superintendent, Giovanni Meli, did not have previous experience producing architectural terra cotta and lacked technical skills.\nAfter his hiring in Chicago, Taylor introduced English methods for preparing clay and producing terracotta, employing muffle kilns in what is believed to be their first use in the United States. Whereas many American architects initially considered terracotta to be a decorative element, Taylor promoted its use for entire building facades.\nTaylor's family settled on a farm in Port Monmouth, New Jersey and while there he worked with his friend Edward Adolphus Spring to form Eagleswood Art Pottery, which was one of the first institutes in the United States to offer an education in making ceramics.\nIn 1878 Taylor moved to Boston to operate the Chicago Terra Cotta Company's new Boston branch and worked there until it closed the next year. By 1880 he had been recruited by another new company; the Boston Terra Cotta Company. His work there allowed him to spend many weekends at home with his family in New Jersey.\nWhile working for the Boston Terra Cotta Company, Taylor helped produce 540 tons of terracotta for use on Orlando Potter's Potter Building in New York City. Potter was so impressed by the use of terracotta that after the building's completion in 1886 he recruited Taylor to help form the New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company, which became one of the largest manufacturers in the country. Taylor was a proponent of the company's urban location, feeling that unfired clay was cheaper to transport than fired pieces.\nTaylor remained with the New York company for several years and helped them achieve success, even acting as a guest modeler and leaving his signature on a terracotta fireplace in the company office. In 1893 he left after his health began to fail and retired to his farm in New Jersey, where he remained until his death in 1898.\nLegacy\nTaylor was widely considered to be the leading authority on architectural terracotta and many contemporary accounts described him as being always willing to share knowledge and help those looking to improve their product. Surviving letters revealed that he provided lengthy written advice to competitor Gladding, McBean while working at the New York Architectural Terra Cotta Company, and he was likely paid to do so.\nTaylor's work in promoting terracotta production within the United States played a key role in establishing its usefulness and suitability for American architecture. Much of the success of the architectural ceramics industry around the turn of the century can be traced to innovations and techniques introduced by Taylor. The Clay-Worker, a trade journal of the time, wrote that \"what Mr. Taylor don't know about terra cotta is not worth knowing.\"\n",
    "Indian sanskrit poet\nBhanudatta Misra was a Sanskrit poet from the Mithila region of India who has been dated to some time in the late 15th and early 16th century.\nBhanudatta's works started to gain popularity, particularly in the early modern period when his compositions, the Rasam\u0101njari and the Rasatarangini received numerous commentaries especially up till the 18th century. As per Sheldon Pollock; \"no other Sanskrit poet exercised anything remotely approaching Bhanudatta's influence on the development of the Hindi literary tradition between 1600 and 1850.\".\nLife\nAs per Bhanudatta himself, he was born in the country of Videha corresponding to the Mithila region of modern-day North Bihar in India and belonged to the Maithil Brahmin community. He also states that his father was a poet named Ganeshvara. Speaking of his background in the third person, he states:\nHis father was Gan\u00e9shvara,\nbrightest jewel in the crown of poetry,\nhis land, Videha country,\nwhere waves of the holy river ripple.\nOther than this, Bhanudatta gives very little information about his life from his works which was typical of Sanskrit poets of the period. Many poets would also travel vast distances to secure royal patronage and many of Bhanudattas works were likely composed under the patronage of a Muslim rule in Devagiri in modern-day Maharashtra whom Bhanudatta refers to as a \"King Nijama\". Sheldon Pollock has connected this \"Nijama\" with Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah I of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. The outcome of this was that Bhanudatta's works continued to be deeply studied in the Deccan region and in other neighbouring sultanates like that of Golconda.\nInfluence\nBhanudatta's works made an impact on the emergent painting tradition of early modern India.\nThe Bouquet of Rasa was well received within the field of miniature paintings and was illustrated possibly as early as the 1600s in the region of Mewar. His poems have also been depicted in miniature paintings from the Deccan, Chamba and Nurpur.\nWorks\nThe attributed works of Bhanudatta Misra are:\nAlankaratilaka (Forehead Ornament of Figures)\nGitagauripatikavya\nKumarabhargaviyacampu\nRasam\u0101njari (Bouquet of Rasa)\nRasatarangini (Rivers of Rasa)\n",
    "English general and colonel-commandant in the Royal Engineers\nJohn Oldfield KH (29 May 1789 \u2013 2 August 1863) was an English general and colonel-commandant in the Royal Engineers.\nBiography\nOldfield was the only son of John Nicholls Oldfield, lieutenant in the royal marines, who served with distinction on the staff of the army and with the 63rd regiment in the American war, and of Elizabeth, only daughter of Lieutenant Hammond of the royal navy. He was born at Portsmouth on 29 May 1789. He was descended from Sir Anthony Oldfield, created a baronet in 1660, and he claimed to be fifth baronet, but the proof was incomplete. A re-creation was deemed to be necessary, the cost of which Oldfield declined to incur, and the matter dropped. His father retired from the service about the date of Oldfield's birth, and purchased a small estate at Westbourne, Sussex. He died in 1793.\nIn 1799 Oldfield's uncle, Major Thomas Oldfield, of the royal marines, was killed at St. Jean d'Acre. The distinguished conduct of this officer led to offers from Lord St. Vincent, Lord Nelson, and Sir Sidney Smith to provide for John Oldfield in the navy, while Earl Spencer offered a commission in the royal marines, and the Marquis Cornwallis a nomination for the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. The latter was accepted. When Oldfield was old enough to go to Woolwich, he was only four feet six inches high, and a dispensing order had to be obtained from the master-general of the ordnance to allow of his admission to the Royal Military Academy, the minimum standard being then four feet nine inches. The junior cadets at that time went first to Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where he joined, on 23 August 1803, and was afterwards transferred to Woolwich. When George III inspected the cadets on 29 May 1805, Oldfield was one of the seniors. The king was struck with his diminutive stature, asked his name and age, and spoke to the lad of his uncle's services at St. Jean d'Acre.\nOldfield joined the Trigonometrical Survey at Bodmin in Cornwall in September 1805. He was commissioned as second lieutenant in the royal engineers on 2 April 1806, and quartered at Portsmouth. He was promoted to be lieutenant on 1 July. The following summer he was sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and after two years' service in North America he returned to England, and in September 1809 was stationed at Dorchester. He was promoted second captain on 1 May 1811.\nFrom Dorchester he went to Fort George in Scotland, and remained there until he embarked for Holland in 1814. He landed at Hellevoetsluis on 28 March, and entered Antwerp with Sir Thomas Graham on 5 May. He was promoted captain on 26 January 1815. He was at Brussels on 7 April 1815, when he heard of Napoleon's escape from Elba, and at once packed his family off to England, to Westbourne. Oldfield was sent to Ypres to construct new works of defence, and was entrusted with the inundation of the country round, a troublesome and thankless operation. He shortly after joined the army of the Duke of Wellington as brigade-major of royal engineers. He made a sketch-plan of the plains of Waterloo for the use of the duke, and took part in the battle of Waterloo and the occupation of Paris. In April 1819, in consequence of a reduction in the corps of royal engineers, he was placed on half-pay, and passed his time chiefly at Westbourne.\nIn October 1823 he was sent on a special commission to the West Indies. He returned in 1824, and was quartered for some years in Ireland. On 23 July 1830 he was promoted brevet-major and made a K.H. for his services in 1815. In September he was appointed commanding royal engineer in Newfoundland. On 19 November 1831 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. In October 1835 he returned to England, and was appointed to the command of the royal engineers at Jersey. In March 1839 he was sent to Canada as commanding royal engineer and colonel on the staff. He was there during the rebellion and rendered good service. On 9 November 1841 he was promoted colonel in the army, and appointed aide-de-camp to the queen. He returned from Canada in the spring of 1843, and was appointed commanding royal engineer in the western district. He was promoted regimental colonel on 9 November 1846, and was appointed to command the royal engineers in Ireland in 1848. On 20 June 1854 he was promoted major-general, and went to live at Westbourne. He became lieutenant-general on 10 May 1859. He was made a colonel-commandant of the corps of royal engineers on 25 October 1859, and was promoted general on 3 April 1862. He died at Emsworth on 2 August 1863, and was buried at Westbourne.\nOldfield was thrice married: first, on 12 March 1810, at Dorchester, to Mary, daughter of Christopher Ardens, esq., of Dorchester, Dorset, by whom he had seven children (she died at Le Mans, France, on 6 July 1820); secondly, on 8 July 1822, at Cheltenham, to Alicia, daughter of the Rev. T. Hume, rector of Arden, by whom he had eight children (she died at Pl",
    "\nFootball match\nThe 2024 EFL Championship play-off final was an association football match played on 26 May 2024 that decided the final team to get promotion from the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football, to the Premier League. The top two teams of the 2023\u201324 EFL Championship, Leicester City and Ipswich Town, gained automatic promotion, while the clubs that placed from third to sixth took part in the 2024 English Football League play-offs. Promotion to the Premier League was estimated in 2024 to be worth up to \u00a3265 million to the play-off final winner.\nThe final was contested by Leeds United and Southampton, both of whom were relegated from the Premier League in the previous season and finished third and fourth respectively in the 2023\u201324 EFL Championship season. Southampton won the game 1\u20130, thus securing promotion back to the Premier League.\nRoute to the final\nMain article: 2023\u201324 EFL Championship\nLeeds United finished the regular 2023\u201324 season in third place in the EFL Championship, the second tier of the English football league system. They were six points behind second-placed Ipswich Town and seven points behind champions Leicester City. Southampton finished in fourth place, nine points behind Ipswich Town. Fifth and sixth-placed West Bromwich Albion and  Norwich City finished 21 and 23 points respectively behind Ipswich Town. They all therefore missed out on the two automatic places for promotion to the Premier League and instead took part in the play-offs to determine the third and final promoted team.\nThe first legs of the semi-finals took place on 12 May, contested between Norwich City and Leeds United at Carrow Road, and between West Bromwich Albion and Southampton at The Hawthorns. Both games finished in goalless draws, which was the first time that had happened since the 2011 Football League Championship play-offs semi-final first-legs between Nottingham Forest, Swansea City, Reading and Cardiff City.\nThe return leg between Leeds United and Norwich City was played at Elland Road on 16 May. Attacking their opponents from the kick-off, Leeds' Crysencio Summerville curled a shot over the bar after only two minutes. Leeds were later awarded a free-kick after a foul on Joe Rodon, which Ilia Gruev took; he deceived Norwich goalkeeper Angus Gunn into expecting a cross, but instead shot towards the near post to make it 1\u20130 in the seventh minute. In the 20th minute, Leeds made it 2\u20130 after Jo\u00ebl Piroe headed in a cross from Wilfried Gnonto. Georginio Rutter made it 3\u20130 in the 40th minute, crashing the ball into the net off of the crossbar after a breakaway Leeds' attack. Summerville made it 4\u20130 in the 68th minute, tapping the ball in from close range after Gnonto's shot had been parried by Gunn to Junior Firpo who squared the ball to Summerville. No further goals were scored as Leeds won the tie 4\u20130 on aggregate to make the play-off final on 26 May. Following the match, the Leeds squad gathered into a huddle in the centre circle while the home fans in the stands sang \"I Predict a Riot\" by Leeds band Kaiser Chiefs. Norwich manager David Wagner said after the game, \"It was a poor performance from us. Everything you should not do, we have done\". He was sacked by the club the day after the match.\nThe second leg between Southampton and West Bromwich Albion was played at St Mary's Stadium on 17 May. Southampton opened the scoring in the second half in the 49th minute as Will Smallbone struck the ball from an angle to put it past West Brom goalkeeper Alex Palmer and give his team a 1\u20130 advantage. Adam Armstrong later made it 2\u20130 in the 78th minute. In the 85th minute, Southampton were awarded a penalty kick for a foul on Ryan Manning, which Armstrong converted to put his side 3\u20130 up. C\u00e9dric Kipr\u00e9 scored a header in injury time to give West Brom a consolation goal, but Southampton won 3\u20131 on aggregate to qualify for the play-off final.\nAt the end of the Southampton\u2013West Bromwich Albion game, a section of Southampton supporters came onto the pitch and confronted the West Bromwich supporters. Flares, seats and missiles were thrown between the two sets of fans before police and stewards gained control. A post-match lap of honour by the Southampton players had to be cancelled due to crowd disturbances. Three people were arrested, two for going on the pitch and one for assaulting an emergency worker, using threatening behaviour and obstructing/resisting a police officer.\nMatch\nBackground\nFrank Lampard (pictured in 2020) was in charge of Derby County during the 2018\u201319 season when they came to face Leeds United during the Spygate era when Leeds head coach Marcelo Bielsa sent someone to spy on Derby's training session prior to their home league meeting.\nThis was Leeds' first play-off final since the 2008 Football League One play-off final against Doncaster Rovers, while this was Southampton's first-ever play-off final. This saw both of the other relegated teams from the previous Premier League season",
    "Species of fish\nThamnaconus hypargyreus, commonly known as the lesser-spotted leatherjacket, yellowspotted leatherjacket, or the yellow-fin filefish, is a fish native to the coastal waters of the South and East China Seas and northern Australian coast.\nTaxonomy\nThamnaconus hypargyreus is a species of the genus Thamnaconus of the family Monacanthidae, a group commonly known as filefishes.\nDescription\nThe maximum total length of T. hypargyreus is 21.2 cm. The body is a dusky orange-cream toward the top, with blue tints on the head and back, and a cream colour below.\nDistribution and habitat\nThamnaconus hypargyreus inhabit the southeastern Indian Ocean from around northern Western Australia, Queensland, to southern New South Wales, Australia, as well as southern Papua New Guinea, and the East and South China Seas from southern Japan to around Taiwan to Hainan Island, China . It inhabits the sandy bottoms of neritic waters 10\u2013235 m deep, though is typically not found deeper than 130 m.\nConservation status\nThe IUCN Red List categorizes T. hypargyreus as Least Concern, the justification for which being the species' broad distribution. While the yield from trawling in the South China Sea declined rapidly due to population decline as a consequence of pressure from fisheries since the 1980s, the Australian populations are not commercially targeted by local fishing, but are a bycatch in Queensland's deepwater eastern king prawn trawl fishery, and Australian populations are therefor not endangered by local fishing. Since 2000, bycatch reduction devices have been required as part of Australia's fishery management plan, resulting in reduced local trawling efforts in addition to reduced bycatch.\nClimate change may be a future threat for the species.\nReproduction\nThamnaconus hypargyreus consumes plankton, increasing consumption shortly before spawning. The fish become sexually mature at one year of age, approximately 100\u00a0mm in length.\nAssociation with humans\nThe species is caught as trawling bycatch and sold in fish markets as a food fish. In the 1970s, the species was one of the most commercially popular fish in the South China Sea, with a peak yield of 200,000 tons, fished by both Japan and China. Major fisheries still operate in the coastal waters of Pearl River Estuary and western seas of Guangdong, China.\n",
    "Church in Norfolk, United Kingdom\nSt Andrew's Church is an Anglican church in Bedingham in Norfolk, England. It is in the Hempnall group of parishes and in the Diocese of Norwich. It is a round-tower church, dating mostly from the medieval period. The building is Grade I listed.\nHistory and description\nLooking towards the rood screen and the chancel\nThe church is built of flint with limestone dressings. It is a large building, perhaps because Walsingham Priory Manor, held by Walsingham Priory from 1318 until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, was one of the two manors in the parish. The other manor was Bigod's Manor, held by the Stone family from the mid-16th to the 19th century. There were once two churches in the churchyard; foundations remain of St Mary's church.\nThe gateway to the church was made narrower in the 19th century, to prevent the lord of the manor from driving his carriage up to the porch when attending services.\nThe earliest part of the church is the lower part of the tower, which is late Saxon or early Norman; above this is a 15th-century octagonal belfry, where there are four louvred bell-openings alternating with four panels with tracery, and a castellated parapet. The rest of the building dates mostly from the 13th and 14th centuries, with 15th-century additions.\nInterior\nThe font\nThe nave has 14th-century arcades, and north and south aisles; the pillars of the arches are octagonal in the north, and quatrefoil in the south, which may be earlier. There is a clerestory with 15th-century windows; the clerestory windows extend over the chancel, providing much light. The chancel's east window has tracery of about 1300.\nThe rood screen, with fine tracery in the panels and carved brattishing along the top, dates from the 15th century. The bench ends have 15th-century carvings. The 15th-century octagonal font has seated lions around the stem, and the symbols of the four evangelists around the bowl. There are monuments to the Stone family on the north wall of the chancel and on floor slabs in the north and south aisles.\nThere is a south chapel, of the 14th century. The south porch is 15th-century.\nThere are five bells, the oldest dating from about 1520. Theye cannot be rung, as the 15th-century oak frame is no longer strong enough.\n",

    "Argentine financial institution\nThe Banco Santiago del Estero is the most important financial entity in the Santiago del Estero Province. It is a commercial bank mainly serving the retail financial market, and is also the main financial agent of the State of the province of Santiago del Estero.\nIts headquarters are located at Avenida Belgrano 529, City of Santiago del Estero. It also has several payment centers and various branches in the interior of the province, as well as branches in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, C\u00f3rdoba, Catamarca, Tucum\u00e1n, Salta and Jujuy.\nHistory\nEarly years\nIn 1910, with the installation of the first Spanish Bank of the R\u00edo de la Plata and on December 18, 1911, with the immediate local private creation of the then called \u201cCommercial and Edifier Bank of Santiago del Estero\u201d, the province was fully incorporated into the nascent Argentine banking system, through the initiative of a young entrepreneur from Santiago, only 37 years old, Luis Su\u00e1rez, who together with a group of neighbors founded it with an initial capital of m$n 500,000, which soon had to be expanded to m$n 1 million.\nThe then governor Manuel Arga\u00f1araz created the departmental political headquarters in the interior, but at the same time, the existence of a rooster arena just 1 and a half blocks from the main square was also a problem. Accompanying Luis Su\u00e1rez in the creation of the first Santiago Bank were personalities such as Baltasar Olaechea y Alcorta, Pablo and Jaime Verdaguer, Dr. David Garc\u00eda, Juan Berraondo, Enrique Ballestrini (son), Modesto Gonz\u00e1lez, Manuel Suffloni, Augusto Helman, Alfredo Ricci and Manuel Ruiz, among many others.\nHowever, the evolution of the Bank was of such magnitude that, just over a decade after its foundation, already in 1923 and always under the management of Luis Su\u00e1rez, now supported by the accountant Andr\u00e9s Pereda, its cash flow was of m$n 35 million annually, approximately 10 million current dollars. It granted credits of 5 to 25 years, mainly for the private construction of homes, which appeared in the Property Registry, from the first day, in the name of the owner of the land.\nPost-war crisis\nBanco Edificador was able to go through the crisis of the first post-war since 1918, the serious economic crisis of the years 1929 and 1930 forced private shareholders to agree to public capitalization in 1932, under the government of Juan Castro, which transformed it from a private bank into a mixed ownership bank that, through provincial law 1,144 of April 17, was renamed Banco de la Provincia de Santiago del Estero, with an initial capital of m$n 3 million, just over 600,000 current dollars.\nThat same year, 1932, the Bank made it possible to issue m$n 12 million provincial public debt bonds. In 1936, upon turning 25, its capital had already amounted to m$n 185 million annually, about 47 million current dollars, in cash movements, checking accounts, discounts and bank drafts.\nIts board of directors was chaired by Alfredo Ricci and he was accompanied by Edverto de la Vega, Jos\u00e9 Casanova, Manuel Barthe, H\u00e9ctor Bonacina, Federico Salaverry, Octavio Latapi\u00e9 and Ram\u00f3n de la R\u00faa, among others. In 1935, the  Central Bank of Argentina had been created, which reformulated and rebuilt the banking system, greatly weakened by the aforementioned crisis of the years 1929 and 1930.\nNationalization\nIn 1953, an emblematic year in the capital city of Santiago del Estero, it turned 400 years old and was the headquarters for one day of the National Executive Branch chaired by Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, during the governorship of Francisco Javier Gonz\u00e1lez, through the sanction of provincial law 2,939, the Bank was transformed again, in terms of organization and ownership.\nNow it became an autonomous entity of the local government, calling itself \"Bank of the Province of Santiago del Estero\". In this condition as an entirely public bank, in 1961 it celebrated its Golden Anniversary, 50 years of continuous operational life, reaching a capital close to m$n 200 million, almost 47 million dollars. , with a 50% contribution provided by the BCRA.\nThe effect of the inflation tax that, under mixed and public management, could only keep the Bank's capital constant during the 25 years of the period 1936\u20131961.\nFirst branches\nThey began to incorporate the first branches in the interior of the province, which followed the main railway lines, such as La Banda, A\u00f1atuya, Suncho Corral, Fr\u00edas, Sumampa and Quimil\u00ed, Selva, Bandera, Tintina, were added as mobile agencies of the Bank. Termas de R\u00edo Hondo, Pinto, Loreto, Ojo de Agua, Monte Quemado and Nueva Esperanza.\nIn 1961, already during the governorship of Eduardo Miguel, a special first-class branch of the Banco de la Provincia was opened on central Florida Street in City of Buenos Aires.\nIn 1971, Banco Provincia, with 340 employees, already had 20 branches in the interior.

    "\nKleftopolemos (Greek: \u039a\u03bb\u03b5\u03c6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) was a military tactic during the Greek War of Independence. These were surprise attacks carried out by the rebel Greeks against the Ottomans following an ambush. Kleftopolemos is the only military tactic that has been preserved by tradition until the Greek revolution.\nWithout knowledge of it, it is impossible to understand the struggles of the Greek nation under Turkish rule. The core of his fighting forces are armatoles and klepht. He was the one who, during the Turkish occupation, kept the morale of the Greeks high and, during the struggle, contributed the most to the liberation of Greece from the Turkish occupation.\nArmatolos\nHistory of kleftopolemos\nAlthough the term was first used by thieves, the tactic is ancient. The conventional mode of hostilities, using a regular army, is a relatively recent invention. It was established with the development of agrarian societies, which could build fortifications and a regular army. In the history of mankind only a few states had organized armies and even very recently, close to historical times.\nExamples of stealth warfare, in modern times, we find in the American Revolution (1776\u20131783), as well as in the Napoleonic Campaign in Russia, where Russian rebels acted against Napoleon's army.\nIn the Greek area, operations in the form of stealth warfare were carried out during the Greek revolution but also earlier in individual revolutionary movements.\nTactic\nThe tactics used by the Greeks in stealth warfare were first developed in the Balkans by the Albanians. The tactic responded to the need for small groups to fight while minimizing their losses. Each group was a separate military element, and the personal safety of each member was so important that it was considered a crime to injure someone if they were trying to distinguish themselves or gain personal glory, because to do so would endanger the whole group. The Greeks followed this way of war, since the Turkish army was numerically superior. During their conflicts with the Turks, the tactics of surprise, ambush and hiding were applied, while in attacks by the Turks they defended themselves with natural or artificial fortifications (drums).\nThey fought scattered, standing or kneeling, behind whatever they found in front of them: behind a wall, a tree, a rock or even the corpses of their enemies. These covers were called meterizia. Sometimes surrounded, pinned down for days and nights and even deprived of water, food and sleep, they found the strength (at times when the enemy thought they were exhausted and ready to surrender) to jump from their positions and make the so-called y\u00fcr\u00fcy\u00fc\u015f, the desperate raid. That is, to rush upon them, to open a way with their spears through their lines and to escape. In other cases, resistance to the death was their usual tactic, knowing full well that there was no other hope of salvation. The basic elements that characterize the conduct of traditional stealth warfare are: ambushes, surprise, wearing down the opponent and a quick retreat. These elements were later adopted by regular armies in the \"Special Forces\".\nThe tactics and logic of stealth warfare throughout the ages can be summed up in what Sun Tzu has said in \u00abThe Art of War\u00bb:\nEvery war is based on cunning. Therefore, when you can, feign helplessness, when you are active, feign inactivity. When you are near, make it seem that you are far, when you are far, show that you are near. Offer the enemy a decoy, to mislead him, pretend to scatter your forces and hit him. When he gathers, prepare against him, where possible avoid him. Enrage the enemy general and confuse him. Keep him under pressure and wear him down. When he has unity, divide him. Attack where he is unprepared. Hit him when he's not expecting you. These are the secrets of victory.\n-Sun Tzu, The Art of War\nArmor\nPistola-National Historical Museum\nThe main weapons used in stealth warfare during the period of the Greek Revolution of 1821 were the pistols, the rifle, the knife and the yatagan.\nThe evolution of kleftopolemos\nToday's kleftopolemos is an evolution of Guerrilla warfare. This type of warfare has been successfully tested mainly in the struggle of colonized peoples against occupying forces, by citizens resisting dictatorships or even civil wars. What has changed is that the rural character of the war has receded, as it manifests itself in urban areas, while at the same time it has assumed a political character.\n",
    "Italian cleric (1561\u20131633)\nFor other people named Carlo Carafa, see Carlo Carafa (disambiguation).\nThe Venerable Carlo Carafa (Mariglianella, 1561 \u2013 Naples, 8 September 1633) was an Italian presbyter and founder of Congregation of Pious Workers.\nBiography\nCarlo Carafa was born in 1561 and joined the Society of Jesus at the age of sixteen. After five years in the Society, constant ill-health forced him to leave. Eventually he decided to enter the army. One day while passing the Palazzo Reale di Napoli, he happened to hear the nuns chanting at the Monastery of Regina Caeli and stopped to listen. Carafa decided to make a change and at the age of thirty-four, took up the study of philosophy and theology. Five years later he was ordained. After this his life became a constant exercise of charity and zeal. Cardinal Giesualdo, seeing his good work, assigned him to the church of Santa Maria di Tutti i Beni. Several ecclesiastics who were under his spiritual guidance left their homes to live with him and aid him in his apostolic labors, which the archbishop allowed.\nIn 1601 Carafa opened his church, and, with eight priests, he began to work. He faced many trials: he was misrepresented at Rome; he had to leave the church which had been given to him, and most of his disciples abandoned him. But he kept up his courage, rented a house and continued his work with three companions, who had remained faithful. Some time after, his perseverance was rewarded by new accessions to his community. This enabled him to establish several houses of his congregation. He obtained for it the approbation of Pope Gregory XV by a Brief of 1621. It received the title of Congregation of the Pious Workers. After a life of great merit, spent in works of charity, he died on 8 September 1633. He was declared a Servant of God on 18 September 1740, and The Venerable on 16 December 1832.\nCongregation of Pious Workers\nMain article: Congregation of Pious Workers Rural Catechists \u00a7\u00a0Congregation of Pious Workers\nSee also\nKatharina Valenta, a courtesan converted by Carlo Carafa\n",

In the spring of 1942, fierce battles are taking place on the Leningrad Front; enormous human and technical resources are being spent on holding back the advance of German troops. Recruits are arriving in a mixed aviation regiment - female volunteers who will fly military aircraft. The future female pilots do not understand well what is happening, and the male staff, and they are the majority, treat the girls with distrust. They will have to not only prove that they can handle fighter jets just as well as men, but also overcome their fears and doubts every day.\nZhenya is a talented pilot whose only dream is to fly masterfully and defeat enemies. She feels more confident in the sky than on earth, since she has difficulty building relationships with others. Despite her young age, she has already experienced a lot, so she tries not to get close to anyone, so as not to experience the pain of loss again. But what Zhenya is running from is hot on her heels. She becomes the best pilot of the regiment, surpassing even experienced commanders with her skill, and the rest of the girls fly better and better. But despite the emotional distance she tries to keep from others, the deaths of her colleagues cannot help but touch her. And there are more and more of them.\nCast\nAnastasia Talyzina as Evgenia 'Zhenya' Belova\nAglaya Tarasova as Ekaterina 'Katya'\nKristina Lapshina as Maria 'Masha'\nSergey Bezrukov as Alexey Astafiev\nElena Lyadova as Rita\nOleg Grinchenko as Captain Bondar\nAnton Shagin as Volodya\nKristina Isaykina-Berger as Marina Yatsenko\nOther cast\nIgor Mityushkin as Pavel 'Pashechka', mechanic\nIgor Korovin as Stepanov, technician\nAnna Isaeva as Sveta, a nurse\nMariya Melnikova as a nurse\nVladimir Tyaptushkin as Timofey\nAndrey Kondratyev as Konyakhin\nMariya Gerasimenko as Anya Savelyeva\nDarya Shevelko as Shevelko, a female technician\nAlyona Mityushkina as Mityushkina, a female technician\nMarusya Furina as Medvedeva, a female technician\nPolina Dudkina as Frolova, a female pilot\nPolina Krasavina as Chumakova, a female pilot\nAnna Musina as Novotortseva, a female pilot\nPhilip Dyachkov as Kirill, pilot\nIvan Ryabenko as a pilot\nMikhail Samarin as a pilot\nPyotr Logachev as a pilot\nProduction\nWork on the film began in 2018.

    "Swiss singer (born 1999)\nThis article is about the Swiss singer. For the German rapper, see Nimo (rapper).\nMusical artist\nNemo Mettler (born 3 August 1999), known mononymously as Nemo, is a Swiss musician and singer-rapper who plays the violin, piano and drums. They were the first openly non-binary act to represent Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest, and later won the 2024 contest with the song \"The Code\". They were the first openly non-binary musician to win the contest, and the third winner representing Switzerland (following the 1956 and 1988 competitions).\nCareer\nNemo at the press conference following their Eurovision win in 2024\nNemo began their interest in music at the age of three, learning to play the violin, piano and drum machine. They studied opera singing from age nine to thirteen. At the age of ten, they joined the Biel children's opera and performed in Mozart's The Magic Flute which was later used as inspiration for \"The Code\". At thirteen, they performed in the musical I've never been to New York. They also began rapping at this age, competing in Swiss contests and performing songs they independently wrote. They found early success in battle rap as a teenager and performed on season three of the Swiss television show Die gr\u00f6ssten Schweizer Talente\u00a0, receiving praise from the judges.\nIn 2015, Nemo released their first EP Clownfisch, under the name Nemo (CH), which peaked at number 95 in the Swiss charts. In 2016, when they were seventeen, Nemo's single \"Cypher\" went viral. In 2017, Nemo released the EPs Mom\u00e4nt-Kids and Fundb\u00fcro under the name Nemo (CH). Fundb\u00fcro contained the single \"Du\", which reached number 4 in Switzerland. \"Ke Bock\" and \"Himalaya\" also charted. In the same year they studied solo singing in jazz and pop at Zurich University of the Arts, won the SRF 3 Best Talent prize, and later settled in Berlin to pursue their music career. In 2018, Nemo won four Swiss Music Prizes, including best song of the year for Du and best concert performance of the year.\nAfter staying in Los Angeles in 2020, Nemo decided to switch from singing in Swiss German to English. On the second season of The Masked Singer Switzerland in 2021, they were unmasked as a panda and finished in fifth place. In 2022, they released their EP Whatever Feels Right, this time under the name Nemo. On 29 February 2024, they were announced as the Swiss representative in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 with the song \"The Code\", and performed in the second semi-final of the contest, on 9 May. They won the Eurovision final on 11 May with 591 points, becoming the first openly non-binary performer to win the contest; they also finished with the fourth highest amount of points in the final in the competition's history.\nPersonal life\nNemo at Eurovision Song Contest 2024Nemo Mettler was born in Biel/Bienne in the canton of Bern. Their father, Markus Mettler, is an entrepreneur and inventor, and mother, Nadja Schnetzler, a journalist. Nemo's sister, Ella, is a photographer. She collaborates with Nemo in the artistic direction of their projects. Nemo's first name means 'no one' in Latin. During a mission for the Swiss Red Cross in El Salvador in 2018, they said \"my parents thought that if I was no-one, I could become anyone.\"\nIn 2022, Nemo came out as pansexual via an Instagram story, and as of 2024, they have been in a five-year relationship with their girlfriend, who was the first person they came out to (as non-binary).\nIn November 2023, Nemo came out as non-binary in an article in the SonntagsZeitung, after being closeted since around 2021. In the article, Nemo also stated that they prefer to be referred to by their given name instead of pronouns in German, and use they/them pronouns in English.\nNemo currently lives in Berlin.\nActivism\nFollowing their Eurovision win, Nemo called on the Swiss government to legally recognise a third gender, after this proposal was rejected in 2022. When asked in an interview who they would call first after their win, they responded with Beat Jans, Switzerland's justice minister, stating that \"we need to have the representation in our politics\". A spokesperson for Jans later stated that the minister had responded and was willing to meet Nemo to discuss the rights of non-binary people in Switzerland. In response to the topic, Green Party member of the National Council Sibel Arslan wrote on social media that \"a non-binary person who officially doesn't exist in Switzerland has won Eurovision 2024\", and that the matter was \"more relevant than ever\", urging the Federal Council to act.\nDiscography\nExtended plays\nSingles\nAs lead artist\nAs featured artist\nOther charted songs\nAwards and achievements\n",
    "North Korean pop song and propaganda hymn\n\"Friendly Father\" or \"Friendly Parent\" is a North Korean pop song and propaganda hymn praising the country's third and current supreme leader, Kim Jong Un. It was written by An Pun Hui and composed by Jong Chun Il. The song was first played on 16 April 2024, at a ceremony celebrating the completion of new apartment buildings in the country's capital, Pyongyang.\n\"Friendly Father\" received considerable media attention outside of Korea due to its popularity on social media platforms like TikTok, where hundreds of users had uploaded videos of themselves listening or dancing to the song shortly after its release.\nRelease\n\"Friendly Father\" debuted on 16 April 2024, sung live by Kim Ryu Kyong at a ceremony celebrating the completion of 10,000 new apartment units in the Hwasong district of Pyongyang. Such ceremonies are common in North Korea and broadcast on state media to promote the ruling Workers' Party of Korea. The music video for \"Friendly Father\" was released the next day and played on the state-controlled Korean Central Television.\nStyle and composition\n\"Friendly Father\" has been described as \"upbeat\" and \"catchy\". Peter Moody, a North Korea analyst and visiting professor at Korea University, compared the song's style to that of Swedish supergroup ABBA, pointing to the shared use of a \"rich set of orchestral-sounding sequences\". This comparison was echoed by several users of the social media platform TikTok, where the song had gone viral. Frances Mao of the BBC identified the song's genre as \"synthy-electro pop\". The music was composed by Jong Chun Il.\nThe lyrics of \"Friendly Father\" were written by An Pun Hui and praise North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un as a \"trustworthy and loving leader\". The chorus encourages the listener to \"boast about Kim Jong Un, a friendly parent\".\nReactions\nNorth Korea\nOn the front page of its 20 April 2024 edition, the state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper published an editorial which stated: \"'Friendly Father' has created a storm of reactions\u00a0... and warmed the hearts of millions of people across the country.\"\nThe Seoul-based Daily NK reported negative reactions from residents of North Hamgyong Province, who juxtaposed their living conditions with the song's lyrics. North Hamgyong is the most underdeveloped province of North Korea.\nSouth Korea\nThe Korea Communications Standards Commission blocked the music video for \"Friendly Father\" at the request of the National Intelligence Service. The commission also blocked 29 alternate versions of the video. The South Korean government considers the video a violation of Article 447 of the Information and Communications Network Act, which prohibits the \"distribution of illegal information\", including North Korean government-produced content outlawed by the National Security Act. The commission's official statement on the block read in part: \"The video is typical content linked to psychological warfare against South Korea, as it was posted on a channel operated to connect with the outside world and is mainly focused on unilaterally idolising and glorifying Kim .\"\nOutside of Korea\n\"Friendly Father\" gained significant traction online in social media spaces outside of Korea, particularly on TikTok. In the two weeks following the song's release, hundreds of videos were uploaded to TikTok of users listening or dancing to the song.\nAnalysts have described the song's reception on TikTok as a mix of genuine enjoyment and comedic ridicule. Emma Briant, a British specialist on propaganda and information warfare, argues that while the North Korean government likely did not expect the song to go viral on social media, they are nonetheless \"not naive about how this may look to Western audiences\". Briant further argues that \" is obviously intended for this kind of mass distribution\", but also that \"North Korea does not necessarily put this out around the world expecting it to be taken seriously\", opining that it was likely \"created deliberately to be humorous\".\nSee also\nMusic portalNorth Korea portal\nMusic of North Korea\nPropaganda in North Korea\nNotes\n^ Although the song title is commonly translated as \"Friendly Father\", \uc5b4\ubc84\uc774 actually means \"parent(s)\", not \"father\".\n",

NGC 3799 was discovered by British astronomer John Herschel in 1832.\nNGC 3799 and NGC 3800 are two gravitationally interacting galaxies and appear in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the symbol Arp 83. Halton Arp describes these as an example of galaxies by presenting a bridge of matter between them and having a high surface gloss.\nThe luminosity class of NGC 3799 is II and it has a broad HI line. According to the SIMBAD database, NGC 3799 is a LINER galaxy, that is to say a galaxy whose nucleus presents an emission spectrum characterized by broad lines of weakly ionized atoms.\nTo date, a non-redshift measurement gives a distance of approximately 47,000 Mpc (\u223c153 million ly). This value is far outside the Hubble distance values. Note, however, that it is with the average value of independent measurements, when they exist, that the NASA/IPAC database calculates the diameter of a galaxy.\nNGC 3800 group\nNGC 3799 is part of a group of galaxies that has at least 16 members which make up what is commonly known as the NGC 3800 group.

    "\nMonumental Jewish necropolis from the 1st century CE\nDeir ed Derb (\"The monastery of the road\") is a monumental Jewish tomb with an elaborate fa\u00e7ade dated to the 1st century CE. The site is located in the West Bank about 1/2-mile SE of the village center of Qarwat Bani Hassan. Its Arab name derives from the ancient road passing near it and refers to a monastery.\nHistory of research\nThe tomb was surveyed for the Palestine Exploration Fund in 1873 and the main tomb was described as \"one of the finest sepulchral monuments in the country, resembling in character some of the tombs near Jerusalem\". In further years to come surveys and rescue excavations were done (Yeivin - 1972, Dar - late 70's, Raviv -2013) at and next to the main tomb.\nDescription\nDecoration above the entrance\nThe front of Deir ed Derb, 1873\nThe tomb contains three rock-cut chambers with a courtyard in front. The entrance to the tomb has a portico measuring 5.5 metres (18\u00a0ft) wide and 3.0 metres (10\u00a0ft) tall. There is a 15-metre (50\u00a0ft) long Doric cornice in front supported by two Ionic columns and two pilasters. The carved decoration included 15 triglyphs and 14 rosettes \u2013 all the rosettes had different designs.\nThe main tomb\nBurial chamber\nThe tomb has a large (about 10x15 m) rock-cut front yard. On the side of the yard, to the right (west) of the front of the tomb, a monumental staircase was carved leading into the courtyard. The front of the tomb is decorated in a combined style: two Greek style columns between two arts (antis in distylos). The right (western) column does not exist today and was probably stolen in ancient times. The central part of the frieze did not survive. In carved tufts Roses (rosettes) of different types. Above the frieze, a cornice consisting of dentils was designed. Below the part from the triglyphs there are drops (gutae).\nThe entrance to the burial chambers is carved into the southern wall of the entrance room. The opening was closed with a circular burial stone moving inside a trestle rail. A niche was cut above the opening, which damaged a decoration with chiseled edges that was located on the entrance room walls, it seems to have been carved at a later period. A parallel to this kind of niche is found in the central tomb in the necropolis of Khirbet Kurkush, in Dar's opinion, this alcove symbolizes the change of ownership from Jewish to foreign.\nThe opening leads to a central rectangular burial chamber. A standing pit was carved in the center of the room. Three niches were carved into the wall in front of the opening. On both walls on the sides (the eastern and the western) openings were carved leading to two additional burial chambers were carved with arches. A standing pit was cut in the western (right) burial chamber, and a pit was installed. In the southern wall a burial vault was carved and beneath it a wide and shallow trough (about 0.2 m deep). It seems that this room was not completed. The eastern (left) room was neatly carved. A small, relatively narrow standing pit was carved in its center, in each of its four corners pilasters were carved simulating small and stylish columns. Three vaults were installed on the walls of the room - one on each wall. At the bottom of them are troughs wide and shallow burials (about 0.2 m deep). The researchers who discussed this grave did not refer to the decorations that were designed on the outer walls of the burial troughs. In the outer septum of each of the three burial pits are distinguished by the design of a requiem bed with legs (kline). This decoration has parallels in the Greco-Roman burial world as well as in Jewish burial tradition.\nAnalysis\nAn archeological analysis led Dar to conclude that there was a flourishing Jewish settlement near the site during the late Second Temple period and even up to the Great revolt and the Bar Kokhba revolt. After the latter, the area was settled by Samaritans.\nThere is a consensus among all archeologists and researches who have been to the site of Deir ed Derb, that it resembles the Tombs of the Kings in Jerusalem and similar sites in Samaria. The structure bears a strong resemblance to some tombs by Jerusalem, which have been dated to 1st century CE. Magen has linked Deir ed-Derb and other similar tombs in Samaria (including Khirbet Kurkush and Mokata 'Abud) to the departure of Jewish craftsmen from Jerusalem to Samaria before the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Peleg-Barkat, on the other hand, suggested that these tombs were constructed by local Jewish elites who were inspired by the elaborate graves of the Jewish elite in Jerusalem of the late Second Temple period. In the close vicinity of the tomb, about 20 other rock-cut burial caves were found.\n",
    "Arabic poetry composed between 540\u2013620 AD\nPre-Islamic Arabic poetry (or simply pre-Islamic poetry) refers to the corpus of Arabic poetry composed in pre-Islamic Arabia roughly between 540 and 620 AD, though its composers did not think of themselves as \"pre-Islamic\" or as \"Arabs\". Traditional Arabic literature called it al-shi\u02bfr al-J\u0101hil\u012b, \"poetry from the Jahiliyyah\". Surviving works largely originate from Najd, located today in central Saudi Arabia.\nPre-Islamic poetry constitutes a major source for classical Arabic language both in grammar and vocabulary, and as a reliable historical record of the political and cultural life of the time. A number of major poets are known from the time period, perhaps most prominent among them being Imru' al-Qais.\nPoetry held an important position in pre-Islamic society with the poet or sha'ir filling the role of historian, soothsayer and propagandist. Words in praise of the tribe (qit'ah) and lampoons denigrating other tribes (hija') seem to have been some of the most popular forms of early poetry. The sha'ir represented an individual tribe's prestige and importance in the Arabian peninsula, and mock battles in poetry or zajal would stand in lieu of real wars. 'Ukaz, a market town not far from Mecca, would play host to a regular poetry festival where the craft of the sha'irs would be exhibited.\nAlongside the sha'ir, and often as his poetic apprentice, was the rawi or reciter. The job of the rawi was to learn the poems by heart and to recite them with explanations and probably often with embellishments. This tradition allowed the transmission of these poetic works and the practice was later adopted by the huffaz for their memorisation of the Qur'an. At some periods there have been unbroken chains of illustrious poets, each one training a rawi as a bard to promote his verse, and then to take over from them and continue the poetic tradition. For example, Tufayl trained 'Awas ibn Hajar, 'Awas trained Zuhayr, Zuhayr trained his son Ka`b, Ka`b trained al-Hutay'ah, al-Hutay'ah trained Jamil Buthaynah and Jamil trained Kuthayyir `Azza.\nMajor collections\nThe five major collections of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry were made in the 8th and 9th centuries and are, alongside published editions and translations:\nThe Mu'allaqat (\"The Suspended Odes\" or \"The Hanging Poems\"), a group of seven long poems collected in the 8th century.

    "The Potaissa Sphinx statue is a 3rd-century bronze statue from the former province of Dacia. The sphinx sculpture itself bears striking parallels with the famous Naxos sphinx from 560 BC, which is now in the Delphi Archaeological Museum.\nThe history of the statue\nFor the first time, in February 1847, a German archaeological magazine published the statue and its inscription, as well as a drawing of the statue. According to the report at the time, the find was discovered during an excavation near Torda.\nGerman archaeologists judged the statue's inscription to be authentic, and many tried to decipher it, but no one succeeded.\nThe statue found its place in the private collection of the archaeologist Count J\u00f3zsef Kem\u00e9ny, who led the excavation.\nAfter the German presentation, J\u00e1nos \u00c9rdy-Luczenbacher requested the statue from J\u00f3zsef Kem\u00e9ny's collection and presented it to the professors of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, as well as to Croatian, German and Austrian archaeologists and historians.\nThe statue is then returned to Kem\u00e9ny J\u00f3zsef's collection, where it is stolen along with many other works of art during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848/49.\nThe text\nAt the end of December 2003, Dr. P\u00e9ter R\u00e9v\u00e9sz, professor of informatics and honorary professor of classical philology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, published his study in which he successfully deciphers that the text on the statue is an archaic Hungarian text written in special Greek letters. With this, the statue became the oldest written language memory in Hungarian. The interpretation of the text has been confirmed by several other experts and is now accepted. Most recently, it was published by the journal Mediterranean Archeology and Archaeometry.\nAfter the decipherment, however, some experts called the statue a fake.\nArguments for and against the authenticity of the sculpture\nArguments against its authenticity\nOne of the few contemporary records of the statue was found in the archives of J\u00f3zsef Kem\u00e9ny, whose early career involved a document falsification scandal. According to some opinions, the statue never existed, and only J\u00f3zsef Kem\u00e9ny invented the whole thing.\nJ\u00f3zsef Kem\u00e9ny never presented the statue to the general public, as he claimed that his mansion was robbed during the revolution.\nArguments for its authenticity\nThe type of Greek letters on the statue were only discovered nearly 50 years after the discovery of the statue. So, Kem\u00e9ny could not have known about such letters and could not have used them in a forgery.\nContemporary Roman sources mention a sphinx statue erected in the Isis temple in the settlement.\nThe statue was presented at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and examined by several Austrian, Hungarian, Croatian and German historians.\nThe Hungarian text written in Greek letters only contains words that could already exist in the Hungarian in the third century, while it does not contain words that the Hungarians took from other languages only later. However, in J\u00f3zsef's time, these linguistic theories had not yet been developed, on the basis of which a possible forger would have been able to choose and use only authentic words.\nA German archaeological newspaper published an accurate drawing of the statue and the inscription on it in 1847, before J\u00f3zsef Kem\u00e9ny.\nIn a letter addressed to a confidential friend of his time, J\u00f3zsef Kem\u00e9ny reports that his mansion was really looted during the revolution.\nAt the beginning of his career, J\u00f3zsef forged only one document, but his later works are all authentic, and therefore he was a member of many scientific institutions. He never faked artifacts, but he did collect them.\nSo, if Kem\u00e9ny J\u00f3zsef did indeed forge the statue, he should have been 50 years ahead of the Greek Archaeological Society and the German and British archaeologists in Dipylon and should have discovered the Greek writing type, well before they did, which is on the statue. He should also have found Roman records of the sphinx nearly 100 years earlier than the other historians. He would also have had a nearly 50-year head start over the Finnish, Hungarian, Austrian, and German linguists in Hungarian language research, so that he could forge only those words on the statue that were truly authentic. Then, in an incredibly strange way, he should have been disinterested in the sculpture, since he never deciphered its writing, and never profited from it scientifically. Then his previous vast research should be destroyed so that it is not later found in his archives, which have now been completely overlooked.\n",

    "Former religious organization in Poland\nThe United Evangelical Church of the Polish People's Republic was a religious organization existing from 1947 to 1988, comprising five Polish Protestant communities characterized by evangelical piety and the practice of baptizing only those who were conscious of their faith. Two of them had a Pentecostal character. During the Polish People's Republic period, it was the largest evangelical church in Poland \u2013 the second largest denomination of this profile at the time was the Baptist Christian Church of the Republic of Poland. Since 1967, the church's headquarters had been located at Zag\u00f3rna Street in Warsaw. Until 1953, the church was a federation, within which each group retained its distinctiveness; in 1953, these distinctions were abolished. In 1981, the United Evangelical Church returned to a federative structure.\nThe first post-war unification initiatives among evangelical Christians in Poland emerged as early as 1945 when the Baptist Christian Church of the Republic of Poland was founded, bringing together various strands, but within the next two years, all groups withdrew from it, leaving only the Baptists. Soon after, a new unification initiative emerged, resulting in the establishment of the United Evangelical Church in 1947. Initially, three churches belonged to it, and from 1953, five. In 1956, some of the former Union of Evangelical Christians' congregations attempted to leave the United Evangelical Church and appealed to the authorities to legalize their association. The authorities responded with repression, and the congregations were forced to return to the United Evangelical Church. The \"Lublin group\" resisted the longest, until the late 1960s. Until 1975, Free Christians (Plymouth Brethren) dominated, and from 1981, Pentecostals. The change in the political situation after 1980 allowed the individual confessions to become subjects within one church. In 1981, a group of Free Christians left, forming a separate religious association called the Church of Free Christians of the Polish People's Republic. From then on, the United Evangelical Church encompassed four communities. In 1987, at the church's last synod, it was decided to dissolve the United Evangelical Church. Towards the end of its existence, it exceeded 17,000 believers, with the largest numerical growth occurring in the 1980s. As a result of its dissolution, four separate churches were formed: the Church of Christians of the Evangelical Faith in the Republic of Poland, the Church of Evangelical Christians, the Church of Christ Congregations, and the Pentecostal Church in Poland.\nThe basic unit in the United Evangelical Church was an autonomous congregation with legal personality. The congregation had the right to decide on the admission or exclusion of its own members. Among the Church's major achievements were the construction of a central chapel in Warsaw, the establishment of a Home for the Elderly in Ostr\u00f3da, and publishing activities, including the publication of the monthly magazine Chrze\u015bcijanin. The United Evangelical Church was a member of the Polish Ecumenical Council.\nHistory\nFirst unification initiatives\nStanis\u0142aw Krakiewicz in the central chapel (1974)\nIn the Evangelical-Baptist communities in Polish territories, the first unification idea emerged after the end of the Polish-Bolshevik War and concerned the Union of Slavic Baptist Congregations and the Union of Evangelical Christians. In 1923, the Evangelical Christian and Baptist Union in Poland was established in Brest, but after two years, due to different attitudes towards military service, the Baptists decided to pursue independent activities.\nThe unification ideas resurfaced during World War II and were relevant immediately after its end. The biblical motto that they may all be one (John 17:21) was often cited. A significant obstacle to realizing this idea was the ambitions of leaders of individual groups.\nAfter World War II, the first unification initiative came from the Baptists, at that time the largest Evangelical group in Poland. As a result, in May 1945, a religious union was formed, bringing together several Evangelical groups with similar doctrines under the name Polish Church of Christian Baptists. Pentecostals did not join this church. The union was recognized by the state authorities in May 1946. Already in January 1946 (before its legal situation was regulated), a group of Evangelical Christians led by Ludwik Szenderowski withdrew from it, and in November 1946, the Church Union of Christ with Jerzy Sacewicz as president also withdrew. Konstanty Jaroszewicz, who visited Poland in 1946, contributed to the separation of the Christ group, encouraged the leaders of the Church of Christ to break away from the Baptist Christian Church and promised them financial assistance. The Free Christians withdrew in June 1947. The decision to withdraw was influenced, among other things, by a personal conflict between Free Christian ",
    " Professional American arena football league\nThis article is about the new and current Arena Football League. For the original league, see Arena Football League.\nThe Arena Football League (AFL) is a professional indoor American football league founded in 2023 with their first season beginning in 2024. The current AFL takes its identity, history, rulebook and some team names from, but is not directly connected to, the previous iteration of the Arena Football League founded by Jim Foster in 1986.\nOn February 1, 2023, G6 Sports Group (based in Toronto, Ontario, and Middletown, Delaware), a new ownership group that had acquired the league's trademarks and social media accounts, announced the league's launch, as a revival of the previous Arena Football League that operated in two incarnations from 1987 to 2008 and 2010 to 2019.\nThe league launched in April 2024 with 16 teams, six of which were absorbed through a pre-launch merger with the existing Champions Indoor Football. Three weeks into the season, after numerous controversies, unfulfilled commitments and teams suspending operations, the ownership group fired founding commissioner Lee Hutton and reorganized as a ten-team league (shortly thereafter restored to eleven, then reduced to nine), hiring former NFL coach Jeff Fisher as its interim commissioner and bringing back general counsel Jerry Kurz from the previous incarnation of the league.\nHistory\nBackground\nMain article: Arena Football League\nThe original Arena Football League, created in 1981 and founded in 1986 by Jim Foster, had previously existed in two interrelated incarnations between 1987 and 2008, and 2010 to 2019. Only one of the current AFL teams has direct ties to the former AFL: the Albany Firebirds; the Firebirds had previously played as the Albany Empire the previous three seasons in the National Arena League after its ownership group acquired the intellectual properties of the Albany Empire of the AFL (the final champions of that league and itself a successor to two previous AFL and AF2 franchises known as the Firebirds) after the AFL's bankruptcy. Two other existing clubs revive the names of former AFL teams: the Orlando Predators (also coming from the NAL) and the Nashville Kats; several other such revivals were included at the start of the season but were among those contracted in the reorganization.\nPre-launch\nOn February 1, 2023, over a year after Darren Arbet, who had acquired the league's trademarks out of bankruptcy, sold them to an investment group called G6 Sports Investment Group and sub-partner F1 Sports & Entertainment, the new owners confirmed plans to relaunch the Arena Football League. The relaunched league, led by chairman Chris Chetty, president Anthony Rossi, president of operations Shan Singh, and commissioner Lee A. Hutton III, will feature 16 teams playing a 10-game season over the course of the summer months, followed by a postseason format that has yet to be determined. In a later interview, Chetty indicated that G6 planned no involvement or spending, with its only role being to collect licensing royalties from Hutton, who was given mostly free rein to build out the league: \"everything down the line, turnkey. As an investor this sounds good to me. Hey, it doesn\u2019t sound like I have to operate.\"\nThe league returned its logo to the one used from 2003 to 2018. The new iteration of the league announced plans to feature \"streaming, betting, technology, (and) virtual reality\" elements, per Rossi. In a February 2023 interview with ArenaFan.com, the commissioner mentioned that the league would have a salary cap of $700,000, but the league will allows additional salary spending for \"franchise players\". Players were promised a $1,000 per-game salary, substantially higher than that of other indoor leagues and in line with the AFL's previous incarnations.\nOn July 18, 2023, TMZ Sports initially reported, and the league soon confirmed, that the AFL had selected the following cities that would be receiving new teams: Austin, Texas; Boise, Idaho; Bakersfield, California; Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; St. Paul, Minnesota; Lake Charles, Louisiana; Cincinnati, Ohio; Orlando, Florida; Salem, Oregon; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; St. Louis, Missouri; Tallahassee, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; Everett, Washington and Odessa, Texas. Several of the cities' arenas indicated they had never been contacted or had only limited conversations before being awarded teams, with Cincinnati's arenas indicating they had in fact rejected the league's advances. Hutton purposely avoided confirming any news reports, stating that he would only release information \"on our time,\" and threatened any news outlets who reported critically on the league with \"egg on their faces come April 2024.\"\nOn August 29, 2023, the league officially announced that the Billings Outlaws, formerly of Champions Indoor Football, would be the inaugural members of the new version of the league.

    "Business enterprise owned by one or more members of the LGBT community\nLGBT-, or queer-owned businesses are businesses owned and often operated by members of the LGBTQIA+ community. They may also be described as being owned by specific subgroups, such as gay-, lesbian-, or trans-owned businesses.\nVisibility of queer-owned businesses is an important part for the community and many businesses cater specifically to marginalized people by offering products that are not otherwise widely available. They are commonly more likely to have difficulty acquiring financial backing.\nSome government institutions and municipalities have special programs to support minority-owned businesses and have started to include LGBT-owned businesses in such programs.\nIn 2022, Charlie Sprinkman created the website Everywhere Is Queer to help promote queer-owned businesses around the world.\nCanada\nCape & Cowl is among notable LGBT-owned businesses in Canada.\nMexico\nPaco Ruiz opened Club Paco Paco (later known as Paco's Ranch) in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, in December 1989.

    "Military unit\nThe 175th Rifle Division was originally formed as an infantry division of the Red Army in the North Caucasus Military District in July 1940, based on the shtat (table of organization and equipment) of September 13, 1939. It was still in that District at the time of the German invasion, and it was soon moved to the Kiev Fortified Region as part of Southwestern Front. It would remain defending the Ukrainian capital into September, eventually as part of 37th Army, when it was deeply encircled and destroyed.\nA new 175th was designated in March 1942, based on a 400-series division that had begun forming the previous December in the Siberian Military District. It was soon moved to the Ural Military District, and after a rushed period of training it joined the reformed 28th Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, before that Army was assigned to Southwestern Front. In May it formed part of the Front's northern shock group for the offensive intended to liberate Kharkiv. While initially hampered by the failure to take the German strongpoint at Ternovaya it gradually developed momentum in cooperation with 169th Rifle Division and ended up farther into the German positions than any other formation in the northern group, reaching to just north of Lyptsi, before being struck by an armored counterattack on May 20 and being driven back to near its starting line, at considerable cost. In June it was nearly encircled during Operation Wilhelm, but managed to escape, again with serious losses. When the main German summer offensive began later that month the remnants of the 175th were driven back to the Don River, where a relative handful of personnel and equipment were able to cross after fighting out of encirclement. The division was officially written off on September 4.\nThe final 175th began as the Ural Rifle Division of the NKVD in October in the Ural Military District. It retained the name \"Ural\" as an honorific. Early in the new year it, and five similar divisions, were transferred to the Red Army and formed as the new 70th Army. The Army was soon assigned to Central Front, where it joined the advance toward Oryol in late February and March 1943, but proved ineffective due to low standards of training and leadership. Over the following months, as these issues were taken in hand, the 175th helped to prepare for the expected German summer offensive against the Kursk salient. When this began the division was in the Army's second echelon and saw some defensive combat on the western fringe of 9th Army's attack on July 8, where it helped fight off a force of up to 200 panzers. A week later it again began advancing against the Oryol salient, reaching the German defenses at its base by late August, at which time it was transferred to 48th Army, still in Central Front. During September it advanced through northeastern Ukraine, across the Dniepr and into eastern Belarus, where it fought into January 1944, mostly near Gomel, Rechytsa and Shatsilki. At this point it was removed to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding and reassignment, but returned about a month later, now as part of 47th Army's 125th Rifle Corps on the long left flank of 1st Belorussian Front. It would remain under these commands for the duration of the war. In a preliminary operation on early July the 175th took part in eliminating a German salient around Kovel, and received its name as a battle honor. During the main Lublin\u2013Brest offensive later that month it advanced through western Belarus and into eastern Poland, eventually running up against the German-held fortifications at Praga. After these were finally taken in mid-September the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. During the winter offensive into Poland in January 1945 the 175th, with its Army, outflanked Warsaw from the northeast, and two of its regiments were given battle honors for helping to take the city. Following this, it advanced into East Prussia and East Pomerania where its subunits received several decorations. In the final offensive on Berlin the 47th Army attacked out of the bridgehead over the Oder at K\u00fcstrin and as the operation developed swung north of the city, eventually linking up with units of 1st Ukrainian Front on April 25 in the Potsdam area. During the first five days of May, during and after the surrender of Berlin, the 175th, with its Corps, faced and defeated the largest effort to break out to the west. Following the war 47th Army was assigned to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, but it was disbanded in early 1946 and its units returned to the USSR.

    "Producer of architectural terra cotta\nThe New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company was a manufacturer of architectural terracotta based in Queens, New York, U.S.\nHistory\nBeginning in the 1870s, architectural terracotta grew in popularity in the United States after architects were drawn to its adaptability for various aesthetic styles and its inherent fireproof qualities. The initial companies to find success were the Chicago Terra Cotta Works and the Perth Amboy Terra Cotta Company, but New York real estate magnate Orlando B. Potter saw an opportunity for a company based closer to New York City to succeed and founded the New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company with his son-in-law Walter Geer in 1886.\nThey recruited James Taylor, a ceramicist often described as \"the father of architectural terracotta\" in the United States, to act as superintendent of the new company's factory in Ravenswood, New York. Less than three months after the company began producing terracotta the entire factory was destroyed by fire. Taylor announced they would rebuild immediately and temporary sheds were built. A new factory, with an automatic sprinkler system, was built and operational in a few months and the company's rebirth was hailed by the community as \"Phoenix-like.\"\nThe company's 1892 office building in Queens, New York, designed by Francis H. Kimball\nIn 1892 the company constructed an office building, separate from its manufacturing facility, designed by architect Francis H. Kimball. As was often the case at the time the building was designed to showcase the various products the company was capable of producing, with a Renaissance and Tudor Revival design incorporating terracotta panels, chimney pots, and clay roof tiles.\nThe company was the fourth largest employer in Long Island City by 1915 and remained successful into the 1920s. A second manufacturing site was built in Old Bridge, New Jersey and the company went bankrupt in 1928\u20131929.\nAfter dissolution\nRichard Dalton, who had been president of the company from 1919 to 1928, formed the Eastern Terra Cotta Company in 1931 and used both of the New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company's facilities. This new company remained in operation until the mid-1940s, after which the 1892 office was used by Dalton for his construction company. When he died in 1968 the Queens property was sold to Citibank, which demolished the remaining manufacturing works.\nDespite opposition from Citibank and Queens borough president Donald Manes, the 1892 building was designated a New York City Landmark in an unusually fast application process in 1982. Afterwards it drew increasing attention for its unique architecture and in 1999 it was purchased by Stuart Match Suna, president of Silvercup Studios. Historic preservationists were initially happy about this purchase due to Suna's wife being an architect on the Landmarks Commission, but Suna did not make efforts to maintain the structure until forced to by lawyers from the Landmarks Commission. In the 2020s the building underwent restorations to the interior and exterior of the structure.\nNotable projects\nThe company produced architectural terracotta for many prominent buildings in and around New York City, including the Lincoln Building, the Corbin Building, the Schermerhorn Building, the Old Grolier Club, the Montauk Club, Carnegie Hall, and The Ansonia.\nGallery\nOrnamental terracotta on Carnegie Hall\nArchitectural terracotta seen on Schermerhorn Building\nArchitectural terracotta seen on facade of the Ansonia\nChimney pots on the 1892 office building\nDecorative terracotta on the 1892 office building\nSee also\nArchitectural terracotta\nGlazed architectural terra-cotta\nAtlantic Terra Cotta Company\n",

He started Zig-Zag in 1938 which was later re-established in Miami in 1960. From 1941 to 1960, he was the owner and director of the daily Havana newspaper Prensa Libre.\nCarb\u00f3 had been detained in the political prison at La Caba\u00f1a Fortress in January 1931, for publishing content in his newspaper, La Semana, that the government found objectionable prior to his eventual release in February 1931.\nRise to power\nRevolutionary expedition\nIn May 1931, Carb\u00f3 and Carlos Hevia equipped and led an expeditionary force from the United States which landed in G\u00edbara, a small community in the province of Oriente (now Holgu\u00edn Province). It was an attempt to oust Gerardo Machado's dictatorship, but it was suppressed by Machado's army. Carb\u00f3 was later charged with inspiring a rebellion in Oriente Province.\nCuban Revolution of 1933\nThe leaders of the 1933 Sergeants' revolution, from the left in the picture, Dr. Ram\u00f3n Grau, Sergio Carb\u00f3, and Sgt. Fulgencio Batista.\nIn August 1933, an army revolt in Havana forced President Machado to flee Cuba and he was succeeded by Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes y Quesada. The C\u00e9spedes administration assumed power on August 12, 1933, until Sergeant Fulgencio Batista staged a coup d'\u00e9tat called the Sergeants' Revolt on September 4, 1933. Carb\u00f3 was a leading factor in the uprising which brought the downfall of the Cespedes' presidency.\nPentarchy of 1933\nThe five members of the pentarchy, from the left in the picture, Jos\u00e9e M. Irisari, Porfirio Franca, Guillermo Portela, Ramon Grau, and Sergio Carb\u00f3.\nAn executive committee of five men including Carb\u00f3, Dr. Ram\u00f3n Grau, Jos\u00e9 Irisarri, Dr. Guillermo Portela, and Porfirio Franca replaced the C\u00e9spedes cabinet as Cuba's governmental leaders. On the committee, Carb\u00f3, a member of the Student Directory, acted as the Secretary of War. Following the coup, the five-member junta\u2014also referred to as The Pentarquia\u2014served as a transitional administration for just five days.\nOne Hundred Days Government\nWithin a week, Dr. Ram\u00f3n Grau was promoted to president, replacing the Pentarchy with the One Hundred Days Government on September 10, 1933. On November 13, 1933, Carb\u00f3 accused the United States ambassador to Cuba, Sumner Welles, of supporting an attempted uprising against President Grau's regime and asked that he be removed from his post. On January 15, 1934, Sergeant Batista forced Grau to resign, ending Grau's government of slightly more than a hundred days.\nOn October 16, 1934, Carb\u00f3 was declared not guilty in an urgency court of publishing articles against the government.\nCarb\u00f3 was an officer of the exile group, the Cuban Revolutionary Council and on April 21, 1961, he was acting as coordinator-general of the anti-Castro Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front (FRD).\nDeath\nSergio Carb\u00f3 died in Miami, Florida at Mercy Hospital on April 18, 1971.\n",

The ruin is commonly identified with Garob, a place mentioned in the Talmud in connection with the story of Micha's Idol. It is also identified with two sites from Crusader times.\nArchaeology\nKhirbet Ghuraba occupies the summit and western slope of a hill, located 4\u00a0km west of Seilun, where ancient Shiloh was located.\nPresently the site is in a largely dismantled state but with the surviving remnants of walls constructed from ashlar stones. Notable features include a 30-meter-long wall on the northern side, likely functioning as a revetment, alongside door jambs, rock-cut cellars, and cisterns.\nAdjacent to the site lies a burial cave containing a sarcophagus, while observations by Gu\u00e9rin note several columns. Kallai's documentation references an olive press within a cave and remnants of a large structure situated on the eastern perimeter of the ruins.\nThe site was surveyed by Kallai in 1972, and again by Finkelstein et al. in 1982. Potsherds found here mostly date from the Iron Age (I-II), Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine period, with smaller numbers from the Middle Ages and the early Ottoman period. Most of the pottery collected from the site's center is from the Roman and Byzantine periods.\nHistory\nAntiquity\nMultiple scholars, including Conder and Kitchener, Klein, Kopp, and Safrai, have associated Khirbet Ghuraba with Garob or Gareb, a place referenced in the Talmud:\"R. Nathan said: Garob to Shiloh is a distance of three mils, and the smoke of the altar and that of Micah's image intermingled\" (b. Sanhedrin 103b). Reeg suggests Khirbet Ghuraba or an alternate, unnamed site as its potential location. The findings from the Late Roman period further strengthen the identification with Garob.\nCrusader period\nR\u00f6hricht posits this site as Gerable, a significant place during the Crusader period, although Beyer favors identifying it with Carrubia, another contemporaneous site.\nArabic name\nAccording to E. H. Palmer, the name Khurbet Ghurabeh means: \"The ruin of the raven.\"\nSources\n^ a b c d e f g h i j Finkelstein, Israel; Lederman, Zvi; Bunimovitz, Shlomo, eds. (1997).

The British Foreign Office unsuccessfully asked the Iraq Petroleum Company not to use slave labor in the Gulf.\nThe Advisory Committee of Experts on Slavery (ACE) was a permanent committee of the League of Nations, inaugurated in 1933. \nIt was the first permanent slavery committee of the League of Nations, which was founded after a decade of work adressing the issue of slavery by temporary committees within the League. \nThe ACE conducted a global investigation concerning slavery, slave trade and force labor, and recommended solutions to address the issue. Its work lay the ground for the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery of 1956. \nHistory\nFoundation\nThe League of Nations had conducted an active work against chattel slavery and slave trade from the early 1920s. The investigation of the Temporary Slavery Commission (TSC) had resulted in the introduction of the 1926 Slavery Convention. \nIn 1932 the Committee of Experts on Slavery (CES) was established to investigate the efficiency of the 1926 Slavery Convention.\nThe result convinced the League of the need to establish a permanent committee to address the issue. \nIn 1933 the Committee of Experts on Slavery (CES) established the first permanent slavery committee, the Advisory Committee of Experts on Slavery (ACE). \nThe ACE held its first meeting the following year, and met annually five times between 1934 and 1938.\nActivity\nThe ACE conducted a major international investigation on chattel slavery and slave trade. The committee asked for reports from all member countries of the League of Nations, including the major colonial empires of the time. The governments were asked to report of all forms of slavery and slave trade taking place within the territories under their control, which the member countries of League as subject of the 1926 Slavery Convention were expected to actively oppose. \nIn 1938 George Maxwell of the ACE concluded that slave raids were almost nonexistent; that slave trade were significantly reduced; that the chattel slavery in the Aden Protectorate and the Persian Gulf were under control; and that in regard to slavery in Saudi Arabia and slavery in Yemen, nothing more could be expected.\nIn February 1939, it was decided that the Sixth meeting of the ACE were to be postphoned until later that same year; however by the outbreak of World War II in 3 September 1939 the activity of the ACE were effectively ended. \nAftermath and legacy\nThe global investigation of the occurrence of slavery and slave trade performed by the ACE between 1934 and 1939 was interupted by the outbreak of the World War II, but it was the foundation for the work against slavery performed by the UN after the war.\nWhen the League of Nations was succeeded by the United Nations (UN) after the end of the World War II, Charles Wilton Wood Greenidge of the Anti-Slavery International worked for the UN to continue the investigation of global slavery conducted by the ACE of the League, and in February 1950 the \nAd hoc Committee on Slavery of the United Nations was inaugurated, which ultimately resulted in the introduction of the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery.\nSee also\nBrussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889\u201390, 1889\nTemporary Slavery Commission, 1924\nCommittee of Experts on Slavery, 1932\nAd Hoc Committee on Slavery, 1950\n",
    "\nMykolas Kalmantas (born Mykolas Kalmantavi\u010dius; 18 October 1895 \u2013 6 June 1976) was a Lithuanian military officer. Apart from being one of the founders of the Aeroclub of Lithuania, Kalmantas had a significant role in commanding a contingent of Lithuanian soldiers during the Klaip\u0117da Revolt of 1923. His son, Vytautas Mykolas Kalmantas, was a famous fencer and athlete.\nBiography\nEarly life\nMykolas Kalmantas was born on 18 October 1895 in the village of M\u0117\u010dionys\u00a0, then belonging to the Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire, to Matas Kalmantavi\u010dius and Anel\u0117 Kalmantavi\u010dien\u0117 n\u00e9e Kuodyt\u0117. In 1912 Kalmantas graduated from the St. Petersburg Secondary Technical School.\nWorld War I\nIn 1915 Kalmantas attended the St. Petersburg gymnasium, later studying at the Moscow Institute of Archeology. Kalmantas's studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War as he was conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army in 1915. In 1916 he graduated from the Petergof 3rd Praporshchik War School, after which he received the rank of praporshchik, an NCO rank equivalent to sergeant major. Kalmantas served in the 124th\u00a0 and 293rd Reserve Regiments of the Russian Army. In 1917 he was sent to work at a commandant's office in the city of Torzhok, located in the Tver Governorate. For one year Kalmantas served as the commander of the commandant's company at the 128th Division. In 1917 he joined the Lithuanian Reserve Battalion, one of the first 20th-century Lithuanian military units.\nAfter the unit was disbanded, Kalmantas returned to Lithuania and for some time worked for the Vilija company's workshop office in Vilnius.\nMykolas Kalmantas in 1919\nIndependence Wars\nOn 3 July 1919 Kalmantas was mobilized into the Lithuanian Army and assigned to the Ukmerg\u0117 Infantry Battalion's 2nd Company as a junior officer. Later he was appointed the commander of the company's machine-gun squad. In November he was promoted to senior lieutenant. After the battalion was transformed into the 8th Infantry Regiment on 10 December, Kalmantas became the regiment's chief of the regimental communications team just five days later on 15 December. From 1919 to 1920 Kalmantas along with the battalion fought against various Bolshevik forces in the region of Zarasai, and against Polish forces near August\u00f3w and Vilnius. On 20 August 1920 he was made chief of the 6th, and later the Training, Company. As was the customary reward for people serving in the army during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, Kalmantas received land in the village of Ber\u017eai near Jonava.\nIn May 1922 Kalmantas was promoted to captain. On 13 October 1922 Kalmantas graduated from the Higher Officers' Courses.\nLeadership of the Klaip\u0117da Revolt in 1923. Mykolas Kalmantas is on the left\nKlaip\u0117da Revolt\nThe Lithuanian government and military intelligence sent Lithuanian activists to Lithuania Minor to propagate unification with Lithuania. The Supreme Committee for the Salvation of Lithuania Minor (SCSLM), chaired by Martynas Jankus, was established to unite all such \"local\" activist committees. After signing up as a volunteer for the march to Klaip\u0117da, the SCSLM was notified about Kalmantas being made the commander of the second group of rebels under the codename of Mikas Bajoras. From 9 to 22 January 1923, Kalmantas commanded his contingent in taking over the Pag\u0117giai city and district; Jonas Budrys, one of the most important military intelligence figures in the revolt, reported Kalmantavi\u010dius's activity as follows:\"<...> Mikas Kalmatavi\u010dius (Bajoras) was appointed the commander of the 2nd group with the task of occupying the Pag\u0117giai county and establishing himself in the Til\u017e\u0117 district, which he fulfilled at the appointed time.\" On 15 January, Kalmantas's contingent broke through the French lines at Klaip\u0117da, occupying the city. Kalmantas personally arrested the senior French governor of the region Gabriel Jean Petisn\u00e9 \u2013 it is said that after Petisn\u00e9 demanded Kalmantas show his papers, Kalmantas instead drew his revolver and arrested Petisn\u00e9. Jonas Budrys described that: \"Later, with two other companies, he was summoned near the city of Klaip\u0117da and after Captain Strielnikas captured the Althof manor, he  received the task of occupying the bar and taking the city. They pushed the entrenched enemy with a powerful blow and forced them to retreat. The operation was complicated by the fact that the left wing \u2013 the second company \u2013 stopped as its company commander was killed near the Rumpischen estate and began to retreat in confusion. Nevertheless, at the risk of death every minute, setting an example to his subjects, he went forward and captured a part of the city as far as the river Danga, capturing about 60 well-armed Frenchmen with officers and 10 machine guns.\"\nKalmantas's contingent also had the task of protecting the border with Germany. Kalmantas was later made the area's commandant. On January 16, Kalmantas was made the commander of the Klaip\u0117da Region's Volunteer Army's 1st Regime",

His parents were Hugh and Mary Hughes. His father was a carpenter, and he himself followed the same occupation till he was nineteen. When a lad of twelve he joined the Sunday-school which was then introduced into the neighbourhood, and made great progress. In 1810 he joined the Calvinistic Methodist church at Adwy, and three years later began preaching. On 13 September 1815 he opened a school at Cross Street, near Hope, Flintshire, but in August 1817 he went to school himself to learn Latin and Greek. After a time he opened a new school at Wrexham, and prepared many young men for the pulpit. He preached every Sunday. In February 1821 he was authorised as regular preacher to visit all parts of Wales, and in 1822 he preached before the Methodist Association. On 17 June 1829 he was ordained at Bala. In 1835, owing to bad health, he gave up his school, and became a flour merchant, in partnership with a brother. In 1838 he went to Liverpool, attained considerable eminence there as a preacher, and became co-pastor with Henry Rees of the Welsh Calvinistic churches of Liverpool. He died on a visit to Abergele 8 August 1860. He was twice married.\nHughes's chief work is his 'History of Welsh Calvinistic Methodism,' in three large volumes (Wrexham, vol. i. 1851, vol. ii. 1854, vol. iii. 1856). A volume containing twenty-two sermons, together with a memoir by the Rev. R. Edwards and the Rev. John Hughes of Everton, and a portrait, appeared in 1862. Other works (all in Welsh, and nearly all published at Wrexham without date) are:\n'Companion to Scripture.'\n'Mirror of Prophecy' (reviewed in 'Drysorfa,' March 1849).\n'The Scripture Test.'\n'Catechism of Scripture History' (reviewed in 'Drysorfa,' January 1850).\n'Protestantism in Germany,' London, 1847.\n'An Essay on the Sabbath,' 1859.\nHe also translated several works for the Religious Tract Society.\n",

According to her passport she was 5\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (1.57\u00a0m) with brown hair and brown eyes.:\u200aA26\u200a\nIn February 1931 she was picked up by the LAPD Red Squad as she left the CPUSA offices and \"was beaten so severely by the police officers that she was admitted to a local sanitarium\". She was reportedly hit over the head \"with an automobile crank\". According to the Chicago Daily Worker, \"A couple of weeks ago she spoke at a meeting of Trade Union Unity League metal workers, and, returning home alone, was suddenly attacked by one of the patriotic thugs of that city. The gangster leaped from an automobile, struck her down with a club, and, while she was lying in the street, kicked her in the mouth and knocked out all of her front teeth. She was in a hospital for ten days, but is now improved\". In 1938 she worked as a millinery worker in Los Angeles and lived with her brother, Abe Shafran, a furrier, and his wife on Cummings Street. All three were registered to vote Communist Party.\nA California state legislature investigation into Communism in California, published in 1945, put a spotlight on Shafran's biography:\n\"Eva Shafran merits particular notice in this report. For some time she was the active organizer of the Communist Party in Los Angeles County. She was registered as a Communist in Los Angeles County in June of 1940. She wrote for the Western Worker, West Coast Communist predecessor to the Communist publication, The People's Daily World. In October, 1936 , she wrote an article for the Western Worker entitled 'The Socialist Party and Trotskyites.' In December of 1936 she wrote an article for the Western Worker entitled 'Unity of Negro and White Urgent in Maritime Strike.' Eva Shafran is known among Communists as an outstanding Marxist. For many years she has taught advanced classes on Marxism-Leninism in the Communist Workers' School in Los Angeles. According to the testimony of John Leech, former Secretary of the Communist Party in Los Angeles County (before the Los Angeles Grand Jury, 94369-8-15-40) Eva Shafran was transferred to Los Angeles by the Communist Party from the New York Workers' School in 1935 or early in 1936. She was immediately assigned to the California State Committee of the Communist Party and has devoted herself to the task of raising the political level of Communists in Los Angeles. Her name is variably spelled Shafran, Shaffron, and Shiffman.\"\nCalifornia Communist Dorothy Ray Healey recalled in the 1970s, \"I became a part of what in the post-Browder period was derisively called the Gods' Committee. That was the Communists who were in the top leadership of the CIO, who had a group together; it was mainly a class, as a matter of fact, taught by a woman by the name of Eva Shafran who died in '45. Really a wonderful woman, the only woman I've ever known who could take a current question and relate it back to Marxist classics\".\nShafran was struck and killed by a streetcar in November 1944. At the time of her death her husband Don A. Burton was serving as a sergeant in the U.S. armed forces in China. Her friends organized a memorial in her honor.\n",
    "American dancer and actor\nGeri Miller (born April 27, 1942) is an American former go-go dancer and actress. She was a dancer at New York's Peppermint Lounge in the 1960s and appeared in sexploitation films before becoming part of pop artist Andy Warhol's Factory crowd. As a Warhol Superstar, she appeared in the films Flesh (1968), Trash (1970), and Women in Revolt (1971). She also starred in Warhol's play Pork (1971). A self-described \"super groupie,\" Miller was linked to various musicians, including Ringo Starr, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and James Brown.\nLife and career\nGeraldine Miller was born to Mr. and Mrs. Morris Miller in Clifton, New Jersey on April 27, 1942. She graduated from Clifton High School in 1960. While attending Berkeley College in New Jersey, she built a portfolio as a model and dancer before being recruited as a chorus line girl at the Peppermint Lounge nightclub in New York City. The Peppermint Lounge was a celebrity hot spot and as a go-go dancer, Miller met many musicians who partied at the nightclub.\nIn October 1962, Miller met singer James Brown at the Peppermint Lounge. He invited her to his show with The Famous Flames at the Apollo Theater in Harlem the night he recorded the live album Live at the Apollo (1963). Miller and Brown continued an on-and-off relationship for some years. Due to discrimination against interracial couples and because Brown criticized Black musicians who were involved with White women, they kept their affair hidden. Miller turned down Brown's marriage proposal because she was ashamed of her secret drug habit. \"I said no, even though I loved him. \u2026 I was taking uppers all the time because I needed to keep up with\u2026 life. I was sad to turn him down, but I didn't want him to find out,\" she said.\nIn February 1964, Miller had a brief affair with drummer Ringo Starr when The Beatles first toured America. By June 1965, she reportedly dated guitarist Lenny Davidson of The Dave Clark Five, drummer Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys, and Gordon Waller of Peter and Gordon, who surprised her with a painting.\nMiller made her first film appearance as a go-go dancer in Fail Safe (1964). She recorded the songs \"We All Warned You\" and \"Peppermint Jerk\" as the lead singer of The Peppermints, a trio of dancers. The single \"We All Warned You\" was released on RSVP Records in 1965 and received a 4-star rating from Billboard magazine.\nIn the mid-1960s, Miller dated Dino Danelli, drummer of the rock group The Young Rascals. They lived together for some time in her Manhattan apartment at 310 West 47th St. After his group found success, Miller found it hard to cope with his affairs. \"He was the first guy to break my heart. I was so sad. We split, and he moved out and into his own place,\" she recalled.\nMiller was fired from the Peppermint Lounge after Brown sent her a telegram to the nightclub. Afterward, Miller became a stripper at the Jazz club Metropole Cafe in New York. The change of environment was difficult for her and as a result, she took more uppers for confidence and became promiscuous. Feeling about her body, Miller later got a non-surgical breast augmentation through silicon injections.\nIn September 1966, Miller was a contestant for the 'Miss Night Beat' title aboard a gambling cruise. Miller discovered that journalist Earl Wilson was one of the judges so she went to his office and gave him a picture of herself in a \"daring outfit.\" Wilson wrote about their encounter in his syndicated column It Happened Last Night.\nIn the late 1960s and early 2970s, Miller appeared in several sexploitation films, including The Wall of Flesh (1968), Sex by Advertisement (1968), Meeting on 69th Street (1969), Monique, My Love (1969), and The Telephone Book (1971). She had small roles in the films The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart (1970) and Pound (1970).\nMiller appeared in the Warhol-produced films Flesh (1968), Trash (1970), and Women in Revolt (1971). She starred as Josie in Warhol's only play Pork, which was controversial due to the nudity and sexual acts simulated. The play had a two-week run at La MaMa Experimental Theatre in New York City in May 1971. The production was brought to the Roundhouse in London for a six-week run in August 1971. Miller caused a scandal in London when she was arrested for exposing her breasts during a photo session in front of Clarence House, the residence of the Queen Mother. She was released from jail after pleading guilty to insulting behavior.\nIn 1974, Miller stated that Warhol did not pay her enough for her film roles. Following their falling out, she withdrew from the public. In the book The Andy Warhol Diaries, Warhol mentioned in a diary entry on November 30, 1985, that Miller called him from a women's shelter and he referred to her as a \"young senile person.\" \"In her Trash days she was our most sensible superstar\u2014then in the seventies she suddenly got crazy. One day she was very down to earth, worrying about her topless dancing career, and then th",

    "Former lifeboat station in Anglesey, Wales\nPorth Ruffydd Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station located at Porth Ruffydd on Holy Island, west of the port of Holyhead, Isle of Anglesey, Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1891.\nAfter 14 service launches, but with no lives saved, the station was closed in 1904.\nHistory\nIn poor conditions on 17 December 1889, the Barque Tenby Castle ran aground on rocks at Penrhos Point, on the western side of Holy Island. The Volunteer Life Brigade was dispatched to travel 3 miles overland from Holyhead. The Holyhead lifeboat was launched, but needed to travel the 6 miles or more around the north of Holy Island. On arrival on scene, the brigade were unable to reach the vessel. John O Williams, Chief Officer of HM Coastguard, and Holyhead lifeboat Honorary Secretary, sent a man to also raise the Rhoscolyn lifeboat, 5 miles away.\nHowever, after several trips with the use of a small boat, the brigade managed to save 3 men. By the time the Holyhead lifeboat arrived, the vessel had sunk. They picked up one man, who later died. In all, 11 of the 14 crew of the Tenby Castle were lost. Five of the brigade received the RNLI Silver Medal for their brave efforts.\nAs a result, it was decided to open a lifeboat station at nearby Porth Ruffydd. A 34-foot 10-oared self-righting pulling and sailing (P&S) lifeboat (one with oars and sails), costing \u00a3436, was ordered from Watkins & Co., and a boathouse, costing a further \u00a31,320, was constructed at the head of the small cove. A special fund had been raised by a Mr and Mrs Norbury of Bowden, and this covered the entire cost. Such was the remote location of the station, the station was managed by Holyhead lifeboat station, as if the boat was required, many of the crew would be Holyhead men.\nAt a ceremony in Holyhead on 6 August 1891, Mrs Norbury named the lifeboat Norbury (ON 297).\nThe Porth Ruffydd lifeboat was first called on the 19 November 1893 to the SS Theresa, but it turned out she was not required. On 12 October 1894, the lifeboat was called to aid the Norwegian vessel Eugenie aground on Ramon Rocks, and after some assistance. she was refloated.\nWith few service calls, and now with a steam-powered lifeboat based at Holyhead, able to cover the distance far quicker than before,  it was decided to close the Porth Ruffydd Station in 1904. The Norbury (ON 297), the only lifeboat to serve at Porth Ruffydd, was broken up. The boathouse survived until 1997, when it was demolished.

He gained international recognition for his work as the action director of the Japanese jidaigeki action film Rurouni Kenshin (2012), and its sequels Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno, Rurouni Kenshin: The Legend Ends (both 2014), and Rurouni Kenshin: The Final (2021). Tanigaki's international action directing credits also include the Japanese comedy film Shinjuku Swan II, the Chinese crime film The Liquidator (both 2017), and the American superhero film Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins (2021).\nEarly life and education\nTanigaki was born on 13 October 1970 in Nara Prefecture, Japan. He had seizures at a young age and was physically weak, but since he enjoyed playing in the wild, Tanigaki recognized that it developed the physique that would benefit him in his future career as a stuntman. When he was in primary school, he watched Hong Kong action film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and Project A starring Jackie Chan and became fond of Chan's action stunts and Chinese kung fu. He joined a shorinji kempo coaching school and began martial arts training while in high school, winning in a prefectural tournament. He went on a graduation trip to Hong Kong in his third year of high school, and visited Chan's filmmaking company to witness the production of the action film Miracles, sparking his interest in joining the action film industry. He returned to Japan to continue his studies and later graduated from Kwansei Gakuin University with a Bachelor of Laws. Tanigaki joined a martial arts club formed by Hong Kong-based Japanese choreographer Yasuaki Kurata to learn karate while studying in university in 1989. He moved to Hong Kong alone to pursue a career in filmmaking in 1993, starting off as a cast extra and volunteered in police identity parades.\nCareer\nEarly ventures (1994-2001)\nTanigaki was initially rejected by most filmmaking companies when he first came to Hong Kong since he could not speak Cantonese.

However, due to lead actor Keanu Reeves' injury and the subsequent rescheduling of filming, both the action director and Tanigaki had to withdraw from the project before Yuen Woo-ping substituted. In 1998, Yen advised Tanigaki to return to Japan and pursue a parallel career in both Hong Kong and Japanese cinema due to limited opportunities for foreigners in Hong Kong. Tanigaki followed the advice, and later coordinated the Hong Kong-Japanese co-produced romance film Moonlight Express and action film Tokyo Raiders. In 1999, RTL Televi",
    "Tablet for National Cultural Relics Protection Unit\nMentsikhang (\u95e8\u5b5c\u5eb7, Tibetan: \u0f66\u0fa8\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f62\u0fa9\u0f72\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f44\u0f0b, Wylie transcription: sman rtsis khang, THL: men tsi khang), translated as Tibetan Medical Calendar College or Medical Astrological College, was a hospital and medical school. It was located in Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region. In 1959, Mentsikhang merged with the former Chagpori to form the Lhasa Tibetan Medicine Hospital, which was transformed into the Tibetan Hospital of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1980.\nHistory\nIn Tibetan, \"men\" means \"medical\", \"tsi\" refers to \"calendar\", thus \"mentsikhang\" means \"medical calendar hospital\". In Tibetan medicine theory, human body condition is influenced by astronomical changes, and the growth and efficacy of Tibetan medicinal plants is influenced by seasonal changes, so traditional Tibetan medicine is heavily connected to the Tibetan calendar.\nWith approval of the 13th Lama, in 1916, Tekhang Jampa Thubwang established the Mentsikhang. Thubwang designated his close disciple Khyenrab Norbu as director but took sole responsibility for its administration and overall development. Mentsikhang was an outcome of the 13th Lama's attempt to shift power away from big monasteries to the Kashag. The building has an east\u2013west layout, the door facing south, two story high, 66 meters long (now 60 meters), 18 meters wide. It has an outpatient department and a Tibetan medicine research and teaching center. The east and west ends of the second story are living spaces of the director and vice director. Director Khyenrab Norbu lived in the west end, the vice director lived in the east end, and the middle rooms are the research and teaching departments. The two ends of the lower floor are for other doctors' living spaces, the center for a spacious teaching room. The hospital had a total of five professors, including two for Tibetan medicine, two for astronomy and calendar, one for ophthalmology. The army, monasteries, and aristocratic families had to send quotas of students to Mentsikhang, and trained amchi were sent back to needy communities and monasteries after completing their training. Anthropologist Martin Saxer wrote that \"probably for the first time in Tibetan history, a state-sponsored public healthcare system started to sprout\".\nKhyenrab Norbu became a monk in Tsedang Atsurin at an early age. Later, because of his outstanding talent, he was sent by the old lama of the monastery to study Tibetan medicine at Chagpori. He started his medical studies under Sera physician Ngawang Choeden and later sought education on medicine, astrology, and other fields of Tibetan studies from physicians and scholars like Tekhang Jampa Thubwang, Dorjee Gyaltsen, Jampal Rolpai Lodoe, Lama Ugyen Tenzim of Sikkim, Lama Tenzin Gyaltsen of Kinnaur, Chikchar Dungzin Rinpoche of Tsari, and others. Khyenrab Norbu mainly studied medicine and calendars, and also learned other cultural knowledge. In 1912, Norbu became a doctor in Drepung Monastery. Later, he became the first director of Mentsikhang. Thereafter, he recruited many young students from monasteries, soldiers, and farmers and herdsmen throughout Tibet for training, and successively trained more than a thousand students, contributing greatly to the development of Tibetan medicine.\nIn 1959, Mentsikhang merged with the former Chagpori to form the Lhasa Tibetan Medicine Hospital, which was transformed into the Tibetan Hospital of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1980. In terms of hardware, the government had allocated 230,000 yuan to remodel a number of tin houses and move the outpatient clinic to the front of the old Mentsikhang building for the convenience of the public. In 1976, the government further allocated 1.21 million yuan to construct a new outpatient clinic building.\nGallery\nEntrance\nFoyer\nInner courtyard\nInner courtyard\n",
    "In the Rhythms of Tuqay (Tatar: \u0422\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0439 \u0430\u04bb\u04d9\u04a3\u043d\u04d9\u0440\u0435 Tuq\u00e1y ah\u00e4\u00f1n\u00e4r\u00e9, Russian: \u0412 \u0440\u0438\u0301\u0442\u043c\u0430\u0445 \u0422\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0301\u044f) is a vocal-symphonic poem based on the poems of \u011eabdulla Tuqay, consisting of seven songs for voice and chamber orchestra, which Almaz Monasypov composed in 1975.\nOrigin\nThe texts are by \u011eabdulla Tuqay (1886\u20131913). He was one of the most famous representatives of the Tatar Renaissance of the early 20th century. Almaz Monassypov took the seven poems from different years. The work was completed in 1975 on the poet's 90th birthday. The first edition of the poem, arranged for baritone and piano, was published in 1976 by the Tatar Book Publishing House. The work was premiered in 1976 by baritone Emil C\u04d3l\u04d3letdinov with the TASSR Chamber Orchestra under the composer's direction.\nContents\nThe composer's interest in jazz is partly due to his collaboration with the Oleg Lundstrem Orchestra. Vocal-symphonic poetry is based, on the one hand, on features of Tatar and, to a greater extent, general Turkish music characteristic of the pre-revolutionary period. On the other hand, the work reflects the techniques of jazz, neoclassicism and even pop music. The work uses the Tatar folk melodies T\u00e4ftil\u00e4w and A Few Horses. The 5/8 and 7/8 time signatures that are widespread in the poem, i.e. H. the metric features are characteristics, as in the folk songs Munadjat and Bajet.\nThere are two editions of the poem. The first edition was intended for the baritone Emil C\u04d3l\u04d3letdinov, the second edition was published in 1993 for the tenor Idris Gasiew. The second edition uses the following instrumentation:\nTenor with microphone;\nTwo electric guitars;\norgan or electronic organ;\npiano with microphone;\npercussion with microphone;\nDoira;\nString orchestra.\nMusic\nIntroduction\nThe poem begins with an introduction to the theme of the folk song \"A Few Horses\" in the text by Tukaj. This theme, combined with Tukaj's arrival in Kazan, \"the city of his destiny\", becomes the leitmotif of the main character's fate. The introductory music is a gradually developing folk song melody accompanied by a growing rhythmic ostinato. The ostinato rhythm imitates the sounds of a running horse's hooves. Without using words, \"A Few Horses\" is in a way Tukaj's eighth poem in this poetry.\nFor the Homeland\nThe richly ornamented melody in a narrow vocal range is similar to Tatar book songs (a genre of Tatar folklore). The singing is accompanied by pentachords in the orchestra. Of the nine stanzas of Tukaj's poem, only six are used and form the three verses of the part.\nTry to Reach People's Hearts\nIn the second part of the poem, the poem \"The Unnamed\" by G. Tukaj is used in its entirety. Most of the techniques used in this song, including the diatonic fifth fall sequence, correspond to the style of 1970s Soviet popular music. The episodes in which the organ sounds solo between verses are reminiscent of oriental music.\nThe Home Village\nIn the third part, only three of the four stanzas of \u011eabdulla Tuqay's poem are used. The second verse, which mentions the Quran and the Prophet Mohammad, was deleted. The melody, which is reminiscent of a Munadjat chant with a time signature of 5/8, is accompanied by organ chords.\nRepentance\nThe part completely uses the poem of the same name by \u011eabdulla Tuqay, which is a response to Alexander Pushkin's poem \"The Tenth Commandment\". This poem is written in the genre of oriental poetry Nazire, as a retelling by the author of another author's poem. Small seconds and rhythmic features used in the passage are reminiscent of classical oriental music. In the introduction, Sornay's shrill sound is imitated with an abundance of small seconds. This duet between sornay and doira brings the song closer to the light music of the East (e.g., although the Nay is a wind instrument associated with Sufi ideas, it is more commonly used in the serious music of the East).\nBroken hope\nIn the introduction to the part, the leitmotif \"A few horses\" sounds. The song is based on one of \u011eabdulla Tuqay's most famous poems - \"Broken Hope\", sung to the folk melody \"T\u00e4ftil\u00e4w\". The richness of the song lies in the fact that sections of singing and recitation alternate. This part is the lyrical center of the vocal-symphonic poem.\nIn bars 48\u201364 in the orchestral section there is a quote from the Tatar folk melody \"T\u00e4ftil\u00e4w\". In order to make the counterpoint of the soloist's melody and the quotation sound more distinctive, the composer combines them in different time signatures. In other passages the folk song is used in modifications.\nIn bars 43\u201346 of the song, the first half of the leitmotif \"A Few Horses\" appears in the singer's part.\nI Did Not Know\nThe sixth part is written on the poem \"Voice from the Murid Cemetery\" by \u011eabdulla Tuqay, which was created under the influence of Ayaz \u0130shaki's novel \"Disappearance in 200 Years\". One of the main ideas of this poem by G. Tukay is criticism of Sufism, but not rejection. Almaz Monasypov was forced to use a version of the poem approved by t",

    "Genus of lichens\nMangoldia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the subfamily Graphidoideae of the family Graphidaceae. It contains four species of corticolous (bark-dwelling) script lichens.\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was circumscribed in 2012 by the lichenologists Robert L\u00fccking, Sittiporn Parnmen, and H. Thorsten Lumbsch. It was made to hold two Australian species that have Phaeographis-like ascomata (fruiting bodies) but Graphis-like ascospores. The genus name honours Armin Mangold, \"for his outstanding contribution to the knowledge of thelotremoid Graphidaceae in Australia\".\nMangoldia is in the tribe Graphideae, subfamily Graphidoideae of the family Graphidaceae. Mangoldia has a sister taxon relationship with genus Allographa.\nDescription\nThe thallus of the Mangoldia species is corticolous, meaning it primarily grows on the bark of trees. It is continuous and partly endoperidermal, indicating that part of the thallus grows beneath the outer bark layer. The surface of the thallus is uneven and white. When observed in cross-section, it features a very thin, corticiform (bark-like) layer and an irregular layer containing algal cells that are essential for photosynthesis.\nApothecia (fruiting bodies) emerge from the thallus and are angular to lirelliform (slit-shaped). The disc of the apothecia is exposed and ranges in colour from blackish brown to black, without any powdery or waxy covering (epruinose). The thalline margin around the disc is thin, white, and may be fissured to lobulated. The proper margin, which is distinct from the thalline margin, is thin, stands out prominently, and is black. In a cross-section, this margin appears very thin and consists of densely packed fungal cells (prosoplectenchymatous), which are pale yellowish to brownish on the outer parts. There are no periphysoids (hair-like structures) present.\nThe hymenium (the spore-bearing layer) does not contain interspersed particles, and the paraphyses (sterile filaments within the hymenium) are unbranched. The ascospores, which are spores produced within the asci (spore-producing cells), number 4 to 8 per ascus. They are muriform (divided by both transverse and longitudinal septa), ellipsoid in shape, and have thickened septa that stain violet-blue with iodine, with rounded internal spaces (lumina) and are colourless. No chemical substances were detected in this genus when tested with thin-layer chromatography, suggesting a lack of distinctive secondary metabolites typically used for identifying and classifying lichens.\nSpecies\nMangoldia has four species:\nMangoldia australiana L\u00fccking, Parnmen & Lumbsch (2012) \u2013 Australia\nMangoldia bylii (Vain.) I.Medeiros (2022) \u2013 Australia; South Africa\nMangoldia lecideicarpa (Zahlbr.) L\u00fccking, M.C\u00e1ceres & Aptroot (2024) \u2013 Brazil\nMangoldia thallolomoides Aptroot, L\u00fccking & M.C\u00e1ceres (2024) \u2013 Brazil\nMangoldia atronitens (A.W.Archer) L\u00fccking, Parnmen & Lumbsch (2012), one of the original Australian species originally included in the genus, was shown to differ from Mangoldia bylii by only minute differences in spore size, and so Ian Medeiros and Fran\u00e7ois Lutzoni treated them to be synonymous in a 2022 publication, further noting that \"previously unrecognized presence of this genus in South Africa highlights biogeographical connections between southern Africa and Australasia\".\n",
    "American mathematician\nJane C. Purcell Coffee (1944\u20132022) was an American mathematician, one of the first women to earn a doctorate in mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania, and the founder of the Teacher Education Honors Academy at the College of Staten Island.\nEarly life and education\nCoffee was the daughter of James Purcell, a civil engineer and Democratic Party politician, who died when she was young. She was born in Meriden, Connecticut in 1944, and became the valedictorian of O.H. Platt High School in Meriden. She attended Smith College on a scholarship, where mathematics professor Neal McCoy became a faculty mentor. There, she met her future husband, legal scholar John C. Coffee Jr., a student at Amherst College. She graduated from Smith in 1966.\nNext, she went to the University of Pennsylvania for graduate study in mathematics, while John Coffee studied law at Yale University. She persisted as \"one of the first women in her PhD program\" despite facing discriminatory practices such as segregating her with the mathematicians' wives at regular gatherings where the male mathematicians in the department would discuss their research. She completed her Ph.D. in 1970, with a thesis on abstract algebra, A Condition for a Filtered Ring to be Isomorphic to its Associated Graded Ring, supervised by Murray Gerstenhaber.\nCareer and later life\nIn order to avoid hiring discrimination, Coffee applied to faculty positions using only her first initial, \"J.\". This led to a job offer at Richmond College, which later became the College of Staten Island, and she began working there in 1970.\nDuring this time, she lived with her husband in Maplewood, New Jersey, commuting to their jobs in Staten Island and in New York City, respectively. Their daughter, Megan Coffee (now a medical researcher at Columbia University) was born in 1976. In the late 1970s, Coffee took a new faculty position, at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, at about the same time as her husband became a professor at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. As child care, she sat her daughter at the back of her classroom at the academy.\nAfter this, Coffee returned to the College of Staten Island, as chair of mathematics, and her husband moved to Columbia University. An incident from this time spurred her creation of the college's Teacher Education Honors Academy: she met a woman on a train who freely confessed her innumeracy, only to discover later that the same woman was a teacher at her daughter's elementary school. The academy aimed at improving that situation by preparing college students for a career as a secondary school STEM educator.\nShe died on September 23, 2022.\n",
    "Public school in Owego, New York, United States\nOwego Free Academy is a public high school located in Owego, New York. The school serves students in ninth through twelfth grades and is part of the Owego Apalachin Central School District.\nHistory\nOwego Free Academy traces its founding to 1827, when the Owego Academy was built on a tract of land donated for that purpose by James McMaster, who was the first white settler of Owego. The original school building, which is located on Court Street, consisted of three stories and featured a steeple that housed a bell. In 1851, the academy's capacity was increased with the construction of a three-story addition in the rear of the building; however, within several years, the building's interior was gutted and the third story was removed. When the academy opened to students in April 1828, the academic year was divided into two terms consisting of two twelve-week quarters. Tuition ranged from two dollars to four dollars per quarter depending on the course of study.\nIn 1864, the Owego Academy was merged into the union free schools of Owego by an act of the New York Legislature, and the school was accordingly renamed Owego Free Academy.\nBy the 1880s, the original Academy building on Court Street was no longer suitable for the school's needs. A new building was constructed on the corner of Main and Academy Streets in 1883 at a cost of $25,000. The 1883 building was later demolished, and a larger building was constructed on the same site in the 1920s. As of 2024, this building is still in use as the Tioga County Office Building.\nA new, single-story building was constructed on the north side of the village in 1958 This building later housed Owego-Apalachin Middle School from 1972 until 2005. The current Owego Free Academy was opened in 1972 and is located near the north side of the village limits. It is situated on a large campus that includes several athletic fields, as well as Owego Elementary School, Owego-Apalachin Middle School, and the Owego-Apalachin Central School District main offices. In 2005, Owego-Apalachin Middle School was opened; this building is connected to Owego Free Academy, and the schools share a music wing and a large theater.\nEducation\nStudents at Owego Free Academy can earn a local diploma, as well as a Regents diploma or Regents diploma with advanced designation by passing a requisite number of Regents examinations. College credits can be earned several ways, including successful completion of Advanced Placement courses, as well as courses offered in conjunction with Tompkins Cortland Community College (TC3). Students who successfully complete a requisite number of dual-credit courses offered through TC3 can graduate from Owego Free Academy with an associate degree.\nOwego Free Academy has received national recognition for its music department, and is a six-time recipient of the Best Communities for Music Education designation from the National Association of Music Merchants.\nAthletics\nOwego Free Academy's athletics teams compete in Section IV of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association, and the school is also a member of the Southern Tier Athletic Conference.\nFor much of the school's history, its athletics teams were known as the Indians. In 2023, the New York State Board of Regents issued an order mandating the retirement of Native American mascots for all New York public schools by 2025. Owego Free Academy's mascot was accordingly changed to the River Hawk in September 2023.\nAs of 2024, Owego Free Academy teams have won NYSPHSAA championships in the following sports:\nBoys' Baseball \u2013 1997\nBoys' Soccer \u2013 2002\nGirls' Volleyball \u2013 2013, 2015, 2017\nNotable Alumni\nWashington Gladden (1854), Congregational pastor\nDoug Hurley (1984), NASA astronaut\nThomas C.

    "Chinese bubble tea brand\nChaPanda\nChaPanda (SEHK:\u00a02555, Chinese: \u8336\u767e\u9053; pinyin: Ch\u00e1 B\u01ceid\u00e0o), also known as Chabaidao, in Chinese, is a tea beverage brand in the People's Republic of China. ChaPanda is China's third-largest retailer of freshly made tea drinks and has a 6.8% market share, up from 6.6% in 2022. It operates mainly through franchises and has established a network of more than 8,000 stores since opening its first one in Chengdu, Sichuan, in 2008.\nAccording to Frost & Sullivan's report, ChaPanda ranked third in the Chinese new-style tea store market in terms of 2023 retail sales, with a market share of 6.8%.  In 2023, Chabaidao achieved RMB 16.9 billion in total retail sales, selling 1.016 billion cups of tea drinks, making it the second-largest new tea drink stock.\nHistory\nFounded as a small shop near a school in 2008 in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, by Wang Xiaokun, ChaPanda opened its first store and managed to grow under Chengdu ChaPanda Catering Management Co., Ltd., which was established on February 21, 2017.\nIn 2018, ChaPanda decided to revamp its image by introducing a cute and clumsy blue panda mascot named Ding Ding Cat, which incorporated Chinese elements. This move significantly boosted brand recognition, reaching approximately 800 stores by the end of the year. By the end of 2020, the number of ChaPanda stores had surpassed 3,000.\nDuring the pandemic, ChaPanda experienced a surge in growth, defying the overall market trend. In just nine months, the number of stores exceeded 3,000, making it a rising star in the tea beverage industry and earning it the nickname \"King of Delivery\".\nAccording to the \"National Meituan Takeout Sales\" ranking released in June 2021, ChaPanda ranked third with a total of 10.563 million orders for the month, trailing only Wallace and Mixue Ice Cream & Tea. However, ChaPanda's average sales per store exceeded 3,000 orders, significantly surpassing other brands.\nEarlier reports from Shanghai Securities Journal and other media outlets indicated that ChaPanda was planning an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong with a target of raising approximately $500 million. ChaPanda successfully completed its IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 15, 2023, and was successfully listed on April 23, 2024.\nOperating income has increased from 3.644 billion yuan in 2021 to 5.704 billion yuan by the end of 2023. Based on ChaPanda's pre-IPO valuation of 17.5 billion yuan, the net worth of Wang Xiaokun and his wife exceeds 14 billion yuan.\nIn April 2024, ChaPanda enters the Korean market.\nControversies\nHowever, in 2021, the company faced allegations of using expired raw materials. \nIn May, ChaPanda (Changsha Shiji Jinyuan Store) was exposed for allegedly using expired ingredients during a surprise inspection by the Market Supervision Bureau. Law enforcement officials found that the labels on raw materials named \"cake\" and \"raw coconut milk\" in the freezer had expired. On May 28, in response to this incident, ChaPanda issued a statement on its official Weibo account, stating that, upon learning of the matter, the company immediately organized a special investigation team to look into the store. The results are as follows: After investigation, the \"cake\" and \"raw coconut milk\" in question during the random inspection were not expired raw materials. Both raw materials were prepared on-site at the store, and due to staff negligence, the expiration date labels were not replaced in time after preparation, resulting in the expiration date labels showing as expired during the inspection.\nA blogger conducted undercover visits to four ChaPanda stores in different cities and discovered that all of them were using expired ingredients with replaced labels. The store employees claimed this was done to avoid detection by regulatory authorities. The topic \"ChaPanda uses expired raw materials\" became a trending topic on September 30, sparking widespread concern.\nOn 6 October, a female customer in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, reported finding a spider in the milk cap of a beverage ordered from a ChaPanda store in Cixi. The customer stated she had already reported the incident to relevant authorities. ChaPanda staff responded that no spiders were found during preparation, and the customer reported the issue hours after receiving the drink. The store is negotiating 600 yuan in compensation with the customer. The incident quickly became the top-trending topic on Weibo.\nIn the aftermath of Fat Cat's suicide, when people ordered fast food deliveries to commemorate him, multiple restaurants delivered empty packages, including ChaPanda. Upon realizing the issue, ChaPanda issued an apology. Additionally, both ChaPanda and Wallace announced the dismissal of the employees involved in the incident. ChaPanda also made a 1 million RMB donation to the Sichuan Youth Development Foundation in Fat Cat's name.\n",
    "American suffragist (1871\u20131952)\nGrace Allen Johnson (commonly referred to as Grace A. Johnson; n\u00e9e Fitch; September 9, 1871 \u2013 January 17, 1952) was an American suffragist, educator, and peace activist known for her leadership in the women's suffrage movement in Massachusetts. Initially holding traditional views on women's roles, she became actively involved in suffrage after attending a meeting in Cambridge, England, in 1907. Johnson was the founder and president of the Cambridge Political Equality Association (CPEA), rallying public support for women's suffrage. She later focused on international peace activism and played a key role in introducing proportional representation in Cambridge in 1940.\nBiography\nA suffragist poster from 1920 in Cambridge, MA.\nEarly life and education\nGrace Allen Fitch was born on September 9, 1871, in Maples, Indiana, to Appleton Howe Fitch and Elizabeth Harriet Bennett. She spent her childhood in Kalamazoo, Michigan, before her family relocated to Hopkinton, Massachusetts. Johnson graduated from Hopkinton High School in 1890 and went on to attend the Pratt Institute Library School in Brooklyn, New York, graduating in 1891.\nMarriage and family\nIn 1893, Grace Allen Johnson married Lewis Jerome Johnson, a civil engineer. The couple settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Lewis became a professor at Harvard University. They had two sons, Jerome and Chandler.\nEntry into suffrage movement\nUntil adulthood, Grace A. Johnson held the traditional view that women belonged at home, despite her husband's support for suffrage. However, this perspective shifted after she attended a pro-suffrage meeting in Cambridge, England in 1907. Upon her return to Massachusetts, she became actively involved in the suffrage movement,  becoming the president of the Cambridge Political Equality Association (CPEA) of MA in 1910, which she founded in 1896.\nSuffrage activism\nJohnson served as president of the CPEA for six years, during which she focused her efforts on rallying public support for women's suffrage in Massachusetts. She advocated for the adoption of a state constitutional amendment to enfranchise women and played a key role in organizing suffrage rallies, canvassing voters, and writing pro-suffrage articles.\nPolitical engagement\nIn addition to her suffrage work, Johnson was politically active in other areas. She supported the Progressive Party and favored the \"single tax\" on land value popularized by Henry George. In 1912, she served as a delegate and organizer to the Progressive Party National Convention in Chicago.\nWorld War I and post-war activism\nDuring World War I, Johnson initially opposed American entry into the conflict, but eventually supported the war effort after the United States declared war in 1917. She contributed to the war by advocating for women's suffrage and promoting other progressive causes. Following the war, Johnson continued her activism by working towards international peace.\nPeace activism and education\nJohnson supported the League of Nations and served as executive secretary of the Massachusetts Woodrow Wilson Foundation. She traveled to Geneva in 1926 to observe the League of Nations in action and dedicated herself to educating the public about international affairs and peace initiatives. In addition to her activism, Johnson had a distinguished career in education, teaching International Affairs and Parliamentary Procedures at the Garland School for Homemaking in Boston.\nLater life and legacy\nIn her later years, Johnson remained committed to activism and education. She continued her advocacy for international peace and taught subjects such as International Affairs and Parliamentary Procedures until 1940. Johnson also played a role in local governance, advocating for proportional representation in Cambridge. She died on January 17, 1952, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n",

It was the second season of operation under the auspices of the Scottish Professional Football League.\nGlasgow City were the defending champions, after winning their 14th title in 16 seasons  on a dramatic last matchday of 2022\u201323 to stay ahead of Celtic and Rangers, both of whom could have finished as champions depending on the results. The newcomers to SWPL 1 were Montrose, restoring a representation for the Angus region in the top tier after long-time members Forfar Farmington resigned from the league in 2021. New participants in SWPL 2 were Glasgow Women (relegated from SWPL 1) and Livingston (winners of the 2022\u201323 SWF Championship). Teams finishing second-bottom in both divisions survived play-offs, Hamilton Academical beating Gartcairn to stay in SWPL 1, and Stirling University keeping their SWPL 2 place with a win over Rossvale.\nA 12-club \"split\" format was used in SWPL 1 in 2023\u201324, with a double round-robin before the \"split\", then another double round-robin of the top six and bottom six clubs respectively. The SWPL previously used a \"split\" format between the 2012 and 2015 seasons. In SWPL 2, the eight clubs simply played each other four times. The top club in SWPL 2 won automatic promotion, the 12th-placed club in SWPL 1 was relegated, and promotion/relegation play-offs took place between the clubs finishing 11th in SWPL 1 and 2nd in SWPL 2, and between the clubs finishing 7th in SWPL 2 and 2nd in the 2023\u201324 SWF Championship. The league season began on 13 August 2023 and ended on 19 May 2024 for both divisions.\nThe championship was again settled on the final matchday, which Celtic and Rangers started on the same points after pulling ahead of Glasgow City; Celtic's superior goal difference meant they led the table and only had to match Rangers' result to win the title. However, while Rangers quickly took and kept a lead against Partick Thistle, Celtic struggled to break down the Hibernian defence. In the 90th minute, Amy Gallacher scored the only goal of the match at Celtic Park to give her side their first league championship in the women's game. Celtic's men's team had also won the 2023\u201324 Scottish Premiership, and this was the first instance of a club holding both national championships at the same time.\nAt the bottom of the SWPL 1 table, Hamilton were relegated with Queen's Park coming up to replace them; Dundee United survived by defeating Kilmarnock in the play-off. In the lower tier it was also the previous season's play-off survivors who went down this time, Stirling University swapping divisions with Rossvale, the team they overcame a year earlier. Ayr United won the SWPL 2 / Championship play-off with Glasgow Women to move up and condemn their opponents to a second successive relegation.\nTeams\nSWPL 1\nSWPL 2\nAberdeenAirdrieDundee UnitedEdinburghLivingstonGlasgowHamiltonKilmarnockMontroseMotherwellRangersSt\u00a0JohnstoneStirling UniversityGlasgow teams:Glasgow CityPartick ThistleQueen's ParkAirdrie teams:CelticGartcairnEdinburgh teams:Boroughmuir ThistleHeart of MidlothianHibernianSpartansclass=notpageimage| Locations of teams in the SWPL\nSWPL 1\nFootball league season\nRegular season\nSource: Rules for classification: 1) Points; 2) Goal difference; 3) Number of goals scored\nTop six\nUpdated to match(es) played on 19 May 2024.

    "Musical artistCongolese musician (1952\u20132020)\nJean-Marie Belobi Ng\u2019ekerme (December 22, 1952 \u2013 27 August 2020), known professionally as Meridjo Belobi, was a Congolese drummer and songwriter. Known for being a long-time drummer for Za\u00efko Langa Langa, he is credited as the creator of the Cavacha drum pattern, which gained international recognition and is considered as a major contribution to African music.\nEarly years and musical debut\nJean Marie Belobi Ng\u2019ekerme was born on December 22, 1952, in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nHe spent his childhood in the Kauka district of the Kalamu commune. His father, a mechanic from Idiofa who worked at ONATRA, influenced his early life notably by sending him to the Institut des Techniques Appliqu\u00e9es (ISTA) to replace him in case of retirement, but eventually left his studies to pursue a career in music. During his youth, he became involved in Xav\u00e9rie, a cultural and educational movement guided by Catholic priests, where he participated in various cultural events and played percussion.\nHe had a brief stint at the B.C. Onatra basketball team at a young age.\nIn 1971, Belobi joined the youth band Za\u00efko Langa Langa which rehearsed at the Hotel Azur, not far from his home. Initially a percussionist, he transitioned to the role of drummer after Bimi Ombale switched from drumming to singing. His stage name, Meridjo, was coined by fellow musician Papa Wemba, who reversed the syllables of \"John Mary,\" a nickname Belobi was known by in his neighborhood.\nInnovation and musical career\nCavacha original drum pattern Play\u24d8 or Play variant\u24d8.\nIn 1973, during a trip from Brazzaville to Pointe-Noire, Belobi innovatively created the Cavacha drum pattern. Inspired by the rhythm of the train's wheels, he developed this pattern on the snare or hi-hats. The Cavacha beat quickly became influential in Africa and later spread internationally, being incorporated into various musical genres. This innovation earned him the nickname \"Masini Ya Kauka\" (the Engine of Kauka in Lingala).\nHe faced a significant personal challenge in 1974 when he was imprisoned for 21 months at Ekafela prison for violating a curfew imposed on young Zairians. After his release, he recorded \"Sangela,\" his first single with Za\u00efko Langa Langa, and continued to contribute to the band's success.\nThroughout the 1980s, Belobi played a crucial role in Za\u00efko Langa Langa. He was part of the group's administrative team alongside Jossart N'Yoka Longo and other prominent members. In 1985, he and fellow drummer Bakunde Ilo Pablo pioneered the concept of double-drumming in Congolese rumba. Belobi's talents took him on international tours with Za\u00efko, including a notable tour of Japan in 1986, prestigious halls in Europe and America as well as many sold-out stadiums in Africa.\nDespite internal conflicts within Za\u00efko Langa Langa in 1988, which led to the formation of Za\u00efko Langa Langa Familia Dei, Belobi remained with the original band. During his tenure, he released several successful songs, including \"Bisengo Na Bango,\" \"Mosafi,\" \"Bolingo Aveugle,\" \"Matondo,\" \"Nyongo Ekeseni,\" \"Ize Bola,\" \"Ben Betito,\" and \"Mofiti.\"\nAfter leaving Za\u00efko Langa Langa in 1999 due to administrative tensions, Belobi co-founded Za\u00efko Langa Langa Universel with Oncle Bapius and Modeste Modikilo. The group released one album, \"Etumba Ya La Vie,\" featuring the eponymous title track composed by Belobi.\nDeath\nHe died on August 27, 2020 (aged 67), at the Li\u00e8ge University Hospital in Belgium after a prolonged illness. He was interred at the Nsele Necropolis in Kinshasa on October 15, 2020. In recognition of his contributions to music and culture, he was posthumously awarded the Order of Civic and Artistic Merit.\nLegacy\nMeridjo Belobi's influence extended beyond his performances. He inspired many prominent Congolese drummers, including Ramatoulaye Ngolali of Extra Musica and Papy Kakol of Wenge Musica Maison M\u00e8re. His creation of the Cavacha drum pattern remains a significant contribution to the world of music.\nReferences list\n^ \"Digitalcongo.net | Za\u00efko\u00a0: d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en Belgique, Meridjo d\u00e9cor\u00e9 \u00e0 titre posthume \u00e0 Kinshasa\". www.digitalcongo.net.

    "Football club\nBremer TS Neustadt (officially known as Bremer Turn- und Sportgemeinde Neustadt von 1859 eV) is a sports club located in Bremen, in the Bremen-Neustadt district. The club was formed on January 1, 1972, as a result of the merger between Bremer TG and TuS Bremen-Neustadt. With twelve departments catering to various sports and music activities, Neustadt offers its members a wide range of options to pursue their interests.\nDepartments\nNeustadt encompasses twelve departments, including badminton, basketball, football, handball, karate, athletics, gymnastics, marching band, folklore, table tennis, gymnastics, and volleyball. The football and volleyball departments have been particularly successful in terms of the number of teams and the level of leagues.\nHistory\nMen's Football\nThe men's football team initially competed in the regional league but was subsequently relegated to the district league in 1973. After a brief stint in the association league from 1975 to 1978, they secured two consecutive promotions and gained entry into the Bremen upper house for the first time in 1980. However, the team experienced back-to-back relegations, which led them back to the district league. In 1987, they earned promotion once again and returned to the Bremen upper house, which had been renamed the Association League. In 1991, the team qualified for the newly established Oberliga Niedersachsen/Bremen after two years of battling relegation. This promotion came about due to the withdrawal of higher-placed clubs, OT Bremen and TSV Lesum.\nAlthough narrowly missing out on relegation, the team eventually returned to the top league after four years and made their mark. However, they were unable to maintain their position and were subsequently relegated again. Neustadt men's team competed in the Bremen Association League until 2004. Since their relegation in 2008, they have been playing in the Bremen district league. In the 2011/12 season, Neustadt achieved the district league championship, earning promotion to the Bremen regional league, which is at the sixth-tier level. Three years later, they were promoted to the Bremen League, marking their return to the top-tier Bremen league.\nWomen's Football\nNeustadt women's football team experienced their first successes in the early 1980s. They clinched the Bremen championship title in 1983 and 1984 but were eliminated in the first round at the national level. During the same period, the team qualified for the DFB Pokal on four occasions but faced early exits. In the 1983/84 season, they suffered a 1\u201316 defeat against KBC Duisburg. After a prolonged period of relative insignificance, the team made a comeback to the DFB Pokal in 2006, only to face a 0\u201316 loss to VfL Wolfsburg in the first round. Notably, the club produced Christine Frai, a former FIFA referee.\nLiterature\nHardy Greens: Northern Germany \u2013 Between TSV Achim, Hamburger SV, and TuS Zeven. In: Legendary Football Clubs.

    "1982  film\nThe Rooks (Russian: \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0438, romanized:\u00a0Grachi) is a Soviet crime drama film directed by Konstantin Yershov, filmed in 1982 in the USSR. Based on real events.\nPlot\nThe Grachi Brothers are a family gang that specializes in robbery.\nAfter another criminal episode, as a result of which the driver of the car was killed, as well as a traffic police inspector, the police managed to detain the gang members. The younger brother, Alexander Grach, was involved in criminal activities under the pressure of the authority and personality of his middle brother Viktor. The brothers' son-in-law, Leonid Osadchiy, also participated in the plot to kill the Zhiguli driver Usov. Victor was sitting in the car to the right of the driver Usov, Leonid Osadchiy was sitting behind the driver, and Alexander was next to him. After the murder, the Rook family decides to move to Krasnodar. However, the police are on their trail, and Viktor has already noticed the surveillance, after which they decide to temporarily \u201cscatter\u201d with Osadchiy. Viktor and Alexander run together, but are soon blocked in the restaurant. Alexander is detained on the street while he was waiting for his brother, and Victor, noticing this, tries to sneak out through the service room, but they manage to block all the exits there  and Viktor is quickly caught. When trying to detain Rrach's accomplice Leonid Osadchiy, he shoots back and tries to escape along the roofs of houses, but they use weapons on him, and the wounded Leonid falls from the roof and dies. At the trial, Victor states that he allegedly sat behind Usov, while Leonid Osadchiy was sitting next to the driver, but this statement is refuted by presenting direct physical evidence of the murder   the knife with which it was committed. Viktor is sentenced to death, Alexander  to five years in prison to be served in a maximum security colony. And the judge, having arrived at the old house of the Rooks, tries to understand how they turned into criminals.\nCast\nAleksei Petrenko as Igor Anatolyevich Stavrasov, judge\nLeonid Filatov as Viktor Grach\nYaroslav Gavrilyuk as Alexander Grach\nVitaly Shapovalov as Leonid Osadchiy\nYuri Grebenshchikov as Andrey Grach\nMaria Vinogradova as Evdokia Grach, mother\nZemfira Tsakhilova as Vera Zagoruiko, Viktor Grach's mistress\nAnatoli Romashin as  Beloded, investigator\nKonstantin Linartovich as Malik, traffic police sergeant\nAlexander Anurov as prosecutor\nOlena Chekan as  Akchurina\nCritical response\nAlexander Fedorov noted:\n\"The  Rooks\" was filmed in a strict, laconic manner. Events are recreated almost documentary, with protocol precision. In the natural range of seaside landscapes and ancient Taganrog streets, in the few retrospectives there are also no stylistic delights. True, in rare cases this principle is violated, and the actor\u2019s strain and intonation falseness are noticeable. Having revealed the ins and outs of the psychology of adult criminals, the authors do not provide a deep analysis of the reasons that led Viktor to an irreversible moral decline.\nAccording to Mikhail Trofimenkov\u00a0,\nYershov made his directorial debut with the film \"Viy\" (1967), which enjoys the reputation of  the first Soviet horror film.  \"The Rooks\" is also a horror film. Yershov found a new intonation in the conversation about everyday, everyday evil, indistinguishable from the norm, living nearby and always ready to manifest itself.\n",

On 12 May, Olma Hall in St. Gallen was proposed as a potential venue. On 13 May, 1956 host city Lugano ruled out a bid to host the 2025 edition, while the president of Bern's cantonal government Philippe M\u00fcller expressed his reluctance to hosting the competition in the de facto Swiss capital, citing \"a rise in antisemitism\" in the contest. M\u00fcller was publicly contradicted by the whole cantonal Bernese government on 15 May; the council congratulated Nemo and announced its support in organising the contest in Bern. Meanwhile, the Zurich City Council was reported to have held a \"high priority\" meeting to discuss a bid. On 14 May, 1989 host city Lausanne ruled out bids to host the 2025 edition, citing a lack of infrastructure.\nOn 15 May, Biel/Bienne, Nemo's hometown, declared its interest to be associated and co-host the event.

    "Spanish footballer\nEnrique Molina Soler (4 May 1904 \u2013 15 July 1943) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Valencia CF. Apart from football, he also played Basque pelota in Valencia, and was one of the organizers of the Volta a Peu del Mercantil Valenciano.\nEarly life\nEnrique Molina was born on 4 May 1904 in the Russafa neighborhood, which at that time had just been annexed to the city of Valencia, into a conservative and deeply Catholic family. It was a small district surrounded by orchards, in which his family worked and in which he began to play football, a sport that was beginning to enjoy some success in the city of Valencia.\nPlaying career\nFrom a very young age he stood out as an athlete and for his physical form, so at the age of 16, he joined the ranks of the now-extinct Uni\u00f3n Levantina. He remained there for two seasons, until 1922, when he joined Gimn\u00e1stico FC, where he played alongside the likes of Silvino and Alfredo Arr\u00f3niz. While there, he became the most notable midfielder in the city, standing out for his bravery on the field of play and his extraordinary ability to recover balls in the center of the field, pushing the team towards the attack with an energy never seen in those times.\nIn the summer of 1924, Molina was signed by Valencia CF, which meant greatly weakening its eternal rival, and in fact, they won the following three Regional Championships\u00a0, with Molina playing a crucial role in those titles. In his first year, however, his performances were heavily affected by an illness, but he was at his best in the next nine, displaying great pride and consistency that was only interrupted in 1931 due to a knee injury and the enormous impact caused by the death of his wife, whom he had married only a year before. Molina became one of the first great players in the club's history, as he remained in the team for ten seasons, experiencing the first years of the club's professionalization in 1926, the debut in both the Copa del Rey and La Liga in its inaugural season in 1929, and the first promotion to the First Division in 1931, retiring in 1934, shortly before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Together with Cirilo Amor\u00f3s and Enrique Salvador, Molina formed what was known as the \"glorious media\", which achieved the first feats in national football. In 1929, with an economic crisis at the club, he agreed to reduce the fee and calmed down an attempted rebellion by the footballers against the coach.\nMolina was a very temperamental man; for instance, during his time as a referee, he assaulted a Correspondencia journalist\u00a0. On another occasion, during a match in Torrero against Iberia, he was attacked with an umbrella by a spectator, and Molina, without flinching, snatched the weapon from him and ended up throwing the fan out of the stadium. He once even drove his car into the Mestalla Stadium to remove a referee who was threatened by the stands.\nAdmired by critics and caricaturists, Molina received thunderous ovations not only at Mestalla, but also in rival stadiums, notably in his farewell match in a League fixture in Vitoria-Gasteiz, when the entire audience at the Mendizorrotza stood up and paid a resounding tribute to him. In 1933, he was the subject of a tribute match, a friendly match against the Spanish national team in the Mestalla Stadium on 30 April 1933, a team for which he was permanently called up, but with which he unfairly never made his debut. In total, he played 323 games with the Valencia club.\nLater life and death\nOnce he retired, Molina was able to start a small business with the little savings generated by his activity as a player.\nA Falangist since before the outbreak of the Civil War, Molina enrolled in the Blue Division as a volunteer, a militia that moved from Spain to provide support to the Army of Nazi Germany in the fight against the Soviet Union during the Second World War. He died after being attacked by cannon fire while transporting two Nazi Germany drivers on a motorcycle with a sidecar during the Siege of Leningrad on 15 July 1943.

    "2003 studio album by FAB Trio\nTransforming the Space is the debut album by the FAB Trio, a collaborative ensemble named after the first letters of the musicians' last names, featuring double bassist Joe Fonda, drummer Barry Altschul, and violinist Billy Bang. It was recorded on February 17 and 18, 2003, at the Spirit Room in Rossie, New York, and was released later that year by CIMP.\nReception\nIn a review for AllMusic, Steve Loewy called the album \"a delightful set,\" and noted the musicians' \"collective virtuosity and joyous enthusiasm.\" He wrote: \"It all has a certain sense of completeness, as though by the last selection the trio has accomplished its task with an unobtrusive reverence.\"\nDerek Taylor of All About Jazz praised the music's \"startling intellect and emotion,\" stating that the trio \"generates a body of music on par with what the players' individual reputations would suggest.\" AAJ's Jeff Stockton described the recording as \"a session brimming with empathic interplay,\" commenting: \"the disc's sheer musicality and accessibility took me by surprise... The players were loose, and the result is as tight a trio session as you're likely to hear.\" Another AAJ writer remarked: \"Without the particular combination of talent and experience each of these articulate players brings to this table, the risks involved would almost certainly have yielded total disaster. But somehow, magically, this hour of music ends up open, expansive, and hearty.\"\nDusted Magazine's Jason Bivins wrote: \"The musicians prod each other, at times in a frenzy, but elsewhere in a serene manner. They embody virtues developed during an earlier period of American improvisation, when finely wrought compositions first grew from contexts of what had previously been complete freedom, and yet their playing still sounds vital.\"\nWriting for Jazz Word, Ken Waxman noted Bang's \"squirming, squeaking, near-atonal glissandos and multi-stops\" that suggest \"the picture of a whirling dervish fiddler,\" and praised the group's \"memorable and thought-provoking sounds.\"\nTrack listing\n\"Be Out S'cool\" (Barry Altschul) \u2013 7:52\n\"The Softness of Light\" (Billy Bang) \u2013 13:15\n\"For Papa Jo, Klook & Philly Too\" (Barry Altschul) \u2013 10:13\n\"Tales from Da Bronx\" (Billy Bang) \u2013 9:09\n\"Song for My Mother\" (Joe Fonda) \u2013 16:38\n\"Coligno Battatta\" (Joe Fonda/Barry Altschul/Billy Bang) \u2013 6:29\nPersonnel\nBilly Bang \u2013 violin\nJoe Fonda \u2013 double bass\nBarry Altschul \u2013 drums\n",
    "Turkish politician (1914\u20131995)\nOrhan \u00d6ztrak (1914\u20131995) was a Turkish jurist and politician who served as the minister of interior and the minister of customs and monopolies. He was a member of the Parliament and of the Senate.\nEarly life and education\nHe was born in Malkara, Tekirda\u011f, in 1914. He hailed from a family of which members are politicians and bureaucrats. His father was Mustafa Faik \u00d6ztrak who was the minister of interior. His brother, Adnan \u00d6ztrak, was the first director general of the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation between 1964 and 1971. His younger brother \u0130lhan \u00d6ztrak served as the minister of state.\nOrhan \u00d6ztrak obtained a law degree from Ankara University. He received his Ph.D. in law from the University of Neuch\u00e2tel.\nCareer and activities\nAfter working as a district governor \u00d6ztrak was elected to the Parliament in the 1957 general election for the Republican People's Party (CHP) from Tekirda\u011f. Following the military coup on 27 May 1960 a Constituent Assembly was formed. \u00d6ztrak was the Tekirda\u011f representative for the CHP at the Assembly from 6 January 1961 to 15 October 1961. He worked as a member of the CHP Central Administrative Board and was the party's deputy general secretary. He was named as the minister of customs and monopolies to the cabinet led by \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc on 25 June 1962.\n\u00d6ztrak was appointed minister of interior to the same cabinet on 26 December 1963, replacing \u0130lyas Se\u00e7kin in the post. \u00d6ztrak's tenure ended on 20 February 1965 when Hakk\u0131 Akdo\u011fan was named as the minister of interior. \u00d6ztrak was part of the group led by Turhan Feyzio\u011flu in the CHP who argued in 1965 that the concept of the left of center was a way to make a distinction between the CHP followers and the followers of the Workers' Party of Turkey.\n\u00d6ztrak resigned from the CHP on 30 April 1967 and was involved in the establishment of the Reliance Party. Later he was made its general secretary. He was a representative of Turkey at the European Parliament from 17 April 1970 to 28 January 1971.\n\u00d6ztrak served as minister of customs and monopolies in the cabinet led by S\u00fcleyman Demirel between 1975 and 1977. \u00d6ztrak was a senator from Tekirda\u011f from 1975 to 1980.\nPersonal life and death\n\u00d6ztrak was married and had two children, including Faik \u00d6ztrak, a member of the CHP.\n\u00d6ztrak died on 30 December 1995.\n",
    "\nBridge in Nassau County, New YorkThe Wreck Lead Bridge is a railroad drawbridge carrying the Long Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road over Reynolds Channel, between the City of Long Beach and the Village of Island Park, in Nassau County, New York, United States.\nDesign\nThe Wreck Lead Bridge is a steel and concrete bascule bridge. It carries a single track across the channel, with the Long Beach station to its south and the Island Park station to its north. When in the closed position, the bridge's bascule span, located midstream, has a clearance below of 17 feet (5.2\u00a0m) above the high-tide mark.\nHistory\nThe original Wreck Lead Bridge was a wooden swing bridge which was built in 1880, upon the construction of the present-day Long Beach Branch to Long Beach. By the 1980s, it was in need of replacement, with its deck frequently being stuck & subsequently delaying train and/or boat traffic; the bridge was also vulnerable to flooding due to its low spans, which caused the swing bridge mechanisms to regularly be submerged in saltwater. A modern replacement span was soon proposed by officials, and the plans were finalized by the latter half of the decade following the LIRR, Town of Hempstead, Village of Island Park, City of Long Beach, and the United States Coast Guard all agreeing on the plans.\nConstruction on the current bridge commenced in 1987 and was finished in the spring of 1988. The opening of the $25.4 million bridge occurred on May 9 of that year. It has a deck which sits 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) higher than the one on its predecessor, allowing for more boats to pass underneath it without the bridge needing to open; the reduction in required bridge openings also improved train service and capacity. As part of the replacement project, the locations of both the maritime navigation channel and the bridge's bascule section were shifted southwards, from their previous location along the Island Park shore to their current location midstream.\nThe current bridge's bascule span was originally built and used as one of the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad's former drawbridges in Placida, Florida; service on that line ceased upon the railroad's decision to discontinue its Placida\u2013Boca Grande freight route. When planning the bridge, the MTA purchased the then-16-year-old span for $475,000 (1986 USD) and shipped it to New York by barge; reusing the bascule span saved the LIRR an estimated $1 million (1986 USD) in project costs.\nIn the 2010s, following Superstorm Sandy, the MTA announced that the bridge, along with the rest of the Long Beach Branch (which was severely damaged during Sandy), would undergo a major bridge rehabilitation and modernization project which would fortify it against future floods. As part of the project, the bridge received an emergency generator and improved electrical systems to make it more resilient in the event of severe storms. Many of the bridge's aging underwater power cables were also replaced.\nSee also\nManhasset Viaduct \u2013 Another major LIRR bridge.\nWreck Lead station \u2013 A former LIRR station near the bridge.\n",
    "American ichthyologist\nMargaret Gertrude Bradbury, known as \"Maggie\" (July 15, 1927 \u2013 October 19, 2010) was an American ichthyologist, educator and illustrator. She is best known for her work on the anglerfish family Ogcocephalidae, the deep-sea batfishes.\nShe was born on July 15, 1927, in Chicago; her parents were Gerald Bradbury, an architect, and Margaret Bradbury. She had a younger brother Gerald Jr. Her father died around 1938 when she was probably 11 years old. In 1947 she joined the Chicago Natural History Museum's Zoology Department as a staff artist. In this role she provided illustrations for publications by many scientists associated with the museum, including the herpetologists Robert F. Inger and Karl P. Schmidt, as well as the ichthyologists Loren P. Woods and Robert H. Kanazawa. While she was at the museum she enrolled in Roosevelt College and graduated with a bachelor's degree in zoology in 1955. She continued to work as an illustrator and was honored in 1957 by Marion Griswold Grey in the specific epithet of the dreamer Oneirodes bradburyae for her \"preparation of the figure of the type specimen\".\nIn 1955 Bradbury went on a collecting trip to the Bahamas as part of an Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences expedition, and on her return to the United States she matriculated at Stanford University as a graduate student. Here she was initially supervised by George S. Myers but switched to Rolf L. Bolin at the Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove around 1957. She worked as a teaching assistant at Stanford's Palo Alto campus and as a part-time technical assistant at the collection of South Pacific fishes at the George Vanderbilt Foundation. After transferring to Hopkins she worked as a technician preparing research reports for California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations at Hopkins in 1957, as an illustrator and illustrating consultant for the U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries in Washington, D.C. in 1959. She worked for two years as a teaching assistant in marine biology at Hopkins and gained her Ph.D. in 1963. Her Ph.D. dissertation was on the systematics of the deep sea batfish family, Ogcocephalidae, a group she was to study for the rest of her career and beyond until her failing eyesight stopped her work.\nShe was appointed as assistant professor of biology at MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois, in 1962 but returned to California in 1963 as an assistant professor of Biological Sciences at San Francisco State College, becoming associate professor in 1967 and a full professor in 1971. She remained at San Francisco State University for 34 years until her retirement in 1994. Bradbury also taught summer courses in ichthyology at Hopkins and took part in expeditions on the schooner Te Vega. She was regarded as a leading authority on the family Ogcocephalidae and published a number of papers on this group. She was a pioneer in the use of cladistics in her work. She became a Fellow and a Research Associate of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences. In her retirement she moved to Pacific Grove where she was active as a member of the Board of Friends of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, an was president of that board for a number of years. She died on 19 October 2010.\nEponyms\nBradbury has been honored in the specific names of the following fishes:\nOneirodes bradburyae  Grey, 1957\nCoelophrys bradburyae  Endo & Shinohara, 1999 \nHalieutopsis margaretae  Ho & K-T Shao, 2007\nMalthopsis bradburyae  Ho 2013\n",

    "\nChawan dialect (simplified Chinese: \u8bcf\u5b89\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u8a54\u5b89\u8a71; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Chi\u00e0u-an-\u014d\u025b) is a variety of Southern Min spoken in the Chawan (Zhao'an) County in Fujian province, China. It is usually considered a divergent dialect of Hokkien exhibiting some Teochew influence.\nGeography and classification\nChawan dialect is spoken in the southern half of the Chawan (Zhao'an) county. The northern part of the county, with roughly one-third of its population, is mainly Hakka-speaking, and the border between the Chawan-speaking and the Hakka-speaking parts of county lies within the Hongxing township (\u7ea2\u661f\u4e61) and Taiping town (\u592a\u5e73\u9547).\nThe dialect spoken in Sidu (\u56db\u90fd\u9547), Meizhou (\u6885\u6d32\u4e61) and Jinxing (\u91d1\u661f\u4e61), three localities in the eastern part of the Chawan county, is closer to the Yunxiao Hokkien. The Yunxiao dialect bears some affinity to Chawan, however, it lacks some of its notable characteristicts, such as vowels /\u026f/ and /\u0259/.\nA related dialect is spoken in some parts of the Dongshan island, particularly the Qianlou town (\u524d\u697c\u9547).\nThe speech of the Nanzhao town is taken as representative for Chawan dialect. There are some internal differences, but the subdialects of Chawan are yet poorly described. E.g.:\nThe dialect of the Tingyang village (\u6c40\u6d0b\u6751) in Baiyang Township (\u767d\u6d0b\u4e61), almost at the Fujian-Guangdong border, shows some Teochew specific traits, such as lack of denasalization and the merger of /in, an/ with /i\u014b, a\u014b/ (e.g. it distinguishes \u76ee ma\u030dk and \u6728 ba\u030dk, while general Chawan has both as ba\u030dk; it distinguishes initials, but not finals in \u5102 n\u00e2ng and \u862d l\u00e2ng, while general Chawan has \u5102 l\u00e2ng and \u862d l\u00e2n).\nThe dialect of the Wenshan (\u6587\u5c71\u6751) village in the Taiping Town (\u592a\u5e73\u9547) has the rime /oi/ in words like \u5c3e b\u00f3i, unlike general Chawan b\u00f3e. It also has the rime /-uou/ instead of /-ou/ (e.g. it reads \u571f th\u00f3\u0358 as , unlike general Chawan ), which is a trait found in some Hokkien dialects around Zhangpu.\nChawan is usually classified as a dialect of Hokkien. However, it also has some common traits with Teochew, particularly in its vocabulary, e.g.:\n\u7747 th\u00e9i\u207f \"to see\" (cf. Teochew \u7747 th\u00f3i\u207f, Hokkien \u770b kh\u00f2a\u207f)\n\u547e\u8a71 t\u00e0\u207f-\u014d\u025b \"to talk\" (cf. Teochew \u547e\u8a71 t\u00e0\u207f-\u014de, Hokkien \u8b1b\u8a71 k\u00f3ng-\u014da)\n\u5973 n\u0144g \"woman\" (cf. Teochew \u5973 n\u1e73\u0301ng, Hokkien \u5973 l\u00ed)\nPhonology\nConsonants\nIn terms of consonants, Chawan does not differ much from other dialects of Hokkien. It has as total of 15 initials. Denasalization is extensive, which is typical for Hokkien, but not for Teochew.\nRimes\nThe most notable feature of Chawan is the presence of the vowels /\u026f/ and /\u0259/, which are absent in the general Zhangzhou dialects.\nChawan is also notable for distinguishing /ue/ and /u\u025b/. While the former rime is common across Hokkien dialects, the latter is usually merged with /ue/ (in Quanzhou Hokkien) or /ua/ (in Zhanghzou Hokkien). To a lesser extent, Yunxiao Hokkien also distinguishes /ue/ and /u\u025b/.\nChawan dialect does not dissimilate the rimes /uam/ and /uap/ (in \u51e1 ho\u00e2m, \u72af ho\u0101m, \u6cd5 hoap), similarly to Teochew. Most other Hokkien dialects have /uan/ and /uat/ instead.\nTones\nChawan has 7 citation tones, which are mostly similar to general Zhangzhou Hokkien tones.\nNotes\n^ Min is believed to have split from Old Chinese, rather than Middle Chinese like other varieties of Chinese.\n",
    "One of three types of war in Jewish law\nVoluntary war (Hebrew: \u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u200e; mil\u1e25emet ha-resh\u016bt), sometimes called a discretionary war, optional war, a  non-obligatory war, or  a war of free choice, is a technical term found in Hebrew classical literature and denoting a war that is waged of free choice by Israel, only at such a time when the people of Israel are settled in their ancestral homeland. Such a war is to be distinguished from a mandatory war, in that a voluntary war is not fought for national survival, but rather for personal ambitions of the country's ruler. This might include personal enmity with another state, or a desire to show the country's military prowess as a means to deter potential aggressors, or to expand the territorial domain of the country. Such a war cannot be waged without either the command of a king, or the approbation of the Great Sanhedrin, consisting of no less than seventy-one judges. A voluntary war is also to be distinguished from a religious war, insofar that a religious war concerns the conquest of the land of Canaan by Joshua.\nFor all practical purposes, a voluntary war can be described as an offensive war, but in the absence of either a monarchy or the Sanhedrin such a war is lacking in its powers and in its authority to be waged, and there is no man who can forcibly be taken to join the war effort.\nHistory\nTraditional laws of armed conflict are the norms and practices that were in force amongst nations long before the adoption of the UN Charter and the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, where, in the case of the former, the victor subjugated the enemy (enslaved them), expelled them, took their cities and land, etc., and what some have also termed \"precedents of permissibility,\" although universally agreed that wherever the traditional laws of conflict are found, \"the structure of the UN and the structure of international criminal law have been significantly weakened.\"\nThe Hebrew Bible, as a case study, has often been cited and used as the constitutional basis for traditional laws of conquest, where the defeated are either killed or enslaved. Traditional Jewish law recognizes as a category of permissible war, wars undertaken in order \"to diminish the heathens so that they shall not march against them.\"\nIn 164 BCE, Mattathias, the progenitor of the Hasmonean dynasty, made it a law that it was permissible for Jews to defend themselves on the Sabbath day, even if it meant desecrating the Sabbath, when attacked by their enemies. His son, Judas Maccabeus, when trying to curtail the advances of the enemy Syrian troops who had invaded the country, put into practice the teachings of Moses, as prescribed in the 'ancient order of battle' (Deut. 20:1\u2013ff.), and dismissed from his army those men who had recently been married to a wife.\nRules of conduct\nA voluntary war is bound by certain legal restraints and restrictions (jus in bello), inasmuch as it is prohibited by halakha to wage a voluntary war on the Sabbath day, unless it be to save life. Moreover, in a war waged of free choice, whenever Israel lays siege to a city belonging to the enemy, the siege must be initiated at least three days before the start of the Sabbath, and it is incumbent upon Israel to offer the besieged conditions of capitulation (peace), such as the guarantee of their lives being spared if they agree to be put under tribute and servitude to the Jewish nation, and on condition that they agree to observe the seven basic commandments given to the sons of Noah. For this, embassages and heralds are sent to representatives of those persons who make themselves voluntary enemies to the nation of Israel in order to extend conditions of peace. Once the siege has  begun, war is made against the besieged city and continues thereafter, day after day, even on the Sabbath day itself, as it says: \"until it be subdued\" (Deut.\u00a020:20).\nIn a voluntary war, not all able-bodied men are conscripted to fight, as there are certain exemptions outlined explicitly in the Torah, namely: \n'the one who built a house and did not dwell in it a year's time' (This rule also applies to the man who built a new warehouse, cowshed, woodshed or hayshed. It is the same whether he had obtained the house through legal means, but had not dwelt in it, or he had inherited the house, but had not dwelt in it.)\nhe that 'planted a vineyard and did not partake of its fruit' . (The same rule would apply to the man who planted five fruit-trees, whether they were all of the same kind, or different kinds).\nthe one who has 'betrothed a wife and has yet to perform his marital duty' on her.

In the early stages of the film's development, Dosch briefly considered changing the subject the film after an encounter with filmmaker Justine Triet, who previously directed Dosch in the film Age of Panic (2013), and revealed to Dosch the premise of her next film Anatomy of a Fall (2023) which similarly centers on a trial, a child, a blind person and a dog.\nThe film is produced by Lionel Baier and Agnieszka Ramu for Bande \u00e0 Part Films (Switzerland) and by Thomas and Mathieu Verhaeghe for Atelier de Production (France), in co-production with RTS Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse, SRG SSR and France 2 Cin\u00e9ma.\nRelease\nDog on Trial was selected to compete in the Un Certain Regard section at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, where it had its world premiere on 19 May 2024.\nInternational sales are handled by mk2 Films.

    "\nDistortion pedals are a type of effects unit designed to add distortion to an audio signal to create a warm, gritty, or fuzzy character.  Depending on the style of signal clipping, the broader category of distortion pedals is typically divided into fuzz pedals, distortion pedals, or overdrive pedals.  Designed for electric guitar and bass and operated by the player's foot, distortion pedals are most frequently placed in the signal chain between the guitar and amplifier.\nThe use of distortion pedals was popularized by Keith Richard's use of a Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone pedal on the 1965 Rolling Stones song \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\".  Later pedals like the Pro Co Rat and Ibanez Tube Screamer have achieved iconic status among guitarists and are a key element in many players' tones.  Industry publications often publish lists of influential and popular models.\nFuzz pedals\nArbiter Fuzz Face\nMain article: Fuzz Face\nArbiter Electronics released the first Fuzz Face in 1969, featuring a unique round metal housing inspired by a microphone stand and with the arrangement of volume knob, distortion knob, and logo intentionally resembling a face.  The Fuzz Face's first production run lasted until 1976/77, then was reissued from 1986 until 1990.  In 1993, Dunlop Manufacturing took over production and has continued to issue several varieties of the pedal.  Jimi Hendrix popularized the Fuzz Face and was known to buy multiple copies at a time to identify the best ones; his pedal chain often consisted of a wah-wah pedal into a Fuzz Face, then into a Uni-Vibe.  Other notable users include Duane Allman, Stevie Ray Vaughan Pete Townshend, Eric Johnson, and George Harrison.\nElectro-Harmonix Big Muff\nMain article: Electro-Harmonix Big Muff\nThe Big Muff Pi (\u03c0), often known simply as the Big Muff, is a fuzz pedal produced in New York City by the Electro-Harmonix company, along with their Russian sister company Sovtek, primarily for use with the electric guitar.  Released in 1969 and designed with an emphasis on long sustain compared to existing fuzzes, the Big Muff Pi was the first overwhelming success for Electro-Harmonix's line of pedals. Due to its reliability, its low price, and its distinctive sound, the Big Muff sold consistently through the 1970s and was found in numerous guitarists' pedal collections, including David Gilmour and Carlos Santana.  The \"sustained grind\" of the Big Muff was later an integral part of the sound of many alternative rock bands through the 1980s and 1990s, being used extensively by the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr., NOFX, Bush and Mudhoney.\nMaestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone\nMain article: Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone\nThe Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone was the first widely marketed fuzz distortion guitar and bass effect. Introduced in 1962, it achieved widespread popularity in 1965 after the Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards prominent use of the FZ-1 on the group's hit, \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\".  Later in 1965, the design was slightly modified and designated as the model FZ1-1a.  In the wake of the success of \"Satisfaction,\" numerous recordings, mostly from  1960s garage rock and psychedelic acts, featured Maestro Fuzz-Tones on guitar.  More significant design changes made after 1967 resulted in different renditions of the Fuzz-Tone released over the years.  In the 1990s, Gibson re-issued the FZ-1a, but it was later discontinued.\nSola Sound / Vox Tone Bender\nMain article: Tone Bender\nReleased in 1965, Sola Sound's Tone Bender was a re-creation of the popular Maestro Fuzz-Tone, but with more sustain and intended for the European market.  For U.S. distribution, Vox released a version in 1967 based on Sola Sound's MK1.5 Tone Bender update, one of many the pedal went through.  With different component values and transistors being used over the years, earlier variants are fuller sounding, while later ones are bright and cutting.  Notable examples of the Tone Bender in use include Jeff Beck's sitar-like guitar solo on the Yardbirds' 1965 song \"Heart Full of Soul\" and Mick Ronson's guitar work on David Bowie's 1972 song \"Moonage Daydream\".\nUnivox Super-Fuzz\nMain article: Univox Super-Fuzz\nThe Univox Super-Fuzz circuit was designed in the late 1960s by the Japanese company Honey, in the form of a multi-effect called the Honey Psychedelic Machine. Later on, Honey was acquired by Shin-ei, who produced the effect separately and imported it to the USA via Unicord, the parent company of Univox.  The first Super-Fuzzes were made in 1968, and production continued until the late 70s.  The pedal is unique in that the full-wave rectification of the circuit produces an upper octave as well as a slight lower octave. This also gives the sound a lot of compression and a mild ring modulator effect. A second unique feature is a tone switch that engages a 1\u00a0kHz filter that \"scoops\" the mids, giving a fat, bassy tone.\nDistortion pedals\nBoss DS-1 Distortion\nMain article: Boss DS-1\nIntroduced in 1978, the DS-1 was Boss's first distortion",
    "\nUnited States historic place\nThe St. Peter State Hospital Museum, located in St. Peter, Minnesota, offers a glimpse into the history of Minnesota's first and oldest public psychiatric hospital. Established in 1866, the St. Peter State Hospital played a significant role in the evolving field of mental health care. The museum, housed within the original 1867 hospital administration building, itself on the campus of what is now St. Peter Regional Treatment Center, was created to shed light on the institution's long history and dispel misconceptions surrounding mental illness. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\nHistory and organization\nBecause the museum is on the grounds of St. Peter Regional Treatment Center it is has restricted access and offers visits by appointment only. Following a brief introduction to the hospital's history, visitors can explore exhibits covering diverse themes. These include the roles of nurses and doctors, patient care, daily routines, historical medical instruments used by staff, patient-created artwork, photographs of nursing personnel, and even salary records.\nExhibits\nThe museum divides its space into two sections. One section focuses on the professional duties of hospital staff, including nurses and doctors. The other section details patient care and daily routines.\nMinnesota Hospital for the Insane\nThe St. Peter State Hospital Center Building is the oldest surviving structure of the first mental hospital established in Minnesota. The hospital was constructed between 1867 and 1878. The front pediment bears a tablet with the date \"1866\" \u2014 the year the state legislature established the St. Peter hospital. The building was designed by architect Samuel Sloan according to the principles of Dr. Thomas Kirkbride, a prominent figure in mental health treatment. Kirkbride's theories, outlined in his book \"On the Construction, Organization and General Arrangements of Hospitals for the Insane,\" emphasized a central administration building with flanking wings for patients. This design aimed to create a stable environment for both patients and staff.\nSloan was chosen for the project due to his experience working with Kirkbride. He had previously designed numerous hospitals based on Kirkbride's plan. Notably, Kirkbride himself served as a consultant on the St. Peter project.\nThe building as it stands today is all that remains of a much larger complex built between 1867 and 1878. The original patient wings were demolished in the late 1960s. Despite this, the Center Building retains its architectural integrity and exemplifies both Kirkbride's design philosophy and Sloan's skillful execution.\nGallery\n1874 Lithograph\nBuilding in 1893\nSee also\nMinnesota Security Hospital\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Nicollet County, Minnesota\n",
    "\nSoumaintrain is a French soft cheese made exclusively from whole cow's milk with a 21-day ripening period. It is named after the commune of Soumaintrain.\nA minimum of 75% of the dry food the cows consume must be from the geographic area.\nIt was proposed to be a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) cheese in 2014 and was finalized in 2016.\nSoumaintrain originates from north of Bourgogne where it borders the department of Aube.\u00a0It is full of grasslands with wet valleys, which is conducive to dairy farming but discourages other agricultural pursuits. The soil is predominantly loose and impermeable clay and is difficult to cultivate with machines. The area has a topography that is largely flat with little undulation, with a dense hydrological network set among soft, impermeable rocks, which combines to create a susceptibility to flooding between autumn and spring. Temperatures are somewhat cool with an annual average that barely exceeds 10\u00a0\u00b0C. Rainfall is regularly between 700 and 800\u00a0mm.\nProduction\nThe process of making Soumaintrain can be traced to the Middle Ages. The earliest evidence of ripened cheese dates back to a twelfth-century abbey in Pontigny which was founded in 1117. Henri Auclerc (1887\u20131968), a priest in Vergigny linked cheese-making and the abbey when he asserted that: \u2018the Cistercian monks demanded payment of farm rents in ripened cheese\u2019.\nThe traditional production method of Soumaintrain is described numerous times in nineteenth-century literature.\u00a0Essentially, the fresh cheese curd is poured into moulds and allowed to drain.\u00a0The cheese is turned twice daily for two days until fully set.\u00a0After which it is salted on both sides and then washed daily until the outside develops its colour.\nWashing the cheese periodically removes surface flora which develops because of the prevalent humidity of the region. The specific technique used for washed-rind ripening combined with the fresh curd starter leads to the defining characteristics of Soumaintrain, a moist rind, a colour that ranges from ivory to pale yellow, centripetal ripening (the cheese ripens from the outside in, but rarely ripens to the centre), intense aroma and characteristic refined bitter aftertaste.\n",
    "American politician\nLady Willie Forbus (August 24, 1892 \u2013 April 27, 1993) was an American politician in the state of Washington. A Democrat, she was a member of the Washington State Senate for the 44th district from 1943 to 1947.\nEarly life and education\nForbus was born on August 24, 1892, in Zieglerville, Mississippi. Her parents were William Peyton Forbus and George Ellen \"Birdie\" Forbus (n\u00e9e\u00a0Davis). Her name came from her father's name with, as was customary at the time for daughters named after their fathers, the addition of \"Lady\". Her father was the manager of several cotton plantations, although he was at constant risk of losing his job if the plantation was not profitable and frequently changed jobs. Her mother worked part-time as a music teacher, as well as raising cattle and selling eggs, butter and lard. Forbus had five siblings: Sample, Wiley, Edward, Bess and Juanita. When she was eight, the family moved to the Nitta Yuma plantation outside of Vicksburg.\nAs the second eldest, Forbus and her older brother Sample were sent to a larger town, Laurel, for their education when Forbus was fourteen as their mother was determined that they receive a good education. More than 150 miles away from their hometown, Forbus and Sample ran the household on the $25 (equivalent to $848 in 2023) monthly check sent by their parents, even after their four younger siblings joined them in the two-room house. Sample would receive the funds and distribute them to his sister to purchase the necessary household goods. Forbus would later say that her focus on equal rights began due to the discrimination she faced as a child.\nForbus's brothers graduated high school with university scholarships but the same aid was not available to female students, so Forbus worked as a stenographer for a local judge, Stone Deavours Barefield. She began studying at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. When she had an ear infection her junior year, she was unable to be treated at the university infirmary as a female student and was rendered dead in her left ear. She received her bachelor of science degree in 1915, having completed a four year liberal arts degree in three years. Determined to go to law school, she applied to Columbia, Harvard and Yale but was rejected from each, as none were yet admitting female law students. Instead she enrolled at the University of Michigan that fall as one of three female students, although she was the only one to graduate in 1918 with her bachelors of law degree. To fund her education, Forbus worked again as a stenographer, as a secretary for the highway engineering department and bought a $1,000 (equivalent to $20,257 in 2023) life insurance policy that she borrowed against and repaid each year. After graduation, she was told by the law school dean, \"Goodbye, Lady Willie, someday you'll make a good stenographer for some lawyer\".\nLegal career\nLeary Building, where Forbus's law practice was located, circa 1910\nForbus believed her legal career would be best placed if she went west and, using her law school's directory, she sent letters to lawyers in Cheyenne, Denver, San Francisco and Seattle asking for a job. Based on a response from a Seattle-based criminal lawyer, Walter Fulton, Forbus moved to Washington in 1918, immediately after graduation. She was prohibited from practicing in the state until she spent a year as a law clerk, a requirement in the state law as she had not graduated from the University of Washington. Forbus spent a year clerking for the local firm of Donworth & Todd (now Perkins Coie), and worked as a legal adviser for the draft board and secretary for the Military Training Camps Association. The law that prevented her from applying for her law licence was repealed during the year and on May 24, 1919, she was admitted to the Washington State Bar Association.\nForbus opened her own legal practice in September of that year in the Boston Block until it was torn down for the Seattle National Bank sixteen months later, when she moved to the Leary Building. Female lawyers were a rarity in Seattle but Forbus would later state that she was treated well and the state was \"freer, more open-minded\". Forbus's practice was the first woman-owned law firm in Seattle and she remained the only female sole practioner for a decade, until 1929. Her practice area was wide-ranging, although she primarily represented individuals in property and personal rights cases. She worked on divorces and annulments, probate, criminal matters and business matters, including arguing a case before the state supreme court.\nIn 1922, Forbus began to receive public attention due to her handling of the murder of the police officer Charles O. Legate. He was found dead in his car in his garage on March 17 and the gunshot wound to his head led the coroner's jury to rule the death a suicide. His wife retained Forbus as her lawyer, since a death by suicide would mean she was not entitled to his police pension. Forbus brought the c",

    "The statue.\nThe Statue of N. F. S, Grundtvig, situated in the central courtyard of Vartorv, close to the City Hall Square in central Copenhagen, Denmark, was created by Niels Skovgaard. It depicts N. F. S. Grundtvig knealing by the Spring of Life.\nDescription\nGrundtvig is depicted knealing by the Spring of Life. Skovgaard has signed the sculpture with his monigram (NKS) and the inscription Grundtvig og Livskilden (Grundtvig and the Spring of Life)  on the sole of his back-facing left shoe.\nNiels Skovgaard based his portrail of Grundtvig on his father P. C. Skovgaatrd's 1948 portrait drawing of Grundtvig. It is believed that P. X. Skovgaard's drawing was inspired by a three years older drawing by Gertner.\nHistory\nBackground\nNiels Skovgaard was the son of P. C. Skovgaard and Georgia Skovgaard. Grundtvig was a close friend of the family. He conducted the ceremony at the parents' wedding and their children Niels, Joakim and Suzette were also baptized by him. Niels Skovgaard and his brother Joakim were also good friends of Grundtvig's two sons. Throughout his career, Skovgaard received numerous commissions from independent Grundtvigian congregations and folk high Schools.\nGrundtvig died in 1872. A statue of him by Vilhelm Bissen was installed at the Frederick's Church construction site in 1894. In 1904, Rasmus B\u00f8gebjerg proposed another Grundtvig statue. His proposal depicted Grundtvig with a lark sitting on his left hand. The proposal was subject to a prolonged debate.\nThe teo competitions\nSkovgaard drawing from 1919.\nIn 1912, a competition for a Grundtvig monument was launched. Skovgaard's proposal received an award but none of the 32 submissions were selected as the final winner. Skovgaard was around the same time working on a portrait relief of Grundtvig for the Grundtvig House on Studiestr\u00e6de. A new invited competition was launched in 1913. The new competition was won by Niels Hansen Jacobsen. Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint awarded second prioze. It was later decided by the jury to go with Jensen-Klint's proposal. He had proposed a bell tower. It was later expaneed into the monumental Grundtvig's Church (1921\u20131940).\nCreating the sculpture\nThe completed statue at Lyngby Sugar Factory.\nSkovgaard kept working on his 1912 proposl. In 1925 he was finally commissioned by the Nt Carlsberg Foundation to create a granite version of the sculpture for Vartov's courtyard. It was executed with fewer details than the original proposal.

As of April 2024, Thapa is the only Nepalese person to have been awarded the George Cross.\nBiography\nThapa was born in western Nepal. He enlisted in the 2 Bn, 8th Gurkha Rifles in December 1920. He was married and had a son.\nGeorge Cross action and citation\nAt the rank of Naik, Nandlal Thapa was initially awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal (EGM) for the extraordinary bravery he displayed in conducting rescue operations right after the massive Quetta Earthquake of 31 May 1935. Lance Naik Chitrabahadur Gurung of 1/8 Gurkha Rifles was another recipient of the EGM for rescue operations in the same episode.   \nNandlal Thapa's EGM citation reads as the following: \n\"The KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the Award of the Medal of the Military Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire to the undermentioned for services rendered in connection with the recent earthquake in Baluchistan:\u2013 For Gallantry. No. 7506 Naik Nandlal Thapa, 2nd Battalion, 8th Gurkha Rifles, Indian Army. Naik Nandlal Thapa formed part of the leading detachment of the Battalion which was conveyed by Mechanical Transport from the Lines to Quetta City. There was no time for the party to collect tools. On arrival in the City the detachment was split up into small parties and worked with their hands for three hours, prior to the distribution of tools, extricating injured men and women from the d\u00e9bris. The area in which they worked was the junction of Bruce Road and Colvin Road, one of the parts most damaged by the earthquake. During this period minor shocks frequently occurred, causing further falls of masonry in the houses in which they were digging with their hands. Working with the party this Non-commissioned Officer showed conspicuous bravery in the manner in which he entered tottering buildings in search of living people and in the work and initiative he displayed in removing them. As a result of his disregard of danger ten people were rescued alive at considerable risk. He fully realised the risks he ran, but was always ready to enter any building where there was any possibility of anyone remaining alive. His conduct was a very fine example of courage and energy at a critical time.\"\nIn September 1940, following the creation of the George Cross, he was awarded a George Cross in place of the EGM. By that time, he had already retired from the army.\nLater life\nAfter the completion of his service, Thapa returned to Nepal. He died at Dhaulagiri.\nHis George Cross is held in the collection of the Gurkha Museum, Winchester.\nHe finds a brief mention in J.P. Cross's autobiographical account of his life in Nepal.\n",

    "German merchant and poet (1836\u20131868)\nAbraham Peter Carl Siebel (13 January 1836 \u2013 9 May 1868) was a German merchant, poet, and friend of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. His pseudonyms were Emil Thilva and Julius Morton.\nLife\nBorn Abraham Peter Carl Siebel, in Barmen, Germany, he was the son of the lace manufacturer Karl August Siebel (1805 \u2013 1888) and Emilia (Emilie) Kampermann (1812 \u2013 1878). After being tutored by a private teacher, he attended the Barmer City School and then a higher school in Rheydt. In 1850, his father determined that he should apprentice in the family firm \"Abraham Siebel & Son.\" He was not very fond of the profession and therefore turned to poetry. His friends were Emil Rittershaus and Hugo Oelbermann. Together they founded the Wuppertal poets' circle. Later, he joined the Sonntagskr\u00e4nzchen (Sunday gathering) of Friedrich Roeber.\nFrom 1852, Siebel was associated with the literary journal Morgenblatt f\u00fcr gebildete Leser (Morning paper for educated readers) and its editor Hermann Hauff. From 1853 to 1866, Siebel corresponded with Wolfgang M\u00fcller von K\u00f6nigswinter. Between 1854 and 1858, he wrote eleven letters to Nikolaus Hocker\u00a0.\nBetween 1856 and 1859, he spent a considerable amount of time travelling in Berlin and Manchester, where he met Friedrich Engels in 1859 and Wilhelm Wolff. In May 1859, Siebel was to report as a reserve soldier to the Prussian Guard in Berlin.\nHe participated in a festival marking the centenary of Friedrich Schiller's birth in Manchester on 10 November 1859, with the poem \"Epilogue\".\nSiebel (top-left, glasses) in an 1859 caricature by Johann Richard Seel\u00a0\nIn 1860, he returned to his homeland to marry on 14 November 1860. His wife was Eleonora Augusta Christina Reinhilda (Reinhilde) Freiin von Hurter (1842\u20131880). The marriage produced three children: Emilie Maria Siebel (b. 1862), Anna Reinhilde Siebel (b. 25 August 1863), and Carl Reinhold Siebel (b. 17 August 1867).\nIn May 1861, Karl Marx visited him in Elberfeld. In 1864, Siebel founded a section of the International Workingmen's Association in Barmen.\nDue to a chest ailment, he travelled to Funchal on the island of Madeira for healing purposes in 1866 and 1867.\nSiebel supported Karl Marx through reviews and advertisements in the German press to promote Marx's Das Kapital throughout 1867.\nShortly after his return from Madeira, he died of consumption in Elberfeld on 9 May 1868\u2014he had lost weight quickly in the fortnight before his death, and was planning to travel to the Rhine. He was buried in the Bartholom\u00e4usstra\u00dfe Cemetery in Barmen.\nLegacy\nGerman politician Johann Viktor Bredt called him a \"poet by divine grace\" in 1937, while Friedrich Engels summarised him in a letter to Jenny Marx on 22 December 1859: \"Give me Siebel any day; he may be a rotten poet, but he does at least know that he is a thorough humbug and all he asks is to be allowed to advertise himself\u2014nowadays a necessary proc\u00e9d\u00e9  without which he would be a complete nonentity.\"\nThe poet Eduard M\u00f6rike expressed negative opinions about the quality of his poetry in a letter to Karl von Gr\u00fcneisen on November 17, 1860.\nFrom the year 1865, four letters from Siebel to Wilhelm Jordan are preserved. Two letters to Gottfried Kinkel are in Kinkel's literary estate, two letters to Karl Gutzkow are kept in Frankfurt, and one letter to Paul Heyse is in the Munich State Library.\nWorks\n",

    "Arabic book of magic\n\"Book of the Cow\" redirects here. For the ancient Egyptian text, see Book of the Heavenly Cow. For the Quranic sura that sometimes circulated independently, see al-Baqara.\nStart of the only known surviving excerpt of the original Arabic text of the Kit\u0101b al-naw\u0101m\u012bs\nThe Kit\u0101b al-naw\u0101m\u012bs is an Arabic book of magic written in the late ninth century in a \u1e62\u0101bian milieu. It falsely claims to be a work of Plato. The complete Arabic text does not survive, but a complete Latin translation of the twelfth century does under the title Liber vaccae or the Book of the Cow.\nThe work is divided into two books of 45 and 40 chapters, respectively. Each chapter contains a magical experiment or recipe, including for creating rational animals or hybrids, creating phenomena in the sky, controlling the rain or trees, acquiring wisdom, influencing the sense of vision, creating inextinguishable lights, getting one's wishes granted, seeing spirits, making animals submissive, manipulating fire and making miraculous seeds and inks.\nTitle\nThe original title in Arabic, Kit\u0101b al-naw\u0101m\u012bs, is often translated Book of the Laws, since naw\u0101m\u012bs is the plural of n\u0101m\u016bs, an Arabic transliteration of Greek nomos (law). It was chosen so as to sound genuine, since there is an authentic work of Plato entitled Laws. The Arabic term naw\u0101m\u012bs, however, came to mean \"secrets\" and this is how it is defined in medieval dictionaries. Liana Saif suggests \"book of the sacred secrets\" is a better translation of Kit\u0101b al-naw\u0101m\u012bs and accurately reflects its content.\nIn Latin translation, the book circulated under various titles. The original title of the translation was Liber aneguemis, the latter word being a mere transliteration of al-naw\u0101m\u012bs. This was sometimes corrupted to Liber neumich. The alternative title Libri institutionum (and variants like Liber institucionum activarum) is an attempt at translation. Other titles are taken from the work's contents. Liber tegimenti is a reference to the preface, wherein the original title (Kit\u0101b al-naw\u0101m\u012bs) is said to be a tegimentum (covering) concealing the true meaning. Liber regimenti, the title found in De mirabilibus mundi, appears to be a corruption of this. Liber vaccae ('Book of the Cow'), the title chosen by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, refers to the first experiment, which involves a cow.\nGenre\nBy medieval classifications, the Kit\u0101b al-naw\u0101m\u012bs is a work of natural magic (s\u012bm\u0101\u02be, magia naturalis) as opposed to ritual magic. That is, it is \"based solely on the exploitation of the hidden forces of nature\" and does not directly involve demons or other spirits.\nModern scholars have employed many terms. On account of the substances used and the end products of its experiments, it may be classed as \"organic magic\". Its complex procedures and focus on marvel and spectacle place it in the realm of \"illusionist\" rather than divinatory magic. David Pingree labels it \"psychic magic\" because its uses body parts and fluids which souls were believed to inhabit.\nDate and place of origin\nThe Kit\u0101b al-naw\u0101m\u012bs was produced by the \u1e62\u0101bians of \u1e24arr\u0101n in the late ninth century. The earliest citation of it is found in a Pseudo-J\u0101birian work of the early tenth century. Robert Goulding suggests that second book was composed separately and added to the first early on.\nThe preface falsely claims that the work is \u1e24unayn ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q's translation of Galen's synopsis of Plato's Laws. An actual translation or adaptation of Plato's Laws based on Galen's synopsis and attributed to \u1e24unayn is partially extant. No fuller translation is known. The purpose of the forgery was \"that their anonymous authors hoped to give additional weight to the authority of their works.\" The pagan religion of the \u1e62\u0101bians, however, was genuinely influenced by Neoplatonism. Some words in the Arabic text are clearly transliterations of Greek words.\nThe ascription to Plato was considered suspect by the earliest Latin writers to comment on it, William of Auvergne\u00a0(d.\u00a01249) and Nicole Oresme\u00a0(d.\u00a01382). It was rejected outright by Pico della Mirandola, who calls the work \"full of detestable dreams and nonsense ... no less alien to Plato than these dreadful things are alien to Plato's decency and wisdom.\"\nSynopsis\nStart of the Liber vaccae in the Vatican manuscript\nAfter a preface, the Kit\u0101b al-naw\u0101m\u012bs is divided into two books, called maior (greater) and minor (lesser). There are 85 chapters containing approximately as many \"experiments\", 45 in the first book and 40 in the second. Some surviving copies lack chapter 26 and chapters 39 and 40 appear to be later additions.\nThe experiments are organized thematically. Sophie Page identifies ten groupings (and three isolated chapters) in the first book:\nChapters 1\u20134, experiments for creating creatures\nChapters 5\u201311, suffumigations for creating celestial marvels\nChapters 12\u201315, experiments for influencing the rain\nChapters 16\u201320, experiments for \"how to adapt houses so that they have marvelous appearances or s",
    "Scottish nobleman and supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots\nSir John Maxwell, 4th Lord Herries of Terregles (1512? \u2013 20 January 1583) was a Scottish nobleman and supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots.\nBiography\nMaxwell was the second son of Robert, fifth lord Maxwell, by Janet Douglas, daughter of Sir William Douglas of Drumlanrig, Dumfriesshire. He was born about 1512, and was educated at Sweetheart Abbey, Kirkcudbrightshire. As tutor to his nephews, and presumptive heir to them and his brother, he was for some time known as the Master of Maxwell. While his father and brother were prisoners in England in 1545, he with great valour held Lochmaben Castle, and refused to deliver it up. In 1547 he married Agnes Herries, eldest daughter and coheiress with her two sisters of William, third lord Herries. To win her hand he had to enter into complicated intrigues against her guardian, the Earl of Arran, who designed to marry her to his son, Lord John Hamilton. Although related to her within the prohibited degrees, he neglected to obtain a papal dispensation for the marriage, but on 26 May 1555 an absolution and grace of dispensation was granted him.\nOn 20 March 1551-2 the Master of Maxwell was appointed to succeed his brother Robert, sixth lord Maxwell, as warden of the west marches; but on 29 August 1553 resigned the office on the ground that he had come under deadly feud with various clans of the marches. It was therefore transferred to his uncle, James Douglas of Drumlanrig. In 1559 the master was committed by the queen regent to the castle of Edinburgh for declaring that he would to the uttermost of his power 'assist the preachers and the congregation' (Knox, i. 319), but on 1 August he made his escape. On the 15 August, John Knox advised Cecil to comfort him with \"favourable writings\", as his assistance would be invaluable to their cause. From this time Maxwell gave strenuous support to the reformed party. He was one of the commission who signed the treaty with Elizabeth at Berwick, 7 February 1560; he signed the band of 20 April following to defend the liberty of the Evangel, and for the expulsion of the French from Scotland;  and on 27 January 1560-1 he subscribed the Book of Discipline.\nAfter the return of Queen Mary to Scotland, Maxwell on 4 September 1561 was reappointed warden of the west marches (Reg. P. C. Scotl. i. 157). Henceforth his attitude towards the reformed party was uncertain; for while he continued nominally a Protestant, his political sympathies, like those of Secretary Maitland, were with the queen. He had been on terms of special friendship with Knox, who never lost respect for him, and refers to him as 'a man stout and wittie' (Works, i. 459), and as of 'great judgment and experience' (ib. ii. 351); but on account of a letter written by Knox in October 1563 in reference to the mass, the master gave Knox 'a discharge of the familiarity which before was great betwixt them' (ib. p.\u00a0399). Still the master did not break with James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray even when he rose in rebellion at the time of the Darnley marriage in 1565, and endeavoured to prevent the queen going to extremities against him. When Moray retreated westwards from Edinburgh, the master had an interview with him at Hamilton, after which he endeavoured without success to mediate an arrangement with the queen. On Moray passing southwards into Dumfries he entertained him in his house (ib. p.\u00a0512); but when the queen expressed her determination to revenge herself on Moray, he declined to arrest him and advised him to pass into England. The queen on Moray's retirement committed to the master the charge of guarding the borders, and returned to Edinburgh (Herries, Memoirs, p.\u00a072). On 1 January 1565-6 an act was also passed absolving him from all charges of treason that had been made against him (Reg. P. C. Scotl. i. 415). On the queen's escape from Holyrood Palace, after the murder of David Rizzio, the master joined her with a strong force at Dunbar, and henceforth may be reckoned one of her staunchest supporters.\nAt the end of 1566 he became Lord Herries. Sir James Balfour states that he was created Lord Herries at the baptism of Prince James, 17 December; but according to a decision of the House of Lords, 23 June 1858, no new peerage was created in his person, and he was merely called to the peerage in right of his wife. He also acquired from his wife's sisters their share in their father's estates, and on 8 May 1566 a charter of Terregles was granted to him and his wife and their heirs, and failing these to his heirs male. The charter was confirmed by parliament on 19 April 1567.\nHerries was one of the assize who acquitted James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell of the murder of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and excused himself for doing so merely on the ground that in the indictment the murder was stated wrongly to have been done on the 9th instead of on the morning of the 10th February. He was, however, rather an enemy than a friend of",
    "1973 studio album by The Hollies\nOut on the Road is the 13th album by the British band The Hollies and the second to feature Mikael Rickfors as lead singer. The song \"Slow Down Go Down\" was released as a single in Australia and became a Top 100 hit (No. 73). By the time the album was released in some European countries (Germany, Spain), the original singer Allan Clarke had returned to the band and the album was therefore not released in the UK and US. For this reason it is sometimes not listed in the official discography.  \nOverview\nThe album was a follow-up to the successful Romany LP, which The Hollies had released with Mikael Rickfors in 1972. According to the recollections of drummer Bobby Elliott, the album was inspired by the band's frequent tours to the United States, where the Hollies' previous singles such as \"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\", \"Long Dark Road\" and \"Magic Woman Touch\" had a much greater impact than in the UK. All songs were written by members of the band (Kenny Lynch and Dean Ford also co-wrote some of them). LP was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, with the band's long time producer Ron Richards and Peter Bown as the engineer of sound. In the spring of 1973, the album was announced in The Hollies Official Fan Club Newsletter and Bobby Elliott wrote short notes on each track but the album was later released only on Hansa Records in Germany and Ariola in Spain. The gatefold cover art of the LP, created by Colin Elgie of the Hipgnosis art team, was later reworked again for the cover of the Hollies' LP Another Night.\nOut on the Road was not available in the UK until the release of the compilation CD box set \"The Hollies \u2013 Changin' Times\" in 2015. The only other country to re-release the album on CD was France (in 2006 on the Magic Records label). After the cancellation of the project and the return of lead singer Allan Clarke, the band re-recorded some of the songs for their next album, simply titled Hollies (\"Transatlantic Westbound Jet\", \"Out on the Road\"). The song \"Pick up the Pieces Again\" was used in the same version because Terry Sylvester sang the lead vocals and the track \"I Was Born a Man\" (sang by guitarist Tony Hicks) was released as the B side of the comeback single with Allan Clarke \"The Day That Curly Billy Shot Down Crazy Sam McGee\".\nReception\nIn his AllMusic retrospective review of the release, Bruce Eder wrote, \"The requisite Hollies harmonies are present as well on most of the material, and the body of songs is mostly very good - and mostly as distinctive as their other album cuts of this era.\"\nTrack listing\n(*) Dean Ford was not credited on the original album cover.\nPersonnel\nThe Hollies\nMikael Rickfors \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, harmonica\nTony Hicks \u2013 lead guitar, banjo, electric sitar, backing vocals\nTerry Sylvester \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nBernie Calvert \u2013 bass guitar, keyboards\nBobby Elliott \u2013 drums and percussion\n",

    "Daily newspaper from Peru\nDiario Expreso is a daily newspaper with national circulation in Peru. Founded in 1961, it is among the newspapers with the highest circulation in Peru.\nHistory\nIt was founded on October 24, 1961, by Manuel Mujica Gallo\u00a0, a wealthy owner linked to the banking and insurance business. For this purpose, the company Period\u00edstica Per\u00fa S. A. was established. In this first stage, its editors were Manuel Jes\u00fas Orbegoso, Ra\u00fal Villar\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Encinas de Pando, among others.\nIn 1965, it was acquired by Manuel Ulloa El\u00edas, who founded Editora Nacional S. A. The same company published the evening newspaper Extra\u00a0. In this new stage, Efra\u00edn Ruiz Caro\u00a0 and Guillermo Cortez N\u00fa\u00f1ez were editors-in-chief. Among his collaborators were Ciro Alegr\u00eda, Carlos Cueto Fernandini\u00a0, Manuel Mujica Gallo and Mario Vargas Llosa. A Sunday supplement entitled Estampas was also published; and as a contribution to education, the supplement El Escolar.\nWith the rise of a military government in 1968, difficulties began. On October 31 of that year, Expreso and Extra were closed by order of the regime of General Juan Velasco Alvarado. However, a protest by the Federation of Journalists of Peru forced the Government to allow the newspapers to reopen.\nOn January 2, 1970, Manuel Ulloa resigned as president of the board of directors of Editora Nacional S. A. because a Government decree prevented those who resided outside the country for more than six months from exercising such function. Ulloa, who had been an important minister of the overthrown Belaundista government, chose not to return to Peru after considering that a political persecution had been unleashed against him.\nOn March 4, 1970, Expreso and Extra were practically expropriated by the military government, with the excuse of handing over their administration to their own employees and workers, organized in cooperatives. However, people outside the newspapers took control of them. In this stage of expropriation, the following served as directors of Expreso: Alberto Ruiz Eldredge\u00a0, Leopoldo Chiappo\u00a0 and Juan Jos\u00e9 Vega\u00a0, all appointed by the government. Some time later, Velasco explained that he had given the newspapers to the communists to serve as \"mastiffs\" (prey dogs) in his \"fight against the oligarchy.\"\nAfter the revolutionary government ended on July 28, 1980, Expreso and Extra returned to their owners, and Manuel Ulloa took over again as president of the board of Editora Nacional S. A. The first director of Expreso, in this new stage, was Guillermo Cortez N\u00fa\u00f1ez (1980\u20131988), who was succeeded by Manuel D'Ornellas (1988\u20131998). It then had a prestigious team of journalists, among which Jaime de Althaus\u00a0, Jorge Morelli, Uri Ben Schmuel and Patricio Ricketts stood out.\nDuring the government of Alberto Fujimori (1990\u20132000), the newspaper's directors were committed to selling their editorial line to the interests of the regime. After the fall of Fujimori, the imprisonment of the newspaper's director, Eduardo Calmell del Solar\u00a0, was ordered, accused of having received, together with Vicente Silva Checa (director of Cable Canal de Noticias\u00a0), more than US$ 3,000,000 from presidential advisor Vladimiro Montesinos.\nIn 2002, a new organization came into operation under the direction of Luis Garc\u00eda Mir\u00f3, whose objective was to recover the prestige of the newspaper. Since 2024, the director is Antonio Ram\u00edrez Pando.\nSee also\nEl Comercio Group\n",
    "\nFrench criminal and escapee\nMohamed Amra (born 10 March 1994), also known as \"The Fly\" (French: La Mouche), is a French criminal. He has been indicted for several crimes, including kidnapping that resulted in death. French police suspect that Amra is a drug lord involved in international drug trafficking and has links to \"The Blacks\", a powerful gang in Marseille.\nIn May 2024, he escaped from a prison van during an armed ambush that killed two prison officers, and has not been apprehended.\nEarly life\nAmra was born on 10 March 1994 in Rouen, the capital of Normandy. He grew up in the Sandpit council estate of the city.\nCriminal career\nAmra grew up in a troubled environment, and ended up engaging in criminal activities. According to prosecutors, he committed his first crimes between the ages of 11 and 14, which ranged from theft to extortion and violence. Amra was first convicted of a crime in October 2009, at the age of 15.\nSince then, he has garnered 13 convictions for robbery, extortion, criminal conspiracy, armed violence, and other crimes. In January 2022, he was jailed in \u00c9vreux prison to serve several sentences for these convictions. Police and prosecutors have suspected Amra of heading a narcotics network and holding significant links to organized crime groups in Marseille, however none of his convictions are drug-related. He is not considered radicalized or suspected of terrorism by law enforcement.\nAmong his convictions are an attempted murder charge. In 2022, he was indicted for involvement in a gang-related kidnapping that resulted in death in Marseille. Amra has been described by Reuters as a \"mid-level\" player in the drug trade in France, while French media linked him to powerful Marseille-based crime syndicate \"The Blacks\". French news agency Le Monde has described him in the \"middle-of-the-pack of the gangster hierarchy\". According to police, Amra has been involved in the international drug trade. However, his lawyer, Hugues Vivier, has disputed these accusations.\nOn 14 April 2020, he was sentenced to three months in prison by the Evreux Correctional Court for \"motorized rodeos\u00a0\". Two years later, on 5 January, he was sentenced to three years for several crimes, including extortion, gang theft, and burglary.\nOn 7 May 2024, Amra was detained at the Val de Reuil prison after he was found guilty for burglary and given a prison sentence of 18 months. The burglaries, which occurred in 2019, consisted of Amra breaking into supermarkets and restaurants and stealing around 200 bottles of alcoholic beverages and around \u20ac7,500 in cash. He is suspected of using Signal, an encrypted messaging app, to organize kidnappings and extortions through his cell. He required high security during transfers despite not being seen as a high-risk inmate, with his escorts initially consisting of three guards but later being increased to five. Amra attempted to escape detention by sawing through his prison cell's bars and using tape to conceal it, but was caught by guards and placed in solitary confinement as a result.\nEscape\nLocation of the ambush\n100m110yds\n\u2002\u2002Incarville toll booth\nOn 14 May 2024, Amra was being transported to \u00c9vreux prison following a court hearing in Rouen. At 10:57\u00a0a.m, the convoy was ambushed at the Incarville tollbooth on the A154 freeway, 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) southeast of Rouen. CCTV footage showed a black Peugeot 5008, which had earlier been reported stolen, ram a white prison van head-on while it passed through the tollbooth. Another prison vehicle which followed the van got stuck. Two men then exited the Peugeot, while two other men exited a white Audi A5 which had been following the convoy. The men, masked with balaclavas and wearing black sports apparel, began to open fire at the convoy with automatic rifles. Between 30 and 40 shots were fired at the guards, who were armed with SIG Sauer handguns. The ambush lasted for at least two minutes, before the gunmen fled with Amra in the Audi and a BMW 5 Series vehicle, which were later burned at other locations.\nTwo prison officers were killed in the shooting, while three others were seriously wounded, including one in critical condition. The incident was the first time French prison officers were killed on duty since 1992. One of the officers killed was described by Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau as a \"captain in the prison service\". One of the gunmen fired a double tap shot into a victim's head to confirm their death.\nVivier told BFM TV that he was shocked about the jailbreak, and saw Amra as \"perfectly normal\". Vivier said that he would like to believe that Amra did not plan the escape as it did not match what he knew of him.\nRight-wing politicians said that the incident showed that the centrist French government could not control drug crime and compared France to other nations with rampant gang violence. Centre-right opposition leader Bruno Retailleau said, \"We're on a path to Mexicanisation,\" while far-right Marion Marechal offered condolence",
    "2024 studio album by Like Moths to Flames\nThe Cycles of Trying to Cope is the sixth studio album by American metalcore band Like Moths to Flames. It was released on May 10, 2024, through UNFD. The album was produced by Carson Slovak and Grant McFarland. It is the band's first album to feature drummer Roman Garcia and guitarist Cody Cavanaugh.\nBackground and promotion\nOn February 7, 2024, the band released two new singles \"Paradigm Trigger\" and \"Angels Weep\" with a corresponding music video for \"Paradigm Trigger\". On March 7, the band unveiled the third single \"Kintsugi\" along with a music video. At the same time, they announced the album itself and the release date, while also revealing the album cover and the track list. On April 11, the band premiered the fourth single \"Dissociative Being\".\nCritical reception\nThe album received positive reviews from critics. Anne Erickson from Blabbermouth.net gave the album 8 out of 10 and said: \"Like Moths to Flames are absolutely triumphant on The Cycles of Trying to Cope, and it should be well-received by new and old fans alike. Next time around, it would be nice to see this band dip into more experimentation, as they certainly have the talent to branch out. But, for now, The Cycles of Trying to Cope is more than worthy of repeat listens.\" Katie Bird of Distorted Sound scored the album 8 out of 10 and said: \"Overall, The Cycles of Trying to Cope is cohesive, fun to listen to, and accessible to new fans. Whilst it isn't perfect, as some of the songs in the middle suffer from production issues, the rest of the album is a masterclass in how to balance two genres at once. By scattering elements of electronica throughout the first three songs, for example, it does not feel out of place for the fourth song to have a heavy electronic metal sound. By doing this throughout the album, the band make sure that the genre changes do not sound sudden. The instruments and vocals throughout are fantastic, and the pacing is \u2013 mostly \u2013 cohesive, and all told this makes for a brilliant addition to the band's discography.\"\nNew Transcendence praised the album saying, \"I was astounded, and continue to be astounded at The Cycles of Trying to Cope. A record I expected to enjoy I've ended up loving, and while there may be one or two songs that fall just flat of the heights set by \"Kintsugi\", \"Gone Without a Trace\" and \"What Do We See When We Leave This Place?\" They are by no means slouches. Like Moths to Flames' sixth full-length record is their finest, and a contender for one of 2024's apex metalcore records with precious little in the way of tangible flaws. It remains to be seen how Like Moths to Flames come to terms with trying to cope, but I can only hope they have cycles of churning out more records like this long into the future.\" Samantha Andujar from Spill gave the album almost a perfect score 4.5/5 and saying: \"The Cycles of Trying to Cope addresses these issues by bringing together these complex emotions and various musical threads to create not just one of their finest records to date, but also a fantastic concept album.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Chris Roetter, Cody Cavanaugh, Roman Garcia, and Zach Pishney.\nPersonnel\nLike Moths to Flames\nChris Roetter \u2013 lead vocals\nZach Pishney \u2013 lead guitar\nCody Cavanaugh \u2013 rhythm guitar\nRoman Garcia \u2013 drums, percussion\nAdditional personnel\nCarson Slovak \u2013 production, mixing, mastering\nGrant McFarland \u2013 production, mixing, mastering\n",
    "Spanish footballer manager and sports leader\nJos\u00e9 Rosich Rubiera (14 February 1884 \u2013 23 September 1960) was a Spanish sports leader who presided over the Catalan Football Federation in two stages (1919\u201320 and 1926\u201329) and also a football Manager who co-directed one match of the Spanish national team in 1924. In the 1920s he was also treasurer of the Spanish football federation and part of the board of directors of FC Barcelona in 1923\u201324. He was the brother of the sports leader in the field of swimming, Joaquim Rosich Rubiera.\nBiography\nBorn on 14 February 1884 in Barcelona, Catalonia, Rosich presided over the Catalan Football Federation between 1919 and 1920, and again between 1926 and 1929, being its representative in the Spanish federation in the 1930s. On 22 January 1929, the assembly of the Catalan Federation, which was chaired by Rosich, met and agreed to request to the Spanish Federation that, on the occasion of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, the Spain v England football match and the FIFA Congress would also be held in Barcelona; they only achieved the latter. The Congress was naturally attended by a Spanish delegation, which was formed by Rosich, Juli\u00e1n Olave, and Ricardo Cabot, and its most important point was the discussion of the regulations of the upcoming inaugural FIFA World Cup, and Spain was the first to withdraw its candidacy to donate support to Montevideo, the \"most Spanish city among all the Spanish capitals of South America\".\nIn the 1920s, Rosich was also treasurer of the Spanish football federation and, as a member of its national committee, a triumvirate made up of himself, Olave, and Luis Colina, he provisionally served as national coach in a match against Austria held at the Camp de Les Corts on 21 December 1924, which ended in a 2\u20131 victory thanks to goals from Antonio Juantegui and Josep Samitier.\nRosich was also part of the board of directors of FC Barcelona in 1923\u201324, under the presidency of Enric Cardona.\nIn 1932, Rosich was one of the effective patron members of gas employer entities.\nDeath\nRosich died on 23 September 1960, at the age of 76.\n",
    "Professional esports league\nThe Overwatch Champions Series (OWCS) is a global competitive esports tournament series for the video game Overwatch 2, owned by Blizzard Entertainment. The circuit is divided into three regions: North America, EMEA, and Asia. The North America and EMEA regions are operated by ESL FaceIt Group, while Asia is by operated by Korean esports tournament organizer WDG.\nHistory\nOverwatch initially showed promise for an esports scene during its beta phase in 2015, attracting teams from around the world to compete upon its full release. While an open ecosystem for its esport was quickly established, its publisher Activision Blizzard elected to create the Overwatch League, a franchised league akin to that of North America's NBA, with slots being sold for a reported US$20\u00a0million for its inaugural season in 2018. The league faced challenges early on, including a slow start in its inaugural years and logistical issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Additionally, the announcement of Overwatch 2 in 2019 brought about changes to the game's format and gameplay, which received a lukewarm response upon release in 2022. These challenges, coupled with controversies such as the sexual harassment lawsuit in 2021, led to mounting pressure from teams to exit the league. Months before Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, teams were offered the chance to leave the Overwatch League, ultimately leading to its closure in January 2024.\nThe Overwatch Champions series (OWCS) was established in January 2024 following the folding of Overwatch League. Unlike the previous approach of independently managing the league, Blizzard Entertainment opted for partnerships to oversee specific regions, with ESL FaceIt Group operating the North America and EMEA regions, while WDG was selected to operate the Asia region. The Overwatch Champions Series adopted an open format, departing from the franchise structure of the Overwatch League. This transition opened up opportunities for both established organizations and new entrants, with teams like ENCE and Team Falcons joining the series alongside well-established teams such as Fnatic and TSM. Former Overwatch League teams such as the Toronto Defiant and San Francisco Shock (playing under the name NRG Shock) also remained active after the closure of the Overwatch League, competing with a new roster in the OWCS. Early concerns for OWCS included the lack of well-defined prize pools, the lack of a clear roadmap, and challenges in maintaining consistent viewership, compared to that of the Overwatch League.\n2024 season\nFormat\nA match in the WDG Esports Studio for the Asia region\nThe OWCS follows an open tournament format, allowing any team to compete in open qualifiers that lead into regional and international tournaments. The OWCS is divided into three regions: North America (NA); Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa (EMEA); and Asia. Both North America and EMEA follow the same format structure, with Asia following a different structure due to its size. The 2024 season has two international events: the Dallas Major, which will take place in June 2024, and the Stockholm Finals, which takes place at the end of the season.\nThe Asia region has two competitive stages and is further divided into three subregions: South Korea, Japan, and Pacific. Stage 1 begins with each subregion hosting its respective Open Qualifiers, which then feed into Regional Tournaments. From there, the top teams from each region advance to the OWCS Asia Championship, an eight-team event held at the WDG Esports Studio. Qualification from this championship secures slots in the Dallas Major at DreamHack. Stage 2 mirrors Stage 1's format, with top performers advancing to the Stockholm Finals.\nFor North America and EMEA, the OWCS consists of four stages. Each stage comprises three phases: Swiss, Groups, and the Main Event. The Swiss phase accommodates up to 512 teams, with the top 16 proceeding to the Group stage. From there, teams compete in groups of four, with the top two from each group advancing to the Main Event \u2013 an eight-team, double-elimination tournament. Circuit points are awarded to top finishers in the Main Event, determining qualification for international tournaments. Stages 1 and 2 lead into the Dallas Major, while Stages 3 and 4 lead into the Stockholm Finals.\nBroadcast\nFor the 2024 season, OWCS matches are broadcast across various platforms. In North America and Europe, matches are broadcast on YouTube and Twitch. In Asia, the broadcast is available on platforms such as YouTube, CHZZK, AfreecaTV (Korean), and Twitch (WDG and PlayOverwatchJP for Japanese audiences). Viewers can earn exclusive in-game rewards, such as OWCS-themed cosmetics, through Twitch Drops during official match streams.\n",
    "Military unit\nThe Parsons Mounted Cavalry (PMC) is a cavalry unit of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets which serves as the only mounted ROTC cavalry unit in the country. This horse combat unit consists of cavalry, artillery and quartermaster elements. The unit represents Texas A&M University at football games, parades, agricultural, and equestrian events throughout Texas. There are 90 junior and senior cadets and 50 horses in this unit.\nHistory\nBackground\nPMC traces its origins to the early years of Texas A&M when mounted drill training was a fundamental part of military education. However, this practice ceased in 1943 with the disbandment of the United States Cavalry Branch by the United States Army. The initiative to revive the cavalry tradition was revived at A&M by the junior Class of 1974, in the spring of 1973. That semester, three cadets, Michael Collins, Darrell Williams, and Douglas Latimer, proposed reviving mounted drill training to then Commandant of Cadets. Colonel Thomas R. Parsons. The unit was named after Parsons, who was the only active-duty Commandant at Texas A&M. The unit made its debut in the Corps' march-in at the Wichita State football game in September 1973. Collins served as the unit's first Commanding Officer, with Williams as the Executive Officer and Latimer as a Platoon Leader. By the 1981\u20131982 academic year, PMC proudly welcomed its first female member.\nIt has worked with horsemen of the 1st Cavalry Division.\nOrganization\nThe command of the company consists of the following individuals:\nCommanding Officer\nExecutive Officer\nFirst Sergeant\nStaff Officers\nArtillery Officer\nMuleskinner\nAdministration Officer\nOperations and Logistics Officer\nTraining Officer\nPisshead (\"Sophomore\") Training Officer\nPublic Relations\nSupply Officer\nGame Day Officer\nStablemaster\nLeather Officer\nVeterinary Officer\nThe unit is broken into three of the following basic units:\n1st Platoon\n2nd Platoon\nHalf-Section\nEach platoon is further subdivided into two squads.\nStables\nIn 1979, it relocated from the Research Annex to a new facility adjacent to Texas A&M University's Vet School, which in 1981, was named \"Fiddler\u2019s Green.\" The name pays homage to a poignant poem embraced by U.S. Army cavalry formations in the late 1800s, which portrayed an idyllic paradise. In 2014, a substantial expansion initiative nearly doubled the original 26-acre space, elevating the total acreage to an impressive 50 acres.\nSpirit of '02\nThe Half Section (responsible for Field Artillery and Mule Team elements) maintains the \"Spirit of '02\", a field gun found in the fall of 1974 at a Aggie Bonfire cut site near Easterwood Airport. The cannon is driven by a 4 horse team and a restored caisson to Kyle Field and fired during all home football games, midnight yell practice, and other special events. While Aggie lore states the gun was the runaway that tumbled over a ridge in the film We've Never Been Licked, there is no conclusive evidence. It is affectionately known as \"The Spirit of \u201802,\" in honor of its 1902 origins.\nAssociation\nThe PMC Association is a non-profit organization designed to support those in PMC.\nSee also\n3rd Infantry Regiment\nNational Lancers\nTexas Military Forces\nNotes\nPMC Association\n",
    "American serial killer\nFor other people with the name Tracy Walker, see Tracy Walker.\nTracy Walker (born 1964) is an American serial killer who murdered three homeless people in Rancho Dominguez, California from 2020 to 2021. Having previously been incarcerated for a 1991 voluntary manslaughter conviction, Walker later pleaded guilty to the murders and was sentenced to life imprisonment.\nEarly life\nVery little is known about Walker's early life. Born in 1964 in Mississippi, he grew up in an impoverished household with his mother, who frequently cohabited with various men and gave birth to seven other boys from different fathers. Unable to afford tuition, Walker dropped out of school in the late 1970s and began working in manual labor, often changing jobs.\nIn 1985, he left his home state and moved to Los Angeles, where he found a job, got married, and settled in his own house. At that time, he was well regarded by friends and neighbors, had no history of drug or alcohol abuse, and had never been convicted of any crimes.\nVoluntary manslaughter\nBy 1991, Walker was working as a security guard at a bus depot on 77th Street when, in the early morning hours of December 7, he got into a dispute with a fellow guard, which resulted in him shooting and killing the 34-year-old man with a revolver, a crime witnessed by multiple bystanders. Immediately after committing the killing, Walker attempted to flee in a school bus, managing to drive several blocks away from the crime scene, but was soon stopped by police officers on San Pedro Street. Refusing to comply with their demands, Walker attempted to open fire on them, but officers drew their weapons and fired on him, striking him seven times. Walker was rushed to the Martin Luther King Jr. Outpatient Center for treatment, where, despite the severity of his injuries, he eventually recovered and was put on trial in 1993. During the investigation into the crime, his defense attorney was able to have the charges reclassified from first-degree murder to voluntary manslaughter. Walker eventually pleaded guilty to this charge and was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment.\nWhile serving his sentence, Walker's mental state deteriorated dramatically. He was diagnosed with a variety of conditions over the years, including schizophrenia and PTSD, brought on by the 1991 shootout. In the late 1990s, he was declared mentally unstable and transferred to a mental institution, where he was treated for several months. In 2001, Walker's condition improved; as a result, he was declared to no longer be a danger to the community and released.\nVagrancy\nSoon after his release, he returned to Los Angeles, where he lived as a vagrant for the next two decades. During this period, he changed residences frequently, slept in homeless shelters or on the streets, and was forced to work in manual labor due to his lack of education. At different times, he is known to have worked as a cleaner, security guard, or laborer. He had no relations with his relatives or ex-wife, who divorced him in the mid-1990s after his conviction and moved out-of-state.\nAs he spent a lot of time among fellow vagrants, Walker often got into conflicts, as a result of which he carried a knife with him at all times. In 2011, he was arrested on a charge of unlawful possession of edged weaponry, to which he pleaded guilty and was placed on three years probation. During the mid-2010s, Walker lived in the notorious Skid Row neighborhood, known for housing some of the biggest homeless populations in the country.\nIn the late 2010s, Walker moved to an isolated section of land near the Compton Creek, where he soon gained a reputation as a loner who preferred not to be disturbed by others. Soon after the move, he began committing murders.\nMurders\nPatricia Loeza\nWalker's first known victim was 26-year-old Patricia Loeza, who was stabbed to death eight times in June 2020, with her body being found on June 7 on South Susanna Road. The youngest of four siblings, Loeza was raised in South Los Angeles after her father was deported to Mexico in 2003. As a high school student, she began abusing drugs, ran away from home, and began to live as a vagrant. During this period, she lived with a group of fellow homeless people on the streets of Los Angeles, gave birth to a son from an unknown father, and was arrested several times, spending time in the county jail. She had no contact with family members between 2016 and 2019.\nWhile investigating the Loeza murder, law enforcement found two receipts and a Minute Maid carton near her body. They determined that the receipts originated from a Numero Uno Market store in Compton, while the juice was from a Vons in Long Beach. While reviewing surveillance footage from the Vons store, they noticed Tracy Walker buying the juice with an EBT card, after which they interviewed homeless people living near where the body of the murdered woman was found. They identified the man as a vagrant they knew by the nickname \"Solo,\"",
    "1959 painting by Grandma Moses\nGreat Fire (The Burning of Troy in 1862) is a 1959 oil painting by the American outsider painter Grandma Moses, produced at age 99 and signed \"Moses\".\nIt has been in the collection of the Bennington Museum since 2024.\nIt shows the artist's impression of the covered bridge of Troy, New York, from the western Green Island entry point on 10 May 1862, looking east at the moment that a spark from a locomotive set the bridge over the Hudson River on fire. To the right is a peaceful scene of Troy that mostly burned later that evening, thanks to the westerly wind pushing the flames towards the center of town. The fire was a major disaster for the town that had recently become a major hub for traffic on the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad line going east across the Hudson as well as steamships travelling north and south along the Hudson. Grandma Moses was born two years before it happened, but in a town bordering the Hudson river further upstate in Greenwich, N.Y. She would have heard the stories of river folk, locals and family members about the devastation caused by it. \nDetail of 1881 bird's eye view of Troy, with the rebuilt Green Island Bridge (portion from Centre Island to Troy was still covered with a wooden shed until a new bridge was built in 1884)\nPhoto of the burnt district surrounding Union Station in Troy, looking west towards the river, with upper right the remaining part of the Green Island Bridge connecting Green Island to Centre Island\nRegular memorials were held for the Great Fire of Troy on anniversary days, such as in 2012 for the 150th year. In 1937, the 75th anniversary had been commemorated with various activities, and a news article printed in 1939 with a dramatic oval graphic illustrating the bridge on fire caught the eye of the artist, who cut the clipping and marked it up for her use in a rectangular painting. Her first version based on the print was included in her first solo exhibition in 1940 at the Galerie St. Etienne in NYC. She then made two more versions in 1941 that expanded the scene to include the soon-to-be-burned Troy side of the river. These must have been well-received, because she made two more versions in 1942 and 1943 that included more of the town. This 1959 painting is the last known version. None are the same, but all six contain the same central burning bridge idea.\nSee also\nGalerie St. Etienne\n",
    "American oyster farm\n\"Saltaire Oyster\" can from Adams Oyster Company, c. 1940s\nAdams Oyster Company was an oyster farm and seafood cannery business headquartered in Suffolk, Virginia, and by the 1950s was one of the largest oyster farm businesses in Virginia. The company held over 300 acres of oyster farms in the Nansemond River, Battens Bay, Bleakhorn Creek, Chuckatuck Creek, Cooper Creek, and the James River.\nHistory\nBy 1870, oystermen had planted themselves and their families on the peninsula between Chuckatuck Creek and the Nansemond River and drew a livelihood from the water. Members of the Adams family were oysterman in the area by the late 1880s. The Nansemond River was one of the richest oyster grounds in the Chesapeake Bay, and seafood businesses in Suffolk were shipping approximately 75,000 bushels of oysters a year by 1900.\nIn the 1920s, Charles Gray Adams I established an oyster company and oyster shucking house on the Hobson side of Chuckatuck Creek. Adams operated a fleet of over 30 boats out of the creek. Adams died in 1938.\nThe Adams Oyster Company was formally established in the 1940s by Adams' son, Captain Charles Gray \"Charlie\" Adams II and later became a partnership with Carl Bagnell when they merged the holdings with the Nansemond Fish and Oyster Company. The Adams Oysters Company sold oysters at local markets in Norfolk and shipped them to locations throughout the U.S. East Coast. The company also canned and sold a packaged oyster product called \"Saltaire Oysters\" and operated a steamed crab business near the Chuckatuck Creek location.\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, the \"Saltaire Oysters\" brand could be found in Kroger supermarkets, Fass Brothers, or Ballards. The company also sold directly to Colonial Stores and Campbell Soup Company for their canned oyster stew product, and was a certified interstate shellfish dealer. Charles Adams III worked for the company during this period, before being deployed to serve a tour of duty in the Vietnam War. In March 1968, Charles Adams III and three other watermen drowned when the oyster boat Klondike capsized with all four men on board.\nThe business activity had slowed by the end of the 1970s due to the decline of the oyster population and the Army Corps of Engineers construction of a dam on Carter's Clove Creek, which closed Hobson's direct outlet to Chuckatuck Creek and the James River. From the 1980s to the 2010s, the business remained registered as an active oyster farm with the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.\n",

    "2nd century BCE wall\nTower of David and remains of the first wall\nThe First Wall (also called The Old Wall) is one of three strong and fortified walls that were built for the defense of Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period. This wall was built during the Hasmonean period, but its foundations are older and were laid already in the First Temple period. During the time of the Return to Zion, the wall was rebuilt by Nehemiah, and in the days of the Hasmoneans, it was strengthened and even additional parts of it were built. The additional walls are the Second Wall - built during the days of the Hasmonean rulers John Hyrcanus or Alexander Jannaeus, and the Third Wall - construction began in the days of Agrippa I, and its construction was completed on the eve of the Great Revolt.\nBackground\nThroughout the entire Hellenistic period, the boundaries of the city hardly changed since the days of the Return to Zion. The Second Temple was located in the same place where it was initially in the days of the First Temple, and the city - the City of David - was to its south. In the 2nd century BCE, during the reign of the Hasmoneans, the city began to significantly expand towards the western hill, where the Hasmonean palace was built. The area was characterized by luxurious architectural style, and its inhabitants included the wealthy and respected. The new area, which with its expansion and establishment to the west, began to expand also to the north, was called \"the Upper City\" and around it a new wall was built, \"the First Wall,\" which actually enclosed the Lower City together with the Upper City. Both essentially constituted the main part of Jerusalem. Due to the city's location near the Kidron Valley to the east and the Valley of Hinnom to the south, which served as \"natural barriers\" for topographical reasons, the city was later expanded only towards the west and the north, while the eastern and southern boundaries remained unchanged.\nThe course of the wall\nWithin the first wall's boundaries included the City of David and Mount Zion, whereas most of the areas that are today within the boundaries of the Ottoman wall of Jerusalem were outside the first wall. The wall began in the area of the citadel (Tower of David) from there the wall descended along the southern ridge line of Mount Zion on a rocky cliff towards the Pool of Siloam, in the southern section of the wall the Essenes Gate was established which led to the desert. From there, the wall turned east and north on the eastern slope of the City of David, in a line parallel to the Kidron Valley. The wall passed through the Ophel area, and connected to the wall of the Temple Mount slightly north to the southwest corner, to allow entry to the Temple Mount from the east. The area of connection of the first wall to the Temple Mount wall is called \"the seam\" due to the meeting of two building styles. The northern part of the wall started from the Tower of David eastward to the Temple Mount parallel to the Tyropoeon Valley (David Street and Chain Street). In the northern wall were established several gates, among them \"the Hidden Gate\" and \"Garden Gate\". Above the remains of the first wall and more or less in the same course, about 400 years later, in the Byzantine period, a new wall was built by Empress Eudocia. The fact that two walls were built 400 years apart in the same course without their builders knowing about each other, proves that the topographic location of the first wall is the most correct for defending the city.\nAdditional fortifications along the wall\nIn the fortress area where the first wall begins, Herod strengthened the wall, Phasael Tower, and Tower of David, and built the Hippicus Tower ('Tower of David'). The section south of the fortress, where the wall was built on rock to protect the western part of the Upper City, was also fortified, and nearby, the palace was built. The wall served as a supporting wall of the structure, and an adjacent front wall was added with a thickness of up to 3.5 meters. This wall later served as the foundation for the Ottoman wall (remnants that exist to our days).\nRemnants of the first wall existing today\nToday, there are clear remnants of the First Wall in these places:\nIn the area of the citadel, which is called today \"Tower of David\"\nIn the Mamilla area, west of the current wall, there are remnants of Hasmonean fortifications.\nIn the Jewish Quarter, close to the Israelite Tower and remnants of a gate which is probably \"Gennath Gate\".\nAt the base of the eastern wall of the Temple Mount.\nOn the southern slopes of Mount Zion.\n",
    "2024 live album by Alice Coltrane\nThe Carnegie Hall Concert is a live album by Alice Coltrane. It was recorded at Carnegie Hall in New York City on February 21, 1971, and was released in 2024 by Impulse! Records. On the album, Coltrane appears on piano and harp, and is joined by saxophonists Pharoah Sanders and Archie Shepp, double bassists Jimmy Garrison and Cecil McBee, and drummers Ed Blackwell and Clifford Jarvis.\nThe album was recorded at a benefit for Swami Satchidanda's Integral Yoga Institute that also featured Laura Nyro and The New Rascals. A concert reviewer for Billboard described Coltrane's band as \"one of the greatest assemblages to appear on the Carnegie Hall stage.\"\nThe recording features two compositions by Alice Coltrane, \"Journey in Satchidananda\" and \"Shiva-Loka,\" both of which appeared on her album Journey in Satchidananda (Impulse!, 1971), plus two pieces by her late husband, John Coltrane: \"Africa,\" first heard on the 1961 album Africa/Brass, and \"Leo,\" versions of which previously appeared on the Impulse! albums Infinity (1972), Live in Japan (1973), Interstellar Space (1974), The Mastery of John Coltrane, Vol. 3: Jupiter Variation (1978), and Offering: Live at Temple University (2014). This performance of \"Africa\" was originally issued on Carnegie Hall '71 (Hi Hat, 2018).\nReception\nJon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the concert \"gathered force like a typhoon,\" noting the contrast between the \"serene opening\" and the \"squall of free jazz\" with which it concludes.\nDownBeat's John Ephland called the album \"a marvelous transition for Coltrane,\" and stated: \"Bandmates sound very much in sync... In 1971, this music may have been of its time, but today, more than half a century later, it sounds like a clarion call for something worth listening to and playing as the New New Thing.\"\nIn a review for The New Yorker, Richard Brody described Coltrane's solo on \"Leo\" as \"the most thrilling single concentration of her art that I've ever heard,\" and wrote: \"after intense duos by Sanders and Shepp on tenor sax, she enters with ringing, fervent chords that yield to gospel-like tremolos, from which emerges an obsessive bass-note chiming that sounds like church bells from space.\"\nWriting for the Financial Times, Mike Hobart noted that the \"solos are long and the arrangements ad-lib,\" but acknowledged the fact that \"the commitment of the playing and Coltrane's guiding hand on piano and harp ensure the music's emotional force.\"\nPitchfork's Hank Shteamer suggested that, on the album, Coltrane is \"here in full: the matriarch we now know well and duly appreciate; the Godfather we may not have ever properly reckoned with. The devotee of Satchidananda; the torchbearer for John. And the bandleader and instrumental powerhouse who marshaled formidable talents like Pharoah Sanders and Archie Shepp, and found space for them within her rapidly expanding musical vision.\"\nEdwin Pouncey of Jazzwise called the album \"noble,\" and commented: \"Live at Carnegie Hall expertly succeeds in bringing this important episode in Alice Coltrane\u2019s musical ascension vividly back to life \u2013 to the point where you might possibly believe you were there on that magical evening.\"\nIn an article for Mojo, Andrew Male remarked: \"What began as a benefit for Swami Satchidananda and evolved into a summoning of John Coltrane's spirit now stands as a tribute to the liberating force of Alice Coltrane herself. It's a communion. Drink deep.\"\nCommenting for The Quietus, Antonio Poscic described the album as \"inspirited\" and \"crucial\", and wrote: \"It's mesmerising to hear these particular takes for the first time as they show just how deeply invested, how certain, Coltrane and her collaborators were in the music and the devotional flow fuelling it... the group's performance... is confident and inspired.\"\nThe Nation's Marcus J. Moore stated: \"At Carnegie Hall, Alice proved she had a sound all her own... On these tracks, Alice proved she wasn't just a practitioner of transcendental harmonies; she had the same verve as other free jazz luminaries.\"\nThom Jurek of AllMusic commented: \"the concert's pace, textures, explosive drama, virtuosity, and limitless creativity are unmatched... This is an essential entry in Coltrane's catalog.\"\nIn a review for UK Jazz News, Phil Johnson remarked: \"The Carnegie Hall Concert is both an historically important document and an eminently listenable recording full of insistent grooves, remarkably powerful playing and intense compositional depth... essential for anyone wishing to understand where jazz was then and where it has got to now.\"\nWriting for All About Jazz, Marc Myers called the album \"a landmark performance that was both commanding and reflective of a fast-moving era that upended norms\" and wrote: \"Few jazz recordings have captivated me the way this one has, with its extraordinary emotion, Black power, pan-Africanism and artistic endurance by all of the performers.\"\nTrack listing\n\"Journey in Satchidananda",

It was recorded in 1993 when Murphy was 61 years old and released by the West & East Music label in Austria in 1993. The album is a collection of standards and jazz tunes with a jazz nonet. Murphy contributes original lyrics to one of the tunes.\nBackground\nMurphy was on staff at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, Austria as a vocal instructor 1990-1997 and 2001. In 1993 he recorded an album with some of their students and local professionals. The album was produced by trumpeter Oliver Growenewald who also did the arrangements and was studying at Graz at the time. Growenwald writes, \"During my years in Graz, I was able to form my first nine piece band. I was also fortunate to gain experience working with musicians like Mark Murphy and Art Farmer. I had the great chance to write arrangements for Mark Murphy\u2019s CD \u201cVery Early\u201d (West & East, 1992) and the opportunity to perform at Festivals in Montreux, Vienna, Warsaw, and Nancy. During this time, I also met Ack van Rooyen and Chuck Israels, with whom I continued my studies after leaving Graz\".\nRecording\nThis release was Oliver Groenewald's first as producer. Groenewald's Nine Piece Band is augmented by Stjepko Gut (trumpet, track 1) and Ewald Gaulhofer (percussion, tracks 1, 7, 11).

The episode was written by series developers Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks, and directed by co-executive producer Jonathan van Tulleken. It was released on Hulu on February 27, 2024 alongside the first episode, and they also aired on FX on the same day.\nThe series is set in 1600, and follows three characters. John Blackthorne, a risk-taking English sailor who ends up shipwrecked in Japan, a land whose unfamiliar culture will ultimately redefine him; Lord Toranaga, a shrewd, powerful daimyo, at odds with his own dangerous, political rivals; and Lady Mariko, a woman with invaluable skills but dishonorable family ties, who must prove her value and allegiance. In the episode, Blackthorne explains his beliefs to Toranaga, while conflicts arise in Osaka. \nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.764 million household viewers and gained a 0.14 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349. The episode received critical acclaim, with critics praising the performances, cinematography and pacing.\nPlot\nOne year prior, the reigning Taik\u014d is dying, surrounded by his family and members of his court. After sending them away, he privately talks with Toranaga, suggesting he could become the sole regent until his young heir Yaechiyo comes of age. Toranaga refuses, knowing that this will only make him a target for the Taik\u014d's enemies. Anticipating this response, the Taik\u014d informs him that he is forming a \"Council of Regents\", which includes Toranaga, to prevent a possible civil war over his succession.\nIn 1600, Blackthorne is brought before Toranaga and Mariko. They bring Portuguese Father Martin Alvito to translate their conversation, where Blackthorne reveals that England is at war with Portugal over their respective religions. This prompts Ishido to order Blackthorne's arrest, which Toranaga does not prevent to avoid antagonizing the two Catholic regents. In his cell, Blackthorne meets Father Domingo, a Franciscan friar, who informs him that the Portuguese Black Ships are using profits from the silk trade to support a secret military base in Macau, implying that the Jesuits are planning to take power for themselves. \nIshido learns from the Christian regents Kiyama and Ohno that they will support Toranaga's impeachment if Blackthorne is killed, but he believes that the sailor can be useful for their plans. Yabushige, eager to play both sides, arranges for Blackthorne's prison escort to be ambushed by r\u014dnin, before ordering his own samurai to kill the r\u014dnin and \"rescue\" Blackthorne for Toranaga. With Mariko translating his words, Blackthorne explains that Portugal and Spain have divided the world among themselves and intend to replace all non-Catholic governments, shocking Toranaga. \nRealizing his potential, Toranaga decides to let Blackthorne stay with him as a guest. The Jesuits inform Kiyama that Blackthorne's private notes have been retrieved, proving that he was sent to disrupt the silk trade. That night, Toranaga kills a shinobi disguised as one of his servants when she tries to stab Blackthorne in his room. Toranaga explains to his shocked advisors that he has deliberately changed rooms with Blackthorne, proving that the assassin was sent to kill him.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn January 2024, Hulu confirmed that the second episode of the series would be titled \"Servants of Two Masters\", and was to be written by series developers Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks, and directed by co-executive producer Jonathan van Tulleken. It was Kondo's second writing credit, Marks' second writing credit, and van Tulleken's second directing credit.\nFilming\nFor the first meeting scene between Blackthorne and Toranaga, Jonathan van Tulleken said he wanted the scene to feel \"very first person\" to \"get inside both their heads\", hoping to build tension in the scene over whether Blackthorne would commit a misstep.:\u200a25:54\u201326:40\u200a\nReception\nViewers\nIn its original FX broadcast, \"Servants of Two Masters\" was seen by an estimated 0.764 million household viewers and gained a 0.14 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349, according to Nielsen Media Research. This means that 0.14 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode.\nCritical reviews\n\"Servants of Two Masters\" received critical acclaim. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating for the episode, based on 4 reviews.\nMeredith Hobbs Coons of The A.V.

    "1986 textbook by David Watkin\nA History of Western Architecture is a textbook by British architectural historian David Watkin, first published in 1986. The seventh edition (2023) was revised and expanded by Owen Hopkins. The book is known for emphasising the classical tradition's importance for later architecture.\nContents\nAs of the fourth edition (2005), the book has 11 chapters:\nMesopotamia and Egypt\nThe Classical Foundation: Greek, Hellenistic, Roman\nEarly Christian and Byzantine\nCarolingian and Romanesque\nThe Gothic Experiment\nRenaissance Harmony\nBaroque Expansion\nEighteenth-Century Classicism\nThe Nineteenth Century\nArt Nouveau\nThe Twentieth Century and Beyond\nPublication\nSeven editions have been published as of 2024. The seventh was revised and expanded in 2023 following Watkin's death in 2018 by Owen Hopkins, another British architectural historian. By then, a chapter on 21st-century architecture had split off the 20th-century one. Translations have been published in multiple languages such as Dutch.\nReception\nBy the 2000s, Watkin's textbook became widely used in architectural schools in the Netherlands and Belgium for the standard introductory survey course on the history of Western architecture. In a 2002 article, architectural historians Hilde Heynen and Krista de Jonge noted that the textbook's use along with a few other standard ones promoted a standardization of the taught architectural canon of a small set of buildings that illustrated recognized periods of architectural history. At the same time, these schools were trying to move away from a standard canon.\nBritish art historian Deborah Howard recommended A History of Western Architecture as a survey reference textbook in 2002.\nCitations\n^ a b \"A History of Western Architecture Seventh Edition\".\n^ Watkin 2005, p.\u00a05.\n^ a b Heynen & de Jonge 2002, p.\u00a0337.\n^ Howard 2002, p.\u00a0352.\nBibliography\nClement, Russell T.

    "Spanish architect and sports leader\nJos\u00e9 Plantada Artigas (7 June 1879 \u2013 1943) was a Spanish modernist architect and sports leader who was the president of both the Catalan Football Federation and the J\u00fapiter Sports Club.\nEarly life and education\nJos\u00e9 Plantada was born on 7 June 1879 in Barcelona, as the son of Josep Plantada i For\u00e9s (1845\u20131913), a surveyor and master builder born in Barcelona, and Joaquima Artigas i Ramoneda, also from Barcelona. He graduated from the Barcelona School of Architecture\u00a0 in 1902.\nArchitectual career\nIn 1904, Plantada began working at Barcelona City Council as an assistant in the Faculty Office of Urbanization and Works, and just three years later, in 1907, he became Head of Division of the same Office. Between 1903 and 1914, he built several houses in Barcelona, such as Casa Cipriano Calvet (1903), Casa J.

In 1916 he built the casino in the Parc de la Ciutadella, in French Renaissance style; it had two floors, the lower one was used as a cafe-restaurant and the upper one was where the casino was located, but it was demolished in 1964.\nIn 1927, Plantada became interim head of the Hygiene, Health and Assistance Services, the position from which he carried out the Hospital del Mar project, and in 1932, he was appointed head of the Health and Hygiene Buildings Service.\nSporting career\nIn 1930, Plantada was elected president of the Catalan Football Federation, a position that he held for a year until 1931, when he was replaced by Francesc Costa. He was also the president of the J\u00fapiter Sports Club.\nLater life and death\nIn 1940, after the Spanish Civil War, Plantada was relieved of his position as a Barcelona Municipal Architect and went into forced retirement. Plantada died in 1943, at the age of either 63 or 64, and in July 1943, his wife Encarnaci\u00f3 de Gr\u00e0cia i Casas was granted a widow's pension.\n",

    "Karbi-Kuki conflict\nThe Kuki-Karbi conflict is an ethnic conflict between the Kuki people and Karbi people in the Karbi Anglong district of Assam, India. The conflict has its roots in disputes over land, resources and political representation between the two groups.\nBackground\nThe Karbi Anglong district is home to several ethnic groups including the majority Karbi tribe as well as Kuki tribes like the Thadou and Hmar. The Karbi Anglong district has been aspiring for an autonomous state status since 1986, represented by the Autonomous State Demand Committee (ASDC). The Kuki population, initially numbering 15 in the 1951 census, rose to 2,914 in 1961. By 1971, it reached 21,034 in Assam, but then decreased to 21,883 by 1991, suggesting a pattern of inward migration followed by outward migration. The Apex Kuki organization in Karbi Anglong, the Kuki National Assembly (KNA), was also seeking the establishment of an autonomous regional council for the Kuki people, who primarily reside in the Singhasan Hills region.This growth is seen as a potential challenge to the Karbi groups' aspirations. Tensions between the two groups have existed for decades, fueled by competition for land, political power and resources in the district.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the conflict escalated into violence between militant groups representing the two communities. The United People's Democratic Solidarity(UPDS), a Karbi militant group, clashed with the Kuki Revolutionary Army (KRA), a Kuki militant outfit based in Manipur.\n2002-2004 clashes\nThe most intense phase of the conflict occurred between October 2003 and March 2004. During this period, the KRA and the anti-talks faction of the UPDS killed an estimated 85 people, mostly men, in Karbi Anglong. The casualties included at least 23 Kukis and 54 Karbis. Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today requested Delhi to ban the Kuki Revolutionary Army (KRA), saying the militant group was \u201cbehind much of the violence\u201d in Karbi Anglong district.\nIn March 2004, the violence reached its peak. On March 24, the KRA killed 34 Karbi tribals in separate incidents in the villages of Udentisu, Tarak Teron and Jari Teron. Five more Karbis were killed in various villages on March 27. The KRA claimed it was retaliating to the killing of six Kukis by the UPDS on March 19.The March 24 incident resulted in the highest civilian casualty in a single day in Assam. It was also the largest civilian casualty in Karbi Anglong since the pro-talks UPDS faction signed a ceasefire agreement with the Indian government in 2002.\nCauses and consequences\nThe conflict is driven by several factors including competition for land and resources, political representation, and the activities of militant groups. According to then Assam's chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, the KRA, a militant group from Manipur, believed to be responsible for the majority of recent clashes in the district. He had asked Delhi to ban the Kuki Revolutionary Army (KRA) due to their involvement in the violence in Karbi Anglong district. The UPDS, formed by the merger of the Karbi National Volunteers and Karbi People's Front in 1999, aimed to drive out non-Karbi populations from Karbi Anglong. This threatened the Kuki community.The violence has had a devastating impact on the local population. Hundreds of people have been killed, thousands displaced, and villages destroyed. The conflict has also hindered development in the district.\nAttempts at resolution\nSeveral attempts have been made to resolve the conflict. The Indian Army was deployed to Karbi Anglong to control the violence. The government also initiated peace talks with the UPDS, leading to a ceasefire agreement in 2002. However, the anti-talks faction of the UPDS continued to engage in violence. The conflict remains unresolved fully, with sporadic incidents of violence continuing to occur in Karbi Anglong.\nSee also\nKuki-Naga conflict in Manipur\nKuki\u2013Paite Conflict\n2023 Manipur violence\n",
    "Mountain in Arizona, United States\nFor other uses, see Wilson Mountain.\nWilson Mountain is a 7,122-foot-elevation (2,171-meter) summit in Coconino County, Arizona, United States.\nDescription\nWilson Mountain is located three miles north of Sedona in the Red Rock-Secret Mountain Wilderness, on land managed by Coconino National Forest. It is the highest peak in Sedona, and second-highest in the wilderness. Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains to Oak Creek which is part of the Verde River watershed. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises over 2,400 feet (732 meters) above Oak Creek Canyon in one mile (1.6\u00a0km). The nearest higher neighbor is East Pocket Knob, 3.73\u00a0miles (6\u00a0km) to the north. Wilson Mountain is composed of light-colored Coconino Sandstone overlaying reddish Schnebly Hill Formation, which is all capped by a layer of dark-gray basalt. Hiking to the top via the Wilson Mountain Trail covers 5.6\u00a0miles (one-way) with 2,300 feet of elevation gain.\nEtymology\nWilson Mountain and Wilson Canyon, which is on the mountain's southern slope, are named after Richard Wilson who was killed by a grizzly bear in the canyon in June 1885. Wilson, a bear hunter, was unable to resist the temptation to shoot the large grizzly with a small rifle he had with him instead of his usual large caliber bear gun, which was being repaired. The bear was only wounded, and attacked Wilson, and his mauled body was found nine days later. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. Landforms officially named in association include Wilson Canyon, Lost Wilson Mountain, and First Bench of Wilson Mountain.\nClimate\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Wilson Mountain is located in a temperate semi-arid climate zone. Hikers can expect afternoon rain and lightning from the seasonal monsoon in late July and August.\nSee also\nList of mountain peaks of Arizona\n Mountains portal\nGallery\nWilson Mountain viewed from Munds Mountain\nSSW aspect, from airport\nSouth aspect from Midgely Bridge on Highway 89A\nWest aspect of Wilson Mountain on skyline viewed from Bear Mountain\nNorth aspect of Wilson Mountain to right of center, with Oak Creek Canyon below.\n",

    "American LGBT rights activist (1927\u20132006)\nRichard Lamar Schlegel (February 11, 1927 \u2013 February 25, 2006) was an American LGBT rights activist and civil servant from Pennsylvania. Fired from federal and state government jobs on account of his sexual orientation, he filed a wrongful termination suit that reached the United States Supreme Court in 1970. Schlegel v. United States is considered an early landmark case in the American gay rights movement.\nEarly life and education\nSchlegel was born in Berrysburg, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, on February 11, 1927. He was the only child of Roy Fredrick Schlegel, a construction worker, and Margaret Annetta (Deibler) Schlegel, a schoolteacher and homemaker, both of Pennsylvania German descent.\nSchlegel graduated from Milroy High School in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, and attended Pennsylvania State University from 1943 to 1945. He dropped out after being outed by a fraternity brother and was promptly drafted into the United States Army Air Forces, where he served two years on bases in Texas and Florida, performing office duties for the Office of the Judge Advocate General. He returned to Penn State under the G.I. Bill in 1947 and graduated in February 1949 with a bachelor's degree. Later that year, Schlegel enrolled at American University in Washington, D.C., receiving a master's degree in political science and public administration. While attending graduate school, he interned at the federal Civil Aeronautics Administration and accepted a full-time civil service job at the CAA in 1952.\nCivil service career\nAfter three years at the CAA, Schlegel worked for the Federal Civil Defense Administration at Battle Creek, Michigan, from 1955 to 1958. He then became a civilian employee of the Department of the Army based in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he worked in the transportation office at Fort Shafter. When he sought top-secret security clearance in 1960, military investigators uncovered three male soldiers who confessed to having sexual relations with Schlegel. He was charged with \"immoral and indecent conduct\" under civil service regulations and was fired on July 31, 1961.\nAfter his dismissal, Schlegel lived in Schoolcraft, Michigan, and Washington, D.C., for two years before moving to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he served as finance director of the Pennsylvania Department of Highways from 1963 to 1965. He resigned involuntarily when the state police opened an investigation into his sexuality. From 1966 to mid-1967, he worked for a Philadelphia-based accounting firm named Laventhol, Krekstein, and Griffith, CPAs. He later worked at Paul Brooker Sales International from 1972 to 1979. In retirement, he became a financial investor and millionaire.\nGay rights activism\nFired from his federal job in July 1961, Schlegel exhausted federal administrative appeals before filing a wrongful termination suit in 1963 in the United States Court of Federal Claims. He declared that the charge of \"immoral and indecent conduct\" was unconstitutionally vague and that the civil service's efficiency was not impacted by his private life. He sought reinstatement and back pay. Six years later, the seven-judge panel ruled unanimously against him, declaring that \"any schoolboy knows that a homosexual act is immoral, indecent, lewd, and obscene\" and that homosexual conduct undermined the efficient workings of government. On February 28, 1970, ACLU lawyers Norman Dorsen and Melvin Wulf petitioned the United States Supreme Court to hear Schleger's case, casting it as a landmark case for civil liberties. On April 20, 1970, the Supreme Court unanimously refused to hear Schlegel's case. Although Schlegel failed to regain his job, Schlegel v. United States is considered an early landmark case in the American gay rights movement.\nDuring the 1960s, Schlegel became an active member of the Janus Society, an early homophile association based in Philadelphia, and founded a Janus Society chapter in Harrisburg. Barred from government jobs, he became active in gay magazine publishing, working as a proofreader, writer, and editor for Guild Press and Potomac News (both owned by H. Lynn Womack), Drum (edited by Clark Polak), and Trojan Book Service from 1967 to 1969. In 1970, he served as editor and publisher of PACE!, a short-lived magazine published by the Philadelphia Action Committee for Equality.\nDeath and legacy\nSchlegel lived in Pennsylvania from 1970 until his death on February 25, 2006, at the age of 79. He was interred at Sweitzers Memorial Cemetery in his hometown of Berrysburg. He endowed a scholarship at Bucknell University in 1999, and his will posthumously established the Richard L. Schlegel National Legion of Honor Award for an Emerging Activist, based at American University. Schlegel's correspondence and other papers are held in the library archives of Cornell University, the ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the University of Southern California, and other institutions.\nIn October 2021, the Penn",

It is a Division Grade unit that mainly performs scientific research and defense technology development, including during the last few decades, projects related to the Chinese space program.\nHistory\nOn June 2, 1987, the Central Military Commission broke off and renamed the Third Test Site of the Conventional Weapons Test Base into the Third Test Base of Conventional Weapons and placed under the direct leadership of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. Zhou Liezhang was appointed commander, and Li Jiangeng was appointed political commissar. From the start, the base received an extremely high degree of secrecy at the time, due to it work on electronic warfare.\nIn 2005, the base undertook the army's first pilot program for the training of actual electronic countermeasures combat units. In 2009, the base's electronic countermeasures training brigade (\u7535\u5b50\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u961f) was formally established.\nOn December 5, 2012, the State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environmental Effects on Electronic Information Systems was unveiled at the Luoyang Test Center. The construction of this national key laboratory was approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China on October 9, 2012.\nThe Test Center has been involved in the Chinese Space Program since at least 1999. In particular, the Test Center's Surveying, Mapping and Navigation Team has had the responsibility for the more delicate metrological tasks, in particular the high-precision surveying and mapping support for the \"Shenzhou\" spacecraft program. The Team has carried out over 700 surveying and mapping support tasks, from the initial geodetic survey of possible landing sites in Inner Mongolia, to surveying and mapping support for \"Shenzhou 5\" and Shenzhou 6\" and telemetry work for \"Shenzhou 7\".\nThe team also undertook the hyper-precise elevation measurements for the early stages of construction of the 500-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) project in 2012.\nThe test's center parent department, the General Armament Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, was abolished in January 2016, and the base was transferred to the newly established Equipment Development Department of the Central Military Commission. It was then transferred to the newly founded Strategic Support Force, and on the dissolution of that force in April 2024, it passed under the jurisdiction of the Aerospace Force.\nSee also\nChina portal\nCentral Military Commission (China)\nNational Defense Mobilization Commission\n",

The holiday celebrates the military might and moral fortitude of the Red Army, which suffered enormous losses in the war, with at least 20 million Soviet citizens losing their lives. Victory Day has been observed annually on May 9 since 1945, and it is one of the most revered and widely celebrated public holidays in Russia, with parades, fireworks, and concerts held across the country.\nParade summary\nPutin's Young Army on the Red Square\nMilitary parade on the Red Square\nAs light flurries of snow fell on Red Square, over 9,000 different troops from 30 various ceremonial regiments marched past the parade stand, 1,000 of which were involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Just like the previous Victory Day parade, the mechanized column section only featured one tank, a T-34-85, but for the first time in three years, aerial units took part in the parade: The Russian Knights aerobatic team flew Su-30 and MiG-29 fighters, followed by six Su-25 jets that emitted smoke in the colors of the Russian flag. As in prior parades, missile launchers, artillery, and ICBMs were shown. During the parade, Russian soldiers were equipped with what appeared to be drone jammers given the fear that there would be Ukrainian attacks during the ceremonies. For the first time since the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade, a president from an African nation was invited to the parade, as Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 of Guinea-Bissau was in attendance. This was the last Victory Day parade for Sergei Shoigu performing the duties of Minister of Defence, as three days after the parade, he was not reappointed to the position.\nPutin's speech\nPutin speaks from the podium\nTwo days after Putin's fifth inauguration as President of Russia, he criticized former Eastern Bloc Soviet satellite states, as well as several other countries formerly occupied by the Soviet Union for the removal of Soviet-era monuments and memorials dedicated to the Russian victory during World War II, saying that they are now dedicating monuments to \"traitors and Hitler's accomplices\", while erasing the history of noble world liberators.

    "Chinese progressive metal band\nOU (pronounced oh) is a progressive metal band from Beijing, China, consisting of singer Lynn Wu, guitarist Zhang Jing, bassist Chris Cui, and drummer Anthony Vanacore. Their most recent album, II: Frailty, was released in April 2024.\nHistory\nOU was formed by drummer and primary songwriter Anthony Vanacore, an American ex-pat who is fluent in Mandarin and originally moved to Beijing to work as a music teacher. Vanacore recruited guitarist Zhang Jing and bassist Chris Cui, both veterans of the local rock and jazz music community in Beijing, and later added singer Lynn Wu. The band lists Devin Townsend, The Gathering, and Radiohead as primary influences.\nThe band signed with the German label InsideOut Music before ever playing live. They are reportedly the first Chinese rock band to sign with a western record label. The head of InsideOut, Thomas Waber, described OU as \"Very unique and modern, but still familiar sounding, a rare find these days!\" InsideOut released the band's debut album One in May 2022. Lynn Wu gained notice from critics due to her completely Mandarin lyrics and experimental style; several reviewers have compared her singing to Bjork and Kate Bush. The album was also praised for mixing the band's primary progressive metal sound with jazz, electronica, and ambient styles.\nOU gained the attention of labelmate Devin Townsend, who signed on to co-produce their second album. The album II: Frailty was released in April 2024, with Townsend contributing backing vocals on the song \"Purge\". Lynn Wu again earned praise from critics, with one reviewer describing her performance on the album as \" tak it somewhere stranger and more unsettling\". Another reviewer praised II: Frailty because \"it\u2019s effortless to fall prey to the polyrhythmic hypnosis that OU has mastered,\" while The Prog Report called the album \"one of the year\u2019s most unique releases.\"\nMembers\nLynn Wu \u2013 vocals\nZhang Jing \u2013 guitar\nChris Cui \u2013 bass\nAnthony Vanacore \u2013 drums, programming\nDiscography\nAlbums\nOne (2022)\nII: Frailty (2024)\n",

The legal status of the archive is defined on the provisions of the state level Law on the Protection of Cultural Goods from 1994, the Law on Culture from 2009, and the Law on Determination of the Competences of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina from 2009. In addition to archival material related to Vojvodina, the archive preserve a significant material related to the history of Serbs in Croatia, particularly but not limited to the region of Baranya and the rest of eastern Croatia.\nThe Archive of Vojvodina was established in 1926 as the State Archive in Novi Sad. By the decision of the Assistant Minister of Education of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes of August 5, 1926 the first archivist appointed was Dr. Dimitrije Kirilovi\u0107. He invited the historian Aleksa Ivi\u0107, a professor at the Faculty of Law in Subotica, to compile a report on the state of archival material in Vojvodina. During World War II in Yugoslavia, parts of Novi Sad in Syrmia were within the borders of the Independent State of Croatia. At that time, the archive building was located in the Petrovaradin Magistrate building, where the archive had moved in 1934. A significant portion of the archival material was taken over by the Ustasha authorities, and some was transferred to Vienna and private collections in ossupied Czechoslovakia. A significant part of the archival material was lost in the basements of the Petrovaradin Fortress.\nAfter the liberation in 1945, the Archive was housed in the basement premises of the Banovina Palace. From 1951, the Archive was named the State Archive of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, and from 1958, the Historical Archive of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. Its current name was adopted in 1970. The return of stolen items required more space, so the Serbian Orthodox Church provided the Patriarchate Court in Sremski Karlovci, and from 1968, the monastery lodgings in Beo\u010din. The building of the District Prison was renovated during 1988 and 1989, and the Archive of Vojvodina ceremoniously moved into it on April 27, 1989.\nThe Archive of Vojvodina has received several social awards for its professional, scientific, and cultural contributions, including: the Order of Merit for the People - Award of the Presidency of the SFRY in 1986; the Golden Archive - Award of the Archives of Serbia in 1999; the Spark of Culture - Award of the Institute for Culture of Vojvodina in 2006. The Archive of Vojvodina was also awarded the Order of the Star of Karadjordje, second class, by the decree of the President of Serbia in 2016, for outstanding merits in preserving cultural and historical heritage, on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of its founding and successful work.\nSee also\nArchive of Serbia\nArchives of Republika Srpska\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n",
    "Lithuanian veterinarian, agronomist, sociologist, archeologist and zoologist\nKonradas Juozas Aleksa (19 February 1881 \u2013 6 November 1956) was a Lithuanian veterinarian, agronomist, sociologist, archeologist, and zoologist. He is best known as a professor of the Vytautas Magnus University Agriculture Academy and one of the creators of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Veterinary Academy. Aleksa introduced veterinary to Lithuania and was Lithuania's first proponent of eugenics.\nBiography\nEarly life\nKonradas Juozas Aleksa was born on 19 February 1881 in the village of Obelupiai in Congress Poland of the Russian Empire. His brothers were Zigmas Angarietis (later a Communist revolutionary) and Jonas Pranas Aleksa (an agronomist). Aleksa collected Lithuanian folklore and folk songs in his youth, which would be lost during World War I. In 1899 Aleksa graduated from the Marijampol\u0117 Gymnasium, and then traveled to Warsaw to study at the Warsaw Institute of Veterinary Medicine. On 1 May 1901 he participated in an anti-Tsarist demonstration in Warsaw, where he was injured and arrested. In 1903 he graduated from the Warsaw Institute of Veterinary Medicine, where he continued working. He also practiced veterinary at \u0160akiai, Kalvarija, and Balaklava. Until the beginning of the First World War, he collected scientific knowledge and wrote in the press.\nConscription in Russian armies\nAleksa joined the Russian Imperial Army and fought in the Russo-Japanese War from 1904 to 1905. As a person with a medical background, Aleksa served as a medic during the First World War. Aleksa was elected as a regimental delegate to the Russian Army Congress to represent non-Russian people, i.e. people from the occupied territories. Aleksa was elected senior veterinarian in the city of Daugavpils (Dvinsk), but his regiment soon deserted the Russian army, which at that time was in complete disarray. Aleksa traveled back to famine-ridden Balaklava, where his family lived at the time. Aleksa later got a job as a clerk in the city municipality's office to financially provide for his exhausted family and recover. Aleksa was soon mobilized into Lieutenant General Anton Denikin's army, being discharged only when he fell seriously ill. After recovering, he worked in the Balaklava city cooperative. However, Aleksa was then mobilized for a second time under General Pyotr Wrangel. After Wrangel's forces ultimately lost against the Bolshevik forces, Aleksa became a prisoner of war.\nIn 1920 he was imprisoned by the new Russian government and tried by the NKVD troika. It is said that Aleksas's defense speech in court saved his life; Aleksa claimed that representatives of peoples enslaved by the Russian Tsar could not be volunteers in the White Army, and so consequently Aleksa ended up in it against his will. After Aleksa's speech, him and one Latvian were acquitted, while the others were shot. In 1922 he got a job in Kharkov in the Lithuanian embassy. After he formed an echelon of Lithuanian war exiles in Crimea, he arrived in Lithuania in the summer of 1922. He and his wife Marija Aleksien\u0117 n\u00e9e Ko\u017eanevska adopted two children.\nProfessor in Lithuania\nFrom 1922 to 1924 Aleksa lectured at the Dotnuva School of Agriculture, and the Vytautas Magnus University Agriculture Academy from 1924 to 1938. From 1926 to 1927 and from 1928 to 1936 he was a prorector. In 1923 Aleksa became one of the creators of the Lithuanian Veterinary Doctor Academy, being its chairman for a few years. From 1932 to 1938 Aleksa was a permanent representative of Lithuania at the Office International des Epizooties in Paris. Aleksa was made professor in 1927. In 1928 he was awarded the Order of the Grand Duke Gediminas, 3rd degree. Aleksa was the first to do sociological research on women living in urban villages, publishing the book Lietuvos moteris sodiet\u0117 in 1932 with his own funds, distributing copies for free.\nIn 1930 he opened a new Household Section in the Agriculture Academy, where female household agronomists were trained. Aleksa was one of the main creators of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Veterinary Academy, being its lecturer from 1938 to 1940. Aleksa was a co-author of a book on veterinary published in 1936 in Toulouse. Aleksa was the first to write on the history of veterinary in Lithuania and do research on coprology. Aleksa was also one of the first to create Lithuanian names for veterinary terms and to study zoopsychology. As an archeologist, Aleksa was the first to study horse skeletons in mass graves in Lithuania. Aleksa contributed to numerous publications such as Karys, Gamta, Lietuvos \u017einios, and Naujoji Romuva. From 1931 to 1944 he wrote articles for the Lietuvi\u0161koji enciklopedija\u00a0 (Lithuanian Encyclopedia), the first Lithuanian encyclopedia.\nLater years\nDuring the Nazi occupation of Lithuania, Aleksa declined a more career-prospective position, which in turn would please the local Nazi government, and as such was prohibited from living and ",

Other writers on Fallen were Norwegian filmmaker Martin Asphaug and Alex Haridi. Ahlgen remained involved in the production, including viewing all the dailies doing rewrites where necessary. She wanted to show the stark contrast between the city and country scenery. However, the tone is lighter, and the lead character very distinct from The Bridge.\nAs of February 2024, financing was being arranged for a second season, by TV4, Germany's ZDF, and Film i Sk\u00e5ne, which Ahlgren had already started writing.\nRelease\nSanningen premiered on 25 December 2023 on TV4 in Sweden.\nThe series was aired from 25 February 2024 in Germany, and after Banijay obtained distribution rights, the series was bought by American broadcaster MHz Choice, Canal+'s Polar+ for France, NPO in the Netherlands, SBS in Australia, ERT in Greece, and Syn Hf in Iceland.

    "Prejudice towards Nigeria or Nigerian people\nAnti-Nigerian sentiment is the dislike of Nigeria or Nigerians.\nBiafra and the Nigerian Civil War\nAnti-Nigerian sentiment arose among Igbo people during the Nigerian Civil War of 1967\u20131970, when the predominately Igbo region seceded from Nigeria and attempted to establish an independent Republic of Biafra. In the 1969 Ahiara Declaration, Biafran president Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu stated, \"The Federation of Nigeria is today as corrupt, as unprogressive and as oppressive and irreformable as the Ottoman Empire was in Eastern Europe over a century ago. And in contrast, the Nigerian Federation in the form it was constituted by the British cannot by any stretch of imagination be considered an African necessity. Yet we are being forced to sacrifice our very existence as a people to the integrity of that ramshackle creation that has no justification either in history or in the freely expressed wishes of the people.\" Although Biafra was defeated and reintegrated into Nigeria, various Biafran nationalist groups such as Indigenous People of Biafra  and Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra continue the goal of seceding from Nigeria.\nKenya\nKenyan police arrested two Nigerian nationals following the discovered death of a Kenyan woman on 14 January 2024. The arrests led to a public campaign among Kenyan citizens to deport Nigerians from the country.\nSouth Africa\nSince the end of apartheid in 1994, Nigerians and other foreign nationals began migrating to South Africa in large numbers. This has led to xenophobic sentiments among Black South Africans due to scarce economic opportunities. Nigerians are among the common targets of xenophobia in South Africa. The portrayal of Nigerians as illegal drug dealers has often been used to justify xenophobic violence towards Nigerians in South Africa. On 18 October 2007, South African musician Lucky Dube was shot dead because his assailants allegedly mistook him for a Nigerian.\nThe 2009 South African science fiction film  District 9 faced controversy for its alleged negative portrayal of Nigerians. Nigeria's Information Minister Dora Akunyili asked movie cinemas around Nigeria to either ban the film or edit out specific references to the country because of the film's negative depiction of the Nigerian characters as criminals and cannibals. Letters of complaint were sent to the producer and distributor of the film demanding an apology. She also said the gang leader Obesandjo is almost identical in spelling and pronunciation to the surname of former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo. The film was later banned in Nigeria; the Nigerian Film and Video Censors Board was asked to prevent cinemas from showing the film and also to confiscate it. Hakeem Kae-Kazim, a Nigerian-born British actor, also criticised the portrayal of Nigerians in the film.\nDuring the 2019 Johannesburg riots, shops owned by Nigerians and other foreign nationals were attacked and looted following the death of a taxi driver. By 3 September, police had made 189 arrests for looting. Around 50 businesses predominantly owned by Nigerians were reportedly destroyed or damaged during the incident. The riots coincided with a nationwide truck driver strike protesting against the employment of non-South African truckers. After riots resulted in 12 deaths in the first week of September, 640 of an estimated 100,000 Nigerians in South Africa signed up to take free flights offered by Nigeria to return to their home country.\nUnited States\nDuring the Nigerian Civil War, Biafran officials collaborated with American politicians and public relations firms to spread anti-Nigerian sentiments among Americans. The American Committee to Keep Biafra Alive widely propagated negative images of Nigeria and made disputed assertions that Nigeria was committing a mass genocide in Biafra.\n",
    "Nicholas of Bar (died 16 May 1310) was the bishop of M\u00e2con from 1286 until his death.\nAccording to a posthumous document, Nicholas was the \"son of Poncetus of Bar in the diocese of Tulle\". His obituary in the register of his alma mater, however, gives his namesake as Bar-le-Duc. Given family connections to Lorraine there can be no doubt that the latter is correct. His uncle was Cardinal Geoffroy de Bar, who secured his appointment by Pope Honorius IV as bishop in 1286.\nNicholas died on 16 May 1310. An alumnus of the College of Sorbonne, he was a rich man at his death who left the college eighteen manuscripts plus all his possessions in the diocese of Paris. Although he intended that one professor and two students should be sustained on his bequest, this was reduced to only a single student of his own family or else from Lorraine.\nOne of the manuscripts he gave to the Sorbonne is the original manuscript of Thomas of Ireland's Manipulus florum, which the author had given him. It is now Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, lat. 15985. Another is that collection of 170 quodlibetal disputations that he commissioned. The first six questions in this collection are anonymous and may be from Nicholas' own disputation. They probably date to 1285\u20131286. The manuscript, now Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, lat. 15850, probably dates from before 1303\u20131304.\nNotes\n^ Piron 2007, p.\u00a0336: filius Ponceti de Barro, Tullensis dyocesis.\n^ Piron 2007, p.\u00a0336: Nicolaus de Barro Ducis.\n^ Piron 2007, p.\u00a0336.

    "This article is about the Australian band. For the fans or house band of the American TV show, see Shindig! \u00a7\u00a0Series regulars.\nAustralian 1980s beat music band\nShindiggers were an Australian beat pop quartet formed in 1983 by Steve Agar on bass guitar, Pete Andrews on lead guitar, Bill Leggett on vocals and Spud Wildman (a.k.a. Steve Andrews) on drums. They released a studio album, Crash Your Party (1986), before disbanding in 1987. Agar, Andrews and Leggett reformed the band in 1997, with Rodney McMurrich on drums to issue another album, Surf Sex Shindiggers (1998), but disbanded thereafter. A double-album compilation, Maximum Beat, was released in 2008.\nHistory\nShindiggers were formed as a beat pop group in Melbourne in 1983 by Steve Agar on bass guitar, Pete Andrews on lead guitar (ex-Twangin' Heartthrobs, Corpse Grinders), Bill Leggett on vocals and Spud Wildman (a.k.a. Steve Andrews) on drums (ex-Dancehall Racketeers). They initially performed cover versions of 1950s and 1960s material, \"Hippy Hippy Shake\", \"I'm Talking About You\", \"Treat Her Right\" and \"Til the Following Night\". The latter song is by 1960s beat music and shock rock artist, Screaming Lord Sutch, whom Andrews and Leggett acknowledged as a stylistic influence, \"he was the first guy to wear shoulder-length hair in 1962 and dress like a vampire or something. He can't sing for nuts but he had a great band.\"\nBaby Let Go, their first four-track extended play was issued in March 1985, which was produced by Graeme Thomas for his independent label, Preston. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane observed, \" captured the band's raw and primitive sound in all its unembellished glory.\" A six-track mini-album, Beat Is Back (June), which was produced by Lobby Loyde for Man Made. It has three cover versions, Roy Head's \"Treat Her Right\", the Missing Links' \"All I Wasn't\" and the Beatles' rendition of \"Shimmy Shimmy\", as well as three originals written by Leggett. The quartet followed with another four-track EP, Go Wild, in the same year.\nFor Shindiggers' debut studio album, Crash Your Party, they were signed by Waterfront, which issued it in October 1986. Steve Spinalli of Maximum Rock n Roll noticed the album provides, \"catchy songs, all done in a variant of the Mersey style with a slight rockabilly edge... a lot of bouncy poppish fun\". The group disbanded in February 1987 with Agar and Legget forming another group, the Joysticks; Pete Andrews joined various bands including Moment of Truth. In 1997 Shindiggers reformed with Agar, Pete Andrews and Leggett joined on drums by Rodney McMurrich. They released another album, Surf Sex Shindiggers (1998), but disbanded again. A double-album, Maximum Beat, was issued via Off the Hip in April 2008.\nMembers\nSteve Agar\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar\nPete Andrews\u00a0\u2013 lead guitar\nBill Leggett\u00a0\u2013 vocals\nSpud Wildman (a.k.a.

    "Former lifeboat station in Anglesey, Wales\nRhoscolyn Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station located at Porth-y-Corwgl, near the village of Rhoscolyn, on the west coast of Holy Island, Anglesey, Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck in 1830, before being transferred to the management of the RNLI in 1855.\nAfter 99 years service, the Rhoscolyn Lifeboat Station was closed in 1929.\nHistory\nThe Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded by the Rev. James and Mrs Frances Williams in 1828. They had witnessed the loss of 140 lives from the wreck of the vessel Alert in 1823, and spent the following five years raising funds and gaining support.\nThe Association opened Rhoscolyn Lifeboat station in 1830. A stone boathouse measuring 30-foot x 10-foot was constructed, and a 26-foot lifeboat, designed by Palmer, costing \u00a360, was built by Harton of Limehouse.\nOn December 31st, 1845, the vessel Alhambra was heading for the rocks in a gale. Whilst the lifeboat was being launched, Owen Jones swam across to the small island Ynys Traws, and waved a flag to warn the vessel of its impending fate. The Master immediately dropped anchor, saving the vessel from the rocks, and 23 crew were rescued by the lifeboat. Owen Jones was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal.\nA replacement lifeboat was placed at Rhoscolyn in 1853, a 25-foot 8in lifeboat previously built for Cemlyn. On 15 March 1855, she would be called to the vessel Southern Cross, wrecked on Maen y Sais rocks, and rescue 17 of the 18 crew.\nA new replacement boat was provided in 1859, a 30-foot self-righting pulling and sailing (P&S) lifeboat (one with oars and sails) costing \u00a3154, built by Forrestt of Limehouse, with a second boathouse constructed on the site of the original one.\nIn 1877, the RNLI decided on a complete upgrade of the station. A new boathouse, costing \u00a3400, was designed by the Institutions honorary architect, Mr C. H. Cooke, FRIBA, and constructed at the head of the Porth-y-Corwgl cove. A new 33-foot self-righting boat constructed of mahogony was built by Woolfe and Son, and cost \u00a3328-18s-0d. The whole station was funded by a gift of \u00a32000 from Marianne Catherine Cabrera, Countess de Morella, in memory of her late husband Ram\u00f3n Cabrera y Gri\u00f1\u00f3, 1st Duke of Maestrazgo, 1st Marquis of Ter, 1st Count of Morella, the lifeboat being named Ramon Cabrera (ON 263). Nine years would pass before a launch resulted in a rescue. Called to the vessel Hjemlos of Grimstad, Norway on 18 December 1887, the whole crew of 8 were rescued. Coxswain Hugh Hughes would receive a Silver Medal from the Norwegian Government.\n1903 Rhoscolyn Boathouse and slipway\nA replacement for the Ramon Cabrera was provided in 1899, a 37-foot long lifeboat, built by Chamers and Colby, of Lowestoft., and costing \u00a3619. This boat would also be named Ramon Cabrera (ON 423).\nFour years later, in 1903, a fourth boathouse would be constructed, at a cost of \u00a31,591-10s-0d. This time it was next to the shore, with a roller-slipway for quick launching.\nIn a storm of 3 December 1920, Ramon Cabrera (ON 423) was launched to the Timbo of Whitby. The crew rowed for two hours to the wreck. Failing to maintain a line to the vessel, which for now seemed firmly anchored, the lifeboat headed for Llanddwyn, the seas too rough to return to Rhoscolyn. Hit by a large wave, Evan Hughes and Owen Jones were washed overboard, and couldn't be retrieved. Then, when the lifeboat was two miles off shore, it was capsized. Although the boat self-righted, and 8 crew managed to get back on board, Coxswain Owen Owens, and crew members Robert Hughes (brother of Evan) and William Thomas, were also lost. The lifeboat arrived at Llanddwyn 8 hours after setting out.\n1922 Memorial at St Gwenfaen's Church, Rhoscolyn\nA memorial was erected at St Gwenfaen's Church, Rhoscolyn, on 12 November 1922, unveiled by Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley, 12th Baronet, whose family had provided the land for the Penmon lifeboat station.\nIt was decided to close the Rhoscolyn Lifeboat Station in 1929. No accurate service records are available prior to 1859, but it is known that at least 49 lives were saved. In the following 70 years, the Rhoscolyn boat was launched 56 times, and rescued 41 lives.\nThe 1877 boathouse is now a private residence. The 1903 boathouse is grade II listed, and is currently a holiday let.\nRamon Cabrera (ON 423) was retired from service and sold.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Rhoscolyn\nRNLI Silver Medal\nOwen Jones, Landsman - 1846\nHugh Hughes, Coxswain - 1902\nSilver Medal, awarded by the Norwegian Government\nHugh Hughes, Coxswain - 1887\nRoll of honour\nIn memory of those lost whilst serving Rhoscolyn lifeboat.\nOn service to the steamer Timbo of Whitby, 3 December 1920.\nOwen Owens, Coxswain, 61\nEvan Hughes, 34\nRobert J.

    "Football club\nSociet\u00e0 Sportiva Palestra It\u00e1lia (Venetian: ), known simply as Palestra or Palestra It\u00e1lia, is a sports club based in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Although competing in a number of different sports, Palestra is mostly known for its association football team. It plays in the JK Stadium.\nHistory\nPalestra's history is traced back to the Italian community living in Belo Horizonte, a city where already some Italian immigrants lived and their desire to set up a football club. Similar to the Italians of S\u00e3o Paulo (who founded Palestra It\u00e1lia, now known as Palmeiras) the people of Belo Horizonte wanted the Italian colonies in Minas Gerais to have its own club as well.\nIn the sporting goods and footwear Augustine Ranieri's factory, located on the street of Caet\u00e9s, it was decided the foundation of the club should tackle the three major capital: Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, America-MG and Yale. Was born at that moment, the Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Palestra Italia, established on 2 January 1921.\nThe meeting was attended by 95 founders present the shield and uniform that made reference to the Italian colors, and whose SSPI description would be recorded in the center shell. Another decision was that only members of the Italian colony could wear the shirt. Aurelio Noce was elected the first President.\nThe Palestra Italia emerged as the representative of the Italian colony. And is characterized as a team of Italian descent, Palestra also stood out by having elements of the Belo Horizonte working class, unlike Atl\u00e9tico and Am\u00e9rica, who had their consisting squad of college students coming from influential and wealthy families of the city.\nA Palestra squad before playing a game v. Flamengo in 1923\nThe idea of the club being created took a big step when Yale, a sports team from the city, went through an administrative crisis. When some players left Yale over a dispute (Yale, which itself had connections to the Italian community), some went on to found the all Italian, Sociedade Esportiva Palestra It\u00e1lia of Belo Horizonte. Until 1925 the club would only allow Italian men to participate, despite other teams in the nation accepting people of all skin colors and ethnicities.\nPalestra debuted in the Prado Mineiro Stadium with a 2\u20130 win in a friendly on 3 April 1921, against a combination from Nova Lima. The Nova Lima team united players from two teams from the city: Villa Nova, and Palmeiras, another team form Nova Lima. However, the first official match of Palestra was in a 3\u20130 win over future archrivals Clube Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro.\nIn January 1942, Brazil entered World War II and a decree of the federal government forbade the use of terms from enemy nations in entities, institutions, establishments, etc. With this, the Italian name was removed and the club could no longer call themselves Palestra Italia. The name was changed to Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Mineiro.\n",

    "Community in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany\nA letter of homage from the Jewish Community of Magenza celebrating the election of Emmerich Joseph von Breidbach zu B\u00fcrresheim as the Prince-Elector of Mainz on 5 July 1763.\nThe Jewish Community of Mainz had significance throughout Europe in the High Middle Ages, was destroyed several times, and has re-emerged even after the Holocaust.\nUntil the 11th Century\nGravestone of Yaakov ben Yakar\nThe origins of the Jewish community in Mainz are unclear. It is assumed that Jews had already come to the Middle Rhine during the time of the Roman Empire. However, there is so far no evidence for this assumption in Mainz. The first reliable evidence of a Jewish community is provided by rabbinical legal opinions from the second half of the 10th century, when a flourishing community already existed in Mainz. In the 10th century, Jewish families also began immigrating from Italy and southern France. The community in Mainz became a well-known center of Ashkenazic Judaism. The most famous scholar of that time was Gershom ben Judah, born around 960 in Metz, who worked in Mainz, where he died in 1028 or 1040. He founded a Jewish academy (Yeshiva) and thus strengthened a form of Judaism independent of the tradition of the Babylonian religious schools. Simeon bar Isaac was a rabbi and leader of the Jewish community of Mainz.\nThe oldest archaeological evidence of the Jewish community of Mainz dates from the 11th century.\n11th Century\nIn 1093, a synagogue was mentioned for the first time, located on the corner plot at Schusterstrasse/Stadthausstrasse. The oldest gravestone in the old Jewish cemetery - the only Jewish cemetery in Mainz until 1880 - dates from 1049 and is thus the oldest in Central Europe. At that time, the residential area of the Jews was located along the Rhine between the Fischtor and Karmeliterkirche gates. This residential quarter was not a ghetto; rather, most of the inhabitants there were non-Jews. A synod in 1310 prohibited this mixed dwelling.\nThe leading class of Mainz Jews was primarily involved in long-distance trade. From Mainz, the Jews traded in spices, silk, furs and metalwares. The Jewish residential quarter was conveniently located for this, as the trade center Am Brand, the city's most important market for goods arriving by ship, was located just to the south. There was also a spatial proximity to the prince-elector's court. The king had entrusted the protection of the Jews to the Prince-Elector of Mainz. The Jews were also active in lending, which was hindered for the Christian population by the prohibition of interest. Jews also owned vineyards both inside and outside the city. They were considered free and able to bear arms, allowed to keep non-Christian slaves, and able to live according to their own laws, which increasingly conformed to the laws of non-Jews by the beginning of the 13th century.\nThe community was led by parnasim, trustees and elders who together formed the Jewish council.\nThe privileges for Jewish merchants regulated in Jewish law were already the subject of hostilities in the 11th century. In 1012, King Heinrich II expelled the Jews from Mainz for the first time. In 1084, after a fire in the Jewish quarter, there were clashes that led to the flight of Jews to Speyer, where the local bishop, R\u00fcdiger Huzmann, granted them a favorable privilege, thereby promoting the town's development.\nCrusade of 1096\nThe most serious event in the history of the medieval Jewish community in Mainz was the Crusade (anti-Jewish pogrom) of 1096, in which Archbishop Ruthard completely failed in the task of protecting the Jews that had been entrusted to him by the Emperor.\nIn the Jewish liturgy, the victims of this massacre are commemorated under the name Gezerot Tatnu (\"Persecution of the Year 4856\" (according to the Jewish calendar)).\nIn 1097, Emperor Henry IV enabled those who had been forced to convert during the pogrom to return to their ancestral faith. The Jewish community thus continued to exist.\nNew beginning: 11th to 14th Century\nPogroms in Central Europe 1348\u20131349\nTogether with the communities in Speyer and Worms, the community of Mainz formed the center of Ashkenazic Judaism. These three Shum cities - Shpira (Speyer), Vermaisia (Worms) and Magenza (Mainz) - formed an association from the 12th to the 14th century, had joint advisory bodies, and from the 1220s a common law (Taqqanot Qehillot Shum) with high authority in northern Central Europe.\nThe protection of the Jews was the responsibility of the Emperor, for which they paid him taxes, a responsibility that he had granted to the Archbishop of Mainz as an imperial fief. After receiving municipal freedom in 1244, this responsibility passed to the City of Mainz in 1295.\nDuring all further Crusades there were outbursts against the Jews of the city, though these did not reach the dimension of the pogrom of 1096. In the 14th century, anti-Jewish sentiments intensified again. On 28 August 1349, there w",

    "Malaysia-based fast food chain\nSugar Bun Corporation Berhad, doing business as SugarBun is a Malaysian-owned chain of quick-service restaurants that originated in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia. Founded in 1978, it initially operated as an ice cream parlor before transitioning into the fast food industry. While its primary presence is in Sarawak, it also has locations in other Malaysian states, as well as in Brunei and Bangladesh.\nThe menu at SugarBun features a variety of dishes, including fried broasted chicken, savory rice and fish burgers, which have become popular among patrons. In addition to its classic offerings, SugarBun incorporates local Sarawakian and Bornean culinary traditions into its menu, catering to a diverse range of tastes and preferences.\nHistory\nSugarBun's broasted chicken, flavored with Sarawak pepper, alongside their savory rice and pickled vegetables\nEarly origin\nFounded in 1978 near the Kenyalang Theatre in Kuching, Sarawak, SugarBun originated as an ice cream and snack parlor established by Mr. Wung, an entrepreneur. Influenced by a memorable phrase he encountered during a trip to Taiwan, he named it SugarBun, thus initiating the establishment of the brand.\nCultural shift\nIn the 1980s, while Sarawak had limited fast food options, SugarBun seized the opportunity presented by the local population's growing fascination with contemporary dining experiences, particularly those centered around chicken-based dishes.\nIn the absence of fast food restaurants during that time, Sarawakians' exposure to global culinary trends was primarily through advertisements from international chains like KFC and McDonald's broadcast on the radio stations. Despite the absence of fast food establishments, these promotions piqued the residents curiosity about the concept, laying the groundwork for future developments.\nInnovation\nResponding to consumer preferences within two to three years of its inception, SugarBun introduced broasted chicken as a key menu item. This innovative dish, cooked using advanced roasting fryers that combined deep frying and pressure cooking methods, quickly gained popularity with its unique Sarawak pepper-infused flavor.\nThe incorporation of this cutting-edge fryer technology was notably made possible by an American associate who introduced Mr. Wung to the equipment during a visit to the United States. Following this introduction, Mr. Wung successfully acquired the fryer, signifying a notable advancement in SugarBun's culinary offerings and capabilities.\nIn 1981, SugarBun reached a notable milestone as it entered the fast food sector by launching a new venue. At the forefront of this initiative was SB Chicken, positioned as the flagship offering. This expansion represented a significant step forward for SugarBun, enhancing its presence in the fast food market while providing a foundation for further growth.\nFurthermore, Wung's brother introduced an innovative recipe for SugarBun's savory rice, a menu offering that has sustained its popularity throughout the years. Another notable addition during the early stages of SugarBun's establishment was the Hoki fish burger, originally from New Zealand. This fish burger quickly became a signature item on SugarBun's menu.\nBy 1991\u20131992, there was a noticeable shift in consumer preferences, marked by a surge in demand for chicken dishes. During this period, SugarBun saw a notable increase in business, which mirrored a shifting preference among Sarawakians towards dining establishments that provided freshly prepared meals with minimal oil content.\nTransition and expansion\n\"SugarBun - Borneo Asian Food\", the flagship brand under the chain\nA pivotal moment in the history of SugarBun took place in 1993 when the ownership underwent a transition to new shareholders. This transition occurred alongside a significant milestone for the brand, as it had already established 12 restaurants by that time. This change in ownership marked a crucial juncture in SugarBun's journey, signaling both growth and evolution as it continued to expand its presence in the market.\nIn 1997, SugarBun's parent company, Borneo Oil, reached a notable achievement by being listed on the Second Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).  This event not only reinforced SugarBun's position within the industry but also paved the way for potential opportunities.\nThe year 2001 marked another crucial phase for SugarBun with the introduction of a revamped menu featuring a diverse range of Asian dishes. This menu transformation encompassed additions such as Chicken Mushroom Soup, Sambal Eco Fish, Assam Eco Fish, Nasi Lemak and Chicken Curry, complementing the existing favorites. The introduction of these new offerings not only led to a notable surge in sales but also fostered greater customer engagement with the brand.\nDuring this period, numerous SugarBun outlets were strategically co-located with Applebee's Bakery and Caprilla Ice Cream Caf\u00e9s, providing customers with a multifaceted di",

    "French geologist, hydrogeologist, volcanologist and speleologist\nBernard G\u00e8ze (March 24, 1913 \u2013 December 8, 1996) was a French geologist, hydrogeologist, volcanologist, and speleologist.\nBiography\nBernard G\u00e8ze was born on March 24, 1913, in Toulouse. In 1931, he enrolled in the National Agronomic Institute in Paris and graduated as an agronomist three years later. He worked as an assistant to Prof.Camille Arambourg and then, in 1936, to his successor, Prof. Pierre Lamare. During this time, he obtained a bachelor's degree in Natural Sciences from the Sorbonne University. In 1937, he earned his higher education diploma. At the beginning of the war, he served as a geological officer in the Army Corps of Nancy. As an assistant to Prof. Paul Fallot at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1942, he prepared his thesis on the Montagne Noire, which he defended in 1949. He became a lecturer and then a professor of geology at the National School of Agriculture in Montpellier. He succeeded Prof. Lamare in 1954 at the Agronomy Institute, where he remained until his retirement in 1982.\nIn 1954, he became president of the French Geological Society. He was a corresponding member and then a full member of the French Academy of Agriculture.\nBernard G\u00e8ze died on December 8, 1996, in 5th arrondissement of Paris.\nSpeleological Work\nBernard G\u00e8ze pioneered scientific speleology in France, focusing on karst and hydrogeology since the 1940s.\nOn 1930, he was one of the founders of the Sp\u00e9l\u00e9o-club de France, which became the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de France on 1936. In 1936, he was also one of the founding members of the Sp\u00e9l\u00e9o-club de Paris. In 1945, with Louis Fage, Ren\u00e9 Jeannel, F\u00e9lix Trombe, Albert Vandel, among others, he founded a speleology commission within the CNRS, which he chaired from 1965 to 1976. During the same period, the Bureau de recherches g\u00e9ologiques et g\u00e9ophysiques entrusted G\u00e8ze with compiling a directory of natural cavities. He was also part of the hydrology section of the French National Committee for Geodesy and Geophysics. He became director of the underground laboratory of Moulis.\nWith the support of these organizations and figures, Bernard G\u00e8ze founded the Annales de sp\u00e9l\u00e9ologie in 1946, which constituted the third series of Spelunca, under the joint label of the SSF and the CAF.\nIn 1953, he was the secretary general of the first International Congress of Speleology in Paris, and then in 1963, he was one of the founders of the French Speleological Federation, and in 1965 in Postojna (Slovenia), of the International Union of Speleology, of which he was director until 1973 when he became honorary president.\nHe participated in famous underground explorations: Henne Morte (1946), Rogn\u00e8s shaft (1948), Penne Blanque chasm (1955), Padirac chasm (1952), among others.

    "2022 murder of a pregnant woman by her husband in Singapore\nOn 11 January 2022, 30-year-old Isabel Elizabeth Francis, who was 15 weeks pregnant with a daughter, was stabbed to death by her 33-year-old husband David Brian Chow Kwok-Hun (\u5468\u56fd\u5764 Zh\u014du Gu\u00f3k\u016bn) inside their Ang Mo Kio flat. Chow, who was arrested and indicted for murder, was said to have misunderstood that his company would go bankrupt due to an accounting error made by his employee regarding the company's finances. Due to increasing depression over the \"financial crisis\" of his company, Chow wanted to commit suicide but he thought of killing his wife and unborn daughter to spare them from the heartbreak and shame of losing a loved one to suicide, and thus he used a fruit knife to stab Francis to death before attempting suicide twice, but his attempts all failed. Chow was later diagnosed with adjustment disorder that caused him to suffer from an abnormality of the mind at the time of the offence, and hence Chow's murder charge was reduced to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and he was sentenced to seven years in prison on 26 October 2023.\nFrancis's death\nOn the morning of 11 January 2022, police responded to a report regarding a stabbing case that happened in a flat at Ang Mo Kio. The police arrived at the flat, where they discovered a man alive with multiple injuries while a woman lying motionless with multiple stab wounds all over her body. The injured man was rushed to hospital while the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.\nThe victim, whose case was classified as murder, was identified as 30-year-old Isabel Elizabeth Francis, and the injured man was her husband. According to an autopsy report, Francis sustained a total of 15 stab wounds on the head, neck and torso, and two of them were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, as one penetrated the left lung while the other was inflicted on the upper part of Francis's neck. The report also determined that at the time of her death, Francis was pregnant for an estimated 15 weeks, and the foetus was identified to be a girl. Additionally, a law school student and female classmate of Francis from Singapore University of Social Sciences told the press that two weeks before her death, Francis had told her she was pregnant and was expecting to give birth in the middle of the year. Residents told the press that they never sensed anything amiss at all on that morning when the murder happened, They noted that the couple went outdoors for exercise regularly and they even celebrated Christmas together with family and friends weeks before the murder. One neighbour, however, stated that she briefly heard someone screaming before the murder was uncovered by the police.\nThe police later announced that they placed the victim's husband under arrest for murder after some preliminary investigations, and the police confirmed that the suspect would be charged with murder. A bloodstained fruit knife, believed to be the murder weapon, was recovered from the flat.\nMurder charge\nOn 12 January 2022, a day after his arrest, Francis's 33-year-old husband, David Brian Chow Kwok-Hun, who was still hospitalized for his injuries, was officially charged with the murder of his pregnant wife by a field magistrate at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. As the charge of murder under Singaporean law carried the death penalty by hanging, Chow would be sentenced to death if found guilty. His case was adjourned to 26 January 2022.\nOn 16 February 2022, Chow, who was remanded in prison awaiting trial, had completed his psychiatric evaluation. By then, Chow was represented by Shashi Nathan, Jeremy Pereira and Laura Yeo, and the police prosecutor applied for Chow to be brought back to the crime scene to re-enact the murder and assist the police in their investigations.\nBackground and motive\nPersonal life\nBorn on 4 September 1991, Isabel Elizabeth Francis, an Eurasian Singaporean, was the second of three children, and had one younger brother (born in 1993) and one elder sister (born in 1988) who was diagnosed with special needs. At one point during her childhood, Francis's parents divorced, and her mother gained custody of all three children, who went to live with their mother and aunt somewhere at the East Coast area of Singapore.\nAccording to her brother Emanuel, Francis and her siblings shared a very close relationship, and together, they would record song covers at home, with Emanuel playing the guitar and Francis herself singing. Francis and her siblings were raised as Catholic, and they regularly went to the Church of Christ the King in Ang Mo Kio, where Francis taught catechism classes. Francis was described to be an outgoing, generous and loving person, and often mingled with her friends. Francis studied at CHIJ Toa Payoh before she was enrolled in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, where she pursued a diploma in mass communications. After completing her diploma, Francis furthered her studies at the Royal Melbourn",

    "\nNot to be confused with AltaVista.\n2024 studio album (reissue) by Childish Gambino\nAtavista is the fifth studio album and reissue of American rapper Childish Gambino's fourth studio album, 3.15.20, described by Gambino as a \"finished version\". The album was released on May 13, 2024, five days after 3.15.20 was removed from streaming platforms. The album maintains the same guest appearances from the unfinished version (Ariana Grande, Kadhja Bonet, 21 Savage and Ink), while incorporating new guest appearances from Young Nudy and Summer Walker.\nBackground\nIn 2017, Donald Glover, during a live performance, revealed he planned to retire the stage name Childish Gambino, telling the Governors Ball Music Festival audience, \"I'll see you for the last Gambino album.\" After some disputes with Glassnote, Glover signed with RCA Records in January 2018. In July 2018, Glover released the Summer Pack extended play containing the songs \"Summertime Magic\" and \"Feels Like Summer\", the former of which was labeled to be the lead singles from Glover's forthcoming fourth studio album. Later that year, Glover performed live dates on the This Is America Tour and announced at the debut show in Atlanta that the tour would be his last. Individuals who purchased tickets to the tour received exclusive unfinished demos of the songs \"Algorhythm\" and \"All Night\" before the tour dates. Along his tour, he played \"Algorhythm\" and \"All Night\" (the latter was only played in Atlanta), and he also premiered new songs, then believed to be from his upcoming studio album, including a different version of \"Atavista\" and \"Human Sacrifice\". A Google Pixel 3 advertisement also debuted during the 61st Annual Grammy Awards featuring Donald Glover and using the previously teased song \"Human Sacrifice\".\nGlover's fourth studio album, 3.15.20, was originally streamed to the public on March 15, 2020, before releasing a week later on streaming services. The album was released amid the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as following the death of Glover's father. It received critical acclaim from critics, but Glover reflected on its unfinished nature and how it had impacted its reception and legacy.\nThe tracks \"0.00\", \"32.22\", and \"42.26\", which appeared on 3.15.20 were not included on the album.\nPromotion and release\nOn March 15, 2024, four years after the album's initial release, Glover teased a re-release of the album with the title Atavista, showing an updated tracklist that included alterations in tracks and sequencing. A month later, during a radio broadcast by his production company GILGA, Glover revealed that 3.15.20 was rushed out to streaming services because of personal issues and the start of the pandemic, and he plans to re-release the project as a \"finished\" album under its original title Atavista. Glover also revealed that following Atavista, a tentpole film from GILGA titled Bando Stone in the New World would release with its soundtrack acting as the final album under the moniker of Childish Gambino.\nOn May 8, 3.15.20 was removed from select streaming services leading up to the release of Atavista less than a week later. Atavista released as a surprise drop on May 13, alongside a music video for \"Little Foot Big Foot\" directed by Hiro Murai.

    "Richfield Tower (1929)\nZigzag Moderne is a substyle of the architectural Art Deco if the classification established by David Gebhard is used (Robert M. Craig would define the style simply as \"Art Deco\"). The Zigzag style was popular in the 1920s and was replaced by the Streamline Moderne in the 1930s.\nHistory\nGebhard traces the roots of the Zigzag Moderne to the works of Bertram G. Goodhue and Eliel Saarinen, as well as  influence of the emerging International Style and the 1925 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris with its Frank Lloyd Wright's designs. He also notes the diversity of sources between the Zigzag and the succeeding Streamline style, with the latter inspired by the \"machine aesthetic\" of aerodynamic shapes.\nCharacteristics\nGolden chevron decorations on the Eastern Columbia Building (1929)\nGebhard lists the following traits of the Zigzaq Moderne:\nheavy and monumental exterior forms built of smooth surfaces with window openings arranged within inset panels;\nflat roof, no Classical or Gothic termination at the top;\ncentral tower that lowers in steps to the periphery;\ndecorations consist of zigzags, chevrons, sunbursts, spirals, stylized flora and fauna.\nExamples\nBleksmith lists the following examples:\nBullock's Wilshire Department Store (Los Angeles, 1929) by John and Donald Parkinson;\nEastern Columbia Building (Los Angeles, 1929) by Claude Beelman;\nPellissier Building and Wiltern Theatre (Los Angeles, 1930) by Morgan, Walls & Clements;\nRichfield Tower (Los Angeles, 1929) by Stiles O.

The film stars Viktor Dobronravov, Denis Prytkov, Yelizaveta Moryak, Tatyana Sabinova, Alyona Khmelnitskaya, and Tatyana Lyutaeva in supporting roles.\nOnegin was theatrically released in Russia on March 7, 2024, by Cinema Atmosphere Film Distribution.\nPlot\nYevgeny Onegin has a luxurious life, which suddenly tired him. Suddenly he finds out about his uncle's illness and he goes to his village, where he discovers that his uncle is dead. However, Yevgeny was not upset, because his uncle was rich and Yevgeny is his only heir.\nCast\nViktor Dobronravov as Eugene Onegin (also tr.

Filming took place in 2023 in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, among the locations you can see the Pevchesky Bridge, the Sukhanovo estate, and the Great Gatchina Palace.\nAccording to Sarik Andreasyan, it turned out to be impossible to stylize the poetry of Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin under prose, because the characters of the novel speak a language \"unaffordable for the modern ear\", and the screenwriters found a solution thanks to which the poems will sound natural in the frame.\n",
    "\"Bacino\" redirects here. For a Ba\u0107ino village, see B\u00e1tya.\nBacino (in the center). Basilica di San Pietro Apostolo\u00a0, Pisa\nIn architecture, bacini (plural, singular Italian: bacino, IPA: , \"bowl\") are ceramic bowls that were used for decoration in the medieval Europe. The bowls were embedded into the external walls of (mostly religious) buildings and are thus also known as immured vessels. Bacini represent one of the traits of the Pisan Romanesque style. They can also be found in the Byzantine and Gothic buildings.\nTerm\nThe Italian word \"bacini\" is used in many languages in the modern sense - to designate glazed vessels that were not specifically designed as architectural decorations, but were used for that purpose - since at least the 18th-19th centuries. The term does not define a particular type of the vessel that is immured: both bowls and plates had been used as bacini.\nGeography\nRegarding the bacini's origins, most scholars declare them to be a medieval - and European - invention. However, some researchers point to few immured cups found in the buildings of Ostia Antica and Islamic architecture that extensively used the glazed ceramics (but not bacini). Megaw thinks that the practice spread to Italy from the Byzantine empire.\nThe bacini were most popular in Italy, but their use was widespread between late 10th and 15th centuries, primarily in the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. The bowls can be found in the buildings of Spain (Seville, Zaragoza, Calatayud, Teruel), Southern France, Sardinia, and Corsica. In Northern Italy bacini can be found both on the coast and inland, in Liguria, Veneto, Padua, Verona, Lombardy, Ticino (now in Switzerland), Piedmont, Emilia Romagna, Umbria, and Abruzzo. The largest concentration is in Tuscany (especially in the vicinity of Pisa) and Lazio. While common in Rome, very few examples can be found farther south in Campagna, Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily. To the east, bacini appear on the Dalmatian coast (Zadar, Trogir) and continue into the Byzantine territory, including areas of Greece.\nIn Italy, the number of buildings decorated with immured bowls in a single city varies: 4-10 in Milan, Ferrara, Ravenna, Genoa, Lucca, Sassari, Ascoli Piceno, 15 in Pavia and Bologna, more than 20 in Rome and Pisa.\nAfter the 15th century, bacini were used only \"sporadically\".\nSuppliers\nThe bowls were not ordered specifically for decorating the buildings, they were simply selected from regular (and expensive) dishware. There is no evidence of selecting particular drawings or even colors. For a long time the bacini were imported. While Italian pieces appeared in the 13th century (in Liguria), they only started to constitute the majority of the supply since the 14th century (and the importation never stopped). Imported pieces were coming from al-Andalus, Egypt, Maghreb, Balearic Islands, later - from Sicily, Southern Italy, Byzantine Empire. Part of the bacini's attraction apparently came from the exotic sourcing: there were very few cases of bacini used for decoration in places where they were manufactured (like Sicily).\nTechnique\nBacini were used in quantity, buildings with just one  or two installed are rare. Some churches in Pisa (San Piero a Grado, San Martino, Santa Cecilia\u00a0) had over 200 bacini each. The location of bacini in the building varied, but typically they were placed high up: at the clerestory level, in the blind arcades, on the sides of bell towers. Occasionally, the bowls on the facades were arranged into a figure of cross. Five-bacini crosses were popular in Crete, and are quie rare in mainland Greece and Italy. The places for the bacini were designed into the buildings: stones or bricks were cut or shifted to create the space for ceramics; once the piece was placed, the subsequent layers of masonry frequently blocked it in place, thus convincing the future researchers in the contemporaneity of the building and the bowls immured in its walls.\nPisa\nPisa had a special affinity with bacini \u2013 about two thousand of these pieces were installed over five centuries. Hundreds of the bowls survived.\nThe 11th-century churches of Pisa originally had more than four hundred bacini, by 1970, only 146 were remaining. At this time, as part of the conservation work in Pisa, the bacini were removed from the buildings and replaced by replicas, an extensive catalog was published in 1981 (superseded by a new book in 2011). Graziella Berti\u00a0 suggested that the bacini and the initial church construction were contemporaneous, as places were left for these decorations while the buildings were erected. However, since few churches in Pisa date back to the early 11th century (San Piero a Grado, San Zeno, San Matteo\u00a0), this suggestion provide very early chronological dating for the bacini, 50 to 100 years out of alignment with, for example, Spain. All 11th century bowls were sourced from the Islamic territories on the Mediterranean, production in Italy had started in the late 12th century.\nMost of ",
    "American planter and slave trader (~1819\u20131876)\nJosiah Maples (c.\u20091819\u00a0\u2013 September 22, 1876) was a 19th-century cotton plantation owner, bank director, and slave trader of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas in the United States (and the Confederate States during the American Civil War). Maples is notable as a slave-trading business partner of Nathan Bedford Forrest.\nBiography\nJosiah Maples was born in Alabama in approximately 1818 or 1820. In July 1849 Maples was appointed to a \"committee of twenty\" in DeSoto County, Mississippi that produced a resolution that opposed the Wilmot Proviso, protested northern aggression, and \"Resolved, 5th. That while we cherish for the Union a lasting and warm regard, yet, we are not to be frightened from maintaining our just rights by being taunted with the name of disunionist feeling that whatever may be the result of this agitation it is chargeable not only on us who only stand on our rights under the constitution, but on those who have on this subject violated every guaranty of that sacred instrument.\" In 1851 Maples was the treasurer of the Masonic Lodge in DeSoto County. In 1852 the sheriff of Shelby County, Tennessee reported that his jail held a 23-year-old runaway slave named Philip, \"5 feet, 6 or 7 inches high, weighs about 140 pounds; belongs to Josiah Maples, of De Soto county, Miss.\" On or about October 1, 1853, Maples married Mary A. Marshall in Fayette County, Tennessee. On July 15, 1854, Maples patented 40 acres of land in Cherokee County, Alabama.\nMaples was one of three major business partners of slave trader Nathan Bedford Forrest, along with (serially, not simultaneously) Seaborne S. Jones and Byrd Hill. (Forrest's five brothers also worked in the business.) According to a history of DeSoto County, Mississippi produced by the WPA in the late 1930s, \"An interesting fact concerning Gen. Forrest, related by , was his having worked for Josiah Maples in his youth, on the old Evans place, a few miles from Pleasant Hill\". Maples and Forrest were in business together as Forrest & Maples from July 1854 to December 31, 1855.  In November 1854 they sold a nine-year-old girl named Page to Lavinia and Lemuel Smith for $600. On July 9, 1855, they sold Adisson, age 22, to V. Beckworth for $1,000. Also in 1855, Forrest & Maples sold Mary, age 15, for $800. On New Year's 1856 the Maples and Forrest partnership was dissolved. \nAt the time of the 1860 U.S. federal census, Maples, occupation \"planter,\" with personal property valued at $10,000, lived in Redfork Township, Desha County, Arkansas, in a household shared with an overseer, a housekeeper, and their respective families. The slave schedules show that 70 enslaved people worked on Maples' plantation. In March 1861, Maples was elected a director of the Bank of West Tennessee. During the American Civil War he sold some cotton that was later partially burned by Union troops; there was a lawsuit. The case Butler v. Maples \"established that buying cotton through an insurrectionary area through an agent licensed by the Treasury Department was legal\".\nJosiah Maples, last will and testament, made July 20, 1876\nMaples was enumerated as a resident of Desha County, Arkansas during the 1870 census, along with his wife, Mary A. Maples, and their three children, Lizzie, Marshall, and Clement. In 1875 he was described as \"one of the heaviest cotton planters of the Arkansas valley\". In 1876 Maples' primary residence was listed as Red Fork, Arkansas. Red Fork was described as \"a post office and landing on the Arkansas River, thirty miles above its mouth, and four miles from Watson, the county seat of Desha county\". Maples was considered a pioneer of Desha County,  and a leading, if not the leading, citizen of the area of fertile bottomland that was said to \"frequently  two bales of cotton to the acre\".\nMaples died in the Raleigh section of Memphis on September 22, 1876, after a long illness. Maples was buried in Rossville, Tennessee.\nSee also\nForrest's slave jail\nMemphis and Hernando Plank Road\nList of American slave traders\n",
    "Battle during the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\nA battle took place around the village of Mala Tokmachka during the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nBackground\nAt the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Mala Tokmachka quickly became a frontline settlement. The population would drop to only around 200 people by May 2023 due to the proximity of the fighting to the village and consistent Russian shelling which destroyed much of the local infrastructure and utilities. On 13 June 2023, French researcher Philippe Gros referred to the Ukrainian counteroffensive operations south of Mala Tokmachka as a \"major axis\", with the intention of advancing in the direction of the occupied city of Melitopol, which had been captured by Russian forces early into the invasion. David Axe of Forbes wrote that \"perhaps 10,000 or more\" Russian soldiers from the 70th, 291st, 429th, and 503rd Motor Rifle Regiments from the 58th Combined Arms Army's 42nd Guards Motor Rifle Division were stationed on the front lines near Tokmak. The 22nd and 45th Guards Spetsnaz Brigades were also reported by Axe to be in reserve.\nBattle\nOn 7 June 2023, Ukrainian forces would first attempt to push the fighting away from the settlement while the Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade and 33rd Mechanized Brigade totaling 4,000 soldiers, would launch a mechanized assault on the village. Despite being armed with new western equipment, the initial attack went poorly. Russian scouts from the 70th and 291st motor rifle regiments spotted the Ukrainian armored column and called in Ka 52 attack helicopters. The Ukrainian tank column came under anti-tank missile and small arms fire while attempting to cross a minefield outside of the village. Trapped under fire and taking losses, the column retreated. Crews bailed out of their disabled vehicles and dragged dead and wounded with them out of the battlefield. Forbes reported that Ukrainian equipment loses were one IMR-2, a one Leopard 2A6 and as many as nine Bradleys with the some of their crews surviving. The ISW reported that the Russian Ministry of Defense responded to the Ukrainian attack with an uncharacteristic degree of coherency and praised the 42nd Guards Motor Rifle Division, 70th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment and 291st Motor Rifle Regiment for repelling the Ukrainian attack and regaining lost positions.\nOn 8 June, the 47th Mechanized Brigade attempted to use 6 Finnish donated Leopard 2R mine cleaning tanks, a German Wisent and an ex-Soviet BMR-2 to breach the Russian minefield but were forced to abandon 3 of the Leopard 2Rs and both the Wisent and the BMR-2 after one of the Leopard 2Rs struck a TM-62 anti tank mine and Russian helicopters and artillery hit the others vehicles. 50% of the 47th Brigade\u2019s engineer battalion became casualties however, Forbes reported that the unit was still intact citing a video that the battalion posted after the engagement showing a Leopard 2R, two Soviet-style armored tractors fitted with UR-77 rocket-propelled mine clearing charges and a German Wisent.\nOn 9 June, Ukrainian forces launched a second mechanized assault capturing one height near the village. The assault group later came under artillery fire after being spotted by Russian drone operators and were forced to retreat.\nOn 12 June, Aljazeera and Russian milbloggers reported that Russian forces counterattacked Ukrainian positions outside of Mala Tokmachka.\nOn 15 June, Ukrainian Brigadier-General Oleksii Hromov told a media briefing that Ukrainian forces had advanced by up to 3 km (1.8 miles) near Mala Tokmachka.\nOn 21 June, Ukrainian General Staff spokesperson Andriy Kovalev claimed that Ukrainian forces had made several gains around Mala Tokmachka.\nOn 30 June 2023, the Institute for the Study of War reported that the lack of a major breakthrough by Ukrainian forces around Mala Tokmachka would lead to less attacks and the beginning of positional fighting.\nAftermath\nForbes reported that the Battle of Mala Tokmachka was a military disaster for Ukraine with both the 33rd and 47th losing 15% of their soldiers killed or wounded and losing a fifth of Ukraine's M2 Bradleys, a fifth of its Leopard 2A6s and half its Leopard 2Rs with Russian forces in return only suffering light casualties. Photographic evidence showed that at least 4 Leopard 2A6 tanks, 3 Leopard 2R demining tanks, 17 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, and 1 Wisent were destroyed. The battle was also the first documented loss of a Leopard 2 during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Chief master sergeant Valerii Markus of the 47th Mechanized Brigade told critics to \"shut your mouths.\" The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces claimed that 1,900 Russian soldiers died in and around Mala Tokmachka between June 8th and June 10th. Some of the damaged vehicles were later recovered and repaired by Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian sources claimed that Russian forces were inflating Ukrainian equipment losses at Mala To",
    "PA govt office currently missing from Wikipedia\nThe Pennsylvania Office of the Budget is an executive-level agency in Pennsylvania. The office is tasked with developing and managing a balanced financial plan for the commonwealth, aligned with the governor's policies and priorities, while ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. It oversees the annual state budget preparation and implementation, operating through the Governor's Budget Office and the Office of Comptroller Operations. Additionally, it provides administrative services such as budget management, purchasing, and payment services to the commonwealth's executive offices, and manages travel operations for all commonwealth business travelers since 2011.\nHistory\nIn 1923, Governor Gifford Pinchot during his first term gave an inaugural address pledging to organize state government to enhance efficiency and economy.:\u200a403\u200a His plans were eventually carried out in an act called the Administrative Code of 1923:\u200a403\u200a which formalized the state budget process and required the Secretary of the Commonwealth to prepare the budget. In 1925, Governor Pinchot gave the first budget address to the Pennsylvania General Assembly and these addresses continue to this day. During the administration of Pinchot's successor, Governor John S. Fisher, a budget secretary was provided to help with state budget preparation.:\u200a404\u200a The Office of the Budget was formally established within the Governor\u2019s Office by the Administrative Code of 1929. Constitutional changes in 1959 mandated annual sessions of the General Assembly, ending Pennsylvania's two-year budget cycle. The Code was revised again in 1961, establishing annual budgets and setting the fiscal year to begin on July 1.\nBudget impasses\nUnder current law, the governor must submit the budget to the General Assembly by the first full week of February each year or by the first full week of March if it is the governor's first term, and Pennsylvania is legally obligated to pass a balanced budget by June 30 each year. However, it has passed 13 late budgets since 2003 including four impasses that went over 100 days.\nThe impact of budget delays varies annually, but prolonged budget impasses can disrupt state operations significantly. Historically, Pennsylvania has experienced numerous late budgets, affecting local governments, nonprofits, and public schools that depend on state funding. During past impasses, schools canceled programs, state-subsidized pre-K programs shut down, and students at state-related universities faced delays in receiving their in-state discounts. State employees, however, continue to be paid during impasses due to a 2009 state Supreme Court ruling. While this ensures that state services like prisons and parks remain operational, it has shifted the financial strain to local levels. Former governors Ed Rendell and Tom Wolf both faced lengthy budget impasses but noted that the political and practical pressures differ depending on various factors including government division and financial deficits. The most recent impasse was a monthlong delay in 2023 during Governor Josh Shapiro's first term.\nSee also\nList of Pennsylvania state agencies\n",

Graduating from the Royal Academy Schools in 1975, he was elected an associate of the Royal Society of British Artists the same year, becoming a full member in 1976.\nBiography\nCook was born in the fishing town of Grimsby. He studied painting and sculpture at the local Grimsby School of Art, before moving to Maidstone. There, he was taught by painters William Bowyer, Fred Cuming, and Alex Koolman at Maidstone College of Art. Cook was invited to complete a three-year postgraduate course at the Royal Academy Schools in London, where he was influenced by his tutor, the Keeper of the RA Schools and leading portraitist, Peter Greenham. Encouraged by William Bowyer, Cook applied to the Royal Society of British Artists' annual exhibitions, and his work was selected in 1973 and 1974. Cook was then nominated by Bowyer for membership to the society, becoming an associate member in 1975 and promoted to a full member in 1976. In 1980 Cook was invited to hold a solo exhibition at the RA Schools Galleries.\nCook volunteered to demonstrate portraiture and landscape painting for a decade at Art in Action at Waterperry between 1989 and 1999. He later taught at Lancing College between 2007 and 2019. \nCook lives and works in Brighton, East Sussex, with his wife, Christine Cook; they have two daughters, Naomi and Saskia.\nArt\n\u2033I prefer to work from life, often drawing on the spot, making colour notes in the case of landscape or even very basic watercolour sketches to catch the light, colour and atmosphere.\nFor oils, I enjoy working on acrylic gesso primed canvas - linen preferably, with a fairly fine tooth. Drawing basic geometry of the composition in charcoal or soft pencil is the first job, after which I strengthen the line with dark umber. I build up the paint, thick and thin, with hog hair and sable, using a cloth for blending. Landscapes can take days or weeks depending on how much I nag at them.

    "\nSS Skirmisher was a steel tugboat and passenger tender of the Cunard Line built in 1884 for service in the Mersey at Liverpool. She was used in this role through the Cunard-White Star merger until 1941. She was sold for scrap in 1947.\nCareer\nSkirmisher was constructed in 1884 to act as a tender and part time tugboat for the new RMS Umbria and RMS Etruria, which were too big to enter the landing stage in the Mersey at lower tides. Skirmisher was to carry passengers from the docks to these ships. Her machinery was a single ended boiler originally with six furnaces, replaced in 1908 with two boilers. Her engines produced 1,104HP, giving her an average speed of 13 knots.\nIn July 1886, the builder's model of the Skirmisher was up for display at Liverpool, as well as other Cunard vessels. In May 1894, she acted as an escort to Queen Victoria's yacht. She also sailed to Spithead for the 1897 Spithead Naval Review, where she acted as a tender exclusively to the RMS Campania. By 1902, she had permanently replaced the old Satellite as a Liverpool tender.\nDuring the ship's 1908 refit, an extra deck was added, her funnel was heightened, and her old boiler was replaced with 2 slightly smaller but more efficient ones. With this extra deck, it was easier for her to tend to the massive new RMS Mauretania and RMS Lusitania. She continued service in this configuration until 1941.\nIn April 1913, the Skirmisher steamed to the Clyde, to witness the launch of the RMS Aquitania. In 1917, Skirmisher was berthed across the Gladstone Dock gate, to protect the dock from being torpedoed by U-boats. From 1922 until 1923, she was used as a tender on the river Clyde as part of the Cunard-Anchor Line joint service.\nWar Service\nDuring the May Blitz in 1941, the SS Malakand was docked in Liverpool nearby the Skirmisher. When Makaland exploded, the bridge on the Skirmisher was completely destroyed by flying debris, and the mast pierced Skirmisher's hull, and quickly sank. She was refloated, and converted into a fireboat, where she could pump 100 tons of water per hour. In 1944, she visited Fishguard to serve the RMS Queen Mary, with Winston Churchill on board. Due to bad weather, the Queen Mary diverted to the Clyde, and Skirmisher returned to the Mersey.\nShe was withdrawn from service in October 1945, and her upper superstructure and remaining fittings were stripped. She was towed to Garston in March, 1947 where her hull was broken up for scrap.\n",
    "Val des \u00c9coliers or Grand Val was a house of Augustinian canons in Verbiesles in the diocese of Langres. Initially a priory, it was raised to an abbey in 1539 by Pope Paul III.\nIt was founded in 1201 by William the Englishman, a doctor at the University of Paris, and three colleagues. In 1212, Bishop Guillaume de Joinville granted them property in the valley of the Marne. In 1215, he approved the foundation of a monastery. They followed the Rule of Saint Augustine and their statutes were inspired by those of the Abbey of Saint-Victor, Paris. Although the monastery was dedicated to Our Lady, it attracted so many scholars from Paris that it became known as Vallis scholarium, the valley of scholars or val des \u00e9coliers. In 1219, with the approval of Pope Honorius III, it became the mother house of a new Augustinian order, the \u00c9coliers du Christ\u00a0.\nIn 1234, under Prior Manasses, the monastery was moved 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) down the valley to land donated by Bishop Robert de Thorotte. The original site became known as Vieux-Val and the new as Grand-Val. The old site was not forgotten and pilgrimage processions were regularly led to it.\nThe ch\u00e2teau around 1900\nIn 1469, Pope Paul II granted it exemption from the authority of the bishop of Langres. In the 16th century, it was frequently placed in commendam. In 1636, Abbot Laurent Michel united the order to the Congregation of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve. A new abbey was constructed in the 17th century, but the buildings were mostly destroyed during the French Revolution. What remains of them was incorporated into a private residence. Known as the Ch\u00e2teau du Val des \u00c9coliers, it was given by Charles Bourlon de Rouvre\u00a0 to John Joseph Pershing for use as his headquarters during World War I.\nNotes\n^ a b c d Didier 2003.\n^ Sullivan 2007, p.\u00a0375.\n^ Guyon 1998, pp.\u00a063\u201366.\n^ Greenwood 2021, p.\u00a0486.\nBibliography\nDidier, J.

    "\nAlmudena Carracedo Verde (born 1972) is a Spanish filmmaker. She received an Emmy Award in 2008 for Made in L.A., which was praised by The New York Times as \"an excellent documentary about the most basic human dignity.\" In 2019, she received the Goya Award for best documentary film for The Silence of Others.\nBiography\nAlmudena Carracedo was born in Madrid and earned a licentiate in audiovisual communication at the Complutense University. She continued her training at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. She and Robert Bahar are co-owners of the Brooklyn-based Semilla Verde Productions Ltd.\nIn 2009, after the success of their documentary Made in L.A., she received the Estela Award from the National Association of Latino Independent Producers (NALIP), and in the following years she obtained scholarships from several organizations that support film and documentary production: United States Artists (2009), Sundance Institute and Time Warner Foundation (2012), Creative Capital (2012), and a Guggenheim Fellowship in the Creative Arts (2015).\nCarracedo and Bahar next set out to film a documentary about the silenced victims of Francoist Repression in Spain. The result, titled The Silence of Others, which they had worked on for six years, premiered in the Panorama section of the 68th Berlin International Film Festival in 2018, where it received the Audience Award and the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation's Peace Film Prize. In August 2018, it was nominated for a European Film Award.\nIn 2024, Carracedo and Bahar's documentary You Are Not Alone: Fighting the Wolf Pack\u00a0, on the La Manada rape case, premiered on Netflix and in Spanish theaters.\nCarracedo has been a juror at numerous festivals, including the Valladolid International Film Week (SEMINCI), Silverdocs, and the Santiago International Documentary Festival, as well as a delegate of the documentary section at the Association of Women Filmmakers and Audiovisual Media\u00a0.\nIn addition to her work as a filmmaker, Carracedo teaches classes and workshops at several universities, and is a part-time lecturer on documentary production at New York University in Madrid.\nAwards and recognition\n2008: News and Documentary Emmy for Made in L.A.\n2009: NALIP Estela Award for Made in L.A.\n2019: Goya Award for best documentary film for The Silence of Others\n2019: School Jury Prize at the Spanish Film Festival in Nantes for The Silence of Others\nIllinois Wesleyan University recognized Carracedo with an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 2011. During a subsequent visit to the campus in 2019, she expressed her outlook as a filmmaker:\nTelling people to fight for their dreams is too simple because there are so many people who don't have the luxury or the privilege to fight for their dreams. In parts of our lives, there are moments where we have to fight for our dignity, whether it's at work or at home with our political views, our sexual orientation.

    "\n1997 studio album by Kirsten Br\u00e5ten Berg, Solo Cissokho, Kouame Sereba, Bj\u00f8rgulv Straume\nFr\u00e5 Senegal til Setesdal is a world music album made by a quartet consisting of Norwegian folk musicians Kirsten Br\u00e5ten Berg and Bj\u00f8rgulv Straume, Senegalese folk musician Solo Cissokho and Ivorian folk musician Kouame Sereba. It was released on Grappa in 1997.\nBerg and Sereba performed the vocals. Berg and Straume played mouth harp, Cissokho kora and Sereba djembe and do-do.\nProduction and release\nThe quartet was brought together by Rikskonsertene for an ad hoc promotional performance in 1995, and later booked to a festival at Cosmopolite by the same institution. The recording took place in 1996, produced by Hallvard Kv\u00e5le in Oslo Lydstudio.\nThe album was released by way of a mini tour of Norway, spanning Troms\u00f8, Bod\u00f8, Trondheim, Lillehammer, Sandefjord and Arendal. NRK made a music video for \"H\u00e5var Heddi/Goe\".\nReception\nThe album received several good reviews. Bladet Troms\u00f8 gave a dice throw of 6, the highest score, for the highly effective mixture of different folk traditions. The music was \"almost ingenious in its simplicity\". Competing Troms\u00f8 newspaper Nordlys was positive as well. Hordaland praised the \"unmitigated beauty\" of the music. Agderposten, issuing a dice throw of 5, wrote that the music probably took time to digest, but that the listener would find \"very beautiful music for ear and soul\". It was also highly \"visual\", aiding the mental imagery of the listener. The juxtaposition of styles was original and authentic, and the music was danceable, but some of the songs were too stretched, nearing the 10-minute mark. Aftenposten found the song length necessary, since the purpose probably was to catch the improvisation that took place in the studio.\nA number of outlets issued a dice throw of 4 (of 6). Bergensavisen only found the record worthy of the dice throw 3, stating that the album became uniform and only would catch the interest of the \"particularly inclined\". Dag og Tid found that the project would have been more \"original and exciting\" in the 1980s. Nationen found that although the album veered on the verge of uniformity, and was \"maybe somewhat polished around the edges\", the reviewer deemed the project successful.\nTrack listing\n\"Tiramakan\"/\"Eg vippa meg\" \u2013 3:44\n\"H\u00e5v\u00e5r Heddi\"/\"Goe\" \u2013 5:40\n\"Bitilo\" \u2013 4:28\n\"Lill Lisa\" \u2013 3:42\n\"Atolago\" \u2013 2:08\n\"Horpa\"/\"Kono\" \u2013 9:33\n\"Jegerleik\" \u2013 4:09\n\"Sord\u00f8len\"/\"Kody Nadioulo\" \u2013 7:15\n\"Uppstaden\" \u2013 3:16\n\"Kouami Ba\" \u2013 3:02\n\"B\u00e5nsullar\"/\"Ding Ding Ide\" \u2013 2:59\n\"Halling Jorond\" \u2013 2:21\n\"Tveit\u00e5en\"/\"Djatto\" \u2013 4:21\n",
    "American attorney\nSharon Fast Gustafson is an American attorney who served as General Counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 2019 to 2021.\nEarly life and education\nGustafson earned a BA in English from Bob Jones University in 1980. She then graduated with honors from Georgetown Law Center in 1991.\nAdvocacy\nGustafson specializes in employment law, primarily representing employees with discrimination and benefits claims. She successfully litigated the 2015 pregnancy discrimination case Young v. United Parcel Service to the U.S. Supreme Court. She served as counsel for Peggy Young, the case's plaintiff, for eight years. According to the Harvard Business Review, the ruling makes it \"significantly more likely that pregnant women denied workplace accommodations will succeed in their legal claims against the employers who denied them.\"\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\nNomination and tenure\nGustafson was confirmed as General Counsel of the EEOC by the United States Senate on August 1, 2019. Several human rights advocacy organizations including the Human Rights Campaign and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights opposed her nomination citing that she would be \"unwilling or reluctant to preserve the EEOC\u2019s critical mission of defending LGBT people.\" During a confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, she refused to answer whether she believes that discriminating against LGBT workers is a form of unlawful sex bias per the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\nHer tenure was characterized by prioritizing fighting religious discrimination in the workplace.\nOn March 5, President Joe Biden fired Gustafson from her EEOC post. Her Senate-confirmed term had originally been set to run through 2023. The White House had requested her resignation on March 2, and terminated her formally upon her refusal to do so.\nHer termination was opposed by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a conservative political advocacy organization\u00a0that opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. Conservative writer Rod Dreher called the move a \"blow to religious liberty.\" Biden's decision was praised by liberal observers.\nRepublican Congresswoman Virginia Foxx alleged that Gustafson's firing constituted \"partisan warfare.\" Trump-appointed EEOC Commissioner Andrea Lucas added that the move threatened the \"independence\" of the agency. Conversely, Gustafson's predecessor David Lopez countered that in fact it was Gustafson who was violating established norms by not resigning, and that presidents have latitude to choose people for senior roles at the commission.\n",
    "1933 anti-communist attack in California\nThe LAPD Red Squad raid on the John Reed Club art show raid took place in Los Angeles, California, United States, on Saturday, February 11, 1933. The LAPD Red Squad, the police department's anti-radical unit, crashed a political meeting and art show hosted by a number of leftist organizations. Red Squad members destroyed several works of art in a manner that suggested racial animus as well as anti-communist motive.\nArt show\nThe event in question was a multiracial affair at which Los Angeles leftists had gathered to publicize the plight of and to express support for the Scottsboro Boys. The sponsors were Puroretaria Geijutsu Kai (Japanese Proletarian Art Club), Rodo Shimbun, and the Horiuchi Tetsuji Japanese branch of the Los Angeles International Labor Defense. The venue was the Communist-affiliated John Reed Club in Hollywood, located at 1743 N. New Hampshire Avenue between Franklin Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. A handbill later claimed that 450 people were guests at the event. Open Forum, the newsletter of the Los Angeles branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), reported that 200 people were present. As the crowd moved from a theater space to an auditorium for a dance, Red Hynes and his Red Squad burst in the building, smashing doors. The police were apparently assisted by civilian gentlemen wearing American Legion caps. Hynes claimed that LAPD officers present had actually \"intervened to prevent an attack by American Legionnaires\".\nThe LAPD cleared out the building and arrested Karl Yoneda (then known as Karl Hama), who had been the evening's emcee. Loren Miller, an African-American attorney, was present at the event. According to an article about his lifetime of social activism and communist leanings, \"The Club paid for a hall and the audience began to gather, 'when up steps the Red Squad and lets us know that the thing was off.' Miller had a bitter face to face confrontation with a cop afterwards who had told him to leave the scene.\"\nReproduction of Reuben Kadish mural, note on verso: \"R.K. 1932? Destroyed by LA police Dept Raid by 'Red' Hynes\" (Smithsonian Archives of American Art 17084)\nThe Red Squad then turned its attention to portable \"frescos on cement\" created by Bloc of Painters artists Philip Guston, Reuben Kadish, Harold Lehman, Murray Hantman, and Luis Arenal for the Negro America show, which was intended to highlight the racist railroading of the Scottsboro Boys as well as other racial justice issues in the United States. The paintings were confrontational \"if somewhat aesthetically unsophisticated, images deploring the recent increase in the United States of atrocities against African Americans. Among the situations pictured were a black man hanging from a tree, the whipping of an African American by a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and a rapt white audience awaiting the imminent demise of a 'boy' tied to a stake while flames licked at his feet.\" According to a history of Japanese-American activism during the 1930s, the Red Squad seemed \"to have been especially disturbed by a mural painted by the Japanese Proletarian Art Club symbolizing cross-racial solidarity. Underneath a bilingual English-Japanese banner reading 'Workers of the World Unite' was a large painting of the Scottsboro Boys.\" Eyewitnesses described the Red Squad firing bullets into the foreheads of \"each of the nine defendants\" depicted in Murray Hantman's mural. Guston described the policemen also aiming for the genitals and eyes of the images of Alabama defendants. All told, a dozen artworks were destroyed.\nAftermath\nThe artists and attendees were disregarded when they went to the press and the courts about the incident. The media described the Communist and leftist-aligned partygoers as \"misguided individuals\", and \"a reactionary judge dismissed their case\" when they tried to sue. When members of the John Reed Club and the Workers Ex-Service Men's League protested the raid in front of the Los Angeles City Council, the Red Squad was there to eject them, along the way taking the time to pummel lawyer Leo Gallagher, \"leaving him with broken glasses and two black eyes\". For their part, the Red Squad proudly claimed that the raid was a successful attack on \"Japanese militarist elements\". Hynes, the captain of the Red Squad, released a statement that the \"so-called harmless writers and artists club the John Reed club of Hollywood is in reality just another communist tentacle, reaching into the artistic and intellectual life of Los Angeles. The so-called Japanese Press Conference, who were to hold a 'chop suey and social', are, in reality, a group of Japanese communists and the entire event was for the purpose of raising money for the Rodo Shibum, official Japanese communist newspaper published in San Francisco\". In 1934, Arthur Millier, art critic for the arch-conservative Los Angeles Times (Harry Chandler was all but a personal sponsor of the Red Squad), wrote a column about a",
    "Spanish municipal election\nThe 2027 Madrid City Council election, also the 2027 Madrid municipal election, will be held on Sunday, 23 May 2027, to elect the 13th City Council of the municipality of Madrid. All 57 seats in the City Council will be up for election. The election will be held simultaneously with regional elections in at least eight autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain.\nElectoral system\nThe City Council of Madrid (Spanish: Ayuntamiento de Madrid) is the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Madrid, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain are fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly is on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprises all nationals over 18 years of age, registered and residing in the municipality of Madrid and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national European citizens and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty.\nLocal councillors are elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of five percent of valid votes\u2014which includes blank ballots\u2014being applied in each local council. Councillors are allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale:\nThe mayor is indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause requires that mayoral candidates earn the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly is to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the appointee will be determined by lot.\nCouncil composition\nThe table below shows the composition of the political groups in the City Council at the present time.\nParties and candidates\nThe electoral law allows for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors need to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they seek election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Madrid, as its population is over 1,000,001, at least 8,000 signatures are required.\nBelow is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which will likely contest the election:\nOpinion polls\nThe tables below list opinion polling results in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \"Lead\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a poll.\nVoting intention estimates\nThe table below lists weighted voting intention estimates. Refusals are generally excluded from the party vote percentages, while question wording and the treatment of \"don't know\" responses and those not intending to vote may vary between polling organisations. When available, seat projections determined by the polling organisations are displayed below (or in place of) the percentages in a smaller font; 29 seats are required for an absolute majority in the City Council of Madrid.\nNotes\n^ a b Within Sumar.\n",
    "Baby, I Couldn't See was a 1969 single for The Foundations. It enjoyed some popularity in the Netherlands there where it was a chart hit. It has been recorded by a number of other artists in the early 1970s which include, a number of South American acts, a Mexican band, and a New Zealand band.\nBackground\nIn addition to the version by The Foundations, New Zealand group Quincy Conserve recorded their version of the song. Somehow, the song was credited to Macleod and Macaulay who the group had a previous partnership with. It was also covered by Brazilian bands, The Pops and Os Selvagens, and included on both of their albums, Rea\u00e7\u00e3o! and  Os Selvagens that were released in 1970. Instrumental artist, Lafayette also recorded a version which appeared on his 1970 album, Apresenta Os Sucessos - Vol. 9. A Mexican group called Las Lineas Blancas (aka The White Lines) recorded a version which appeared on their 1971 album released on Harmony HLS-8570.\nThe Foundations version\nThe song features Colin Young on lead vocals.\nComposition and production\nBarry Class' Trend record label had taken on two new songwriters who had left Southern Music to come on board in 1969. They were David Myers and John Worsley. Together they wrote \"Baby, I Couldn't See\" for The Foundations. The recording session which was a Trend Production had Barry Class as executive producer. It took place under the direction of Eric Allendale who was the Foundations trombonist and Worsley. Allendale had also been employed by Trend as a producer since 1968. It is possible that Allendale was an uncredited producer on this track.\n\"Baby, I Couldn't See\" was backed with the Colin Young composition \"Penny Sir\" and released on single, Pye 7N 17849 on 7 November 1969.\nReception\nThe song was reviewed in the \"Blind Date\" section of the November 8, 1969 issue of Melody Maker by Steve Marriott of Small Faces and Jerry Shirley. Jerry asked if it was The Foundations and said that he tried to cheat but couldn't read the writing. Steve said that he could see it at the Top of the Pops but said that he thought that \"they\" weren't that knocked out with it because \"they\" could do better.\nIt was also reviewed in the November 8 issue of New Musical Express by Derek Johnson. He mentioned that the Foundations had dissolved their partnership with their Macaulay, Macleod song writing team. The chart potential was noted. Johnson also mentioned that their previous single which was a ballad, and a thoroughly competent disc that just didn't catch on. This song had reverted to their happy effervescent style. He said that this could put them back in the chart.\nAn article appeared in the November 15 issue of New Musical Express about the B side of the single, \"Penny Sir\" which was composed by Colin Young. It explained that the song was being adopted as the official song for the Save the Children Fund. The group was donating the royalties from \"Penny Sir\" to the fund as well as performance royalties. The Foundations were also planning a concert at the Royal Albert Hall to support the cause.\nChart\nIt was a hit in Holland where it registered on to the Dutch Tipparade chart. Peaking at no. 8 on week three, It stayed in the chart for four weeks.\nChart summary\nPerformances\nThe song was performed for the Top of the Pops radio show on November 19, 1969. There was also an interview on that show.\nLater years\nSome five decades later, the song was performed live by Alan Warner's Foundations in 2020.\n",
    "Indian cricket competition (1923\u20131930)\nThe Lahore Tournament was an Indian cricket competition, nominally annual, that was held in each of the seasons from 1922/23 to 1929/30, apart from 1926/27. A total of 18 matches were played, all first-class and all at the Lawrence Gardens ground in Lahore. The format was similar to the Bombay Quadrangular and the Madras Presidency Match as the competing teams were the Europeans, the Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs. The Sikhs were unique to the Lahore Tournament and their team withdrew after the 1925/26 edition.\nThere was not a Parsis team in Lahore where, unlike in Bombay and Karachi, their community was too small. Ramachandra Guha has commented on the \"fluidity\" of communities in that the Sikhs in Bombay were willing to play for the Hindus team there, but not in Lahore which had been their capital until 1840.\nThe 1922/23 tournament was won by the Europeans, whose team included Wilfred Rhodes. In the final, they defeated the Muslims by 169 runs, although Rhodes scored only 14 runs (8 and 6). He did take five wickets in the match (3 for 31 and 2 for 36) but the Europeans' match-winner was fast-medium bowler Frederick Shaw, a British Army officer, who took fourteen wickets (7 for 30 and 7 for 53). Rhodes spent six winter seasons in India during the 1920s, his patron being Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, later the founder of the Ranji Trophy.\nThe Muslims reached the final again in 1923/24 and this time were successful as they defeated the Hindus by 4 wickets. Their best player was Abdus Salaam, who took 6 for 69 and 6 for 81. The Muslims won again in 1924/25, defeating Patiala's Sikhs by 6 wickets. They tried for a hat-trick of victories in 1925/26, but the final against the Europeans ended in a draw after the second day was lost to rain. Their all-rounder Syed Nazir Ali, who later played Test cricket for India, had an outstanding match nonetheless. He took 7 for 93 in the first innings, when the Europeans were all out for 292. He then scored 105 as the Muslims made 272. The Europeans struggled to 83 for 6 as time ran out and Nazir Ali took 2 for 27.\nThere was no tournament in 1926/27 and, when it returned in 1927/28, the Sikhs had withdrawn so that it became a triangular event. The Hindus (328 and 20/0) won in 1927/28, convincingly defeating the Muslims (177 and 167) by 10 wickets. The 1928/29 final was the most one-sided of all as the Muslims thrashed the Europeans by an innings and 74 runs. The Europeans won the toss and decided to bat first, but they were bowled out for 105, Mohammad Jahangir Khan, still only 19 years old, taking 6 for 49. The Muslims then amassed 389/2 declared after an unbroken third wicket partnership of 246 by Syed Wazir Ali (153 not out) and Feroz-ud-din (140 not out). The Europeans did better in their second innings and doubled their previous total by scoring 210 all out, Jahangir Khan taking 4 for 48 for a match return of 10 for 97. In the last-ever tournament, 1929/30, the Muslims (183 and 96/7) retained their title with a hard-fought three-wicket victory over the Hindus (100 and 178).\n",
    "Welsh Calvinistic Methodist minister\nHenry Rees (15 February 1798 \u2013 18 February 1869) was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist leader.\nBiography\nRees was the eldest son of David Rees of Chwibren Isaf in the parish of Llansannan, Denbighshire, and Anne (Williams) of Cefn Fforest. He was born on 15 February 1798. William Rees (1802\u20131883) was his brother. His father, who moved in a short time to Rhyd Loew, and thence to Cae Du in the same district, was a lay officer of the Calvinistic Methodist connection, and Henry showed at an early age a deep interest in religious work. In May 1816 he left home to take employment on a farm near Bettws Abergele, and while in this district, in the spring of 1819, began to preach. Resolving to devote himself to the Calvinistic Methodist ministry, he came home to Cae Du in May, and then placed himself for two years under the tuition of Thomas Lloyd of Abergele. It was not the practice of the ministers of his connection at this time to depend wholly on the ministry for support, and accordingly, in 1821, he went to Shrewsbury to learn bookbinding. In the following year he was persuaded by his friends in that town to accept instead the charge of the Calvinistic Methodist church there in return for his maintenance. He was ordained to the full work of the ministry at Bala on 13 June 1827, and on 20 October 1830 married Mary Roberts of Shrewsbury (d. 1879). During his stay in Shrewsbury Rees rapidly won a position as one of the foremost preachers of his connection, and from this time until his death was almost always to be heard at the great preaching meetings of the North Wales Association. At the end of 1836 he accepted the superintendence of the Calvinistic Methodist churches in Liverpool, where he spent the rest of his life. He died on 18 February 1869 at Benarth, near Conway, his son-in-law's house, and was buried in Llan Dysilio churchyard, near Menai Bridge. He left one daughter, Anne, the wife of Mr. Richard Davies of Treborth, lord lieutenant of Anglesey.\nRees devoted himself to the two duties of preaching and connectional administration. After the death of John Elias in 1841 he was for a quarter of a century the recognised leader of the Calvinistic Methodists of North Wales, and had the largest share in forming the policy of the northern association. As a preacher he had scarcely a rival in the denomination, his sermons being marked by careful preparation, closeness of texture, and purity of diction, coupled with great earnestness and force. He distrusted rhetorical effect. A selection of his sermons was published at Holywell, in three volumes (1872, 1875, 1881).\n",
    "Former royal palace in Hannover and main building of the Leibniz University Hanover\nThe Welfenschloss in Hanover\nThe Welfenschloss with the surrounding Welfengarten from the air\nThe Welfenschloss (English: Guelph palace) is a former royal palace in Hanover, Germany, which serves as the main building of the Leibniz University Hannover. The university is housed in the palace since 1879. The palace is surrounded by a large English landscape garden, named the Welfengarten (English: Guelph garden).\nHistory\nKing George V\nSchloss Monbrillant in 1850, which previously occupied the site\nNew royal residence\nIn 1856, king George V of Hanover (1819\u20131878) decided to build a new royal residence. Initially, only as a summer residence, but later intended as the main seat replacing the Leineschloss in the city center. The king engaged the architect Christian Heinrich Tramm (1819\u20131861) to make the designs in neo-Gothic style. When Tramm passed away, he was replaced by the construction manager of the project, Eduard Heidelberg.\nThe site of the palace of previously occupied by another palace, Schloss Monbrilliant. This palace dated from the first half of the 18th century. It served as a summer residence of kings Ernest Augustus (1771\u20131851) and George V. Before the building started of the new palace, it was demolished. It was rebuilt in Georgsmarienh\u00fctte, before it finally was teared down in 1923.\nConstruction of the Welfenschloss palace started in 1857. Workers used yellowish-white sandstone from the Danndorf and Velpke areas near Helmstedt, one of the hardest sandstones in Germany, and sandstone from Nesselberg near Nesselberg.\nThe bronze lions guarding the entrance\nThe palace was initially named Schloss K\u00f6nigsitz, but in 1861 this was changed into Welfenschloss after the reigning dynasty, the House of Welf, of which the House of Hanover was the surviving branch. This also determined the iconography of the palace. On the side of the garden, the Welfengarten, the exterior is decorated with sculptures of eight significant Welf rulers. The sculptor Wilhelm Engelhard created around 1862 the most important one, that of Henry the Lion (1129/1131-1195). On the entrance side, Adolf Rosenthal created the bronze Lions.\nPlan of the first floor before the rebuilding to University\nGeorge V's reign ended as a result of the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, after which Prussia annexed Hanover. Construction works ended, leaving the Welfenschloss palace empty for over a decade.\nIn the same time as the Welfenschloss was built, king George V also constructed another neo-gothic castle between 1858 and 1867, Marienburg castle. This he presented as a birthday present to his wife, queen Marie (1818\u20131907).\nUniversity of Hanover\nThe Welfenschloss around 1895\nMap of the palace and the surrounding Welfengarten in 1918\nIt was not until 1879 that a new purpose was found for the palace: the Higher Vocational School moved in, now named the University of Hanover. Extensive renovations works were performed by Hermann Hunaeus to transform the palace into a school building. In 1899, emperor Wilhelm II elevated the school the status of a university.\nDuring the Allied aerial raids on Hanover, the chapel on the east side of the palace was heavily damaged. In 1955, it was demolished. On its location, an extension was erected between 1956 and 1958 to house an auditorium and a lecture hall.\nIn 2006, the University of Hanover was renamed Leibniz University Hannover.\nSaxon Steed\nIn front of the palace, there is a bronze statue of a Saxon Steed (German: Sachsenross), created in 1866. It is a duplicate from a sculpture made by Albert Wolf for the entrance of the Altes Museum in Berlin, the L\u00f6wenk\u00e4mpfer. The Saxon Steed is a heraldic motif associated with the German provinces of Lower Saxony and Westphalia, and the Dutch region of Twente.\nPanorama\n The Welfenschloss today as the main building of the Leibniz University Hanover\n",
    "Football club\nSV Steinbach 1920 eV is a German sports club based in the Steinbach district of the Hessian market town of Burghaun in the Fulda district.\nHistory\nFootball\nFounding and pre-war period (1920 \u2013 1945)\nThe club was founded under the name Gymnastics and Football Club Steinbach in the Walk inn in Steinbach on June 20, 1920. A few years later the name of the club was changed to Sportverein Steinbach 1920 . At first, the club played its football games on improvised fields. There was no fixed venue and so the club constantly changed venues. In 1924 it was accepted into the C class of the H\u00fcnfeld district .\nAt the beginning of the 1930s, the 18-year-old player Anselm Henkel was so seriously injured during a game in K\u00fcnzell that he died as a result of these injuries. Because of the death, many older players left the club, which initially had difficulty compensating for this loss. However, before the outbreak of the Second World War, a few friendly games were played against neighboring communities; shortly after the outbreak, play came to a complete standstill.\nEstablishment in the post-war period (1945 \u2013 1993)\nAfter the end of the World War, the first friendly games were played again in 1945. In 1947, H\u00fcnfeld was accepted into the B class and thus returned to regular league operations. Promotion to the A class (then the 8th league) was celebrated in 1951, in which the club was able to stay for two seasons until it was relegated back to the B class in 1953 . They were promoted again in 1956 and relegated again in 1959. In 1971 the team was promoted to the district class and created euphoria. More than 1,000 paying spectators regularly attended the home games. In 1974 the team was relegated to the A class again, but a season later Steinbach reported again from the district class . This rescue only lasted for one season, as the team was relegated again in 1976. It wasn't until 1985 that they were promoted back to the district class. A year later, the team played in a friendly against Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen, which was lost 14\u20130 in front of 800 spectators. The following year they were relegated to the A-Class again . In 1990 the club was awarded the Sepp-Herberger Medal by Werner Kiel for the work it had done, particularly in the area of youth . In 1993 the team was promoted back to the district league .\nSeveral ascents up to the present day (2000 \u2013 present)\nIn 2001 they were promoted to the national league . After two seasons, however, they were relegated back to the district league in 2003. Three seasons later, Steinbach had to go back down to the district league, whereupon immediate promotion was achieved in 2007 with 80 points. In the same year, the M\u00fchlengrund team was also voted team of the year in East Hesse . In 2008, the SVS was promoted to the Hessen Nord association league again and thus made it through. Previously, the team was once again the superior champion of the group league (then: district league) with 83 points. In 2013, the youth department joined the Burghaun youth development association . The 2016/17 season saw promotion to the Hessenliga for the first time . With 36 points, the first season in Hesse's Beletage ended in 14th place. In the next season, however, the team was relegated as bottom of the table with only 15 points. In the 2018/19 season, they were promoted back to the Hessenliga.\nExternal links\nhttps://sportverein-steinbach.com/\n",

    "Binary pair of distant galaxies in Canes Venatici constellation\nNGC 5098 are a binary pair of distant galaxies located in Canes Venatici constellation. They are made up of one Type E elliptical galaxy, PGC 46529 or NGC 5098 NED01 located east and one Type ES-0 lenticular galaxy, PGC 46515 or NGC 5098 NED02 located west. Both galaxies are located 559 million light-years away from the Solar System and were discovered on April 29, 1827, by John Herschel.\nCharacteristics\nNGC 5098 belongs to the NGC 5098 galaxy group which is located some 560 million light-years away. They are the central galaxy pair, first identified by Ramella et al. 1995 \"their group 80.\"  NGC 5098 NED01 is the brighter and larger of the two, showing optical magnitudes of MB = \u221221.131 and MV = \u221222.097, as compared to MB = \u221220.845 and MV = \u221221.770 for NGC 5098 NED02, which the magnitudes were calculated from Sloan Digital Sky Survey by Adelman-McCarthy and converted to Johnson filter system via the relations provided by Smith et al.\nNGC 5098 NED01 hosts an extended radio source, B2 1317+33 which was detected at several frequencies. A study showed there is evidence of gas swooshing and active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating up which the most likely contributor is the nearby galaxy, NGC 5098 NED02 which is being stripped of its gaseous atmosphere. Significant cavities are present in the central region, which two distinctive bubbles are located north and northeast. They are similar to X-ray observations of other galaxies, groups and clusters. These are formed when active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets push into local ICM, evacuating cavities and creating bright rims of X-ray emission from displaced gas.\nA plume of emission is seen extending northeast from NGC 5098 NED01, exhibiting a spiral arm morphology which originates east from the galaxy and wrapping around to the north. This presence of a feature indicates NGC 5098 NED01 is indeed interacting with NGC 5098 NED02.\nApart from that, there is a sharp surface brightness to west, southwest and south, which is approximately 28 kpc from the central AGN of NGC 5098 NED01. It appears to go eastwards and define the outer boundaries of the arm, adding to the overall impression of the spiral pattern in diffuse emission. The edges are quite similar to features that are seen from cold fronts generated by gas sloshing in observations and stimulations of galaxy clusters and groups.\nA study shows NGC 5098 NED02, does not show any traces of associate emission in X-rays, implying it was stripped of gas. It is possible NGC 5098 NED02 after being ram-pressured stripped and passing east of NGC 5098 NED01 might have circled around it and now moving east, creating a conical wake in diffuse emission.\n",
    "German painter killed in Auschwitz\nLucy Ortlepp's home in 2014\nstumbling-stone dedicated to Lucy Ortlepp\nLucy Ortlepp (born Lucy Bock 2 February 1883 in Neubrandenburg, died 30 August 1943 in Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp) was a German painter of Jewish descent.\nLife\nLucy Bock was the daughter of a wealthy merchant. She did not receive regular admission to a university at the beginning of the 20th century; such admission was not usually granted to women at the time. At the age of 16, she moved to Berlin to join the Association of Berlin Women Artists, which was self-organised by women, and began studying art and painting privately. Two years later, she completed her training as a drawing teacher. She then undertook study trips to Switzerland, Italy and England. When she returned to Berlin, she continued her studies with Lovis Corinth. She was primarily interested in portraits and still lifes and used pencil, chalk, red chalk and watercolours. It was probably in Berlin that she met the budding librarian Paul Ortlepp. After he graduated in 1907, the couple married in 1908. Lucy Ortlepp gave Weimar drawing and painting lessons. When she married, she converted to Christianity and became a Protestant, but in the eyes of the National Socialists this did not compensate for her Jewish origins. The couple suffered reprisals from 1933 onwards. In 1937, Paul Ortlepp, who did not want to separate from his wife, was given early retirement. An attempt to emigrate to Switzerland in the spring of 1939 failed. He was not at home when his wife was arrested in 1943 and then deported to Auschwitz via Theresienstadt. She was murdered in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp.\nAround 1927/28, the Haus Trettner was built at Ratstannenweg 21 in Weimar in the style of the Bauhaus. The now listed house was bought by the Ortlepp couple in 1930. A Stolperstein was set into the pavement in front of the house for Lucy Ortlepp.\nBibliography\nSebastian Krumbiegel and others: Stolperstein Geschichten Weimar, Eckhaus-Verlag, Weimar 2016\n",
    "Cuban politician and army colonel\nRosendo Collazo was a former Cuban-born senator, retired army colonel, and veteran of the Cuban War of Independence.\nBiography\nRosendo Collazo was born around 1875 in the Camag\u00fcey Province of Cuba.\nHe joined the national army of Cuba in the 1890s and fought during the third Cuban War of Independence. He distinguished himself as an aide to General Antonio Maceo against the Spaniards in Havana. On December 8, 1897, he signed a proclamation with other Cuban military officers and civil leaders in Havana protesting against Spain's sovereignty over Cuba. By 1898, Collazo was in the Cuban Army with the rank of colonel. On Feb 2, 1898, a detachment of Spanish Cavalry engaged with an insurgent force under Collazo, at the Aguayo Plantation in Havana Province. 4 insurgents were captured by the Spaniards who also wounded seven men. In 1906, rebels in Havana were defeated by the government forces commanded by General Alfredo Rego and Collazo in the Tapaste Hills. After two hours of firing, the government troops made a machete charge. One of the Cuban army officers was killed in the altercation, while Collazo and another corporal were wounded.\nDuring the War of 1912, a detachment of troops under the Cuban Army Major defeated 10 insurgents in a battle near El Cobre.\nFollowing the 1916 Cuban general election, liberals contested conservative Cuban president Mario Garc\u00eda Menocal's re-election, sparking a military insurgency. Liberal insurgent forces including Gerardo Machado were defeated at the Battle of Caicaje. In March 1917, Collazo and another colonel commanded the government forces that captured former Cuban President Jose Miguel Gomez and almost his entire command in Placetas.\nCollazo was regarded as a tactical expert and a student of military affairs. The Cuban army officers referred to him as the \"hero of Caicaje,\" a title that he earned after capturing Jose Miguel Gomez. In August 1917, he toured the United States to learn the workings of the U.S. Army's selective draft by President Mario Garc\u00eda Menocal's order. At the commemoration of Cuba's sixteenth anniversary of independence in May 1918, he rode at the head of the troops.\nCollazo became a member of the Cuban Senate and a member of its Foreign Relations Committee.\nIn 1921, Senator Rosendo Collazo led the establishment of Cuba's National Boxing Commission to regulate the sport. Collazo was the first president and chairman of the Cuban Boxing Federation.\nOn August 19, 1922, Collazo, an expert swordsman, and Colonel Orestes Ferrara, a representative for Havana province settled a point of honor with a duel. The duel was initiated due to news stories published in Ferrara's Havana paper, El Heraldo de Cuba, about Collazo's two nephews being killed in a street brawl in Marianao. Collazo sustained a right shoulder wound, while Ferrara's nose was slashed and drew blood before the congressmen shook hands. On August 17, a similar dispute occurred with La Liberdad's director, Sergio Carb\u00f3, who was wounded by Collazo.\nRosendo Collazo aspired to succeed Gerardo Machado who was elected as Cuba's fifth president on May 20, 1925.\nIn October 1930, Collazo departed from Cuba to New York before being implicated in an alleged plot to assassinate fellow senate members that was uncovered by Havana newspaper El Pais Today. He was also accused of fomenting revolution and investigated for organizing a plot to seize arms and munitions at the Fortress La Caba\u00f1a for a revolutionary movement. Collazo, who was visiting New York on October 15, expressed his astonishment at the Havana reports that were published. After departing from Cuba to New York, Collazo maintained a headquarters at the Hotel Biltmore.\nOn August 5, 1931, five Cubans and one American were detained by American Department of Justice agents pending an investigation of a tip that they were plotting a revolution in Cuba and attempting to board a gun-running vessel, off of New York Harbor. Collazo and the others being held were questioned by Federal authorities to determine whether they had broken any laws against revolutionary activity in a friendly country, despite their claim that they were out fishing. Once questioned, they were later freed. 1931 Havana reports said that the retired Army colonel Collazo had organized and led a group of rebel sympathizers from the U.S. in Santa Clara. Still, Collazo denied the reports at the Associated Press New York office on August 15, 1931. Collazo and two other defendants were later arraigned on November 7, 1931, charged with having \"prepared to furnish money for and to take part in a military expedition to be carried on from the United States against the republic of Cuba, a nation which the United States is at peace\". Collazo was held on a $10,000 bond. In December 1931, a federal grand jury considered charges against a total of eight men who were charged with planning a military expedition against Cuba while they were in the States including Rosendo and",

It has received positive reviews from critics.\nReception\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 4.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Fred Thomas writing that How I Learned to Write Backwards is the \"brightest album from San Francisco retro-minded indie pop sweethearts the Aislers Set\", which continues to draw on primary songwriter Amy Linton's 1960s pop inspirations while adding \"looming paranoia and youthful lightheartedness\" that he compares to Laura Nyro and Judee Sill that makes \"a masterwork in an unflinchingly great catalog, easily their most comprehensive statement and full of a foggy kind of bliss that no other band after them ever quite replicated\". At Exclaim!, Cam Lindsey reviewed all three of the band's full-length studio albums upon their 2014 rerelease, scoring them a 9 out of 10, stating that this album recalls several 1960s girl groups mixed with \"sadness\", \"dour minimalism\", and \"thrashing noise pop\" that results in emotional catharsis. Editors at Pitchfork Media scored this release 8.0 out of 10 and critic Jason Heller called this release songwriter Amy Linton's most assured, and her self-observational lyrics about pensive days and sleepless nights circumvent the band's carefully constructed cuteness and slip straight into the heart\" with a mix of uplifting sounds and \"a deflated ennui\". Writing for PopMatters in 2014, Zachary Houle rated this album a 7 out of 10, called the music \"arguably the band\u2019s darkest hour,  still affirming and affecting, the final piece in a wonderful trilogy of albums\". Jim Glauner wrote an overview of the band for Trouser Press where he called How I Learned to Write Backwards \"for the most part excellent\" with lyrics that \"exude a newfound subtle confidence\".\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Amy Linton, except where noted.\n\"Catherine Says\"\u00a0\u2013 2:29\n\"Emotional Levy\"\u00a0\u2013 3:04\n\"Languor in the Balcony\"\u00a0\u2013 1:58\n\"Mission Bells\"\u00a0\u2013 4:01\n\"Sara's Song\"\u00a0\u2013 2:50\n\"Attraction Action Reaction\"\u00a0\u2013 3:41\n\"Through the Swells\"\u00a0\u2013 2:09\n\"The Train #1\"\u00a0\u2013 1:34\n\"The Train #2\"\u00a0\u2013 1:04\n\"Unfinished Paintings\"\u00a0\u2013 4:00\n\"Melody Not Malaise\"\u00a0\u2013 3:25\nPersonnel\nThe Aisler Set\nJen Cohen\nWyatt Cusick\nAmy Linton\nYoshi Nakamoto\nAlicia Vanden Heuvel\nAdjunct members\nStormy Knight\nDan Lee\nGary Olson\nAdditional personnel\nAlan Douches\u00a0\u2013 audio mastering at West West Side Music\nSara Jaffe\nDallas Kavanaugh\nRecord Technology Incorporated\u00a0\u2013 8917\u00a0\u2013 audio mastering\nJon Reuter\nRe-release credits\nJohn Greenham\u00a0\u2013 remastering at Infrasonic Sound in Los Angeles, California\nKenji Kitahama\u00a0\u2013 resequencing\nAmy Linton\u00a0\u2013 resequencing\nSee also\nList of 2003 albums\n",

    "Destroyer of the Royal Navy\nFor other ships with the same name, see HMS Basilisk.\nHMS Basilisk was a Beagle-class (from 1913 G-class) destroyer of the British Royal Navy. The Beagles were coal-fuelled ships, designed for a speed of 27\u00a0kn (31\u00a0mph; 50\u00a0km/h) and armed with a 4\u00a0in (102\u00a0mm) gun and two torpedo tubes. Built by J. Samuel White and launched in 1910, Basilisk was initially commissioned into the First Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth. In 1912, the warship joined the Third Destroyer Flotilla before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet as part of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla in 1913. As the First World War approached, the destroyer was based in Alexandria, Egypt, but was swiftly redeployed to Malta, followed, in 1915, by action in the Dardanelles Campaign. After the Armistice of 1918 that ended the war, Basilisk was initially transferred to the Nore and then sold in 1921 to be broken up.\nDesign and development\nMain article: Beagle-class destroyer\nBasilisk was one of the Beagle-class destroyers ordered by the Admiralty as part of the 1908\u20131909 shipbuilding programme. The bridge was larger and higher than previous designs and the vessels were coal-burning after concerns had been raised about the availability of fuel oil in time of war. This reduced costs, although it also meant that five boilers were needed, the extra machinery meaning that deck space became more premium. The Beagle-class vessels were not built to a standard design, with detailed design being left to the builders of individual ships in accordance with a loose specification, in this case J. Samuel White. The class were also known, on occasion, as the Basilisk class, named after this vessel. In October 1913, as part of a wider renaming of the Royal Navy's warships into classes named alphabetically, the class was renamed as the G-class.\nBasilisk was 275\u00a0ft (83.8\u00a0m) long, with a beam of 28\u00a0ft (8.5\u00a0m) and a draught of 16\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (5\u00a0m). Normal displacement was 976 long tons (992\u00a0t). Five White-Forster boilers fed direct-drive Parsons steam turbines driving three shafts. Two funnels were fitted. The machinery was rated at 12,000 shaft horsepower (8,900\u00a0kW) giving a design speed of 27\u00a0kn (31\u00a0mph; 50\u00a0km/h). During sea trials, the destroyer reached a speed of 27.984\u00a0kn (32.203\u00a0mph; 51.826\u00a0km/h) at a displacement of 968 long tons (984\u00a0t). Up to 226 long tons (230\u00a0t) of coal was carried, giving a design range of 2,000 nautical miles (3,700\u00a0km; 2,300\u00a0mi) at 15 knots (28\u00a0km/h; 17\u00a0mph). The ship had a complement of 96 officers and ratings.\nArmament consisted of one 4\u00a0in (102\u00a0mm) BL Mk VIII gun forward and three 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns aft. Torpedo armament consisted of two rotating 21\u00a0in (533\u00a0mm) torpedo tubes, one placed forward and the other aft. Two spare torpedoes were carried. On 8 April 1916, the Admiralty approved fitting the destroyer with depth charges. Two depth charge launchers and two charges were carried.\nConstruction and career\nBasilisk was laid down by J. Samuel White at East Cowes on the Isle of Wight with the yard number 1293 on 11 May 1909, and launched on 9 February the following year. The ship cost \u00a3109,729. Basilisk was the ninth to serve in the Royal Navy named for the mythical creature. The vessel was commissioned at Portsmouth and joined the First Destroyer Flotilla on 17 September.  In 1912, a reorganisation of the Home Fleet resulted in the ships of the Beagle class forming the Third Destroyer Flotilla. The vessel remained part of the Third Flotilla in March 1913. Basilisk was transferred, along with the rest of the class, to the newly-formed Fifth Destroyer Flotilla as part of the Mediterranean Fleet.\nAs the First World War approached, Basilisk was part of the Second Division of the Fifth Flotilla and based in Alexandria. The destroyer sailed to Malta, joining the rest of the flotilla on 9 August. The island had a coal shortage, which restricted the vessel's activity. On 6 August 1914, the Second Division was deployed searching for the German battlecruiser Goeben and light cruiser Breslau but this was curtailed by a lack of fuel. On 18 August, the destroyer was deployed to Suez to deter the Ottoman Empire from restricting British access to the Suez Canal. From 25 October, the destroyer, along with sister ship Racoon, patrolled the Gulf of Suez. The ship subsequently joined the force based in the Suez Canal and Red Sea to protect the sea lane for Allied shipping.\nOn 19 November, Basilisk sailed for Tenedos and spent the next year supporting the naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign. In preparation for the assault, the Admiralty decided to attack the defences on the Dardanelles strait with the pre-dreadnought battleships Albion, Majestic and Triumph. The attack was largely ineffective as the troops moved the batteries so they were safe from bombardment. On 26 February 1915, Basilisk, alongside Racoon, escorted the battleships Cornwallis, Irresistible and Vengeance as they attempted to land parties ",

    "American singer-songwriter Janis Joplin, photographed here in 1969, redefined how female vocalists looked and sounded as well as what sorts of songs that they sing.\nThe relationships between female performers in hard rock music versus amateur and professional critics as well as the general public and specific groups of fans who listen to those songs have been a topic of intellectual analysis over multiple decades. Analyzing the initial development of hard rock related styles and the spread in popular culture of rock music in general, the American news agency KQED has reported that for \"women musicians... there really was only a sliver of attention\u2014 and money, and festival slots, and airtime\u2014 to go around.\" Sexism in the context of the music industry has also been criticized in the pages of the American entertainment magazine Billboard.\nPublications such as the online news service Consquence have described cultural changes after the end of the 20th century and onwards with respect to women in hard rock music, with a June 2002 piece on musician Lzzy Hale of the band Halestorm detailing her account of the \"night and day\" evolution to the extent that trends have \"completely flipped.\" She remarked in depth, \"It used to be that not only was I the only girl in a band onstage but I was the only girl on tour, and now that\u2019s not the case...  I\u2019m not alone in being a girl musician...  also there are female lighting techs and tour managers and engineers and roadies.\" She noted the diversity inside audiences that additionally served to prove \"once and for all, even though we\u2019ve been talking about it for eons, that this hard rock genre is genderless.\"\nBackground and commentary\nSee also: History of hard rock music and List of female rock singers\nWomen singing hard rock music have been their careers commented upon by amateur and professional critics over multiple decades. A notable article by American media figure Jacoba Atlas in November 1971, which appeared in the pages of the U.S. entertainment magazine Billboard, used the explicit title \"There Aren't Many Girls In Hard Rock, But A New Day (And Attitude) Is Dawning\". Atlas argued that popular stereotypes and other expressions of prejudice in American society focusing on gender identity warped musical production, with her remarking that this intellectual framework meant that hard rock's presentation as \"raw, aggressive, driving,  electric\" became forcibly divorced from \"our culture's assessment of the essence of femininity\". Atlas additionally opinioned that \"the traditional role of the woman\", which includes \"sexist\" expectations about how women cannot \"scream and sweat\" or otherwise do certain things, \"have conspired to keep women... from coming to the forefront\" of hard rock (or rock music generally). Although writing for a major commercial publication, Atlas criticized the music industry of the time.\nPerformer Grace Slick has gained popularity for her public image as an \"outlaw\" inside of the American music industry.\nProminent examples of female hard rock vocalists include Janis Joplin, regarded as one of the most iconic women in heavy music who's \"tragic\" death early in life \"left a void\", as well as Grace Slick, known for rising to fame as a member of the band Jefferson Airplane. Slick has been described as like a rebellious \"goddess\" given how even after attaining commercial success she \"has always lived as an outlaw.\" In addition, the musical group Fanny has been labeled \"the first successful all-girl rock band\".\nThe band Joy of Cooking featured female vocalists Toni Brown and Terry Garthwaite, and they've also been highlighted as \"well-known hard rock singers.\"  As recounted by the American news agency KQED, \"Garthwaite can\u2019t remember every inane comment she\u2019s received from a man who seemed threatened or confused by her.\" Discussing past instances of misogyny, Garthwaite later noted a time around 1970 when she had gone into a business to buy guitar strings and encountered a man who told her: \"If I close my eyes and forget that there are women in the band,  it sounds really good\". The guitarist, singer, and songwriter opined that said social culture \"was, in a nutshell, the  perspective\" and that she'd additionally faced the \"ame thing with the... record companies.\" Analyzing the initial development of hard rock related styles and the spread in popular culture of rock music in general, KQED has reported that for \"women musicians... there really was only a sliver of attention\u2014 and money, and festival slots, and airtime\u2014 to go around.\"\nPublications such as the online news service Consquence have described cultural changes after the end of the 20th century and onwards with respect to women in hard rock music, with a June 2002 piece on musician Lzzy Hale of the band Halestorm detailing her account of the \"night and day\" evolution to the extent that trends have \"completely flipped.\" She remarked in depth, \"It used to be that not only was I the only girl in a band onst",
    "2020 child abuse and murder of an 11-year-old girl in Singapore\nFrom March to November 2020, an 11-year-old Singaporean girl, whose name was withheld due to a gag order, was physically abused by her stepfather Mohamad Fazli Selamat and mother Roslinda Jamil inside their Jurong flat. The girl died on 10 November 2020, four days after Fazli used an exercise bar to batter her multiple times on the head, and Roslinda reportedly did not intervene. Fazli, an auxiliary police officer, and Roslinda were both arrested and charged with murder after the girl's death came to light. Eventually, the charges of murder against the couple were substituted with manslaughter and multiple other counts of child abuse; Roslinda became the first person to be charged with allowing the death of her daughter in the same household with pursuant to a new law aimed to curb child abuse since 2020. After pleading guilty to their respective charges, the couple were sentenced in February 2024 to jail terms ranging from seven years to nearly 16 years, with Fazli additionally given 12 strokes of the cane for the manslaughter of his stepdaughter.\nBackground\nThe girl was born in Singapore in 2009 when her mother Roslinda Jamil was only 16 years old. Roslinda had the child with her then-boyfriend, whose identity was unknown. The girl grew up under her mother's care, and Roslinda had to work as a cashier, a clerk, a food delivery rider and an early childhood assistant teacher to support herself and her daughter. Roslinda married her first husband in 2013, and had two more sons, but the first husband was reportedly abusive towards Roslinda, who eventually filed for divorce at one point and had joint custody of her sons. Roslinda later met an auxiliary police officer named Mohamad Fazli Selamat, and they began their romantic relationship in May 2019 before moving in together in October 2019. Fazli and Roslinda married in April 2020, and Roslinda gave birth to Fazli's first and only biological child - a son - in August 2020. Roslinda's daughter, as well as Roslinda's two sons from her first marriage, went to live with their mother and stepfather at a flat in Jurong.\nFrom March to November 2020, the girl was abused by her stepfather and mother. According to court documents and the couple's statements, Fazli was unhappy with his stepdaughter for eating slowly and believed that the girl had misbehaved and stole items from their home. On one day in March 2020, Fazli punished the girl by ordering her to stand on a table and hold a 1.5-litre water bottle at shoulder level, and while she did so, Fazli used a belt and cane to beat her for 20 to 30 minutes, resulting in her sustaining multiple bruises on her arms, buttocks, thighs and legs. A few days after the violent assault, Fazli's family members discovered the bruises and they scolded Fazli for abusing the girl and Roslinda for not stopping him, but the abuse continued. As part of the ill-treatment, Fazli made the girl perform physical exercises as punishment. Fazli would often used items such as a wooden backscratcher, an exercise bar and a cane to beat her whenever she misbehaved, such as sleeping instead of studying or making errors while doing her homework. Another shocking aspect of the abuse was, Fazli and Roslinda would force the victim to eat chilli padi until she vomited to punish her. On one occasion, Roslinda also scalded her daughter with hot water, caused blisters to the child's skin.\nBetween 26 August and 28 October 2020, the child did not go to school because Fazli and Roslinda feared that the abuse would be discovered by the teachers, which may in turn lead to retribution from the authorities. Two school representatives arrived on 26 September 2020 to visit the girl and check on her, but the couple did not allow them to enter, thus narrowly evading detection of the abuse. On 15 October 2020, a student welfare officer from the school managed to persuade the girl's parents to let them have a video call with the girl, and an officer from the Child Protective Service (CPS) accompanied the welfare officer throughout the call, which the girl made inside a room of her flat with dim lighting. During the call, the CPS officer did not notice any signs of abuse from the victim, who was then wearing long-sleeved clothes and the room itself was poorly lit.\nDeath of the victim\nOn 6 November 2020, Fazli noticed that his stepdaughter was again eating her food slowly and feeling incensed at the sight of this, Fazli repeatedly used the exercise bar to bludgeon the girl on the head until she fell unconscious, and during the assault, Roslinda witnessed it but did not intervene. After the assault, Fazli tried to wake her up by sprinkling water on her face, reciting prayers and repeatedly calling her, and two minutes later, the girl responded and woke up. Fazli noticed that his stepdaughter was bleeding from her right ear and her head was swollen, and this caused him to panic and realized that she required m",

    "American College Football Player & Track & Field Athlete\nNorman Christopher Greene (July 12, 1973 \u2013 January 26, 2022) was an American athlete notable for his achievements in collegiate football and high school track and field. Born in Fort Hood, Texas, Greene excelled in both sports during his formative years, eventually becoming a starting free safety for the South Carolina Gamecocks football team while maintaining his reputation in track and field.

    "Infantry regiment of the Confederate States Army\nMilitary unit\nThe 8th Mississippi Infantry Regiment was a unit of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. The 8th Regiment was composed of volunteer companies from Mississippi assembled in the fall of 1861. The Regiment fought in many battles of the Western theater of the American Civil War before surrendering in April 1865.\nHistory\nThe companies of the 8th Mississippi Infantry assembled at Enterprise in August, 1861, initially enrolling for 12\u2013months' service. The total original strength of the 8th Mississippi was 888 officers and men. The regiment was mustered into Confederate service in October and sent to Pensacola, Florida to join the Southern forces under General Braxton Bragg who were besieging the forts held by Federal forces there. In May 1862, the Confederates abandoned their positions near Pensacola and the 8th Regiment was sent to Mobile, Alabama, where the men re\u2013enlisted for 3 years. In the fall of 1862, the Regiment moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee to join General Bragg's forces during the Confederate Heartland Offensive. The 8th was assigned to General John K. Jackson's brigade and fought at the Battle of Stones River from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863. Colonel John C. Wilkinson, commander of the 8th Mississippi, was seriously wounded and captured in this battle, and the regiment suffered a 47% casualty rate.\nIn 1863, the 8th Regiment was stationed at Bridgeport, Alabama, and then moved to Chattanooga in August as Bragg's forces retreated from Middle Tennessee. Bragg's army was pursued by Union general William Rosecrans, who later forced the Confederates to retreat into Georgia. During the Battle of Chickamauga, Jackson's brigade, including the 8th Regiment, was assigned to General Benjamin F. Cheatham's division on the right wing of the Confederate line, and took part in a successful movement on September 19 that pushed back the advancing Union forces. Lieutenant Colonel Aden McNeill was killed during fighting at Chickamauga on September 20, and the Regiment suffered a 23% casualty rate. The Union forces retreated to Chattanooga, and Bragg's troops moved north against their position. During the Battle of Missionary Ridge, the Confederates were defeated and many men of the 8th Mississippi were captured.\nIn 1864, the 8th Regiment took part in the Atlanta Campaign, fighting at Resaca, Adairsville, New Hope Church, Kennesaw Mountain, Peachtree Creek, Atlanta, Lovejoy's Station, and Jonesborough. The Regiment took major casualties in several of these battles: Lieutenant Colonel John F. Smith was killed at Pine Mountain on June 19, and commanding officer Colonel John C. Wilkinson was killed east of Atlanta on July 22. After the Atlanta campaign the regiment was reduced to an effective strength of 208 officers and men.\nThe 8th Mississippi then took part in the Franklin\u2013Nashville campaign under General Mark Perrin Lowrey's brigade, including the Battle of Franklin on November 30 where the Regiment took heavy casualties and division commander General Patrick Cleburne was killed. Major Andrew E. Moody was placed in combined command of the depleted 8th and 32nd Mississippi regiments. After the Battle of Nashville, this combined unit retreated into North Mississippi.\nOn April 9, 1865, the surviving remnants of General Lowry's brigade, comprising the 5th, 8th, and 32nd Mississippi infantry regiments, along with the 3rd Mississippi Battalion, were combined into a consolidated unit titled the 8th Mississippi Battalion. This unit surrendered on April 26, 1865, at Greensboro, North Carolina.\nCommanders\nCommanding officers of the 8th Mississippi:\nCol. Guilford G. Flynt\nCol. John C.

The island is best known for the town of Mitarai (\u5fa1\u624b\u6d17), an important port of call for ships during the Edo era.\nGeography\nThe location of \u014csakishimojima (in red)\n\u014csakishimojima means \"Lower \u014csaki Island\".  It is located south of \u014csakikamijima (Upper Osaki Island) and southwest of Okamura Island. The island is a leading production site of mandarin oranges in Hiroshima prefecture.\nHistory\nWith the development of the Western Circuit (\u897f\u5efb\u308a\u822a\u8def, nishimawari k\u014dro) shipping route through the Seto Inland Sea in the Edo period, the town of Mitarai grew as a port for ships waiting for rising tide or favourable winds.  The Wakaebisuya chaya, the largest in the Inland Sea, employed over 100 women, and in The Inland Sea, Donald Richie states that the daimyo of Kumamoto once spent a thousand gold pieces in one night there.  The town was also frequented by political figures travelling to and from Osaka and Edo. The Mitarai Treaty (\u5fa1\u624b\u6d17\u6761\u7d04, Mitarai j\u014dyaku), a secret agreement between the provinces of Ch\u014dsh\u016b and Geish\u016b to ally against the Tokugawa shogunate, was signed at Mitarai on November 26, 1867 and became a key event in the fall of the shogunate.\nToday, the town includes gabled houses with sangawarabuki roofs and is dotted with Western style houses.

    "Hunting lodge of the Hanoverian electors and German emperors in Lower Saxony\nA royal hunting party at G\u00f6hrde (Royal Collection)\nPlan of the G\u00f6hrde forest in 1715\nThe G\u00f6hrde hunting lodge (German: Jagdschloss G\u00f6hrde) is a former hunting lodge in G\u00f6hrde, Lower Saxony in Germany. The G\u00f6hrde State Forest was once a favourite hunting ground of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. Later the kings of Hannover also hunted here and \u2013 to 1918 \u2013 the German emperors as well.\nAs Elector of Hanover, king George I of Great Britain (1660\u20131727) built a baroque style palace here between 1706 and 1709 by the architects Louis Remy de la Fosse and Johann Christian B\u00f6hm. The palace was timber framed and in bad repair by the early 19th century. In 1827, it was taken down. The German Emperors redeveloped the former stables in a new hunting lodge.\nAfter the First World War, the hunting lodge served as a seminary and school. Today, it is privately owned and in poor condition. Almost nothing remains of the 18th-century splendour.\nHistory\nRoyal hunting lodge for King George I\nKing George I\nFloor plan of the G\u00f6hrde palace and two facades by Benjamin Hase in 1759\nPlan of the G\u00f6hrde palace and its direct surroundings in 1759\nThe G\u00f6hrde forests are located near the Elbe river between L\u00fcneburg and Dannenberg. The forests were a favourite hunting ground of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, and later Electors of Hanover. Already as of 16th century, there was a hunting lodge.\nKing George I was a passionate hunter. It was said that he \u2018had no other pleasure but the hunt\u2019. In 1706, he decided to expand the existing infrastructure: the existing lodge was to be replaced by a new palace. In addition, various new outbuildings were added as well, such as new stables, a theatre, a bakery and an abattoir. Construction costed 83,000 talers and it was the king's most elaborate and major construction project.\nThe palace designs were made by the court architect Louis Remy de la Fosse, with assistance of Johann Christian B\u00f6hm. Construction started in 1706 and was completed in 1710. The palace was a compact three story building and slightly lower side wings, which contained at least 48 apartments to accommodate guests. Ancestral portraits from Henry the Lion (1129/1131-1195) onwards decorated the palace walls. The royal stables could house more than 500 horses. In addition, there were also dog kennels.\nThe hunting lodge in G\u00f6hrde was the scene of large \u2018par force\u2019 hunts. These were grand theatrical events, meticulously planned to demonstrate power and greatness. King George I and his guests participated in the hunt, or positioned themselves centrally in the forest while they waited to be summoned. Meanwhile, the mounted hunters and their hounds pursued the day's quarry. From their waiting place, the king and his guests could watch the hunters, horses and hounds as they persecuted the frantic stag at great speed. When the exhausted stag was no longer able to run, the dogs held it fast by biting its throat, ears, legs and muzzle. Thus, the stag was \u201cfixed\u201d and the king was summoned with a special horn signal. He carried out his duty as the master of the hunt by killing the stag with a stab wound to the heart.\nWith the accession of king George to the throne of the United Kingdom in 1714, the Personal union of Great Britain and Hanover started. The king relocated to London and the large hunting parties in G\u00f6hrde were reduced to a few events, but they were still there. The king liked to go from time to time to Hanover. In 1725, king George I entertained king Frederick William I of Prussia (1688\u20131740) at G\u00f6hrde.\nGallery: The G\u00f6hrde palace in the time of King George I \u2013 around 1715\nThe palace from the northeast\nThe palace from the southwest\nThe palace from the southeast\nThe palace from the northwest\nDeer with the palace in the back\nDeer with the palace in the back\nSecond half of the 18th century\nBetween 1756 and 1765, Benjamin Hase drew various site plans of the palace complex, which are preserved in the British Map Library. Although G\u00f6hrde remained a royal hunting property from 1766 onwards, it was no longer used for hunting when king George III (1738\u20131820) ordered the hunting rights in G\u00f6hrde to be leased, but no lessee was found. The palace also remained unused and was left to decay.\nIn 1772, the exiled Danish queen Caroline Matilda (1751\u20131775) used the castle as a temporary residence before moving into Celle Castle, where she died only 23 years old.\n19th century\nThe imperial hunting lodge around 1910\nThe timber framed palace was in bad repair by the early 19th century. In 1827, king George IV (1762\u20131830) decided to take down the palace. The salvageable material was auctioned off, covering about 10 percent of the original construction cost. Only the large royal stable and a Cavalier house were repaired to serve occasional hunting purposes.\nIt was not until the return of a new king to Hanover, Ernest Augustus (1771\u20131851), in 1837 that the place revived.

    "Argentinian-bred thoroughbred racehorse\nRefinado Tom (28 August 1993\u20139 December 2019) was an Argentinian thoroughbred racehorse who won the Argentinian Triple Crown in 1996.\nHe was later cloned for breeding polo ponies.\nBackground\nRefinado Tom was a chestnut stallion with a star and an off-center snip, bred by Haras La Biznaga, one of the most famous and historic farms in Argentina. He was foaled in the early morning of August 28, 1993.\nShy Tom, Refinado Tom's sire, was a multiple graded stakes winner in the United States, where he was bred. He won the Grade 3 Baltimore Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap, Grade 3 Salvator Mile Handicap, and Grade 3 Gulfstream Park Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap. In December of 1991, he was exported to stand stud in Argentina at Haras La Biznaga, starting the 1992 breeding season. Refinado Tom was part of his first crop and would be his most successful offspring.\nRefinado Tom's dam, Ma Raffine, was bred and campaigned by Haras La Biznaga. She won one of twelve races before being retired. Refinado Tom was her second foal. She came from a classic family known for performing well in long races.\nHaras La Biznaga normally sold all of the colts they bred, but Refinado Tom was retained due to a lack of interest from potential buyers.\nRefinado Tom was trained by Roberto M. Bullrich and ridden by Jorge Valdivieso during his Argentinian campaigns.\nRefinado Tom was well-built, with the physique of a sprinter. He had a large rump, big muscles, and a wide forehead. He was said to look more like an American Quarter Horse than a thoroughbred. Refinado Tom was unfriendly and had a poor temperament, such that Bullrich was unable to get close to him to saddle him on race days and he needed to be saddled outside of stalls so he wouldn't kick. He performed poorly in morning workouts, but ran much better in afternoon races.\nRacing career\nTwo-year-old season (1995/1996)\nWhen Refinado Tom entered training, he didn't show much promise. He failed to impress in his debut on February 25, 1996, finishing fourth in a 1200-meter maiden race at Hip\u00f3dromo Argentino de Palermo. He ran again in another maiden race on March 17, and this time ran much better, impressing trainer Roberto \"Coco\" Bullrich, who said that he was surprised at how quickly Refinado Tom had become competitive and that it was as if the colt had figured out \"what this racing thing was about\".\nRefinado Tom was then pointed to stakes races, with his next start being in the Group 1 Gran Premio Ra\u00fal y Ra\u00fal E. Chevalier, a 1400-meter turf race at Hip\u00f3dromo de San Isidro. He won the race, squeezing between the frontrunner and the rail to take the lead and win decisively.\nRefinado Tom was made the heavy favorite for the Group 1 Gran Criterium, run over 1600 meters a month later at the same track. He developed an allergic reaction in the days leading up to the race, although continued training normally. Juan Ithuralde, the manager of Haras La Biznaga, and Bullrich argued over whether or not to run Refinado Tom in the race. In the Gran Criterium itself, Refinado Tom ran poorly, finishing third, leading to concerns about his ability to handle longer distances.\nRefinado Tom's allergic reaction cleared up in the following three weeks, in time for the Group 1 Carreras de las Estrellas Juvenile at Hip\u00f3dromo Argentino de Palermo, the last race of Refinado Tom's two-year-old season. Due to his defeat in the Gran Criterium, Refinado Tom was not the favorite for the race, but he ran to his usual standards to win by several lengths.\nThree-year-old season (1996/1997)\nRefinado Tom's three-year-old season opened with the Group 1 Gran Premio Polla de Potrillos, the first leg of the Argentinian Triple Crown, run over 1600 meters on the dirt at Hip\u00f3dromo Argentino de Palermo, like the Carreras de las Estrellas Juvenile. There was a lot of rain leading up to the race, and it was rainy the day of the race as well. It was to be Refinado Tom's first run on an off track. Refinado Tom ran off the lead until jockey Jorge Valdivieso let him go, at which point Refinado Tom passed the frontrunners to take the lead 300 meters from the finish line. Refinado Tom drew away from the field to win by nine lengths, with Valdivieso later calling it the chestnut's easiest win.\nIt rained prior to the second leg of the Triple Crown as well, the Group 1 Gran Premio Jockey Club, a 2000-meter race on the turf at Hip\u00f3dromo de San Isidro. Hopes were high for Refinado Tom, and he ran as expected, taking the lead in the stretch from Alpino Fitz to finish first by a length and a half. La Naci\u00f3n praised his performance, saying that Refinado Tom was on the road to have his name occupy a principal place in the history of the Argentinian turf.\nThe third and final leg of the Argentinian Triple Crown, the Group 1 Gran Premio Nacional, was Refinado Tom's next race. Despite some concerns over its 2500-meter length, many expected Refinado Tom to win the race and the Triple Crown. Refinado Tom seemed u",

It has received positive reviews from critics.\nReception\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 4 out of 5 stars, with critic Fred Thomas writing that \"Terrible Things Happen finds the band still in a very fresh, embryonic state\" that shows songwriter Amy Linton's 1960s musical influences that makes \"a strong collection... gathering together the raw materials of Linton's knack for homespun production, heartbreaking melodies, and unexpected songwriting twists that would just get stronger and stronger as the band marched on\". At Exclaim!, Cam Lindsey reviewed all three of the band's full-length studio albums upon their 2014 rerelease, scoring them a 9 out of 10, stating that this album includes many pop styles from the 1960s and \"the nosier side of C86\", resulting in \"a template for a whole new generation to ape a decade later\". Editors at Pitchfork Media scored this release 7.8 out of 10 and critic Jason Heller called this release \"a sea change\" that marked Linton's songwriting from the more punk-influenced work in Henry's Dress with \"layered harmonies, dynamic shifts between distorted riffs and acoustic strumming, adventurous arrangements, and dreamy, chanson ambience straight out of a David Lynch roadhouse\". Writing for PopMatters in 2014, John\u00a0L. Murphy rated the band's first two albums a 7 out of 10, alongside the band's 2000 effort The Last Match and called the music on this debut album \"a fresh template\" that includes several influences that previous critics have heard in the band's music and continued that \"updating the sounds of the past, post-punk and girl-group, on this reissue, these songs remain some of Linton\u2019s best\".

    "1640 siege of Hulst by the Dutch Republic against Spain\nThe Siege of Hulst (1640) was a siege battle that took place during the Eighty Years' War. A Dutch army under Frederick Henry of Orange would attempt to capture the city of Hulst to achieve a better strategic position to threaten Antwerp. The Spanish army, a contingent of the Army of Flanders, having successfully defended the front in 1639, would yet again be set on the defensive as the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand would build up the Spanish defenses in preparation for a Dutch campaign. On the offset of the offensive, the army under Frederick Henry would begin landing as Hulst would be rapidly invested by Dutch forces.\nBackground\nIn the years prior to this siege, Frederick Henry and the Dutch armies of Zeeland suffered disastrous defeats at the hands of the Spanish under the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand during Frederick Henry's 1638 campaign. Most notably, the Dutch army under William of Nassau-Siegen would be so thoroughly destroyed at the Battle of Kallo that 30 extra infantry companies had to be raised from various garrisons by Frederick Henry to replace the heavy losses, and above all, they weren't able to conduct notable military operations until 1640. This debilitated the Dutch armies in Zeeland to a great extent up until the resumption of operations in 1640. Prior to that, skirmishes by the Dutch across the front had been repelled by the Spanish, and attempts to attack Hulst in 1639 resounded in failure. The Cardinal-Infante since then has been able to consolidate his armies' position in the Spanish Netherlands effectively, bolstering local superiority and securing a strong strategical position. Frederick Henry knew he had to gain a firm footing in Flanders in order to threaten Antwerp, which led to the campaign of 1640.\nFrederick Henry's Attack\nIn the summer of 1640, Frederick Henry would coordinate a joint offensive with the French to bring down the Spanish Netherlands. Frederick Henry would conduct a new campaign in Flanders targeting Hulst to establish a strong foothold in the province and eventually target Antwerp while the French would lay siege on Arras. On the 1st of July, operations would begin as the Dutch army started to invest in Hulst. The Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand would not leave the Dutch offensive unchecked and rapidly reacted by redeploying Spanish troops from Antwerp to Hulst. The first obstacle for the Dutch army was Fort Nassaro. Both sides were already engaged at the fort on the first day, and by the second day, the Dutch only increased the pressure on the Spanish troops when artillery barges began firing. The Cardinal-Infante would embrace a more offensive strategy in the upcoming days, aiming to rapidly repulse the Dutch forces so that resources could be diverted south against the French. After several heated artillery duels and skirmishes around Fort Nassaro, the Spanish would conduct counter-attacks as the Cardinal-Infante gave orders for large-scale sorties against their Dutch counterparts. In Spanish these attacks are called encamisadas as the soldiers would wear white shirts to distinguish themselves from the enemies at night. These sortie-type attacks were used to great effect by the Spanish throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Multiple days of constant combat at Fort Nassaro ended up draining much of the Dutch momentum and the campaign didn't seem to have much success in its way. The Spanish defenders were so stout in the several days of investment that Frederick Henry would later order a retreat on the 9th of July after fierce fighting around Fort Nassaro.\nAftermath\nFort Nassaro would be heavily damaged but stayed under Spanish control up until 1645. Within the time frame from this siege to the next siege of Hulst, Frederick Henry would spend time reorganizing and planning the next campaign for the next 4 years. Although the Spanish received several years of respite after this siege, the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand would pass away on the 9th of November, 1641. His future plans would never be realized and the new governor of the Spanish Netherlands, Francisco de Melo, would be appointed. De Melo would use the several years of respite to focus on the French front but would be unsuccessful in the coming years and eventually meet his biggest defeat at Rocroi in 1643.\n",

Highlighting social media's dual role as both a gateway to information and a channel for misinformation, he advocated for sophisticated algorithms utilizing user engagement data to combat the spread of false information. In his 2019 book, Detecting Fake News on Social Media, he covered concepts such as detection methods and challenging issues. His subsequent work, Disinformation, Misinformation, and Fake News in Social Media, published in 2020, provided an overview of disinformation, offering insights into user engagements, detection techniques, and emerging ethical and technological considerations. Furthermore, he and his co-authors introduced TriFN, an approach aimed at mitigating the challenge of fake news proliferation on social media, leveraging social context\u2014such as relationships among publishers, news pieces, and users\u2014to enhance fake news detection compared to existing methods.\nIn related research, Shu introduced an explainable fake news detection method that outperformed existing approaches by utilizing a sentence-comment co-attention sub-network, providing better insights into why certain news pieces are deemed fake. To address the prevalent fake news issue, his study presented FakeNewsNet, a repository containing two datasets with diverse features, aiming to facilitate research on fake news detection and analysis on social media platforms.\nSafe and responsible large language models\nShu's research delved into how the public utilized large language models (LLMs) for healthcare purposes as well, revealing their popularity for medical Q&A and self-diagnosis and highlighting LLMs' role in enhancing information quality, reducing misinformation, and optimizing convenience in accessing healthcare information, especially regarding their use by doctors for diagnosis. He also discussed how instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained for AI safety alignment but face vulnerability in their alignment, posing potential harm.\nAwards and honors\n2021\u2013 Distinguished Doctoral Dissertation Award, BenchCouncil\n2021\u2013 Google Cloud Research Credits Award, Google\n2022 \u2013 AI 2000 Most Influential Scholar Honorable Mention, Aminer\n2023 \u2013 AI 2000 Most Influential Scholar Honorable Mention, Aminer\n2023 \u2013 Cisco Faculty Research Award, Cisco\n2024 \u2013 NSF Career Award, U.S. National Science Foundation\n2024 \u2013 College of Computing Dean's Excellence in Research Award, Illinois Tech\nBibliography\nBooks\nDetecting Fake News on Social Media (2019) ISBN 978-1681735825\nDisinformation, Misinformation, and Fake News in Social Media: Emerging Research Challenges and Opportunities (2020) ISBN 978-3030426989\nSelected articles\nShu, K., Sliva, A., Wang, S., T",

    "Canadian brand of ice hockey equipment\nCanadien is a Canadian brand of ice hockey equipment owned by Birch Hill Equity Partners through its portfolio company Sport Maska Inc. The Canadien brand was created in 1969 in Drummondville, Quebec and was manufactured originally by the company Les industries du hockey Canadien, Inc. The original company was sold in 1978, and since that time the Canadien brand has gone through numerous ownership changes. Since 1998 it has been part of a consolidated group of six hockey brands that comprises Canadien, CCM, Heaton, Jofa, Koho, and Titan. In 2017, Birch Hill Equity Partners of Toronto acquired the group of brands, which are held by the company Sport Maska. While CCM remains the flagship brand of the group, products made under the Canadien name appear occasionally.\nHistory\nIn 1969, a group of 15 investors joined to form a hockey stick manufacturing company called Les industries du hockey Canadien, Inc. Among the investors were Montreal Canadiens players Serge Savard, Yvan Cournoyer, and Guy Lapointe. The company established its operations in Drummondville, Quebec, the hometown of Cournoyer. Canadien grew rapidly and by 1976 held 17 per cent of the hockey stick market, the second largest market share after Sher-Wood.\nIn 1977, graphic designer Georges Huel designed the company's wordmark and triangle logo.\nIn late 1978, the Canadien company was acquired by Action Traders, Inc. of Toronto. Then, the following year, Action Traders sold Canadien to Amer of Finland. The previous year, Amer had bought Koho, therefore, the purchase expanded expanded the company's reach in the hockey market. Amer continued to produce hockey equipment under the Koho and Canadien names until 1986, when it sold its hockey operations to Karhu, also of Finland. Karhu had entered the hockey market in 1972 when it acquired Titan, and then in 1985 it purchased Jofa from Volvo. In the early 1990s, Karhu acquired goalie equipment company Heaton, creating a portfolio of five hockey brands.\nKarhu's hockey operations were transferred to its Canadian arm Karhu Canada, Inc., which was renamed the Sports Holdings Corporation in the 1990s. In 1998, Sports Holdings was acquired by SLM International, the holding company for Sport Maska, Inc., which itself owned the CCM brand. In 1999, SLM renamed itself The Hockey Company. As the owner of the CCM, Jofa, Titan, Koho, Canadien, and Heaton brands, The Hockey Company became the dominant player in the hockey equipment market.\nIn June 2004, Reebok acquired The Hockey Company. After the sale, it phased out all brands save CCM and introduced its own RBK line of products. In August 2005, Adidas acquired Reebok. Adidas continued to produce hockey equipment under the CCM brand primarily.\nIn July 2017, Adidas sold its hockey holdings for $110 to Birch Hill Equity Partners of Toronto for around $110 million. Its hockey operations were at this time consolidated in the subsidiary Sport Maska, Inc., which owned the rights to the six brands. Since the purchase in 2017, CCM has remained the flagship brand of the group, though products that use the other five brand names appear sporadically.\n",
    "Saint Kitts and Nevis island\nA map of Saint Kitts and Nevis, with Booby Island labeled in between the two main islands\nBooby Island is an uninhabited islet in Saint Kitts and Nevis. It is found in The Narrows, the channel between the islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis, where Booby Island is an approximate midpoint between the islands. Booby Island is cone-shaped, consisting of a steep hill and a rocky shoreline. The island is of interest to ornithology for its bird population, and it is designated as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.\nGeography\nBooby Island is a cone-shaped islet. It is approximately 1 hectare (2.5 acres) in area, with a width of about 38 metres (125\u00a0ft) across. Its peak reaches a height of 38 metres (126\u00a0ft). The island lies in The Narrows, the channel between the islands of Nevis and St. Kitts, where it is an approximate midpoint between the two islands. It is one of two islands in The Narrows, along with Cow Rock, which measures only 2 metres (6.6\u00a0ft) across.\nThe island is a steep hill with rocky outcroppings and a shoreline is made up of large rocks. A sample of basaltic andesite from Booby Island's southeast coast was predominantly composed of, by weight: silicon dioxide (56.41%), aluminium oxide (17.91%), ferric oxide (8.90%), calcium oxide (6.68%), sodium oxide (3.51%), and magnesium oxide (2.30%).\nBiodiversity\nBooby Island is a major seabird nesting site in St. Kitts and Nevis. BirdLife International designated Booby Island as an Important Bird Area, which includes the entire island and seas up to one kilometre away, for which it has the identification code KN003. Eight species of seabird are found on Booby Island, where nesting season begins in April or May and ends between August and October. The island's brown pelicans are colloquially referred to as boobies.\nA 1997 survey of the island's seabird population found that it hosted 400 to 600 nesting pairs. The most common were sooty terns, followed by bridled terns, laughing gulls, roseate terns, and brown noddies. Red-billed tropicbirds can also be found on Booby Island. All of these species are rare to St. Kitts and Nevis and are not found in any part of the country besides Booby Island. In 2008, it was estimated that there were approximately 425 nesting pairs. The seabird population is fragile, as eggs are easily accessible and chasing birds from their nests causes the eggs to quickly overheat. 15 pairs of roseate terns were identified in 1997, but only two were found the following year.\nBooby Island is not subject to any special environmental protections. The interior of the island contains dense populations of brushy plants. No mammal populations were discovered on the island in a 2004 survey.\nHuman interaction\nBooby Island is uninhabited. It is controlled by the government of Saint Kitts and Nevis and is not privately owned. The island's geography makes human access challenging, as boats cannot approach and visitors must swim over the rocky shoreline. Fishermen sometimes collect the eggs of laughing gulls and other species of bird, which may have a negative effect on the bird population. Over time, the fishing community of Newcastle has shifted its fishing grounds from the coasts of Nevis and St. Kitts to the coast of Booby Island, to save on fuel use and to avoid overfished areas. Shark attacks are rare, but one incident was documented in 2021 in which an American student was bit by a tiger shark while swimming off the island's coast, resulting in amputation above the knee.\nNotes\n^ a b c d e f g Horwith & Lindsay 1999, p.\u00a036.\n^ a b c d e f g h i j Collier & Brown 2008, p.\u00a0276.\n^ a b Patuelli 1980, p.\u00a0119.\n^ Baker 1984, p.\u00a0404.\n^ Vitaliev 2017, p.\u00a098.\n^ Horwith & Lindsay 1999, pp.\u00a037\u201338.\n^ Granderson & Ramkissoon 2022, p.\u00a041.\n^ Faxinfo 2021.\n^ Loop News 2021.\n",
    "French psychoanalyst and scholar\nMarie Balmary, born about 1939, is a French psychoanalyst and essayist . In addition to her therapeutic practice, she studies the Bible and Greek mythology with groups of scholars using psychoanalytic theory and, in return, questioning its foundations.\nAcademic career\nBalmary is a clinical psychologist with university training, a psychoanalyst with Lacanian training and a researcher.\nHer doctoral thesis devoted to the relationship between Freudian theory and Freud 's family history having been refused before defense; she published it in 1979 under the title L'Homme aux statues: Freud et la faute cach\u00e9e du p\u00e8re, or The Man with Statues: Freud and the hidden fault of the father . In this work, she revisits Freudian theory based on a reading of the myth of Oedipus, which includes the story of Oedipus' father and the etymological consideration of the words and names of these stories and a study of their relationship with the history of Freud's family.\nAfter the publication of her thesis, Balmary began reading the Bible. When she approached the Biblical origin myth, which she considered to be the book of Genesis, she followed the Biblical reading seminar of the Jesuit exegete Paul Beauchamp for three years in the early 1980s, and became close from him.\nIn her reading, she mobilized psychoanalytic concepts to understand and interpret the founding biblical texts. She paids very close attention to the letter of these texts, in their original languages, Hebrew, Aramaic and biblical Greek, which she learned, and considered any apparent strangeness or \"mistakes\" of the text, including grammatical errors, as being able to carry meaning.\nHer close reading led to new understandings and re-interpretations.\nExamples\u00a0:\nIn The Forbidden Sacrifice, she notes that it is Abraham who attributes to God an order (that of sacrificing his son Isaac), though is not explicitly written that he gave it;\nin The Divine Origin, she proposes that the prohibition of the Garden of Eden relates to the confusing of the masculine and the feminine, of man and woman not understanding the other well, and of assimilating it to oneself instead of accepting it as it is. 'he is.\nShe also disputes the translation of a sentence ( \u00ab\u00a0You will give birth in pain\u00a0\u00bb ) that God addresses to Eve . A more appropriate translation would be \u00ab\u00a0In sorrow you will give birth to sons\u00a0\", which would thus refer to \u00ab\u00a0the difficulty for human beings to let their own life, their own words happen in others and particularly the child\u00a0\u00bb.\nPublications\nWorks\n1979\u00a0: L\u2019Homme aux statues. \u00c9ditions Grasset.

    "\nDavey Moore vs. Roberto Dur\u00e1n was a professional boxing match contested on \nJune 16, 1983, for the WBA super welterweight title.\nBackground\nIn January 1983, former welterweight champions Roberto Dur\u00e1n and Pipino Cuevas met in a non-title bout at the LA Sports Arena. Dur\u00e1n dominated the fight and scored a fourth-round knockout victory that put him in line for a title shot against the undefeated reigning WBA super welterweight champion Davey Moore. Despite Dur\u00e1n's impressive victory, he was still perceived to be on the downside of his career having lost to little-known Kirkland Laing only nine months prior and the 23-year old Moore expressed doubt that the soon-to-be 32-year old Dur\u00e1n would be a match for him, infamously stating \"Was that Duran looking so good or Cuevas so bad?\"\nThe fight was originally scheduled to take place on May 27 in Bophuthatswana, South Africa with a Ray Mancini\u2013Kenny Bogner WBA lightweight title fight as the co-main event, but the event was cancelled after Mancini was forced to pull out with a fractured collarbone. Two weeks later, the Moore\u2013Dur\u00e1n fight was rescheduled for June 16 (Dur\u00e1n's 33rd birthday) at Madison Square Garden in Moore's native New York City. Dur\u00e1n underwent a rigorous training schedule with his longtime trainer Ray Arcel proclaiming \"Right now, he looks better than I've seen him in several years\" while Dur\u00e1n himself stated \"What will beat Moore is not only my experience, but my conditioning. If I had to pick between them, I would say my conditioning.\" Dur\u00e1n admitted that a loss to Moore would possibly lead to his retirement saying \"If I lose, I'll probably retire, but I'm not thinking about losing the fight. I'm stronger, more mature, more experienced and I'm training more seriously than at any time in my career.\"\nMoore had successfully defended his title three times, defeating all three opponents by knockout and was installed as 5\u20132 favorite by oddsmakers and was confident in his ability to defeat his opponent claiming that Dur\u00e1n  \"over the hill but he still has his name and beating him will take me to the big money fights. I don't expect a very long fight, it might even be over in a round.\"\nThe fight\nDur\u00e1n started the fight aggressively and controlled most of the fight from there on. At the end of the first round Dur\u00e1n threw a jab that Moore attempted to dodge, but the thumb of Dur\u00e1n's glove instead inadvertently poked Moore in his right eye, injuring it immediately and hindering Moore throughout the rest of the fight. Dur\u00e1n continued to be the aggressor in the second round and bloodied Moore's nose with a straight right. Dur\u00e1n slowed his attack during the third and fourth rounds allowing Moore to become the aggressor but Dur\u00e1n still boxed affectively and Moore's right eye was almost entirely shut and he was now also bleeding from his lip by the end of the fourth. Finally, after dominating Moore over six+ rounds, Dur\u00e1n sent Moore down to the canvas with 15 seconds left in the seventh round. Clearly hurt, Moore was able to get up at the count of eight and was saved by the bell, though he was so dazed he went to Dur\u00e1n's corner rather than his own and had to be directed by the referee to get to his own. To start the eighth Moore tried to clinch Dur\u00e1n, but Dur\u00e1n was able to free himself and continued to punish Moore's head and body. After two minutes of Dur\u00e1n landing punches at will and with Moore offering little offensively or defensively and his face bloodied and both eyes almost shut, Moore's trainer Leon Washington threw a blood-soaked white towel in the ring to signify surrender, but referee Ernesto Maga\u00f1a did not acknowledge it causing a Top Rank executive Jay Edison to enter the ring leading to the fight being stopped and Dur\u00e1n was named the winner by technical knockout.\nFight card\n^Note 1 For WBA Super Welterweight title\n",

The language of the Chiapas was the Chiapas language, now extinct, although well documented. This language is classified within the Oto-Manguean language family, being the only language of that family spoken in the current Chiapas territory.\nThe main settlement of the Chiapas people was Napiniac\u00e1, now known as Chiapa de Corzo. The state of Chiapas takes its name from this indigenous people, whose resistance to the Spanish conquest has been treated in heroic tales that are now considered not entirely true. The disappearance of the Chiapas language has led to the assumption that the Chiapas disappeared without a trace. The people of Chiapas were decimated in the C.E.18th century by the various epidemics in the region, which led to the disappearance of some of its most notable settlements, such as Ostuta and Pochutla. The population of Chiapas was Ladinized and its culture survived in a cultural hybridization, some of whose features are preserved in the culture of the peoples of the Chiapas region, made up approximately of the current municipalities of Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapilla, Acala, Suchiapa and Ixtapa.\nLocation\nThey settled in the Central Depression of Chiapas in the center of the state of Chiapas in the territory of what are now the municipalities of Acala, Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapilla, Suchiapa, Osumacinta, Villa Corzo, Chiapas\u00a0, Villaflores, Municipality of San Lucas, Chiapas\u00a0, Tuxtla Gutierrez, Ocozocoautla or Coita, Berrioz\u00e1bal and La Frailesca, Chiapas\u00a0.\nThe capital city of the Socton people was Nandalumi or Napiniaca, located in the present-day territory of the city of Chiapa de Corzo, was known by the Nahua-speaking peoples as Chiapa de Corzo.\nThe fertile alluvial lands that make up the so-called banks of the Grijalva River were, since the beginning of American civilization, a point of attraction for the human groups that colonized the continent. The Olmecs probably inhabited the antechamber of the Sumidero Canyon. Later, the Zoques and Mayans settled there; However, according to the opinion of researcher Carlos Navarrete in his book Archaeological Investigations about the Chiapas Problem, those who came to govern the entire area from the 6th century of our era were the Chiapas, who, according to some historical sources, arrived from the lands of present-day Nicaragua and forcibly displaced the ancient settlers.\nHistory\nThe Orcish Stone was where the Spaniards hanged the last Chiapas warriors. Little is known about its pre-Hispanic history. When the Spaniards arrived in Chiapas, they had subdued and made tributary Zoques, Tsotzils, Tseltals, and had quarrels with the Lacandons and Mames territories assaulted by the Aztec Empire, which also wanted to dominate them.\nFray Antonio de Remesal\u00a0, in his book General History of Chiapa and Guatemala, tells us that:\nFormerly, some people came from the province of Nicaragua, who, tired of walking and of the discomforts that pilgrimage brings with it, remained in the land of Chiapa.\nA legend says that the warrior tribe of the Chiapas (Soctones), led by the old cacique Nandalum\u00ed, from Nicoya, Nicaragua, founded the town of Nandium\u00e9. From there they began to subdue the aforementioned Zoques, Tsotsiles, Tseltals and Mames, covering a large area of the state of Chiapas. In CE.1486, the Aztecs' failed attempts to subdue the Chiapas began and they named the Teochiapan to the town of Nandium\u00e9 and Chiapas to the Soctona ethnic group.\nBernal D\u00edaz del Castillo, in his chronicle of the True History of the Conquest of New Spain tells us that:\n ... When the Chiapas could not defeat their invading enemy, the Spaniards and the Indians who supported them, preferred to die by throwing themselves from the rock of Tepetchia\nThis rock is located at the top of the Sumidero Canyon. On the other hand, Antonio de Remesal\u00a0, in his book General History of Chiapa and Guatemala, tells us that:\nCaptain Diego de Mazariegos met with resistance from the people of Chiapa, and although he took many steps to pacify them out of love, he could not put an end to them.  And there they defended themselves for a few days; and after they had fought a great deal, they were forcibly interfered with, and continued in their pertinence; Those who remained with others who joined him in another place fought until they could not raise their arms, and seeing themselves lost with their wives and children, they fell down the side of the river, which is very high, and there so many perished that of the many who were a little more than two thousand remained\". \nThe Chiapas were very different from the other inhabi",
    "British flying ace of WWII\nEdward Mortimer-Rose, DFC & Bar (1920 \u2013 28 January 1943) was a flying ace who served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. During his service with the RAF, he was credited with having destroyed at least thirteen German aircraft.\nBorn in Littleport, Mortimer-Rose joined the RAF in early 1939. Once his training was completed, he was posted to No. 234 Squadron. He flew in the Battle of Britain and the Circus offensive of 1941, during which he claimed a number of aerial victories. He was sent to Malta in December 1941 and took command of No. 249 Squadron during the siege of that island. He was wounded towards the end of the month and spent several weeks in hospital before returning to duty in February 1942 as commander of No. 185 Squadron. Rested from operations in May, he later served with No. 111 Squadron in the Tunisian campaign. He was killed in a flying accident when his Supermarine Spitfire fighter collided with another aircraft while taking off from an airfield in Tunisia.\nEarly life\nEdward Mortimer-Rose was born in 1920 at Littleport in Cambridgeshire, the United Kingdom. He attended Haileybury School and once his education was completed, he joined the Royal Air Force on a short-service commission. He commenced his initial training in February 1939 before proceeding to No. 6 Flying Training School at Little Rissington two months later as an acting pilot officer. His flight training was completed in November, by which time the Second World War had broken out.\nSecond World War\nMortimer-Rose was posted to No. 234 Squadron on 6 November. This was a newly formed fighter squadron based at Leconfield and working towards operational status with Bristol Blenheim heavy fighters. In March 1940, it began to re-equip with the Supermarine Spitfire fighter and two months later became operational, by which time it was based at Church Fenton. The following month the squadron moved to St. Eval as part of No. 10 Group, and then onto Middle Wallop. It subsequently became drawn into Fighter Command's efforts to defend against the Luftwaffe campaign against southern England.\nBattle of Britain\nMortimer-Rose made his first claim for an aerial victory on 8 August, for a share in a Junkers Ju 88 medium bomber that was probably destroyed in the region of Falmouth. A week later he shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter to the southwest of Swanage. In the afternoon of 18 August, what is now known as The Hardest Day, No. 234 Squadron was scrambled to intercept a Luftwaffe raid on Gosport. Mortimer-Rose destroyed a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter that was escorting Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers attacking Gosport. He engaged a second Bf 109 but ran out of ammunition; this Bf 109 was deemed to have been probably destroyed.\nOn 26 August Mortimer-Rose destroyed a Bf 109 to the south of the Isle of Wight. The squadron's losses by this time saw it withdrawn back to St. Eval from where it saw out the final weeks of the Battle of Britain at a lowered operational tempo, with fewer sorties. Flying from here on 9 October, he shared in the probable destruction of a Ju 88 south of Falmouth. Another Ju 88 was claimed as probably destroyed by Mortimer-Rose over Land's End on 26 October. He shared in the shooting down of a Dornier Do 17 medium bomber near St. Eval on 24 November. He damaged another Do 17 on 20 December to the south of Land's End and on Christmas Day he damaged a Ju 88 near Falmouth.\nCircus offensive\nMortimer-Rose damaged a Ju 88 near St. Eval on 11 February 1941. Later in the month No. 234 Squadron moved to Warmwell, where it began to re-equip with the Spitfire Mk IIa and changed duties; while it still carried out defensive patrols, it also started to undertake offensive operations over occupied France and Belgium as part of the RAF's Circus offensive. On 11 March, some 20 miles (32\u00a0km) to the southwest of Portland, Mortimer-Rose shared in the destruction of a Bf 110. A few days later, he was mentioned in despatches in March.\nOn 23 March Mortimer-Rose shared in damaging a Do 17 over the Isle of Wight. Early the following month, on 2 April, he probably destroyed a Ju 88 to the southwest of Lyme Regis. He damaged a Do 17 near Portland on 8 May. Shortly afterwards the squadron began to receive new Spitfire Mk Vbs and flying one of these on 19 May, Mortimer-Rose destroyed a pair of Bf 109s over the English Channel. His successes over the previous several months was recognised with an award of a Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in early June. The published citation read:\nThis officer has displayed great skill as a fighter pilot. In a recent combat he destroyed two of five enemy aircraft destroyed by his flight thus bringing his victories to at least six. He has set a splendid example and has contributed materially to the high standard of efficiency in his squadron.\u2014\u200aLondon Gazette, No. 35183, 6 June 1941\nOn 17 June Mortimer-Rose shared in the destruction of a Bf 109 near Cherbourg.

    "\n2009 studio album by A-Mei\nAmit (Chinese: \u963f\u5bc6\u7279; pinyin: \u0100 m\u00ec t\u00e8) is the fifteenth studio album by Taiwanese recording artist A-Mei. It was released in physical and digital formats on June 26, 2009, through Gold Typhoon. A-Mei enlisted Adia to help produce the album, while musicians such as Sodagreen's Wu Qing-feng, Xiao An, Albert Leung, Yao Ruolong, Chen Zhenchuan penned the record's lyrics. Amit is primarily a rock record with elements of punk, heavy metal, R&B and acoustic styles.\nAmit received positive reviews from music critics. The album experienced commercial success, peaking at number one on the G-Music Combo Album Chart in Taiwan and ranking within the top 20 best-selling albums of the year in the country. It eventually garnered sales of over 120,000 copies in Taiwan and over 1,300,000 copies across Asia.\nAmit spawned several singles, including \"Disappear\", \"Bold For My Love\", and \"Rainbow\". The album and its singles received various accolades at regional award ceremonies; at the 21st Golden Melody Awards, Amit won Pop Album of the Year whereas \"Bold For My Love\" won Song of the Year, amongst other awards. The Chinese Musicians Exchange Association named Amit one of the top 10 albums of the year, and included \"Disappear\" and \"Straight Up\" in their list of the top 10 singles of the year.\nBackground and development\nThe material from Amit was produced and recorded over a span of two and a half years, with a total investment cost for the album totaling to nearly NT$30 million (US$1 million). The title of the album \"Amit\" is derived from A-Mei's given name, reflecting the singer's desire to reconnect with her indigenous Puyuma heritage of Beinan, Taitung. The title also serves as an acronym for the phrase \"Amei Music Is Transformed\". \"The album saw the singer embracing a largely avant-garde image, with its material offering a change in musical styles in comparison to her previous efforts. She aimed to present the album with both auditory and visual concepts in mind.\nA-Mei enlisted various songwriters and musicians to help write the lyrics for the album, including Sodagreen's Wu Qing-feng, Xiao An, Albert Leung, Yao Ruolong, and the singer's manager Chen Zhenchuan. Production was primarily handled by A-Mei and Adia. On the album cover, A-Mei sports blood orange colored hair and is seen sitting on a leather red chair, designed by BD Barcelona. The chair, worth NT$430,000, takes inspiration from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) musicals that were produced after the 1920s era.\nComposition\nThe concept of Amit explore's A-Mei's multifaceted personality. The songs express the singer's evolving perspectives on life, including her exploration of life's purpose, her stance on LGBTQ+ issues, as well as women's rights. Observers have noted that the album offers a glimpse into the aspects of A-Mei's life that are not usually visible to the public eye, thereby providing a platform for expressing her thoughts and emotions. Primarily a rock record, Amit utilizes various styles including punk, heavy metal, R&B with both electric and acoustic guitar instrumentations.\nThe first track, \"Split\", delves into the dynamics of self-identity. Consisting of a rock composition, A-Mei's vocal delivery consists of a slightly raspy, resonant articulation. \"Disappear\" is a composition of similar style which was penned by Wu Qingfeng, drawing inspiration from A-Mei's interviews about the death of her father. The final version that was included on the album, in contrast, is more lucid and gentle.\nThe tracks \"Double Cross\" and \"Depressed\" both address women in romantic relationships. They utilize musical genres such as metal and psychedelic rock, mirroring each other in their exploration of love and loneliness. The feminine aura unveiled in \"Double Cross\" also permeates \"Bold For My Love\". The latter song features unambiguous lyrics: \"If you wish to appease my love, if you\u2019re so courageous, then come.\" The song fuses electronic rock and pop styles. \"Rainbow\" is a pop rock number that has been recognized as a LGBT anthem in Asia following the album's release. Its lyrics describe how the singer overcomes a failed relationship with the support of her friend.\nAccolades\nTrack listing\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nSales and certifications\nRelease history\n",
    "\nPhillip Dosen (born May 31, 1999), better known by his online alias and gaming handle ImperialHal (or simply Hal), is an American professional Apex Legends player currently playing for Team Falcons.\nNicknamed the CEO, Hal played as the In-Game Leader (IGL) for Team SoloMid (TSM) from 2019 to 2024. With TSM, he won three Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) LAN tournaments, including the 2023 ALGS Championship. He left TSM in 2024 and was signed to Team Falcons, a Saudi esports organization.\nEsports career\nTSM (2019\u20132024)\nImperialHal has competed professionally in H1Z1 and Fortnite, though he is most notable for his Apex Legends play. He has played Apex Legends competitively since the game released in 2019. He played on Cloud9's H1Z1 roster in 2018, though once the team disbanded, he began playing Fortnite. He was then signed to play Apex for TSM in March 2019, alongside Jose \"ProdigyAces\" Soto and Taylor \"THump\" Humphries. Hal would be a mainstay for TSM and would eventually be joined by Jordan \"Reps\" Wolfe, who would be his long-time teammate until 2024. Over their time together, they were joined by several players in the third spot on the TSM roster including Mac \"Albralelie\" Beckwith, Eric \"Snip3down\" Wrona, and Evan \"Verhulst\" Verhulst.\nHe was a winner of both the EXP Invitational \u2013 Apex Legends at X Games Minneapolis event, as well as the Apex Legends Preseason Invitational; both invitationals took place in 2019. In 2020, the Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) was launched by Apex's publisher and developer, Electronic Arts (EA) and Respawn Entertainment, respectively.\nIn December 2021, Verhulst joined TSM and the Hal/Reps/Verhulst trio would be successful in ALGS play. TSM won the 2022 ALGS Split 1 Playoffs, a North American regional LAN. Prior to the win, it had been nearly a year since Hal and TSM won a major tournament. The team experienced further struggles later in 2022, placing sixth in the Split 2 Playoffs and seventh in the ALGS Championship. During the latter, Hal instructed his teammates to not shoot at a Scarz player, noticing his connection to the game's server had crashed. Viewers and fellow competitors praised Hal's sportsmanship. The team's lackluster performances at these LAN tournaments frustrated Hal who stated \"I'm tired of fucking losing, bro,\" and suggested he was considering \"either not playing competitive anymore or just joining another team\".\nFor the 2022 Twitch Rivals LAN event at TwitchCon 2022, Hal parterned with \"Sweetdreams\" and \"ReedzFPS\"; the trio won the event. Hal and TSM would win the 2023 ALGS Split 1 Playoffs LAN. Hal's win made him the first player to win an international tournament as both a mouse and keyboard (MnK) and controller player. He was also named the tournament's MVP. Later that year, Hal led TSM to victory in the 2023 ALGS Championship LAN and was awarded the tournament's MVP trophy. In December 2023, Hal participated in the Apex Rising Charity Pro-AM event, helping raise money for the Product Red, an AIDS awareness and prevention charity.\nA hacker disrupted the 2024 ALGS North American Split 1 Pro League Finals. Hal was affected by the hack, being gifted aimbot during a match. Hal stayed in the match, though refrained to shoot until the server was shut down by admins. Hal and Verhulst were given bans and competitive cooldowns. Ahead of the 2024 ALGS Split 1 Playoffs, Hal joined the Red Bull Gaming team. TSM had a disappointing 17th-place finish at the Split 1 Playoffs LAN.\nTeam Falcons (2024\u2013present)\nOn May 13, Hal announced his departure from TSM and that he would be joining Rhys \"Zer0\" Perry and Noyan \"Genburten\" Ozkose from TSM's rival DarkZero. Though it was initially unclear if the three would play for DarkZero or another organization, on May 28, it was announced the trio signed with Team Falcons, a Saudi-based organization believed to be backed by the government's Public Investment Fund and the Al-Saud royal family.\nPlayer and streamer profile\nKnown for his aggressive style of play and previously serving as the IGL (in-game leader) TSM, ImperialHal is considered one of the greatest Apex players of all time. During his time with TSM, the team was often a favorite to win tournaments. His Apex success has earned him the nickname \"The CEO\". He originally played as an MnK player, before switching to controller and becoming known as a dual-input player, frequently switching between the two. He is also the highest-earning Apex player of all time.\nHal has also garnered a reputation as one of the biggest Apex streamers through his presence on Twitch. In 2022, Adam Snavely of Dot Esports wrote that \"The TSM leader pulls double duty as both the most successful pro player in the history of Apex and the game's most popular streamer. If there is a person that is an embodiment of Apex, it is ImperialHal: skillful, tactical, loud, and confident. Always confident.\" His opinions on the game, such as new character introductions or meta changes, have been often discusse",
    "Song\n\"Keep Right On To The End Of The Road\" is a popular song written by Harry Lauder in 1924. \nHistory\nLauder wrote the song in a railway carriage in April 1924, returning home to prepare for a tour of England.  He d\u00e9buted the song at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London, on 28 April, to an enthusiastic reception; one gentleman in the audience rose to declare it a \"sermon on the stage\" and Lauder was prevailed upon to sing it a second time.\nLauder wrote the song in honour of his son, killed in the First World War, and it was originally published under the name \"The End Of The Road\".  Lauder first recorded it on 26 October 1925 at a studio in Hayes, Middlesex, accompanied by the George W. Byng orchestra, and it was released on His Master's Voice (catalogue number D1085), sharing the shellac with \"The Road to the Isles\", the following April. John Peel chose it as a representative for 1925 in his \"Peelennium\" retrospective.\nThe song was such a success that by 1926 he was using it to close his set.  It was also played at his funeral, as the pallbearers brought the coffin from Lauder Ha' in Hamilton, where the service took place.\nAssociation with Birmingham City F.C.\nThe song is the official club song of Birmingham City F.C., adopted during the club's run to the 1955\u201356 FA Cup final.  On a coach to Highbury for the quarter-final tie at Arsenal in March 1956, the players sang songs to ease the tension, and manager Arthur Turner asked Scottish winger Alex Govan for his choice; he started singing \"Keep Right On\", and the players were still singing on arrival at the ground, with the coach surrounded by Blues fans.  The players also heard singing the song in the dressing-room after the 3\u20131 win in celebration.\nThe fans took to the song quickly, singing it at the semi-final win over Sunderland later that month, and Lauder's recording was played before a home game with Blackpool a week later, with songsheets available for spectators.  The song has been a constant at the club's matches ever since, albeit with lyrics slightly altered to suit the club.  The song got to no. 157 in the UK singles charts, and no. 23 in the Independent Singles Charts, the week before Blues won the EFL Cup in 2011.\n",
    "Spanish soldier and footballer\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Nieto Romero, better known simply as Nieto (8 November 1915 \u2013 17 March 1998), was a Spanish soldier and footballer who played as a defender for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Valencia CF, and FC Barcelona. He later worked as a manager.\nEarly life\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Nieto was born on 8 November 1915 in Madrid, where he lived until he was 8 years old, when he moved to Alicante because of his father's work, who was a photographer. He began playing football as a child at the Salesianos school in Alicante.\nPlaying career\nIn the 1930\u201331 season, the 15-year-old Nieto started playing in federated football with the Alicante CF in the Regional B Championship, in the following season he played in the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. He later played with H\u00e9rcules CF, a team that he was forced to leave in 1934 when he was assigned to Madrid for military service, and while there, he joined the ranks of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the First Division, where he had very few chances as he only played three matches, including one in La Liga.\nWhen the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, he remained loyal to the Spanish Second Republic and moved to Valencia, where he played for Levante. The abrupt stoppage of official competitions led the Catalan and Valencian federations to create a new tournament, the Mediterranean League, in which Levante finished in fifth, and Nieto then helped his side win the 1937 Copa de la Espa\u00f1a Libre, netting the winner against Valencia in the final (1\u20130). He then played for Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona before moving to Teruel in Aragon, where he participated in the Battle of the Ebro, the greatest battle, in terms of manpower, logistics and material ever fought on Spanish soil. In 1939, after the war was lost, Nieto crossed the French border and entered the Argel\u00e8s-sur-Mer concentration camp where he managed to free himself thanks to the mediation of FC S\u00e8te, a French team that signed him to play in the First Division. When he returned to Spain, Levante was his first team, and he was received there as a hero for having scored that winner a few months before.\nIn Levante, Nieto formed a defensive partnership with Guillermo Villagr\u00e1. In 1941, he was signed by Valencia, but after playing several friendlies and being condemned to being substituted to Mundo, Epi, Amadeo, Vicente Asensi, and Guillermo Gorostiza, he left on loan to FC Barcelona, who requested him when his forward Mariano Mart\u00edn was injured. At Bar\u00e7a, he scored once in 9 official league matches. After another loan to CD Alcoyano, his contract with Valencia ended and he finished his career at Levante in 1944, at the age of 29.\nManagerial career\nNieto had a brief career as a coach, first at Melilla CF in the late 1940s, then at Club Maghreb el Akssa\u00a0 in Tangier in the 1950s, and then in the Spanish Segunda Divisi\u00f3n with Algeciras CF and Real Balomp\u00e9dica Linense. After this stage as a coach, he left football completely and began to work by competitive examination at Diario Pueblo.\nDeath\nGarc\u00eda-Nieto died in Librilla on 17 March 1998, at the age of 83.\nHonours\nLevante UD\nCopa del Rey:\nWinners (1) 1937\n",

    "Short story by Greg Egan\n\"Didicosm\" is a science-fiction short story by Australian writer Greg Egan, first published in Analog in July/August 2023.\nPlot\nAs a child, her father shows Charlotte the night sky and wants her to realize the truth about the endless worlds and possibilities in the universe. In one of his books, he read about the idea of the universe repeating, but with changes occurring and later uses this thought to rationalize his own suicide. After her mother dies as well, Charlotte is brought to her grandmother and later wants to find the correct topology of the universe, which turns out to be a didicosm (Hantzsche-Wendt manifold). Her own student later comes up with a theoretical explanation involving quantum gravity, concluding this shape is indeed canonical due to being the only platycosm with a finite first homology group. Charlotte returns to her partner thinking that she lives in the best possible universe.\nBackground\nConstruction of the Hantzsche-Wendt manifold through (direct or twisted) idenftification of the surfaces of a cuboid\nWhile the 3-torus (), also one of the ten platycosms, can be depicted as space-filling repetition of the exact same cube with same orientation (hence a cube with respective opposite sides identified with same alignment), the didicosm can be depicted as a chessboard-like filling featuring cubes flipped and turned upside down. Both illustrations are featured in the short story. In 1984, Alexei Starobinsky and Yakov Zeldovich at the Landau Institute in Moscow proposed a cosmological model where the shape of the universe is a 3-torus.\nThe first homology of the didicosm is . (For the 3-torus it is .) The derivation is explained by Greg Egan on his website, which also lists four academic papers taken for the scientific basis of the short story: \u201eDescribing the platycosms\u201c by John Conway and Jean-Paul Rossetti, \u201eThe Hantzsche-Wendt Manifold in Cosmic Topology\u201c by Ralf Aurich and Sven Lustig, \u201eOn the coverings of the Hantzsche-Wendt Manifold\u201c by Grigory Chelnokov and Alexander Mednykh as well as \u201eHow Surfaces Intersect in Space\u201c by J. Scott Carter.\nReception\nReviews\nSam Tomaino, writing for SFRevu, thinks that the short story \u201egets a little technical but  an interesting idea\u201c.\nMike Bickerdike, writing for Tangent Online, states that \"Didicosm\" is \"somewhat unusual as an SF short story, because while it is technically a story, it is more a speculation on whether Hantzsche\u2013Wendt manifolds apply in cosmological topology.\" He claims that \"there is a story here, but it is rather weak, and serves only as a vehicle\" for the main idea, which is an \"impenetrable subject for those  who lack a higher degree in theoretical physics or the relevant mathematics.\"\nAwards\nThe short story was a finalist for the Analog Analytical Laboratory (AnLab) Award for best novelette in 2023.\nExternal links\nDidicosm title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\nDidicosm (full text on Egan's website)\nDidicosm (full text on analogsf.com)\n",
    "Capture of Tranquebar by British forces in 1801\nFor other sieges on Tranquebar, see Siege of Dansborg (disambiguation).\nThe Capture of Tranquebar (Danish: Overtagelsen af Trankebar) or the Surrender of Tranquebar (Danish: Overgivelsen af Trankebar) was a British takeover of the capital of Danish India, Tranquebar. The capture was quick and successful, with the Dano-Norwegian governor, Peter Anker, surrendering within the arrival of the British.\nBackground\nPortrait of Peter Anker (1744\u20131832), by Nils Gude\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars in 1800 and early-1801 rising tensions between Denmark\u2013Norway and the United Kingdom arose. The Danish colony of Tranquebar subsequently therefore received the intelligence of the rising tensions between the two nations, and Danish merchants therefore sold their ships in order for them not to end up in British hands. Governor of Tranquebar, Peter Anker, realized that a defense on a hypothetical British attack would by hopeless, and he therefore had already begun preparing for a capitulation.\nCapture\nIn May 1801 the English Governor-General of India, Richard Wellesley, got orders from Britain to occupy the Danish colonies, and on the 12 May two English shis anchored with 200 men on the coast of Tranquebar. Concurrently a force from Madras marched to Tranquebar to besiege the city. According to Peter Anker, the British forces were too strong to stand a change against, especially considering the poor conditions the fortifications had. When the British encouraged Anker to surrender, he therefore quickly consented and sent his Instrument of Surrender to the British command.\nOn the same day the British occupied Fort Dansborg and hoisted the Union Jack there. The three Danish ships in the habour were followingly seized.\nAftermath\nDespite the Danish instrument of surrender were favourable for the Danes, the British still accepted.  According to the capitulation Danish laws were acknowledged, and all public cases would be settled by the Danes, migrants would preserve their protection and the Danish officers should have the same wages as British. Only a British inspector would be installed to keep track of the economy.\nSome months after the surrender Anker received orders from Denmark to make the colony ready for an English attack, and to protect it to the utmost, yet Anker had already issued a surrender. On the 17 August 1802 Tranquebar was given back to Denmark.\nSee also\nEnglish Wars (Scandinavia)\u00a0\u2013 1807\u20131814 war in Northern and Western Europe\nBattle of Copenhagen (1801)\u00a0\u2013 Part of the War of the Second Coalition and the English Wars\nPeter Anker\u00a0\u2013 Norwegian general, diplomat and painter (1744-1832)Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nGunboat War\u00a0\u2013 1807\u20131814 war between Denmark\u2013Norway and the United Kingdom\n",

    "\nS-55 (Russian: \u0421-55) was an S-class submarine of the Soviet Navy during World War II. At the start of the conflict it was part of the Pacific Fleet in Vladivostok, and it was sent to the Northern Fleet in late 1942, arriving at the Polyarny naval base in early 1943. During the war the submarine carried out four patrols and sank two transport ships before disappearing in December 1943. \nDesign\nThe Srednyaya or S-class submarine (Russian: \u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f, lit.\u2009'medium'), also called the Stalinets class (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0446, lit.\u2009'follower of Stalin'), was an ocean-going diesel electric attack submarine. Its pressure hull had seven compartments, and the Series IX-bis submarine's displacement was 856 tonnes (842 long tons) while on the surface and 1,090 tonnes (1,070 long tons) while submerged. It had a length of 77.8\u00a0m (255\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in), a beam of 6.4 metres (21\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in), and a draft of 4 metres (13\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in). It had two diesel engines to power it on the surface and two electric motors for when it was submerged, providing 4,000 shaft horsepower (3,000\u00a0kW) and 1,100 shaft horsepower (820\u00a0kW), respectively, to the two propeller shafts. This gave it a speed of 18.85 knots (34.91\u00a0km/h) on the surface and 8.8 knots (16.3\u00a0km/h) while underwater, and the submarine had a range of 9,500 nautical miles (17,600\u00a0km). Its test depth was 80 metres (260\u00a0ft), and as armament it had six 530\u00a0mm (21\u00a0in) torpedo tubes, one 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) deck gun, and one 45\u00a0mm (1.8\u00a0in) gun.\nS-55 was part of the Series IX-bis, which was a modification of the original three boats of the S-class, the Series IX. The main difference between them was the replacement of German components used in Series IX with Soviet equivalents that could be manufactured domestically.\nCommissioning\nS-55 was laid down in Leningrad on 24 November 1936 before being delivered by rail to Dalzavod in Vladivostok in 1938, where it was launched on 27 November 1939 and commissioned on 25 July 1941, under the command of Captain 3rd rank Lev M. Sushkin. He remained the captain of S-55 for the rest its career. The boat became part of the 3rd Submarine Squadron of the Pacific Fleet 1st Submarine Brigade.\nService history\nOn 9 September 1942, S-55 and several other Pacific Fleet submarines were ordered by the Navy Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Nikolai Kuznetsov, to join the Northern Fleet in Polyarny by traveling through the Panama Canal. S-55 left Vladivostok on 5 October 1942 and arrived at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on 16 October, before continuing towards the Aleutian Islands. S-55 arrived at the U.S. naval base in Dutch Harbor, Alaska on the 20th. It and three other boats (S-51, S-54, and S-56) left Dutch Harbor on 28 October with four U.S. Navy destroyers, traveling along the West Coast to California, where they arrived at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard near San Francisco. S-55 stayed there from 5 November until later that month, when the group departed for the Panama Canal, and stopped at the Coco Solo U.S. naval base on the Atlantic coast of Panama. There the submarines received supplies before S-55 and S-54 left together on 3 December for Halifax, Canada, where they spent some time before continuing on the 25th for Britain. In January 1943 they arrived in Rosyth, where S-55 was put in a dry dock and had new electric batteries installed. While this was going on the crew of the submarine stayed on board the cruiser HMS\u00a0Liverpool.\nS-55 left Rosyth together with S-56 in February 1943 and they reached Polyarny on 8 March. After arriving at Polyarny, S-55 became part of the 2nd Submarine Squadron of the Northern Fleet Submarine Brigade and received repairs for several days. It carried out its first mission on 24 March 1943 when it departed from the base to help another submarine that hit a mine, M-174. The damaged vessel was able to make it to back to the base on its own power, and they returned on the following day.\nS-55 began its first war patrol on 28 March 1943, going to a position in the Barents Sea off Vard\u00f8 Municipality. S-55 launched a torpedo at another submarine the next day but it missed its target. Shortly after that, S-55 attacked a convoy of several transport ships, and it fired four torpedoes, though none of them made a hit. During the engagement and on its way back to base the submarine was damaged. It returned to Polyarny on 3 April. The boat went on its second patrol starting on the 22nd of the same month near Nordkapp Municipality. It made an attack on another German convoy in the evening of 29 April, and one of its torpedoes sank the transport Sturzsee (708 tons). After this it was pursued by German warships that dropped depth charges. S-55 took significant damage from explosions that happened close by, but was able to return to Polyarny on 30 April.\nFrom May to September 1943 the submarine underwent repairs, and on 1 July it was transferred to the 5th Squadron of the Submarine Brigade. S-55 began its next patrol on 30 September 1943 off Sv\u00e6rholtklubben. During the patrol, on ",
    "Canadian politician\nColin Dean Murdock (born October 8, 1981)  is a Canadian politician. He has served as the mayor of Saanich, British Columbia since 2022.\nEarly life and career\nMurdock was born at the Vancouver General Hospital to parents Randy and Linda Murdock (n\u00e9e Carswell), though he credits his birthplace as Richmond, British Columbia. His father was a safety inspector for a Molson brewery. The family moved to Saanich in 1993.  Murdock grew up in the Cordova Bay neighbourhood,  and attended Royal Oak Middle School and Claremont Secondary School. He attended Camosun College, and then the University of Victoria, where he took social sciences. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 2003 and a Masters in 2007. After university, he lived in Japan where he taught English.\nPrior to his election as mayor, Murdock worked as a political science instructor at Camosun College for three years, and worked for the BC Ministry of Health and the BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. He worked in the Ministry of Health for 17 years. Murdock served as chair of the Sierra Club Victoria from 2007 to 2008.\nEarly electoral experience\nMurdock first ran for office in 1999 at the age of 18, when he ran for school board representing School District 63 Saanich Peninsula. He earned 1,477 votes in the Saanich zone, missing a spot on the board by 59 votes.\nWhile a student at the University of Victoria, Murdock ran for a council by-election in Saanich in 2001 caused by the resignation of Sheila Orr, who was elected to the BC Legislative Assembly. He ran for council again in the 2002 municipal elections, winning 4,667 votes, finishing 11th on the 8 seat body.\nDistrict Council\nMurdock ran again for council in the 2008 British Columbia municipal elections on platform of \"making an efficient transportation network, a healthy ecosystem and protection for green space and agricultural land\". In the election, Murdock was finally elected to council, winning 9,079 votes, in sixth position.\nMurdock endorsed Mike Farnworth's campaign in the 2011 British Columbia New Democratic Party leadership election.\nMurdock was re-elected to council in the 2011 municipal elections, winning 11,899 votes, in fifth spot. He ran again in the 2014 municipal elections, running on a platform of creating a \"variety of new housing options\", addressing transportation needs, and \"standing up for farmland\" in the district.  In the election, Murdock topped the poll, winning 14,781 votes. While on council, he served as a director on the Capital Regional District from 2017 to 2018. His main focus as a councillor was on housing affordability, food security issues, emission reductions, and safety for pedestrians and cyclists.\nMurdock did not run for re-election in the 2018 municipal elections, citing family reasons.  After his term on council, he created a group called \"Better Mobility Saanich\" in an effort to identify dangerous walking and cycling routes to schools in order to improve active transportation infrastructure.  He also hosted a podcast called Amazing Places.\nMayoralty\nMurdock announced his intentions to run for mayor of Saanich in October 2021, a full year before the 2022 mayoral election. At his campaign launch, he announced \"It's time for new leadership at city hall\". He was endorsed by former councillors Carol Pickup and David Cubberley.\nMurdock was elected mayor of Saanich in the 2022 election, defeating incumbent mayor Fred Haynes by just 152 votes. Murdock ran on a platform of tackling housing affordability, creating accessible and walkable neighbourhoods and protecting against climate change. During the campaign, Murdock criticized Haynes for \"the slow pace of progress.. on the affordability crisis\".\nAs mayor, one of the main issues Murdock has had to deal with is balancing the province's mandate of building more housing and residents' opposition and concerns about new projects in the municipality. Murdock supports the provincial government's housing targets. Another issue in Saanich that Murdock has had to deal with as mayor include calls from the police department for an increase in their budget due to \"lack of bodies responding to calls\" causing a reduction is safety for officers.\n",

    "\nCadair Berwyn North Top in the Berwyn range, an SSSI.\nA Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is a conservation designation denoting a protected area in Wales, as elsewhere in United Kingdom. SSSIs are the basic building block of site-based nature conservation legislation and most other legal nature/geological conservation designations in Great Britain are based upon them, including national nature reserves, Ramsar sites, Special Protection Areas, and Special Areas of Conservation. Sites notified for their biological interest are known as Biological SSSIs, and those notified for geological or physiographic interest are Geological SSSIs. Many SSSIs are notified for both biological and geological interest.\nBackground\nSSSIs in the UK are notified using the concept of an Area of Search (AOS), an area of between 400\u00a0km2 (150\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and 4,000\u00a0km2 (1,500\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in size. The Areas of Search were conceived and developed between 1975 and 1979 by the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), based on regions created by the Local Government Act 1972. Whereas England had its Areas of Search based on 46 counties, those in Wales were based on a combination of the counties and smaller districts. In 1974, Wales was divided into 8 counties, with 37 districts. The NCC created 12 Welsh Areas of Search; they mostly follow county borders, but the larger counties (Dyfed, Powys and Gwynedd) were divided into multiple Areas using district borders. Mid and South Glamorgan were merged into a single AOS, whilst Llanelli district was included in the West Glamorgan AOS.\nDue to subsequent local government reorganisation in the UK since 1972, many counties and districts have been divided, merged or renamed. Using the AOS system alone would make it difficult to search for individual SSSI citations via the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) database without knowing 1972 region divisions. As a result, the CCW groups Welsh SSSIs using the subdivisions of Wales formed in April 1996 by the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, resulting in 22 principal areas.\nFor SSSIs elsewhere in the UK, see List of SSSIs by Area of Search.\nThere are between 1,019 (as of 2017) and 1,078 (as of 2021) sites of special scientific interest in Wales, accounting for 235,000 hectares (580,000 acres), making up over 12% of Wales' land area. The smallest SSSI is the Lesser Horseshoe bat roost in Pembrokeshire (0.004 hectares (430\u00a0sq\u00a0ft)), while the Berwyn mountain range (24,321 hectares (60,100 acres)) is the largest. In 2021, 17% of SSSIs were in an unfavourable condition, 13% favourable, with the remaining 70% of unknown condition, as part of a report in Wales' SSSIs the first since 2006. Many SSSIs are not monitored due to a lack of funding. Most SSSIs in Wales are in private ownership, however some are under the ownership and management of local wildlife trusts, or other voluntary conservation bodies. The first SSSI designated in Wales was from 1949. 99 coal tips in Wales are also SSSIs.\nThey are designated under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, with Natural Resources Wales being the responsible body for SSSIs in Wales.\nList\nBy Area of Search\nThis section is transcluded from List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest by Area of Search.

    "Urban park in Minneapolis, Minnesota\nThis article is about a park. For the neighborhood, see Powderhorn Park, Minneapolis.\nPowderhorn Park is an urban park in Minneapolis. It sits in the northwest of the Powderhorn Park neighborhood and near the center of the larger Powderhorn community, both of which take their names from the park. The park was established around Powderhorn Lake in the late 19th century.\nThe park is mostly set at an elevation below the surrounding neighborhood. It contains playing fields, playgrounds and a recreation center that hosts community education classes ranging from pottery to yoga. In winter, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board sets up a portable warming house and the lake is used for ice skating. Powderhorn Lake is a popular local destination for shore or pier fishing.\nHistory\nLake Powderhorn and the surrounding area in 1880\nBefore there was a park, there was a curved lake in the middle of what is now Minneapolis. The name Powderhorn Lake was first used for the lake in a map of the area around Fort Snelling in 1839. The lake takes its name from its former shape: it was curved, resembling a powder horn, until the mid-1920s, when the northern arm of the lake was filled. The lake is still at the center of the park; the former northern arm now hosts a baseball diamond.\nThe park was established in the 1880s as the surrounding area was beginning to fill in with housing. In 1883, the Minnesota Legislature and Minneapolis voters approved the founding of the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board (MPRB), and within months, residents of the area asking for a park around Powderhorn Lake. MPRB designated the lake shore as a park in 1887, then embarked in a slow period of land acquisitions. A 20-acre plot was added in 1891. The ice rink was constructed that year and the recreation center built in 1907. By 1917, the park was shaped almost the same as it is today.\nEvents\nAnnual and reoccurring\nCelebration of May Day in 2006The park and lake are used as the setting for the last act in the city's annual May Day parade (occurring on the first Sunday in May), which is a play in motion that has been running since 1975. This was produced by the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre through 2022 and continues as a decentralized, community-run endeavor. As the parade runs south along Bloomington Avenue, participants wear a variety of costumes, and many manipulate giant puppets, all to produce a story that is based on sociopolitical themes including peace, environmentalism, current events, and others. After the parade story ends, the tail end of the parade is a \"free speech\" section which includes representatives of community groups and campaigning politicians. After the parade, people gather on a hillside at the west end of the park for the Tree of Life ceremony.  Many details of the final act change from year to year, but there are several figures that consistently appear: River, Woods, Prairie, Sky, Sun, and the Tree of Life. At the end of the ceremony, a flotilla comes across the lake with the Sun figure in the central boat. The Sun awakens the Tree of Life (a figure which includes a traditional maypole), and the crowd sings \"You Are My Sunshine\" to mark the banishment of another season of winter.\nPowderhorn Park is also home to other festivals and decentralized celebrations. The Powderhorn Art Fair, a fine arts and crafts festival, has been held in the park for over 30 years.  The park has also hosted the Autonomous Zine Fest.  Minneapolis People's Pride, an LGBT pride festival designed to be free of police and corporate presences, has been located in the park since 2021. The Minneapolis Art Sled Rally, an event in which participants sled down the hill in sleds of their own design, often depicting topical characters or themes, has been in Powderhorn Park since 2008. The rally has made the news for its creative and sometimes controversial sled designs.\nProtests and civil unrest\nA \"defund police\" sign and stage before a rally at Powderhorn Park on June 7, 2020.\nPowderhorn Park has been a gathering site for protests, including as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. In June 2020, shortly after the Murder of George Floyd, crowds of hundreds gathered in the park to protest the murder and the call for a stronger response from city leadership. There, nine of the thirteen members of the Minneapolis City Council pledged to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department.\nAn encampment for people experiencing homelessness emerged at Powderhorn Park in mid 2020 as a result of civil disorder in the aftermath of Floyd's murder. Some community members complained about the camp (which brought increased vehicle traffic, drugs, property damage, and at least two overdoses) and changed their behavior to avoid it, and others committed to not involving the police.  Some community members delivered meals, medical care, and counseling and sought support from the American Indian Movement to monitor the a",
    "\nThe Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) is a bill in the U.S. Congress to explicitly address the treatment of digital assets under U.S. law.\nThe House Financial Services Committee asserts that the FIT21 Act is \"an important step towards achieving regulatory clarity for digital assets\", with intent to offer strong consumer safeguards and the regulatory clarity that is necessary for the digital asset industry in the United States to prosper.  The legislation defines responsibilities between various US agencies, notably between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for digital commodities and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for securities and firms that deal in them.\nThe legislation has bipartisan support with both Democrats and Republicans sponsoring the bill. The proposed legislation excludes certain stablecoins from both CFTC and SEC regulation, \"except for fraud and certain activities by registered firms.\"  The bill was passed in the lower house of Congress in May 2024 and moves on to the Senate.\nHistory\nThe bill was first introduced \"into the House Financial Services Committee and the Committee on Agriculture in June 2023.\"\nIn early May 2024, the bill was jointly approved by both the Financial Services committee and the Ag committee (which has jurisdiction for law related to commodity exchanges). This has set the stage for consideration of the bill by the entire U.S. House of Representatives in late May.\nOn 22 May 2024 the bill was passed by the full House by a vote of 279-136, with 71 Democrats and 208 Republicans voting to support the measure. The bill passed over the vocal opposition of President Biden and SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\nProvisions\nFinancial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act has been summarized by the Congressional Research Service as follows:\n\"This bill establishes a regulatory framework for digital assets.\n\"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) must regulate a digital asset as a commodity if the blockchain, or digital ledger, on which it runs is functional and decentralized. The bill classifies a blockchain as decentralized if, among other requirements, no person has unilateral authority to control the blockchain or its usage, and no issuer or affiliated person has control of 20% or more of the digital asset or the voting power of the digital asset. In addition, the bill provides the CFTC with exclusive regulatory authority over cash or spot markets for digital commodities.\n\"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must regulate a digital asset as a security if its associated blockchain is functional but not decentralized. However, the bill establishes certain exceptions to SEC regulation for digital assets that limit annual sales, restrict nonaccredited investor access, and satisfy disclosure and compliance requirements. The bill also sets forth requirements for primary and secondary market transactions.\n\"The CFTC and SEC must jointly issue rules to define terms and exempt dually registered exchanges from duplicative rules.\n\"The bill excludes permitted stablecoins from CFTC and SEC regulation, except regarding anti-fraud authority and specified transactions on registered entities.\"\nExternal links\nDetails of the bill (H.R. 4763) on congress.gov\n",

    "Constituency in Seoul, South Korea\nSeodaemun A (Korean:\u00a0\uc11c\ub300\ubb38\uad6c \uac11) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Seodaemun District, Seoul. As of 2024, 130,042 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Seodaemun\u2013Eunpyeong constituency.\nHistory\nThroughout its history, Seodaemun A has elected members of both liberal and conservative parties to represent the constituency. Accordingly, Seodaemun A has historically been considered a bellwether constituency by political analysts. However, in recent elections the Democratic Party has been dominant with four consecutive wins in the constituency. Therefore, some analysts consider the constituency as becoming a stronghold for the Democratic Party.\nKang Seong-mo of the right-wing Democratic Justice Party was the first member to represent the constituency having won with 37.04% of the vote. Kang lost his bid for re-election and was succeeded by Kim Sang-hyun of the centre-left Democratic Party. Kim won re-election in 1996 but was not re-nominated ahead of the 2000 election. He was succeeded by Lee Sung-heon of the centre-right Grand National Party who won in a tight race against Woo Sang-ho of the Millennium Democratic Party. Lee Sung-heon and Woo Sang-ho would continue to face off in rematches in Seodaemun A as the mainstream conservative and liberal party candidates respectively until the 2020 South Korean legislative election.\nIn the 2004 South Korean legislative election, Woo Sang-ho of the Uri Party narrowly defeated incumbent Lee Sung-heon by a margin of 1,899 votes. However, in the following election held in 2008, Lee won the seat back by a wide margin and securing 51.64% of the vote. In the 2012 election, Woo won the seat back, securing 54.36% of the vote in a one-on-one battle against Lee Sung-heon. Woo won re-election in 2016 and 2020 with 54.88% and 53.24% of the vote respectively, defeating former assemblyman Lee Sung-heon in both matches.\nAhead of the 2024 South Korean legislative election, Woo Sang-ho announced that he would not be standing for re-election in Seodaemun A.

    "Demonstration in Amsterdam, Netherlands\nOn May 6, 2024 University of Amsterdam (UvA) students established a pro-Palestinian protest occupation on the Roeterseiland campus to support Palestinians in Gaza and demand action from administrators. This became the first in a series of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses throughout the Netherlands. On May 7, 169 people were detained when the police used a bulldozer to break down the barricades after the protesters refused to leave.\nIn response to the protests, UvA published a list of cooperations with Israeli institutions and universities.

The escalation began after mass arrests at the Columbia University campus occupation, led by anti-Zionist groups, in which protesters demanded the university's disinvestment from Israel over its alleged genocide of Palestinians. In the U.S. over 2,950 protesters have been arrested, including faculty members and professors, on over 60 campuses. On May 7, protests spread across Europe with mass arrests in the Netherlands.

An encampment was erected on the lawn of the campus thereafter, encircled by barricades made of bricks, planks and ropes. Later that night, a group of people in support of Israel sought out a confrontation with demonstrators at the encampment, throwing flares and fireworks at them. They were soon driven away by the demonstrators, while the police did not attempt to intervene. The demonstration went quiet as the night deepened. Most protestors at the encampment rested in tents.\nAfter midnight on May 7, riot police and police dogs were mobilized to raid and evict the encampment. Bulldozers were implemented to demolish the barricades, and some demonstrators tried to fight back. Physical conflicts between protestors and the police took place, followed by the arrest of 169 people, including a member of the Provincial Council of Gelderland. At least one protester suffered head injuries, while a police officer got injured as well. Most people left the scene by 4:30 am.

He then served as Minister to Bucharest, the capital of Romania.\nDuring the Second Republic, he was Spanish ambassador to Japan from 1931 to 1932, followed by ambassador in Washington, D.C. between 1932 and 1934. His appointment was met favorably in the United States, and a luncheon was given in his honor at the Newport, Rhode Island home of Mrs. Duncan E. Cameron. Among the attendess were Juan Ria\u00f1o y Gayangos, the former Spanish diplomat who had married an American socialite and heiress.\nAfter Washington, he served as ambassador to the French Republic between 1934 and 1936. After the coup d'\u00e9tat of July 1936 that began the Civil War, it did not take long before he joined the rebels.

C\u00e1rdenas presented his resignation on July 23.\nAn aristocrat with monarchical inclinations, he was sent to perform the functions of informal diplomatic representative of the Francoist side in the United States, as \"representative of the National government.\" He boasted of the change of editorial line favorable to Franco of La Nueva Espa\u00f1a publication from September 1937, pointing it out as his own merit. At the end of the war, he was again made Ambassador to the United States in 1939. He served as Ambassador until 1947 when he relinquished his post \"as a result of the December, 1946 United Nations vote that demanded the replacement of the Franco regime with one 'deriving its authority from the governed' and recommended that all member nations recall their ambassadors from Madrid.\" After leaving the United States, he became rector of Spain's School of Diplomacy, holding that position until 1957 while remaining honorary director until his death in 1966.\nPersonal life\nPhotograph of Madame Nano and, C\u00e1rdenas' wife, Lucienne, c.\u20091923\nOn 27 June 1923, C\u00e1rdenas married Lucienne Nano, sister of Frederick Nano, the then secretary of the Romanian legation (who was later appointed Minister of Romania in the United States in 1926).

His works feature in international collections including the Tate Modern, Pinault Collection, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo.\nWork\nEngaging in painting, sculpture, photography, installations, video, and performance art, Ob\u00e1's works widely revolve around the affirmation of the body, engaging with ideas of Blackness, racism, religion, and eroticism. Ob\u00e1 has described his work as being concerned with reclaiming his African heritage in a society that has sought to dilute Black culture.\nOb\u00e1's work often explores the relationship between religion and the body. Being Catholic is a strong part of Ob\u00e1's identity. However, his art serves as a space where he can remain a Catholic but, according to the artist, escape from the rules and injustices of organized religion to imagine redemption of the Black body from the vestiges of slavery and reductive eroticization.\nIn 2020, Ob\u00e1 created a large-scale painting titled \u201cWade in the Water II\u201d as an homage to George Floyd, whose name has become synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement. The painting depicts Floyd transcending traditional depictions of Black bodies in water, taking on the powers of Lemanj\u00e1, a central Orix\u00e1 deity in the Candombl\u00e9 religion. \u201cWade in the Water II\u201d was exhibited at the Pinacoteca de S\u00e3o Paulo.\nPermanent collections\nOb\u00e1's works are part of several collections worldwide, including the MASP Museu de Arte Moderna de S\u00e3o Paulo, Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro, Pinacoteca do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, Pinault Collection, P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami, X Museum, Museo Reina Sofia, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Blenheim Art Foundation, Tate Modern, Instituto Moreira Salles.\n",

After graduating from high school, from 1962 to 1964, he worked as a laboratory assistant at the Department of Theoretical Physics at the Moscow State Pedagogical University, equipment adjuster at the Moscow Electric Lamp Plant. In 1964 he entered the Moscow Energy Institute, graduating in 1968, and worked as an engineer at the Joint Design Bureau of the same institute.\nSince 1969 he served in the KGB of the USSR. He served in the 8th Main Directorate of the KGB of the USSR (encryption and decryption, it was also responsible for government communications), beginning his service as an engineer. Simultaneously with his service, he received additional education: in 1973 he graduated from the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of the Moscow State University and in 1983 graduate school at the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB.\nWhen, after the collapse of the USSR in December 1991, the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information under the President of the Russian Federation (FAPSI) was separated from the KGB, among other intelligence services, Matyukhin joined FAPSI and was appointed head of the Research Center of the Main Security Directorate FAPSI communications. From 1993 he served as Deputy General Director of FAPSI.\nOn May 31, 1999, by decree of the President of the Russian Federation Yeltsin, he was appointed General Director of FAPSI. Colonel General V. G. Matyukhin became the third and last head of FAPSI.\nSince January 2001, as Director General of FAPSI, he was a member of the Operational Headquarters for managing counter-terrorism actions in the North Caucasus region, created by decree of the President of the Russian Federation. He was a member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation (from June 14, 1999, to June 21, 2003). Since June 13, 2000, member of the Russian Government Commission on Military-Industrial Issues. Since November 2000 - Chairman of the Coordination Council for ensuring the security of encryption tools and their operation in government and closed communications systems of the CIS member states.\nOn March 11, 2003, President of the Russian Federation Putin signed a number of decrees aimed at reforming government bodies in Russia. In particular, FAPSI was abolished, its functions were distributed between the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation and the Federal Protective Service of the Russian Federation. At the same day, Vladimir Matyukhin was appointed chairman of the State Committee of the Russian Federation for State Defense Orders under the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation. On the same day, March 11, 2003, by decree No. 305 of the President of Russia, Matyukhin was awarded the military rank of army general.\nIn April 2004, the State Committee for Defense Orders was transformed into the Federal Service for Defence Contracts of the Russian Federation under the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. However, Matyukhin was not placed at the head of the new service, but was appointed First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation. He worked in this position for less than a month and was discharged from military service in May 2004.\nSince June 8, 2004 to 2010 he served as Director of the Federal Agency for Information Technologies of the Russian Federation (Rosinformtekhnologii). On January 26, 2010, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a governmental decree releasing Matyukhin from his post \u201cdue to reaching the age limit\u201d for holding it.\nSince December 16, 2010, he has been First Deputy General Director and Scientific Director of the Research and Design Institute of Information, Automation and Communications in Railway Transport (JSC NIIAS).\nHe is Doctor of Technical Sciences, a full member of the Russian Academy of Cryptography, the Russian Academy of Engineering Sciences and the International Academy of Communications. Laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation. For his great contribution to the development of information technology and the implementation of state policy in the field of informatization, he was awarded a Certificate of Honor from the Government of the Russian Federation, and received letters of gratitude from the President of the Russian Federation, the Chairman of the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Russian Federation. Author of more than 150 scientific papers and four inventions. Married and has a son.\n",
    "Bilateral relationsSomalia\u2013Syria relations refer to foreign relations between Somalia and Syria. Diplomatic relations were established when Syria opened its embassy in Mogadishu on 13 December 1964. Both nations are Arab League & Organisation of Islamic Cooperation members and maintain relations.\nHistory\nDiplomatic relations between Syria and Somalia were established on 13 December 1964. Historically and presently, the relationship between the two countries is characterized by mutual amicability.\nSomalia strongly opposed Israel's attack on Egypt & Syria in the Six-Day War in 1967 and their occupation of the Golan and is of the opinion that the Golan is sovereign Syrian territory. Conversely, Syria strongly supports the territorial integrity of Somalia and rejects the legitimacy of Somaliland, considering it to be Somali territory.\nSomalia also supported the Arab coalition in the Yom Kippur War in which Syria was the main belligerent on the Golan front.\nIn turn, Syria supported Somalia in the Ogaden War, sending a small expeditionary infantry force to assist Somalia's war effort even receiving President Siad Barre on a state visit to Damascus in 1977, despite Syria's exceptionally close relationship with the Soviet Union. During the latter half of the Cold War, President Hafez al-Assad viewed Somalia with some caution as Somalia had a very close relationship with Iraq, as Hafez and Iraq's President Saddam Hussein were vying for influence regionally and within the Ba'ath Party and both leaders despised each other.\nWhen the Somali government collapsed in 1991, Syria received many Somali refugees and extended privileges such as state-subsided healthcare to the refugees.\nNotably, Somalia did not fully cut relations with Syria as a result of the civil war in Syria unlike many other Arab or Muslim countries, merely temporarily vacating their embassy. In fact, relations are still warm between Somalia and Syria on account of Syria's past stances of Somalia, particularly Syria's support of Somalia in the Ogaden War and the government's positive reception of Somali refugees. Somalia's embassy on occasion sends diplomatic dispatches to affirm Somalia's support for Syria.\nThere are a significant amount of Syrian refugees in Somalia who are well received as they are perceived to be high skilled labourers and Somalia benefits from the additional labour force.\nDiplomatic missions\nSomalia has an embassy in Damascus, and Syria maintains a non-resident embassy in Sanaa.\nSee also\nForeign relations of Somalia\nForeign relations of Syria\n",
    "Barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Draco\nMarkarian 817 is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Draco. It is located 456 million light-years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that Markarian 817 is about 80,000 light-years across. It is a Seyfert galaxy.\nFeatures\nThe nucleus of Markarian 817 is found to be active. It is classified as a Seyfert 1.5 or Seyfert 1.2 galaxy by the recent work done, according to Koss et al. 2017. The nucleus sits in a barred spiral galaxy, close to face-on and not typical for optically selected unobscured Seyferts.  There is evidence of dust along the galaxy's bar according to the Hubble image.\nA study conducted in February 2011, shows that the active core is not fixed as it shows strong variabilities in X-rays and ultraviolet rays (UV). The X-ray luminosity varies by a factor of ~40 over 20 years, while the UV continuum/emission lines vary at the most by a factor of ~2.3 over the past 30 years.\nA 2021 study shows that the X-ray spectrum in Markarian 817 is highly absorbed and there are new blueshifted, broad, and narrow UV absorption lines, suggesting a dust-free, ionized obscurer that is located in the inner broad-line region, partially covering the central source. During the first 55 days, scientists observed there is a de-coupling of the UV continuum and the UV broad emission line variability. The next 42 days of the campaign showed the correlation recovering, as Markarian 817 entered the less obscured state. The short C IV and Ly\u03b1 lags suggest that the accretion disk extends beyond the UV broad-line region.\nMarkarian 817 has become a notable target of the AGN STORM 2 project, in which a group of astronomers lead by Edward M. Cackett from the Wayne State University in Detroit, monitored the galaxy with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory for 15 months, during which they obtained observations in X-rays and six ultraviolet/optical filters to shed more light on Markarian 817.\nFurther observations done in 2022 showed that the source flux in Markarian 817 has declined compared to that recorded at a prior point during the 19-year mission. From the deep XMM Newton and NuSTAR observations, the spectra presents a complex X-ray wind which consists of neutral and ionized absorption zones. Three velocity components are detected from the part of the structured ultra-fast outflow with v/c = 0.043 (+0.007,-0.003), v/c = 0.079 (+0.003,-0.0008), and v/c = 0.074 (+0.004,-0.005). These suggest that the wind likely arises at radii that are smaller compared to the optical broad line region.\nBlack hole\nAn artist's impression of ultra-fast winds blasting out from the center of Markarian 817.\nThe central black hole in Markarian 817 has an estimated solar mass of (4.9 +/- 0.8) E+7 according to Peterson et al. 2004. Such winds tend to move at many millions of kilometers per hour, thus cleaning up interstellar gas from their region of space. This cuts off the rate of production of new stars being formed in Markarian 817, leaving very little matter to feed the accretion disk. This suggests that the black hole is experiencing a \"temper tantrum\" and is responsible for shaping its host galaxy.\nIn an article in which Markarian 817 and another Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 is studied, it is revealed both AGNs displayed time lags in the broad emission line, including H, H, He~{\\sc ii} and He~{\\sc i} and also the Fe~{\\sc ii} for Markarian 817 with respect to the varying continuum at 5100~\u00c5. From the relationship of line widths and time lags, both galaxies showed that the broad-line regions (BLR) dynamics are consistent with the viral predication. Data provided from Markarian 817 showed almost the same kinetic structures, in which the time lags in the red wing is larger compared to the time lags in the blue wing. This indicates the BLR of Keplerian motion seemly has outflowing components during the monitoring period.\nSee also\nMarkarian 590 - a Seyfert galaxy in Cetus\nMarkarian 273 - a Seyfert and ultraluminous infrared galaxy\n",

    "Greek footballer (1916\u20131938)\nLysandros Dikaiopoulos (Greek: \u039b\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2; 1916 \u2013 3 May 1938) was a Greek footballer who played as a defender. He died playing in a football match following a fatal head injury in May 1938. It was the second incident in Greece where a footballer suffered a fatal accident while playing in a match, six years after the death of the 17-year-old goalkeeper of Apollon Patras, Giannis Fotiou.\nEarly life\nDikaiopoulos was born at Smyrna, from where his family came in 1922 during the Asia Minor disaster. His family was relatively wealthy. His father had passed away at a young age. He lived with his mother and simblings in the area of Agios Sostis in Neos Kosmos at 171 Andrea Syngrou Avenue. As a citizen he worked as a pianist, while at the time of his death he was serving his term as a flight attendant at the Naval Air Base of Phalerum. One of his brothers was also a footballer who later played at AEK Athens from 1937 to 1939.\nClub career\nDikaiopoulos started playing football at an early age in unofficial clubs near his home area, first at Argonaftes Kallithea and then at Mikrasiatiki Dourgouti, which was crowned AFCA champion in the division of unofficial clubs in 1934. The following season he played for the first time in an official league with A.E. Irakleio in the third division. He particularly distinguished himself by helping his club reach the final stage of the league. His appearances were noticed by the officials of AEK Athens and in 1935 he signed for the yellow-blacks, where he played for three seasons having 9, 10 and 4 league appearances, respectively.\nIn 1937 he was transferred to Panathinaikos, where he was established in the starting line-up as a full-back. He was noted for his speed and self-sacrifice and he had the potential to become an international footballer with Greece, but fate had other plans for him.\nDeath\nOn 1st May 1938, and while the AFCA championship had ended, a friendly match between Panathinaikos and AEK was organized at Leoforos Alexandras Stadium, which ended 0\u20130. At the 7th minute of the match, Dikaiopoulos, in his attempt to clear an opponent's attack with a header, strongly collided with Tryfon Tzanetis, who jumped at the same time. While Tzanetis fell on his face, managed to protect himself with his hands and got up almost immediately a little dazed with minor bruises, but Dikaiopoulos fell awkwardly and hit the ground with the back of his head, remaining motionless. The match was temporarily suspended, as the doctor and former athlete, M. Marsellos who was watching the match, rushed to the pitch and diagnosed the seriousness of the hit. The player was taken to the \"Red Cross\" hospital in a state of aphasia, accompanied by his devastated mother who had come to watch him play. In the hospital, the doctors determined that the wound was fatal, since he had suffered a fracture at the base of the skull and a concussion. He was punctured to remove the internal hematoma but the athlete never regained consciousness. He survived for almost 48 hours thanks to his strong hold and passed away at 10:30 a.m. on 3 May in the arms of his mother and his teammates, Tasos Kritikos and Kostas Zogas who had came to visit him.\nHis death moved the society of Athens and especially the sports world. His funeral at the first cemetery of Athens was public and it was attended by official authorities led by the Minister-Commander of the Capital, Konstantinos Kotzias. His teammates at Panathinaikos, his former teammates at AEK, many footballers from other clubs, an agema of Aircraftmen that gave honors, the boards of the HFF, AFCA, Panathinaikos, AEK Athens, P.A.O. Dafni, Apollon Athens, Asteras Athens, Olympiacos, Atromitos, Mikrasiatiki Dourgouti, Poseidon Glyfada, while representatives of the newspapers \"Athlitismos\" and \"Athlitiko Vima\" also laid wreaths. AFCA has decided to observe a minute's silence in the upcoming matches and for the players to compete with black armbands. Telegrams were also sent by clubs of the countryside. The consequence of the death of Dikaiopoulos was the decision of the state to oblige the clubs from now on to insure their eleven football players anonymously, so that those who compete have insurance. The state granted a special pension for his widowed mother and gave a dowry his unmarried sister.\nTributes\nIn May 1939, one year after his death, his relatives and a few sports fans from Kallithea, decided to found a football club dedicated to the memory of the late football player. They named it \"Lysandros Kallithea\". The Board of Directors of the new club were formed by: Ioannis Kouskounas, Spyros Pithamitsis, Athanasios Fotakis, Vasilios Sakopoulos, Vrasidas Dikaiopoulos, Lazaros Ermeidis, Nikolaos Fallieros, Athanasios Bandounas, Andreas Valves, Anastasios Kritikos, Venis Apostolidis, Athanasios Kapitsas. The club was active until October 1940, when the WW2 started, when it was dissolved. The team operated as a football section of the \"Na",
    "Vocational education school in Philadelphia, PA, United States\nBerean Institute, founded as the Berean Manual Training and Industrial School, was a vocational school for predominantly African American adult learners in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1899 by Rev. Matthew Anderson and Dr. Caroline Still Anderson and located at 1901 W. Girard Avenue, the school offered business and vocational training for both men and women. The Institute closed in 2012.\nHistory\nSix prominent Philadelphia citizens organized the Berean Manual Training and Industrial School on November 6, 1899. The organizers included Dr. Matthew Anderson, a leader in the city's Black community and the pastor of the Berean Presbyterian Church, which he had founded in June 1880. In 1888, Anderson had founded the Berean Building and Loan Association, which grew to manage more than $150,000 of stock on behalf of 700 members of Philadelphia's African American community as of 1909. Anderson went on to serve as principal of the Berean Institute from 1899 until his death in 1928. His wife, Dr. Caroline Still Anderson, a physician and educator who like her husband was a graduate of Oberlin College, served as the school's assistant principal until her death in 1919. The Berean Institute took its name from the biblical city of Berea and from Berea, Ohio, where Anderson preached during his time at Oberlin.\nThe Berean Institute filled a critical community need, as the vast majority of US vocational schools in this period were racially segregated, and Philadelphia-area African Americans had no formal vocational training options until the Institute opened. The founders also highlighted the need for vocational training for recent waves of Black migrants from the South. From six instructors and 25 students in 1899, the Berean Institute had grown to 300 students and 16 instructors by 1909. Classes were held at night as most students worked during the day. Adult students learned arithmetic, reading and writing, bookkeeping, electrical wiring, carpentry, upholstery, sewing, hatmaking, typewriting and stenography, cooking, and waitering.\nThe Berean Institute received its inaugural charter from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1904, which enabled it to start receiving funding support from the Commonwealth. In 1908, it moved from temporary quarters in the basement of the Berean Presbyterian Church to a newly constructed three-story brick building on Girard Avenue. The school moved again to a larger brick building on Girard Avenue in 1973. The Berean curriculum expanded to include two-year programs and high school completion courses, cosmetology, salesmanship, information technology, management, finance, dietetics and nutrition, ESL courses targeted to the Puerto Rican community, and more. Enrollment was open to all students regardless of race or color.\nIn the 1980s, the Berean Institute enrolled 200-300 students. The Institute's enrollment fluctuated over the years but experienced overall decline, with its academic programs having 92 students in 2005 and 157 students in 2007. Enrollment plummeted to just six students in 2008, after the school lost its accreditation and after an independent audit found inadequate recordkeeping by the Institute, which had experienced at least four consecutive years of operating losses. The Berean Institute officially closed when the Commonwealth evicted the Institute from its state-owned building in late 2012. The Institute had failed to make lease payments since 2006 while subletting parts of the building in violation of its lease and failing to pay its utility bills.\nLegacy\nThe Philadelphia Technician Training Institute purchased the institute's vacated building in 2015 for $2.8 million and uses the space for a trade school.\nOn October 17, 1990, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a roadside historical marker to mark the Institute building on Girard Avenue. The marker's text states, \"Founded in 1899 by Rev. Matthew Anderson, pastor of Berean Presbyterian Church and founder of Berean Savings Association, this school taught Blacks skilled trades not available elsewhere. Later the curriculum was expanded to meet changing student needs.\"\nInstitute alumni included Pennsylvania state representative Ruth Harper (1927\u20132006). Past board members included pastor Henry L. Phillips.\n",

A notable opponent of the Military dictatorship in Brazil, which ruled the country from 1964 until the 1985 transition to democracy, Almeida co-founded the original MDB in 1966 alongside Ulysses Guimar\u00e3es, M\u00e1rio Covas, and Humberto Lucena\u00a0.\nFollowing the restoration of civilian rule, Almeida served as a member of the Chamber of Deputies representing Para\u00edba for the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) from 1987 to 1991.\nBiography\nAlmeida publicly condemning the Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat in Jo\u00e3o Pessoa in April 1964.\nAlmeida was born in Campina Grande, Para\u00edba, on 25 September 1935. His father, Ant\u00f4nio Pereira de Almeida\u00a0, served as the 7th Mayor of Campina Grande from 1932 to 1934 and a Para\u00edba state deputy. He graduated with a law degree from the Federal University of Para\u00edba in 1958. He soon co-founded the Peasant Leagues in Para\u00edba, for which he also served as a lawyer. He also became a professor at the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the Federal University of Para\u00edba.\nAlmeida was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Para\u00edba as a member of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), where he served for several months until the 1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat. He was a proponent of agrarian reform, among other issues. Following the 1964 military coup, Almeida and three other PSB colleagues in the Legislative Assembly - Assis Lemos, Langstein de Almeida and Figueiredo Agra - were impeached and removed from office on 7 April 1964, becoming some of the first opponents of the new military regime to be purged from their positions in Para\u00edba state.\nOn 11 April 1964, Almeida and eight other professors at the Federal University of Para\u00edba were further fired for alleged \"subversive\" behavior. Their dismissal was confirmed by the UFPB University Council on 11 May 1964. Almeida was arrested and sent to a prison for political prisoners on  the island of Fernando de Noronha.\nIn 1966, he joined with several politicians and colleagues to establish the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB).\nAlemida participated in the 1984 Diretas J\u00e1 protests in Campina Grande and Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, which called for direct presidential elections.\nHe was elected to the Chamber of Deputies from Para\u00edba in the 1986 Brazilian parliamentary election on 15 November 1986. The national assembly took office on 1 February 1987, and helped draft the new federal Constitution of Brazil in 1988.\nAgassiz Almeida died at his home in Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba, on 21 April 2024, at the age of 88.

    "Genus of true bugs\nThis article is about the genus of scale insects. For other meanings, see Puto.\nPuto is a genus of insects described as giant mealybugs, although it is the only extant genus in different family Putoidae; it was originally described by Victor Antoine Signoret in 1875.\nHosts\nGiant mealybugs occur on a wide range of hosts, each species having its own specific host. Host plants commonly include conifers, grasses and various woody shrubs. All parts of the plant can be infested.\nDescription\nThe adult female is oval and up to five millimetres long and concealed by tufts of powdery white wax. If the wax is removed, two longitudinal black stripes can be seen on the upper surface of the body and the wax glands are large and conspicuous. The legs and antennae are well developed and a dark colour.\nLife cycle\nThere are generally four instars in the female and five in the male. In many species there is a single generation each year and the first instar is the overwintering stage. Puto sandini however takes four years to complete its life cycle.\nSpecies\nThe current scientific consensus appears to be based on the two sugenus proposal by Gavrilov-Zimin & Danzig; the following species, recorded from the Americas, mainland Europe and SE Asia, are included in BioLib.cz (as separate genera):\nPuto subgenus Ceroputo\nAuthority: \u0160ulc, 1897\nPuto (Ceroputo) graminis Danzig, 1972\nPuto (Ceroputo) liquidambaris Zhang & Watson, 2023\nPuto (Ceroputo) mimicus (McKenzie, 1967)\nPuto (Ceroputo) pilosellae \u0160ulc, 1898 (\"hairy mealybug\")\nPuto (Ceroputo) vaccinii Danzig, 1897\nPuto subgenus Puto\nAuthority: Signoret, 1875 - list incomplete:\nPuto antennatus Signoret, 1875 (\"conifer mealybug\")\nPuto acirculus\nPuto albicans\nPuto ambigua\nPuto ambiguus\nPuto antennatus\nPuto antioquensis\nPuto arctostaphyli\nPuto atriplicis\nPuto barberi\nPuto borealis\nPuto brunnitarsis (Signoret, 1875)\nPuto bryanthi\nPuto calcitectus\nPuto californicus\nPuto cupressi\nPuto decorosus\nPuto echinatus\nPuto euphorbiaefolius\nPuto israelensis Ben-Dov, 2001\nPuto janetscheki Balachowsky, 1953\nPuto kosztarabi\nPuto lasiorum\nPuto laticribellum\nPuto mexicanus\nPuto marsicanus Marotta & Tranfaglia, 1993\nPuto mimicus\nPuto nulliporus\nPuto orientalis Danzig, 1978\nPuto pacificus\nPuto palinuri Marotta & Tranfaglia, 1993\nPuto pricei\nPuto profusus\nPuto sandini Washburn, 1965\nPuto simmondsiae\nPuto superbus (Leonardi, 1907)\nPuto yuccae\n",

This coming-of-age thriller, while not devoid of flaws, makes for an engaging and thought-provoking watch.\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 2.5 stars and wrote \"The eight-part series focuses on regular people (and their families) to be found in modest dwellings and crowded police thanas, through a sharp look at the LGBTQi community\".\nRahul Desai of Film Companion wrote \"Murder in Mahim is not unwatchable, but it fumbles the fundamentals of its genre. It mistakes slow-burning for slow. If it were an Indian batsman, it would be criticized for its strike rate \u2013 in Test cricket no less.\"\nAbhishek Srivastava from The Times of India rated 3.5 stars stating \"Beyond its suspenseful plot, 'Murder in Mahim' offers a commentary on the challenges faced by the LGBTQ community.\"\nDeepa Gahlot from Rediff.com rated 3/5 and stated \"Among the many reasons to watch Murder In Mahim is that it may be a chance to wipe out -- if it is achievable by a Web series -- the air of judgment towards those who do not conform to the majority's idea of normal.\"\nShilajit Mitra or The Hindu said in his review that \"This (mostly) faithful adaptation of Jerry Pinto's novel lacks the subtlety and craft of a really great crime show.\"\nNandini Ramnath of Scroll.in stated in her review that \"Murder in Mahim can never escape the suspicion that it would have been more effective as a movie.

It is layered and manages to ask some very tough questions. It also makes you self-introspect.\"\nSoumyabrata Gupta of Times Now rated 3/5 and wrote \"Raj Acharya directs Murder In Mahim, spotlighting the riveting portrayals of Ashutosh Rana and Vijay Raaz. The film delves into the chilling murders at Mahim railway station, exploring the perilous trend of honey-trapping within the LGBTQIA+ community.

    "Galaxy pair in the constellation Draco\nNGC 6365 is a pair of spiral galaxies in the constellation Draco. It consists of two galaxies, PGC 60174 to the south, and PGC 60171 to the north. These two galaxies are also designated respectively by the NASA/IPAC database as NGC 6365A and NGC 6365B. This pair of galaxies was discovered by German astronomer Lewis Swift in 1884.\nNGC 6563A\nNGC 6563A is the northern counterpart of NGC 6563, and is a barred spiral galaxy. Its coordinates are 17h 22m 43.8s and 62\u00b0 09\u2032 57.9\u2033. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 8,413 \u00b1 4\u00a0km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 124.1 \u00b1 8.7 Mpc (\u223c405\u00a0million ly).\nThe luminosity class of NGC 6365A is III-IV and it has a broad HI line. It is an active galaxy (AGN) of type Seyfert 2.\nWith a surface brightness equal to 14.00 mag/am^2, we can qualify NGC 6365A as a low surface brightness galaxy (LSB). LSB galaxies are diffuse (D) galaxies with a surface brightness less than one magnitude lower than that of the ambient night sky.\nTo date, nearly fifteen measurements not based on redshift give a distance of 111.469 \u00b1 31.088 Mpc (\u223c364\u00a0million ly), which is within the values of the Hubble distance.\nSupernova\nThe supernova SN 2003U was discovered in NGC 6365A on January 27, 2003, by Scottish astronomer Tom Boles. This supernova was of type Ia.\nNGC 6563B\nNGC is the southern counterpart of NGC 6563, and is a spiral galaxy. However, the NASA/IPAC database and Professor Seligman indicate that it is Magellanic in type. Its coordinates are 17h 22m 43.5s and 62\u00b0 10\u2032 25.4\u2033. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 7,975 \u00b1 4\u00a0km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 117.6 \u00b1 8.2 Mpc (\u223c384\u00a0million ly). The luminosity class of NGC 6365B is IV-V and it has a broad HI line. It also contains regions of ionized hydrogen.\nGalaxy interaction\nThe pair of galaxies that make up NGC 6563 appear in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the designation Arp 30. Arp describes NGC 6365 as a spiral galaxy with an overdeveloped arm, but this has been recently confirmed by astronomers to be false. In the image used by Arp, PGC 60171 (NGC 6365B) appears to be part of PGC 60174 and to be one galaxy. But, they are actually two separate galaxies. According to redshift-based measurements, NGC 6365A is the most distant galaxy. However, given the uncertainties in the measurements, NGC 6365B could be the most distant galaxy. The image taken by the telescope at the Mount Lemmon observatory does not allow us to decide. There is no publication that is only speculative about their position and also about their interaction.\nSee also\nList of NGC objects (6001\u20137000)\nAtlas of Peculiar Galaxies\nLists of galaxies\nList of supernovae\nExternal links\nNGC 6563 at SIMBAD\n",

Likewise, it informs the Spanish Government about the evolution of events in Italy, negotiates on behalf of Spain, can sign or ratify agreements, observes the development of bilateral relations in all fields and ensures the protection of Spanish interests and its citizens in Italy.\nSince 1947, the first floor of the Palazzo Borghese on the Tiber River in Rome has been the seat of the Embassy of Spain in Italy. The current ambassador is Miguel \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez-Palacios, who was appointed by Pedro S\u00e1nchez's government on October 12, 2022.\nAccreditation\nIn accordance with Article 87 of the Constitution of the Italian Republic, the President of the Republic is responsible for the reception and accreditation of foreign ambassadors. Therefore, the Spanish ambassadors in Italy must be accredited to the president once they arrive in the Cisalpine country. During the monarchy this attribution corresponded to the King of Italy, according to the Statuto Albertino of 1848.\nHowever, as it is a semi-presidential republic, the Italian government is responsible for directing foreign policy and the relationship with the ambassadors accredited to Italy.\nDemarcation\nThe Spanish embassy in Italy is also accredited in:\nRepublic of San Marino: San Marino established diplomatic relations with Spain in 1978, and at ambassadorial level in 1992, although since its origins the Consular affairs of this European republic have depended on the Spanish Embassy in Rome.\nIn the past the embassy in Rome was accredited to:\nRepublic of Malta: Malta was also included in Rome's demarcation from 1969 to 1977 when a permanent mission was established in Valletta. This embassy was suppressed in 1998, and became dependent again on the Spanish Embassy in Rome. This situation continued until 2004 when the embassy in the island country was reestablished.\nRepublic of Albania: Spain and Albania established diplomatic relations on September 12, 1986, although Consular affairs in Tirana depended on the Spanish Embassy in Belgrade until 1993 when they became dependent on that of Rome. Finally, in 2006 the Spanish government created a Spanish Embassy in Albania.\nList of diplomatic representatives (since 1865)\nSee also\nSpain \u2013 Italy relations\nForeign relations of Spain\nList of ambassadors of the United States to Italy\n",

    "American poet and World War I volunteer (1885 \u2013 1919)\nGladys Cromwell (November 28, 1885 \u2013 January 19, 1919) was an American poet and Red Cross volunteer during World War I. Known for her introspective and melancholic poetry, Cromwell published works in prominent literary magazines and released a volume of poems titled \"The Gates of Utterance and Other Poems\" in 1915. Her service in the Red Cross alongside her twin sister, Dorothea, exposed her to the harrowing realities of war, which profoundly affected her mental health. The sisters ended their lives while returning to the United States in 1919. Posthumously, Cromwell's poetry was celebrated, earning her the Poetry Society of America's prize in 1920, and her contributions to literature and war service are considered a poignant reflection of her era.\nBiography\nEarly life and family\nGladys Louise Husted Cromwell was born on November 28, 1885, in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents, Frederick Cromwell, a trustee of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York City, and Esther Whitmore Husted, were prominent members of New York society. Cromwell received her education at Brearley, a private school, and traveled extensively throughout Europe.\nLiterary beginnings\nBut when a lyric theme invites,\nI reach outlying bowers\nWhere dwell the bards of quiet years; \nI join my song to theirs; \nMy glad, unfettered spirit hears\nThe melody it shares.\nGladys Cromwell, in her poem \"The Gates of Utterance\"\nCromwell began writing poetry at a young age. However, her family was initially opposed to her publishing work, viewing it as an intrusion on their privacy. Despite this, she managed to publish several poems in magazines such as Poetry and The New Republic. Her first collection of poetry, The Gates of Utterance and Other Poems, was published in 1915.\nWorld War I and death\nThe entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917 significantly impacted Gladys Cromwell's life and career. In January 1918, she and her twin sister, Dorothea, joined the American Red Cross. The sisters were deployed to France, where they served as canteen workers in Chalons-sur-Marne and later at evacuation hospitals. Their roles exposed them to the constant threats of air raids and the relentless stress of being close to the front lines, which affected their mental and physical health.\nBy the end of the war, the Cromwell sisters were deeply impacted by their experiences. In January 1919, they boarded the French liner La Lorraine\u00a0 in Bordeaux to return to New York. Concerned colleagues, including Dr. C. L. Purnell, noted their fragile state, describing them as \"tired, nervous, and hysterical.\" Despite administering sedatives, the efforts to stabilize their condition proved insufficient.\nOn the evening of January 19, 1919, Gladys and Dorothea Cromwell died by suicide. Edward Pemberton, a sentry on La Lorraine, witnessed the sisters on the deck at around 7:00 P.M. He saw one sister suddenly climb the rail and jump overboard, followed immediately by the other. Although Pemberton quickly reported the incident, the ship had already traveled five miles from the location of their jump by the time the alarm reached the captain, making any rescue attempt futile.\nGroup of ARC workers at a Red Cross canteen Left to right\u00a0: Miss Anna L. Rochester, Miss Gladys Cromwell, Miss Elizabeth Strang, Miss Helen J. Day, Miss C. Wheller, Mrs. Mary Palmer Gardner, Miss Winifred Bryce, Miss Anna A. Ryan, Miss Julia Wells and Miss Dorothy Cromwell, ARC Hospitals Nos. 6 & 7, Souilly, Meuse, France, October 13, 1918\nThe Cromwell sisters left behind three notes addressed to Major James C. Sherman, their brother Seymour L. Cromwell, and their sister-in-law. The contents of these letters were not disclosed to the public. Their wills, dated January 2, 1919, contained a clause indicating a possible premeditation of their actions: \u201cIf my sister and myself die in or as the result of any common disaster or catastrophe, whether simultaneously or otherwise\u201d.\nA memorial service for the sisters was held on February 5, 1919, at St. Bartholomew's Church in New York City. Their bodies were recovered three months later and were buried in France with full military honors.\nPosthumous recognition\nIn recognition of their service, the French government posthumously awarded them the Croix de Guerre and the M\u00e9daille de Reconnaissance fran\u00e7aise. A second volume of her poetry, Poems (1919), was published posthumously, comprising works from her earlier book as well as previously unpublished poems. Poems shared the 1920 prize from the Poetry Society of America with John G. Neihardt's The Song of Three Friends.

    "American beauty pageant winner (born 1995)\nSavannah Mar\u02bbi Gankiewicz (born November 28, 1995) is an American model and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss USA 2023. Previously crowned Miss Hawaii USA 2023, Gankiewicz placed as the first runner-up at Miss USA, and took over the title after its original winner Noelia Voigt resigned in May 2024. Gankiewicz is the fifth woman from Hawaii to be crowned Miss USA.\nEarly life and education\nGankiewicz was born on November 28, 1995, on Oahu to parents Yvienne Tagorda Peterson and Mark Gankiewicz; her mother is from Maui and of Filipina descent, while her father is of Polish and Vietnamese descent. Her mother had a background in pageantry, having been crowned Mrs. Maui and serving as a director for the Miss Maui Filipina pageant. Gankiewicz spent the first six years of her life with her family on Maui, and later lived between Maui and Stephenson, Virginia, where her father relocated.\nGankiewicz was educated in Virginia, attending Sherando High School in Frederick County, Virginia and George Mason University in Fairfax County, Virginia. She later returned to Hawaii at age 21, settling in Kihei, Hawaii on Maui, where she began working as a professional model and a marketing coordinator at The Agency Maui.\nPageantry\nGankiewicz began competing in pageantry due to a desire to improve her public speaking skills and to develop a platform to promote self-love to other women, and was encouraged by her mother. Gankiewicz later moved to the Philippines to model and competed in the Filipino beauty pageant Mutya ng Pilipinas 2017, where she was a finalist and received the title of Mutya ng Pilipinas Overseas Filipino Communities for representing the Filipino-Hawaiian community. Following the pageant, she continued to live in the Philippines to work as a model for over a year.\nAfter a break from pageantry, Gankiewicz registered as a contestant for the Miss Hawaii USA 2023 pageant in January 2023, competing as Miss Wailea. She went on to win the title on her first attempt, and also was crowned Miss Photogenic. Aged 27 at the time of her win, Gankiewicz opted to compete in her final year of age eligibility as she had wanted to wait until she felt ready for the responsibilities of being a state titleholder. With her win, Gankiewicz became the first woman from Maui to be crowned Miss Hawaii USA in over 20 years.\nMiss USA 2023\nMain article: Miss USA 2023\nAs Miss Hawaii USA, Gankiewicz became a contestant for Miss USA 2023, representing Hawaii. The competition was held on September 29, 2023, in Reno, Nevada and aired on The CW. During the state costume portion of the pageant, Gankiewicz wore a costume paying tribute to the victims of the 2023 wildfire in Lahaina, Hawaii on her home island of Maui, for which she won the Best State Costume award. Gankiewicz ultimately placed as the first runner-up in the competition, behind winner Noelia Voigt of Utah, and additionally won the Best in Interview award. Gankiewicz later crowned Breea Yamat as her successor at the Miss Hawaii USA 2024 pageant in April 2024.\nIn May 2024, Voigt announced that she was resigning her title as Miss USA, citing her struggles with mental health. Later that day, it was reported in the Hawaiian media that Gankiewicz had been asked to take over the Miss USA title. Due to pageant protocol, the first runner-up is asked to step in to fulfill the duties of Miss USA should the winner be unable to, and on May 9, it was announced that Gankiewicz would assume the title of Miss USA 2023. Gankiewicz was later officially crowned as Miss USA 2023 by Josh Green, the governor of Hawaii, in a ceremony held on May 15 in the neighborhood of Waikiki in Honolulu. Following this, she became the fifth woman from Hawaii to be crowned Miss USA.\nNotes\n^ Gankiewicz was originally first runner-up, but became Miss USA after the original titleholder, Noelia Voigt, resigned the title.\n",
    "\nPeter Heywood is a British artist.\nEarly life and career\nPeter Heywood was born in 1944 in Yorkshire. He and his identical twin, Donald attended Ossett Grammar School, Ossett, in the 1950s, along with their older brother, Alan.\nFollowing his BSc degree, Peter Heywood taught maths and physics for thirty years. He was a popular and successful teacher, voted Britain's Best teacher in 1995 in a national newspaper search. His professional interest in science was combined with a passion for painting, to which he devoted much of his free time  sometimes alongside his brother, Donald who trained as an artist, graduating from the Leicester College of art. From the late 1960s to early 1970s Peter Heywood's work had already been exhibited. Some of his painting were displayed in the Spring Exhibition in Paris, and at a number of galleries in the UK. Encouraged by a successful art one-man exhibition at The Aberbach Fine Gallery in Savile Row, London, he decided to leave teaching altogether and become a full-time artist. For the next few years he traveled widely and lived in South Africa where he created a series of major landscapes. Successful exhibitions followed in Johannesburg at The Cheri de Villiers Gallery and in Cape Town at The Everard Read Gallery and The Cape Gallery\nIn 2000 he moved to Venice and lived there for the following two years. Its striking art and architecture became an inspiration for Heywood's own creations in oil and acrylics. They were well received and exhibited at The Holly Snapp Gallery in Venice. The Century Gallery in Henley-on-Thames outside London was another location for exhibiting his work, along with the Paterson Gallery in Albermarle Street, London W1.\nLater career\nIn 2002, Peter and his twin brother Donald, bought an apartment in Malta. where they could overlook the Port of Valetta a small inlet on the east coast, often referred to as the Grand Harbour. It was an ideal location for two artists, and Peter received plenty of inspiration for painting. His Maltese scenes were exhibited locally at a one-man exhibition at the Caraffa Stores, Vittoriosa, in a building constructed in 1689. Further exhibitions were held at the Casino Maltese, and in Portomaso, adjacent to St Julien's Bay. Through the sale of his paintings he also raised funds for several Maltese charities. Many private collections of Heywood's paintings now exist across  the world.\nFrom 2011 he began spending more time in America where he was to spend most of the next decade. He completed a series of striking paintings of  New York's most famous historic landmarks, seen as dramatic reflections through neighbouring buildings. They were described as having 'many levels for the eye and the mind.' His first American exhibition took place two years after he moved there, at the Alan BarnesFine Art Gallery in Santa Fe, and he exhibited at the Q Street galley in Washington in Nov 2013. He has since had several more shows in the US, including at The Leila Heller Gallery in New York in August 2014, the Thorn Tree Art Project in New York City, November 2017 and at the 237 on Hudson street Gallery in 2019. At the Hudson exhibition, AT&T purchased a large canvas for their new New York headquarters, and following the success which followed the exhibition, Peter began a new series exploring the shape and movement of dance and dancers.  Work went into a proposed show in 2020, where sale of the exhibits was to benefit the  New York City Ballet. But because of Covid, the 2020 show did not take place.\nIn March 2024 Peter traveled to Noto, a very old village in Sicily, to set up and open the largest exhibition painting of his life: \"From New York to Noto.\" It was by invitation of Noto's tour Mayor Dr. Corrado Figura and the opening night party was co-hosted with novelist Maria Giovanni Mirado. Featuring 57 paintings, it includes his acclaimed Reflections series, and his ballet and figure explorations. The exhibition displays, to effect, both the New York landmark buildings \"in reflection\" and a series of New York dancers in action. It runs until November 2024.\nStyle and influences\nIt is difficult to describe Peter Heywood's art in definitive terms for his interest and styles are wide-ranging. He produced 'representational' paintings of creation and landscape in his early career, not least Yorkshire scenes including his gentle study of sheep and stone walls in the Pennines. His innovative on reflected buildings in New York are powerful visual explorations of light passing through high sheet of glass achieved by subtle layering and toning of colour which calls us to reconsider and reflect on what we see. He has always enjoyed working in abstract forms. Some have claimed he has been influenced by such American abstract expressionists as Rothko, DeKooning, Klein, Pollock and the Australian artist Fred Williamson. However, he is probably best known for his considerable output of figurative work portraying a sensitive and detailed study of human form",

    "\nArchibald John Shaw (16 December 1872 \u2013 26 August 1916) was an Australian Catholic priest and radio pioneer.\nEarly life\nShaw was born on 16 December 1872 in Adelong, New South Wales. He was the fourth child born to Catherine (n\u00e9e Scanlon) and Charles William Shaw. His father was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and arrived in Australia in 1849. He initially worked as a miner and later ran a hotel in Adelong.\nShaw was orphaned as a child following the deaths of his father in 1876 and his mother in 1880. He and his siblings were raised by relatives and he attended the public school in Tumut. A childhood operation left him with a permanent limp. After leaving school he worked for periods at a timber mill and at the Goulburn Post Office.\nMissionary activities and priesthood\nAfter unsuccessfully applying to join the Passionists, Shaw was sent to British New Guinea in 1894 as a lay missionary with the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart. He was stationed at the mission on Yule Island and taught English to Belgian, Dutch and French students at the seminary while undertaking his novitiate. He acted as personal secretary and translator for the mission's head Louis-Andr\u00e9 Navarre. He was formally admitted to the order in 1896, but returned to Sydney the following year to train for the priesthood under the tutorship of Francis Xavier Gsell.\nShaw was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1900 and was appointed assistant procurator under Gsell in the same year. One of his first tasks was to act as chaplain to Boer War soldiers camped at Randwick Racecourse awaiting departure to South Africa. He lived at the Sacred Heart Monastery in Sydney until 1908, when he moved to a house in Randwick. As assistant procurator he was responsible for \"finding money not only to keep the three Pacific missions in food, clothing and medical supplies, but also to build convents, churches, presbyteries, dispensaries and schools\".\nRadio work\nShaw became interested in radio as a way to raise funds for missionary activities. He may have been influenced by Father Joseph Slattery's activities at Bathurst. After studying and experimenting with wireless telegraphy for a number of years, in 1910 he obtained a wireless experimentation licence. He subsequently constructed a 240 feet (73\u00a0m) radio tower in his backyard which was capable of transmitting messages over 2,000 miles (3,200\u00a0km).\nShaw's role as assistant procurator had allowed him to develop ties in Sydney's business community. He developed a friendship with Edward Hope Kirkby, who ran a small business manufacturing electrical appliances. In 1911 he went into partnership with Kirby, who floated the Maritime Wireless Company with Shaw as president. Their partnership was based upon Shaw provided design expertise and Kirkby providing production. Their factory at Randwick, known as the Randwick Wireless Works or Shaw Wireless Works, eventually had up to 170 employees.\nThe creation of Maritime Wireless coincided with the federal government's plans for a system of land-based wireless stations along the Australian coastline for shipping and defence purposes. In 1911, the Fisher government awarded Maritime Wireless contracts to establish 17 coastal wireless stations, favouring the local manufacturer over bids from the Marconi Company (represented by Ernest Fisk) and Telefunken. In 1912, Shaw was granted a patent for his airblast \"spark gap\" system. He was threatened with lawsuits by Marconi and Telefunken alleging patent infringement, and similar allegations from John Graeme Balsillie.\nBy 1914, Shaw's personal finances had become interwoven with those of the Sacred Heart mission and the Wireless Works. He soon faced a liquidity crisis, in part caused by his acceptance of payments in shares from creditors rather than cash. In response to the mission's financial difficulties, Pope Benedict XV despatched a special visitator, Robert Linckens, to investigate the situation. Linckens concluded that Shaw had technically embezzled money totalling \u00a38,700 (equivalent to $600,000 in 2022) from the mission by using cheques from the Vatican to buy machinery for the Wireless Works, ultimately intending that the mission be repaid via dividends from Maritime Wireless.\nWith his authority from the Vatican, Linckens ordered Shaw to sell the mission's wireless assets \u2013 including the Wireless Works and Shaw's patents \u2013 in order to repay the funds he had embezzled. Shaw offered the assets to the Postmaster-General's Department for \u00a360,000 (equivalent to $3,400,000 in 2022), but was unable to negotiate a deal. With assistance from Tasmanian senator James Long, he subsequently brokered a deal with navy minister Jens Jensen, whose department had assumed responsibility for wireless infrastructure following the outbreak of World War I. The Department of the Navy ultimately acquired the assets in July 1916 for \u00a355,000 (equivalent to $3,100,000 in 2022).\nDeath and aftermath\nWhile visiting Melbourne, Shaw died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 26 A",
    "\nSpecies of marine ray-finned fish\nDibranchus tremendus is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Ogcocephalidae, the deep-sea batfishes. It is found in deep water in the Atlantic Ocean. This species was identified as a different species from Dibranchus atlanticus in 1999. It is the largest species in its genus.\nTaxonomy\nDibranchus tremendus was first formally described in 1999 by the American ichthyologist Margaret G. Bradbury with its type locality given as the Caribbean Sea at 9\u00b032'N, 76\u00b038'W, Oregon II, station 11239, depth 1,463\u00a0m (4,800\u00a0ft). In her paper Bradbury states that Louis Roule illustrated this species, as Dibranchus atlanticus from Cape Verde in 1916. The genus Dibranchus is classified within the \"Indo-Pacific clade\" of the family Ogcocephalidae. The family Ogcocephalidae is classified in the monotypic suborder Ogcocephaloidei within the order Lophiiformes, the anglerfishes in the 5th edition of Fishes of the World.\nEtymology\nDibranchus tremendus is classified in the genus Dibranchus, a name which prefixes di, meaning \"two\", on to branchus, meaning \"gills\", a reference to the only the second and third gill arches having gills, the fourth having no gill filaments. The specific epithet tremenduus, means \"something to be trembled at\", an allusion to the large size and spiny skin of this fish.\nDescription\nDibranchus tremendus has its dorsal spine supported by between 4 and 7 soft rays and its anal fin by 4 soft rays. The tubercles in the skin do not have the radiating rows of spinules that those of D. atlanticus have. The spines of the tubercles are very long and robust, especially on the sides of the caudal peduncle. The lower surface of the disc shaped body is covered in tubercles. The main tubercles of the lower surface of the caudal peduncle are very large and take up the entire lowe surface except for a few small tubercles in the middle part between the anus and the base of the anal fin. The overall colour is brown. This species is the largest species in the genus Dibranchus with a maximum publsihed total length of 19.2\u00a0cm (7.6\u00a0in).\nDistribution and habitat\nDibranchus tremendus is found in the Atlantic Ocean. In the western Atlantic it is found in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, it has also been recorded from the Hydrographer Canyon, south of Hudson Canyon, from close to Block Canyon and the Bear Seamount. In the eastern Atlantic it has been recorded in Cape Verde and between the Gulf of Guinea and Namibia. This benthic fish is found at depths between 750 and 3,000\u00a0m (2,460 and 9,840\u00a0ft), typically in excess of 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft).\nBiology\nDibranchus tremendus, like its congeners, has pelagic eggs and larvae. Deep sea batfishes are sit and wait predators, luring prey with the illicium, the \"fishing rod\", and esca, the \"lure\" or \"bait\", to within striking distance of the large mouth. The fishes in this family are known to feed on small snails, clams, scallops, worms, small crustaceans and occasionally small fishes. Ogcocephalidae fishes do have a luminous esca , as in some other groups of anglerfishes, but also secretes a fluid thought to act as a chemical lure which attracts prey.\n",

    "International non-profit consortium\nWalk Again Project is an international, non-profit consortium led by Miguel Nicolelis, created in 2009 in a partnership between Duke University and the IINN/ELS, where researchers come together to find neuro-rehabilitation treatments for spinal cord injuries, which pioneered the development and use of the brain\u2013machine interface, including its non-invasive version, with an EEG.\nHistory\nNicolelis, a Brazilian neuroscientist working at Duke University, who had been proposing the use of BMI in his laboratory since 2006, but had been exploring this area since 1999. He had demonstrated the viability of BMI alongside scientist John Chapin, in 2008, together with Gordon Cheng, in an experiment where they tested the first continental BMI, where an ape in North Carolina controlled a robot in Kyoto.  This was a precursor of the Walk Again Project. Previously, in 2000, Nicolelis had already demonstrated, in a publication in Nature, the possibility of a computer decoding an ape's brain signals in order to move a robotic arm. The project, which began in 2009, is a partnership between institutions in the US, Switzerland, Germany, and Brazil.\nIn one of its first steps, published in 2011, the project team made a monkey control a mechanical arm and receive tactile information from this tool, including in the virtual world, with the team's research being welcomed \"as an important advance by the scientific community\", according to Veja magazine. That year, in his book \u201cBeyond boundaries\u201d, Nicolelis described his plan to make a patient take the opening kick of the FIFA World Cup, in a project budgeted at R$33 million at the time (U$S 15,305,489.56 in 2013), and funded by Finep.\nThe BRA-Santos Dumont exoskeleton\nIn 2012, in the process of creating the BRA-Santos Dumont exoskeleton for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the project team recorded 1847 neurons simultaneously, something, until then, unprecedented. The next research project saw mice being able to sense tactile information from infrared light, as a possible new form of BMI communication. The following year, the project received authorization to test the exoskeleton in Brazil, with volunteers from the Association for Assistance to Disabled Children\u00a0 testing the equipment since the beginning of November 2013.\nWhen he returned to Brazil for the project, Nicolelis found that the patients did not want to undergo surgery as a way of regaining movement. This led his team to develop non-invasive techniques that were able to help patients chronically, something, according to the scientist, \u201cthat had never been done in decades of research and treatment of spinal cord injuries.\u201d\nIn 2013, the project team revealed that they had been able to make two rhesus monkeys control two virtual arms, using only their thoughts. The research was published in Science Translational Medicine. In March 2014 the two exoskeletons were already in Brazil.\nThe initial contact with FIFA was made in 2012, but the plan to give the inaugural kick, which would even involve the patient getting up from his wheelchair and crossing 25 meters of the pitch, was abandoned by the entity. Nicolelis has been aware of the time limitation since March. 2014. In the end the demonstration, carried out by the patient Juliano Alves Pinto during the 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony, was reduced to just three seconds on the world network, which was the subject of controversy.\nPatient wearing the non-invasive BMI, 2014.\nThe Walk Again team, made up of 150\u2013156 people for the World Cup, had no control over image production, but the rest of the project was carried out successfully. The \u201cMIT Technology Review\u201d listed the exoskeleton as one of the \u201cmain failures\u201d in technology in 2014, something Nicolelis refuted, while \u201cThe Verge\u201d identified him as \u201cone of the 50 world personalities of 2014\u201d.\nOn March 3, 2016, the team demonstrated the use of BMI on apes so that they could move wheelchairs using only their thoughts. On August 11 of the same year, a new study was published in Scientific Reports. Eight paraplegic patients, who had lost all movement in their lower limbs due to spinal cord injuries, experienced a partial neurological recovery after 12 months of training with virtual reality, a robot, and an exoskeleton.\nThe experiment described above involved 6 men and 2 women: in four cases, the patients became \u201cpartially paralyzed\u201d; a 32-year-old woman who had been paralyzed for more than a decade became able to walk with support after 13 months. One of the two women was able to become pregnant after restoring sensation inside and outside the body, as well as some men regaining sexual ability. The patients reported that the treatment had improved their quality of life.\nThe researchers were surprised by the improvements, since the damage to the spinal cord would have prevented the brain from communicating with the rest of the body. Nicolelis then theorized, still without evidence via imaging tests, tha",
    "English headmaster and poet\nAlexander Gil the younger, also spelled Gill, (1597\u20131642) was an English headmaster and poet. He was the high-master of St. Paul's School.\nBiography\nGil was the son of Alexander Gill the elder. He was born, probably at Norwich, in 1597. He obtained a scholarship at St. Paul's School, London, of which his father became highmaster in 1608. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, 26 June 1612; became an exhibitioner of Wadham College in 1612, and bible-clerk there 20 April 1613; proceeded B.A. 1616, and M.A. 1619. He afterwards returned to Trinity, where he took the degrees of B.D. (27 June 1627) and D.D. (9 March 1636\u20137) (Oxf. Univ. Reg., Oxford Hist. Soc. II. ii. 326, iii. 344). Gill was of very unruly disposition, and was, according to the pamphleteers of the day, on bad terms with the university authorities; but he displayed much skill as a writer of Latin and Greek verse. As early as 1612 he published a Latin threnody on the death of Prince Henry. At Michaelmas 1621 he was appointed under-usher of St. Paul's School. John Milton was among his pupils; a close intimacy sprang up between them, and many of Milton's Latin letters to Gill are preserved. On 20 May 1628 the poet writes in extravagant terms of Gill's Latin verses. On 2 July following he sent Gill some of his own Latin verses for him to criticise and correct. On 4 December 1634 Milton again thanks Gill for a gift of Latin verses. Meanwhile, Gill had fallen into serious trouble, and lost his post at St. Paul's School. He was visiting his friends at Trinity College, Oxford, about Michaelmas 1628, when he drank a health to John Felton, Buckingham's assassin, and made some disrespectful remarks about the king. William Chillingworth, with whom, according to Aubrey, Gill was in the habit of corresponding, was of this party, and deemed it fitting to inform William Laud of what had passed. Gill was committed to the Gatehouse at Westminster (4 September) by Laud's orders, and was examined in the Star-chamber by Laud and Attorney-general Heath on 6 September. Laud's report of the proceedings sent to the king appears in his correspondence (Anglo-Cath. Libr. vii. 16\u201318). A search at Oxford in the rooms of William Pickering of Trinity College, an intimate friend of Gill, disclosed letters and verses by him (some dated in 1626), abusing Buckingham and Charles I. Gill admitted his guilt, and was sentenced (1 November) to degradation from the ministry, to a fine of 2,000l., and to the loss of both ears (one to be removed at Oxford, and the other in London). Gill's father immediately petitioned for a remission of the sentence, and Edward, earl of Dorset, supported the appeal (Aubrey). Laud, a friend of the elder Gill, consented to mitigate the fine, and to forego the corporal punishment. On 30 November 1630 a free pardon was signed by Charles I. Gill, now dismissed from his ushership, received small gratuities from the governors of St. Paul's School in 1631, 1633, and 1634. He tried to retrieve his reputation by publishing in 1632 a little volume of collected Latin verse, entitled \u2018Parerga sive Poetici Conatus,\u2019 containing a fulsome dedication to the king and a profoundly respectful poem to Laud, dated 1 January 1631\u20132, besides much verse to other royal or noble personages, and odes on the successes of Gustavus Adolphus in Germany.\nAccording to Anthony Wood, Gill obtained temporary employment at the school of Thomas Farnaby in Cripplegate. On 18 November 1635, the day following his father's death, he was elected his father's successor in the high-mastership of St. Paul's School. In 1639 complaints were made of his excessive severity towards a boy named Bennett, and at the end of the year he was dismissed. In the school accounts there is an entry of 13l. 7s. 11d. as \u2018charges for displacing Dr. Gill,\u2019 which implies some resistance on his part. On 28 January 1639 Gill appealed to the king to reverse the decision on the ground that it was based on \u2018the unjust complaint of a lying, thieving boy\u2019 (Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1639\u201340, p.\u00a0389). The king referred the petition to Archbishop Laud and \u2018some other lords.\u2019 The Mercers' Company, the governing body of the school, insisted on their right to deal with Gill as they pleased. Laud argued that Gill could not be removed, according to canon law, without his ordinary's knowledge (Laud, Works, iv. 80\u20131). But the company gained the day, and Laud's remarks about the canon law formed the subject of the tenth charge brought against him at his trial. Two coarse doggerel poems, headed respectively \u2018On Doctor Gill, master of St. Paul's School,\u2019 and \u2018Gill upon Gill \u2026 uncas'd, unstript, and unbound,\u2019 dwelt on Gill's whipping propensities and savage temper. They were first issued with the \u2018Loves of Hero and Leander,\u2019 London, 1651, and reappear in \u2018The Rump,\u2019 1660. Aubrey writes that Dr. Gill had \u2018his moods and humours as particularly his whipping fits.\u2019 During his last year at the school Gill was refused ",

Renaming occurred after the deportation in 1944 of Crimean Tatars and other non-Slavic peoples living in Crimea. The old names were mostly of Crimean Tatar origin, while the new ones were Russian. As a result of the renaming, over 1300 settlements in Crimea received new names (over 90% of the peninsula's settlements). A large part of the villages disappeared in the following decades. After 1990, three settlements returned to their historical names (Koktebel, Partenit, and Sarybash). The renaming is one of manifestations of de-tatarization in Crimea.\nIn 1944, Raions (districts) and Raion centers of Crimea were renamed; in 1945, village councils and their centers; and in 1948 and 1949, the majority of settlements. This list includes only settlements (i.e., it does not list the renamed districts and village councils). Settlements are divided by districts of the Crimean ASSR with their names before the renaming in the 1940s.\nAk-Mechet Raion\nAqme\u00e7it (Ak-Mechet) \u2192 Chernomorskoye\nAblaq Ac\u0131 \u2192 Kalinovka\nAbul\u011faz\u0131 \u2192 Svobodnoye\nAbuzlar \u2192 Vysokoye\nAldermeskaya Skala \u2192 Storozhevaya\nAq Ba\u015f \u2192 Vyacheslavovka\nAqqoca \u2192 Dozornoye\nA\u015fa\u011f\u0131 Qul\u00e7uq \u2192 Traktornoye\nAte\u015f \u2192 Kostrovka\nBay Q\u0131yat \u2192 Vladimirovka\nBay\u0131m \u2192 Tikhoye\nBel Avuz \u2192 Peresyp\nBel Avuz Q\u0131p\u00e7aq \u2192 Gromovoye\nBurun Eli \u2192 Rybnoye\nB\u00fcy\u00fck K\u00f6stel \u2192 Bolshoy Yar\nB\u00fcy\u00fck Qala\u00e7 \u2192 Kalachi\nBuzav \u2192 Dedovo\nCa\u011fa Qul\u00e7uq \u2192 Lazurnoye\nCamal \u2192 Nizovka\nCan Baba \u2192 Maryino\nCaylav \u2192 Pastbishchnoye\n\u00c7egelek \u2192 Kuznetskoye\n\u00c7eger Ac\u0131 \u2192 Znamenskoye\n\u00c7o\u00f1\u011fur\u00e7\u0131 \u2192 Zadornoye\n\u00c7oqraq \u2192 Istochniki\nDavul Car \u2192 Groznoye\nDe\u00f1iz Bay\u00e7\u0131 \u2192 Denisovka\nDo\u00f1uzlav 1 \u2192 Krasnoyarskoye\nDo\u00f1uzlav 2 \u2192 Kamyshino\nD\u00f6rt Saqal \u2192 Lenskoye\nKel \u015eeyh \u2192 Smushkovo\nKele\u00e7i \u2192 Karelskoye\nKerlev\u00fct \u2192 Vodopiynoye\nK\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck K\u00f6stel \u2192 Maly Yar\nLa\u015f Q\u0131p\u00e7aq \u2192 Rybatskoye\nMusa Ali \u2192 Zaytsevo\nNemse \u00c7a\u011faltay \u2192 Severnoye\nNemse Tana Bay \u2192 Naydenovo\nO\u00e7eretay \u2192 Priboynoye\nOtar \u2192 Yasnoye\nOtuz \u2192 Staroselye\nOy Eli \u2192 Milovoye\nOyrat \u2192 Morskoye\nQara Ac\u0131 \u2192 Olenevka\nQaraba Quda\u015f \u2192 Yastrebovoye\nQarlav \u2192 Snezhnoye\nQarm\u0131\u015f \u2192 Glubokoye\nQ\u0131r \u00c7eger Ac\u0131 \u2192 Karakulovka\nQ\u0131r Qula\u00e7 \u2192 Uspeshnoye\nQ\u0131r Qul\u00e7uq \u2192 Chistopolye\nQ\u0131\u015flav \u2192 Zimovka\nQ\u0131z\u0131l \u00c7o\u00f1rav \u2192 Krasnaya Polyana\nQo\u00f1rat \u2192 Bagrationovo\nQul Caq\u0131n \u2192 Okhotniki\nQul Sad\u0131q \u2192 Kulikovo\nQula \u015eeyh \u2192 Skalistoye\nQunan \u2192 Krasnoselskoye\nQurama K\u00f6stel \u2192 Malyshevka\nQurman Ac\u0131 \u2192 Romashkino\nSaban\u00e7\u0131 \u2192 Kirillovka\nSa\u00e7al \u2192 Sychevo\nSad\u0131r Ba\u011fay \u2192 Khmelevoye\n\u015eamaq \u2192 Baranovka\nSaqav \u2192 Morozovoye\nTabuld\u0131 As \u2192 Medvedevoye\nTarpan\u00e7\u0131 \u2192 Okunovka\nTatar \u00c7a\u011faltay \u2192 Dalneye\nTatar \u00c7o\u00f1\u011fur\u00e7\u0131 \u2192 Yaroslavka\nTatar Qarlav \u2192 Chaykino\nTeme\u015f As \u2192 Solenoye\nTeme\u015f Qaraba \u2192 Makarovka\nTerekli Ass \u2192 Ozerovka\nToq Col \u2192 Kolodeznoye\nToqa \u2192 Artemovka\nTuvaqa \u2192 Rovno\n\u00dc\u00e7 Quyu Q\u0131p\u00e7aq \u2192 Mayorovo\nUlan Eli \u2192 Glebovka\nYa\u00f1\u0131 \u00c7egelek \u2192 Novokuznetskoye\nYar\u0131l\u011fa\u00e7 \u2192 Mezhvodnoye\nYa\u015fpek \u2192 Vnukovo\nsettlement of fishery industry Ak-Saray \u2192 Peschanka\nAk-Sheykh Raion\nAq\u015feyh (Ak-Sheykh) \u2192 Rozdolnoye\nAqsaqal Merkit \u2192 Bakhchevka\nAtay Temir \u2192 Maksimovka\nAy\u011ful \u2192 Mirazhnoye\nAy\u0131p \u2192 Stepovoye\nBaqqal \u2192 Slavnoye\nBay O\u011flu Q\u0131p\u00e7aq \u2192 Ogni\nBay Qond\u0131 \u2192 Bykovo\nBek Qotan \u2192 Prisivashevo\nBek Qotan Qo\u00f1rat \u2192 Mikulinovo\nBe\u015f Pil\u00e2v \u2192 Varyagino\nBiy \u00d6rl\u00fck \u2192 Orlovka\nBozuq Quyu \u2192 Senokosnoye\nB\u00fcyten \u2192 Kotovskoye\nB\u00fcy\u00fck As \u2192 Lastochkino\nCaylav \u2192 Gorlitsa\n\u00c7erkez \u2192 Vetryanka\nEski Q\u0131z\u0131l Bay \u2192 Kumovo\nFreileben (Frayleben) \u2192 Tyulpany\n\u0130lgeri Qaspir, former Esen-Eli-Qas-Bor\u00fc \u2192 Krasnoye Utro\nKereyit \u2192 Kommunarnoye\nK\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Abay \u2192 Romanovka\nK\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck As \u2192 Kremnevo\nLenindorf \u2192 Divnoye\nManay \u2192 Kovylnoye\nNemse K\u00f6p Qar\u0131 \u2192 Ruchyi\nNemse O\u011fuz O\u011flu \u2192 Babushkino\nNemse Sar\u0131 Bolat \u2192 Novoye\nO\u011fuz O\u011flu \u2192 Chernishovo\nOtar \u2192 Gusevka\nQara Ata Q\u0131yat \u2192 Lapino\nQara Merkit \u2192 Kashtanovka\nQara Nayman \u2192 Krilovka\nQaraba K\u00f6k\u00fc\u015f \u2192 Kukushkino\nQara\u00e7a \u00d6rl\u00fck \u2192 Kozlovka\nQar\u00e7\u0131\u011fa \u2192 Rileyevka\nQarm\u0131\u015f \u2192 Dobrinka\nQazaq Baqqal \u2192 Gosudarevo\nQ\u0131r\u011f\u0131z Qazaq \u2192 Kozachye\nQuda\u015f \u2192 Zaytsevo\nQul Canay \u2192 Geroyskoye\nQul Seyit \u2192 Tatyanovka\nRus Aman\u015fa \u2192 Pogranichnoye\nRus Camanaq \u2192 Zolotoy Kolos\nRus K\u00f6p Qar\u0131 \u2192 Komyshnoye\nSad\u0131r \u2192 Slovyanskoye\nSar\u0131 Bolat \u2192 Portovo\nSar\u0131 Q\u0131p\u00e7aq \u2192 Puchki\nSar\u0131 Q\u0131p\u00e7aq and Y",

    "The Anglo-Saxon Diocese of Whithorn was a Northumbrian bishopric or diocese of the Anglo-Saxon Church.  It was centred on Whithorn, now in Galloway in Scotland, during the 8th century AD. The first known Bishop of Whithorn was Pehthelm.\nOrigins\nAccording to Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical tradition, a Pictish church called Candida Casa was founded by Ninian in the late 4th century to early/mid-5th century. Christianity flourished in Galloway in the 6th century and there was possibly a 6th-century Magnum Monasterium, or Monastery of Rosnat in Whithorn during this time.\nWhile there was some relationship between Northumbrian Christianity and that in Galloway in the 7th century, following the repudiation of Celtic Christianity by the Northumbrian Church at the Synod of Whitby in 664, the Archbishop of Canterbury created several bishoprics out of Northumbrian territory with the intent that they be subordinate to Canterbury rather than to York. York resisted this development, notably by establishing a subordinate bishopric in Whithorn, which at that time was under Northumbrian rule. Specifically, Whithorn appears to have briefly been a diocese from 681 to 681 and then from c. 730. The subordination of Whithorn to York was reinforced when York was elevated to an archbishopric by Pope Gregory III in 735.\nWhithorn in the Northumbrian church\nWhithorn within the Kingdom of Northumbria around 700 AD.\nIt the seventh century, the Bishopric of Hexham had been divided from the Bishopric of Lindisfarne. and the short-lived missionary Bishopric of Abercorn had been established. The seventh century creation of Whithorn briefly took the number of bishoprics in the north of Northumbria to four before returning to the eighth century pattern of Lindisfarne, Hexham and Whithorn.\nList of known Anglo-Saxon bishops of Whithorn\nHeathored is described as the successor to Beadwulf by some accounts. His inclusion on the list as a Bishop of Whithorn is not credible.\nDemise\nIn his Deeds of the Bishops of England (1125), William of Malmesbury states that the diocese failed due to incursions by the Picts and Scots.\nSurviving artefacts\nJohn Godfrey holds that the Anglo-Saxon stone crosses at Aberlady and Abercorn were products of the Diocese of Whithorn.\n",
    "\nThe 2012 Ivorian coup attempt was a failed coup d'\u00e9tat by exiled military officers loyal to former president Laurent Gbagbo to overthrow President Alassane Ouattara's administration in the Ivory Coast. State security seized documents that outlined plans for the eventual overthrow and replacement of the democratically elected leader with a transitional military council.\nIn a public interview to national television, Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko accused pro-Gbagbo officers and former members of his administration of complicity in the plot to install a transitional military council, disclosing \"We had very specific information that a group of officers in exile in Accra were preparing a military operation in Ivory Coast aimed at destabilizing the country.\" He then proceeded to play a recorded video where a group of uniformed men, led by a spokesman, proclaimed the dissolution of the Ivory Coast's institutions and the establishment of a council for national sovereignty. The spokesman, later identified as Colonel Kate Gnotua, announces in the video, \"All state institutions are hereby dissolved. All political activities are suspended. A curfew has been put in place until further notice.\" The recorded video was intended to be broadcast to national television after the takeover.\nAmong the alleged leaders of the foiled coup plot were Moise Lida Kouassi, former defense minister and key ally of Laurent Gbagbo, and Colonel Kate Gnotua, former senior officer in Gbagbo's presidential guard. Kouassi later had a falling out with Kate Gnotua.\nThe coup plot involved a combination of Liberian mercenaries and Ivorian militias, with ties to Gbagbo's loyalists. The coup attempt was linked to recent violence, including the killing of seven UN peacekeepers, and involved elements from Gbagbo's presidential guard.\nIn the end several of the coup plotters were arrested, including Kate Gnatoa and Kouassi, who acknowledged awareness to the plot, admitting \"The documents that were seized during my arrest at my house in Lome did concern a transition and a crisis communication in Ivory Coast.\" He expresses regret for not informing the authorities sooner and indicated willingness to seek forgiveness from the president for his inaction.\n",
    "Chinese mythological creature\nA shadow puppet depicting Xiaotian Quan and his lord Erlang Shen.\nXiaotian Quan (Chinese: \u54ee\u5929\u72ac; lit. 'Sky Barking Hound'), also known as Howling Celestial Dog, is a Chinese mythological beast and companion of the Chinese god Erlang Shen. Depicted as a white dog, it assists Erlang Shen in battle by using its powerful bite and howl to attack, maul, or subdue demons. Qiaotian Quan appears in Journey to the West, Fengshen Yanyi, and other legends about Erlang Shen, such as Lotus Lantern and several Chinese folktales.\nLegends\nAccording to folklore, before Erlang Shen became a deity, he encountered a stray dog on the street. Feeling a strong connection with the dog, Erlang Shen decided to bring it along with him. During his cultivation, Erlang Shen also taught the dog some spells. The dog was deeply grateful for Erlang Shen's recognition and care, remaining fiercely loyal to him. Although they appeared to have a master-servant relationship, in their hearts, they were already family, transcending mere species. The dog, later known as Xiaotian Quan, accompanied Erlang Shen in slaying demons and vanquishing evil. Xiaotian Quan is inseparable from Erlang Shen's legend, and as such, temples dedicated to Erlang Shen often also enshrine him.\nXiaotian Quan first appeared in Gan Bao's In Search of the Supernatural.\nIn the Chinese folktale of Lotus Lantern, Xiaotian Quan is the one who obstructs Liu Chenxiang from splitting Mount Hua to rescue his mother Huayue Sanniang.\nIn the novel Investiture of the Gods, Yang Jian (assumed to be Erlang) sometimes sends his dog to bite his enemies.\nRelief of Erlang Shen and Xiaotian Quan.\nIn the novel Journey to the West, Xiaotian Quan helps Erlang fight Sun Wukong, preventing him from escaping by biting him in the leg. Later in Chapter 63, Sun Wukong, Erlang, and their companions battle against the Nine-Headed Prince when the dog defeats the enemy biting off one of monster's retractable heads. The prince then flees, choking on his own blood. Erlang lets him go and predicts he'll drown in his own blood.\nXiaotian Quan is often identified with the primordial heavenly dog called Tiangou. In ancient times, with limited scientific understanding, solar and lunar eclipses were attributed to Tiangou's mischievous actions. During such celestial events, common folk would traditionally beat drums and gongs to drive away Tiangou. Even today, the saying \"Tiangou eats the moon or sun\" persists in popular culture.\nThere is also a legend that after Hou Yi shot down nine suns to save humanity, the Queen Mother of the West rewarded him with an elixir of immortality. His wife, Chang'e, unable to bear the suffering of the mortal world, stole and consumed the elixir, ascending to the heavens alone. Hou Yi's black dog witnessed this and licked the remaining elixir, chasing after Chang'e. Hearing the dog's bark, Chang'e hastily hid in the moon. The dog, enraged, grew in size and swallowed the moon whole. Upon learning of this, the Jade Emperor and the Queen Mother of the West ordered the heavenly soldiers and generals to capture the black dog. Recognizing it as Hou Yi's hunting dog, the Queen Mother bestowed upon it the title of \"Heavenly Dog\" (Tiangou) and tasked it with guarding the Southern Gate of Heaven. The dog then released both the moon and Chang'e. After being honored, the Heavenly Dog became the divine beast of Erlang Shen, earning the name \"Howling Celestial Dog\" (Xiaotian Quan), assisting Erlang Shen in slaying demons and monsters.\nIn the Legend of the Jade Emperor, at the end of the story, after the war, everyone was granted titles by the Jade Emperor, except for Xiaotian Quan. Feeling wronged, Xiaotian Quan swallowed the sun and moon in two bites, plunging the sky into darkness. The Jade Emperor sent someone to investigate and discovered it was Xiaotian Quan. He then ordered Erlang Shen to capture the dog and bring him back to be punished.\nIn the Peking opera titled An Tianhui (\u5b89\u5929\u6703), Xiaotian Quan is depicted as Liu Tianjun (\u5289\u5929\u541b), with a red face divided into three sections like tiles. In the opera Nao Tiangong (\u9b27\u5929\u5bae), Liu Tianjun is one of the Four Heavenly Kings, a Taoist deity who can summon wind and rain. The red, three-sectioned face represents his loyalty and bravery, with thunder and fire patterns drawn on his forehead.\nThe Interactive Encyclopedia states that Xiaotian Quang appeared in the Yuan dynasty zaju titled Erlang Shen Locks Up the Great Sage Equaling Heaven by an anonymous author. The play contains the following line:\n\"With the True Lord's golden bullet, slender hound, and three-pointed double-edged sword, where can he escape to?\"\nTherefore, some scholars believe that Xiaotian Quan belongs to the Chinese Xigou (slender dog) breed. It is said that a large Tibetan dog breed Tibetan Mastiff is the descendant of Xiaotian Quan.\nAccording to Chinese historian Zhang Zhenglang\u00a0's research, the prototype of Xiaotian Quan is the divine rat beside Dujian, the sec",
    "5th episode of the 1st season of Sh\u014dgun\n\"Broken to the Fist\" (Japanese: \u7236\u306e\u6012\u308a, Hepburn: Chichi no Ikari) is the fifth episode of the American historical drama television series Sh\u014dgun, based on the novel by James Clavell. The episode was written by consulting producer Matt Lambert, and directed by Frederick E. O. Toye. It was released on Hulu on March 19, 2024, and it also aired on FX on the same day.\nThe series is set in 1600, and follows three characters. John Blackthorne, a risk-taking English sailor who ends up shipwrecked in Japan, a land whose unfamiliar culture will ultimately redefine him; Lord Toranaga, a shrewd, powerful daimyo, at odds with his own dangerous, political rivals; and Lady Mariko, a woman with invaluable skills but dishonorable family ties, who must prove her value and allegiance. In the episode, Buntaro returns after the ambush, and Blackthorne gets into a fight over his treatment of Mariko. \nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.554 million household viewers and gained a 0.10 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349. The episode received critical acclaim, with Anna Sawai receiving significant praise for her performance. \nPlot\nAs Yabushige's army cleans the aftermath of the chain shots, they are surprised by the arrival of Toranaga's army. One of the soldiers is Buntaro, who managed to survive the ambush. Toranaga is upset at Nagakado's actions, and he decides to take away his command of the cannon regiment, giving it to Omi.\nWith Buntaro's return, Mariko is still instructed to serve his duties to both her husband and Blackthorne. Buntaro moves in with them, and his presence soon causes friction within them. During this, Blackthorne puts a pheasant in front of the house, instructing Fuji to not remove it despite its smell, as Toranaga gave it to him as a gift. Due to his limited Japanese, he tells the gardeners that they die if they touch it. During dinner, Blackthorne and Buntaro engage in a sake drinking binge. A drunken Buntaro forces Mariko to tell Blackthorne about her father, Akechi Jinsai, who murdered the predecessor of the Taik\u014d. He was forced to execute his family before committing seppuku and Mariko married Buntaro as atonement for his betrayal.\nLater, Buntaro physically assaults Mariko, causing Blackthorne to confront him outside the house with his pistol. Buntaro does not fight back, and apologizes for his actions, blaming the sake for his behavior. Ashamed, he gives an angered Blackthorne his sword. The following day, Blackthorne tries to convince Mariko in leaving her husband, but she refuses, also deciding that she will not speak with him unless Toranaga orders a translation. At his house, the gardener Uejiro is confused by Blackthorne's orders and removes the pheasant to dispose of it, and he is later reported to have been executed. Blackthorne is devastated, but Muraji manages to convince Yabushige and Omi that Uejiro was the spy they were searching for.\nAfter Uejiro's death, Blackthorne meets with Toranaga, asking to leave Japan. During their meeting, an earthquake hits the village and causes a landslide. Toranaga is buried, but Blackthorne manages to save him, although Toranaga's army suffers heavy losses. In Osaka, the remaining regents attempt to decide who will take Toranaga's place on the council but Ochiba no Kata, the consort of the late Taiko, soon arrives and reunites with her son Yaechiyo before telling Ishido that the council will now listen to her.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn February 2024, Hulu confirmed that the fifth episode of the series would be titled \"Broken to the Fist\", and was to be written by consulting producer Matt Lambert, and directed by Frederick E. O. Toye. It was Lambert's first writing credit, and Toye's second directing credit.\nWriting\nJustin Marks explained that the series wanted to explore more of Mariko, especially \"what baggage is Mariko carrying with her.\" For this, it was important to show more about her father, as well as her marriage to Buntaro. Marks considered that Buntaro \"keeps her in an invisible cage\", but to protect her life as he fears losing her.:\u200a1:40\u20133:50\u200a\nFilming\nFor the earthquake scene, producer Eriko Miyagawa said that the crew managed to depict the sequence through \"really rigorous planning\" and a combination of visual effects and stunts. She said, \"It has to be an earthquake. Not, you know, another natural disaster. It has to look and feel like  earthquake.\"\nReception\nViewers\nIn its original FX broadcast, \"Broken to the Fist\" was seen by an estimated 0.554 million household viewers and gained a 0.10 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349, according to Nielsen Media Research.

    "16th and 17th-century leader of the Warraskoyack tribe\nTackonekintaco (birth year unknown\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091620s) was a 16th and 17th-century leader of the Warraskoyack tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy, in what is now the U.S. state of Virginia. \nLife and rule\nTackonekintaco was a respected leader within the Warraskoyack tribe. By the late 1590s, Tackonekintaco had become the new weroance of the tribe. The main village of the tribe was located in present-day Smithfield, Virginia. The tribe had at least 40 warriors and over 135 tribal members.\nIn December 1608, Tackonekintaco was visited by captain John Smith, with whom he had established friendly relations and gave corn to on an earlier trip. He cautioned Smith against continuing his journey in search of lost colonists, primarily due to the threat of violence from Powhatan. John Smith wrote that Tackonekintaco provided him with \"good counsel\" and he told the chief that he had his \"perpetual love\" and friendship. Upon Smith's departure, he left his page Samuel Collier with Tackonekintaco to learn the Algonquian language, and Tackonekintaco provided some local villagers as guides to accompany Michael Sicklemore on his journey south into the Chowanoc country. Tackonekintaco befriended Collier who lived with the tribe during that period.\nAs weroance, Tackonekintaco controlled the tribe's surplus stock of corn which was of great interest to colonists.\nCapture by Virginia Company\nAfter Smith's departure from Virginia, Tackonekintaco's time in leadership was met with threats of coercion and violence by colonists. In the summer of 1610, Tackonekintaco and his son, Tangoit were captured by colonists led by Christopher Newport, and held as hostages. To receive his freedom and his son's, he was forced to contract with the Virginia Company to exchange 500 bushels of wheats, beans, and peas for an indefinite quantity of copper, beads, and hatchets from the tribe. When Tackonekintaco refused to deliver the provisions, Governor of Virginia Baron De La Warr ordered his troops to attack their tribe and burn their main village. Tackonekintaco spotted the troops coming downriver, and gave the signal for his people to flee the village and take refuge in surrounding forests.\nIn 1623 in the aftermath of the Indian massacre of 1622, the tribe was attacked and later, an English fort was built within its borders.\nDeath\nRecords indicate that Tackonekintaco died c.\u20091620s and was the last recorded weroance of the tribe.\n",
    "\nCaramelo (lit.\u2009'Caramel') is a horse known for having spent at least four days on a roof in Canoas during the floods in Rio Grande do Sul in May 2024.\nRescue\nCaramelo stranded on the roof of a house\nThe horse was stranded in a house in the Mathias Velho neighborhood, Canoas, during the floods that occurred in Rio Grande do Sul in May 2024. He spent about four days stranded. According to veterinarians consulted by CNN Brasil, he survived because he was probably very well hydrated and fed.\nOn 8 May, Caramelo began to be monitored and some teams unsuccessfully attempted the rescue. The mayor of Canoas, Jairo Jorge (PSD), told GloboNews that the rescue would require a helicopter. The rescue planning was done during the night with the S\u00e3o Paulo State Fire Department and the team of veterinarians who helped rescue other stranded animals during the flood, including two horses that were trapped on a building staircase.\nOn 9 May, the rescue was carried out by the Fire Department accompanied by a team of veterinarians. The team was mobilized by General Hertz Pires do Nascimento, commander of the Brazilian Army operations in Rio Grande do Sul. Five boats and a helicopter were made available for the rescue. Around 11 a.m., Caramelo was anesthetized, laid down, and placed in a boat, where saline solution was used to keep him hydrated. He reached dry land around noon, when the boat was removed with Caramelo inside and placed on a trailer, where he was dried and taken to the veterinary hospital of the Lutheran University of Brazil (Ulbra). Caramelo was described as docile by veterinarians and weighed between 450 and 500\u00a0kg (990 and 1,100\u00a0lb) when rescued. Two dogs that were stranded on a nearby roof were also rescued.\nAt the hospital, it was checked whether Caramelo was injured and he received intravenous sugar solution to replace the liquid he lost while stranded. The horse was initially fed with a pasty food, with veterinarians planning to transition to grass as he recovered. On 10 May, he had a stable clinical condition, but was still dehydrated.\nImpact\nCaramelo became nationally famous when he was filmed by TV Globo helicopter on 8 May. His rescue was widely reported in Brazil. Some newspapers, such as Metr\u00f3poles and Correio Braziliense, claimed that Caramelo was a symbol of resilience during the flood. Veja magazine stated that Caramelo's rescue showed the government's negligence regarding the flood warnings. The president of the Supreme Federal Court, Roberto Barroso, described the scene as emblematic. The horse stirred up emotions on social media. It was internet users who nicknamed him Caramelo (lit.\u2009'Caramel'). On 8 May, the hashtag #SaveTheCanoasHorse trended on X (formerly Twitter). In addition to rescue requests, he was portrayed in memes, and journalist Renato Peters created a cartoon of him. Celebrities like Felipe Neto pressured for his rescue. The rescue also gained international attention.\nThe rescue was followed by Eduardo Paganella, a reporter for RBS TV. The rescue was also broadcast live on Mais Voc\u00ea, and it moved Ana Maria Braga deeply. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said he slept restlessly the night before the rescue and that Caramelo deserved \"a good rest\". First Lady Ros\u00e2ngela Lula da Silva also became emotional and said she was in contact with a stud farm where the horse would be transported. In response, comedian Whindersson Nunes posted a photo of actress Jade Picon in the soap opera Travessia washing clothes by hand in a river. Ros\u00e2ngela countered the post by writing that \"he doesn't know that washing machines have been invented for a long time\", but the comedian responded that \"this tweet doesn't allude to household chores, it alludes to doing a lot of hassle for something, about getting your hands dirty and making a big fuss about something\".\nShortly after his admission, some people showed up at the veterinary hospital claiming to be the owners of the animal. Giovanna Ewbank and Felipe Neto offered to adopt Caramelo.\nSee also\nCaramel mongrel\u00a0\nNotes\n^ Initially, it was believed to be a horse. However, the S\u00e3o Paulo State Security Secretariat (SSP) announced that it was a mare.

    "2023 novel by Douglas Kennedy\nFlyover is a 2023 science fiction dystopian book by Douglas Kennedy about a future division of the United States into two countries, reflecting the deepening split in the American society between the supporters of the Democratic and Republican parties.\nHistory\nKennedy was inspired to write the novel by the events of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.\nThe book has been published in French in 2023 under the title (Et c'est ainsi que nous vivrons, lit. This is How We Shall Live). The French edition was translated from English by Chlo\u00e9 Royer and published by \u00c9ditions Belfond. As of 2024, it has not received an English release yet, although the title of the English release has been announced as Flyover.\nPlot\nIn Flyover, set in 2045, extreme and populist right has come to power in many formerly democratic countries. Already in 2034 the United States has split into two new entities: the United Republic and the United Confederacy. The United Republic, emerging from the Democratic Party supporters, claims to be a stronghold of progressive values along the coasts, although it encroaches on citizens privacy through the use of extensive surveillance, including through tracking and recording chips implanted in all individuals on its territory. In contrast, the United Confederacy, adopting the old Confederate flag and formed by the former Republican Party supporters, operates as a Christian theocracy across the Midwest and the South and bans not only abortion and sex change, but also divorce; offending religious feelings is a cause for the death penalty, often enacted through burning at the stake. Minneapolis has become a semi-neutral territory and a divided city, reminiscent of the divided Berlin of the Cold War era. The war between the intelligence agencies of the two states form a major part of plot of the novel, and the story follows a Republic spy, Samantha Stengel, who is tasked with assassinating her sister \u2013 a spy working for the Confederacy and tasked with the same mission.\nReception\nThe book has been reviewed in a number of French-language publications. Radio France hosted a review of the book by several journalists and critics. Patricia Martin\u00a0 said that it is \"very good  scary as hell\". Olivia de Lamberterie\u00a0 criticized the novels early writing, but concluded that \u201cit\u2019s very scary  and that\u2019s very good\u201d. Jean-Louis Ezine was less impressed by the work, saying that it is only a rehash of Kennedy's previous works, and that it a horror that claims to alert us to an alarming situation which already exists. Arnaud Viviant\u00a0 called the work captivating and relevant to recent news. It was reviewed for Le Monde by Denis Cosnard, who likened it to a Ian Fleming's spy novel. Cosnard also noted that the novel has some autobiographical elements for Kennedy. The reviewer praised the detailed and realistic prediction for the near future, including election by election future history of the United States, and noted that \"despite fairly flat writing which does not avoid certain clich\u00e9s, Douglas Kennedy's fiction proves doubly terrifying\". The book was reviewed for La Presse by Laila Maalouf. She saw it as a strong criticism of Donald Trump, whom \"whom  does not hesitate to attack directly\". It was also reviewed by Alexandra Schwartzbrod\u00a0 for Lib\u00e9ration, who predicted it to be a \"summer best-seller\", and described the book as an intriguing \"political, futuristic and detective novel\", with elements of science-fiction spy and detective thriller as well; she did however criticize the \"underplayed psychology of the characters\" due to the book's focus on \"politics, futuristic technology and shootings\". It was reviewed by Eric Neuhoff for Le Figaro. He called it a good piece of storytelling, writing that the story \"gallops along, joyfully mocking the improbable\", although he criticized author's film references as \"dated\". Olivia Ph\u00e9lip reviewed it for Atlantico news website, writing that it is a \"dystopia with Orwellian accents, which can be read in one go and which sends shivers down your spine\", and that the work \"unfortunately draws its plausibility from current signals\". She also praised Kennedy for creating \"strong heroines\", noting that it is one of author's best works, \"a real page-turner\". A reviewer U.ARQ also reviewed it for L'Avenir.\nSimon Petite interviewed Kennedy about this book for Le Temps.\nIn English press, in 2023, Lara Marlowe reviewed the book for The Irish Times and likened it to \"an updated version of George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four.\" A reviewer for The Economist in 2024 called the novel \"absorbing\" and noted that it represents one of several works related to recent growing interest in American related to the concept of civil war, reflecting increasing polarization of American politics and society.\nAnalysis\nMarlowe saw the novel as a study in how fundamentalism and populism can warp societies. Schwartzbrod in turn saw this a study in \"religious fundamentalism and into",
    "1995 short story by Greg Egan\n\"Luminous\" is a science-fiction short story by Australian writer Greg Egan, first published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction in September 1995.\nThe short story was included in the collections Luminous in 1998, Dark Integers and Other Stories in 2008, and The Best of Greg Egan in 2020. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1996. It has a sequel, the short story \"Dark Integers\".\nPlot\nBruno and Alison, who made her PhD under the supervision of Yuen Fu-ting at Fu-tan university in China, discuss about arithmetics and the relation of mathematical truth to the physical world. Alison insists that there needs to be a manifestation of theorems by either thought or computation, which would imply them being correct only to spread with the speed of light. She underlines this point of view with a statement about very high integers, which after 423 steps implies its opposite and hence yields a contradiction within arithmetics. Luminous, a computer only based on the interaction of light with itself, carries out these 423 steps and then begins to map out an island of theorems belonging to the far side of mathematics. Bruno suspects the anomaly to have formed from certain combinations in the quark\u2013gluon plasma after the Big Bang. Yuen Ting-fu orders Alison to carry out computations to destroy the far side, when a large spike appears and gets manifested by them gaining an understanding of the arithmetics of the far side. They discuss about the aliens responsible and the possibility, that if their attack indeed only spread with the speed of light, they must exist on Earth in a form invisible to them due to their different mathematics. But their new insight in it might shed light on this new world.\nTranslation\nThe short story was translated into German (1996), French (1998), Italian (2001), Japanese (2002) and Spanish (2010).\nReception\nReviews\nWriting in Strange Horizons, Karen Burnham discussed suspension of disbelief in regard to multiple of Egan's short stories. Burnham indicated that \"Luminous\" and \"Dark Integers\" \"aren't necessarily Egan's best stories\" as they \"both rely heavily on their plots, with very little characterization\", and \"it's very hard to find a narrative toehold when the infodumping gets confusing\". However, they found that \"reading the introduction\" of Dark Integers and Other Stories makes \"them easier to read\". She explained, \"Then I knew that my feeling of disjointedness wasn't because I was stupid, but because the stories' conceit really was completely without basis in any real-world science or genre convention.\"\nRich Horton, writing on the SF Site, referred to the story's central premise as \"fascinating\" but stated that \"it didn't quite sell this idea, and the thrillerish material wasn't convincingly integrated.\"\nIn the Reactor Magazine, Salik Shah claimed the short story (together with its sequel \"Dark Integers\") \"would make an exciting premise for radio or film adaptation.\"\nAwards\n\"Luminous\" was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1996 and won the Japanese Seiun Award in 2003. It reached the 12th in the Reader Poll of the Locus Award in 1996.\nSee also\nDivision by Zero, short story by Ted Chiang about an inconsistency in arithmetics\n",
    "\nThis is a list of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in California in 2024 since protests escalated at the Columbia University campus occupation on April 17. Campus protests initially spread the following week to Cal Poly Humboldt, UC Berkeley, and USC. On April 25, encampments and protests spread further to multiple universities; UCLA. UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, Stanford, and at Sonoma State the following day. On April 29, encampments were set up at San Francisco State, Sacramento State, UC Riverside, and Occidental College; and at UC San Diego and at the University of San Francisco on April 30.\nIn May, United Auto Workers local labor union authorized a stand-up strike against the University of California system alleging unsafe labor practices and violations of civil rights against the workers it represents. The first strike began on May 20 at UC Santa Cruz.\nBackground\nUniversities in California with Israel\u2013Hamas war protests in April 2024. Universities that had encampments are marked in green, and non-encampment protests are marked in blue.\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses.\nPro-Palestinian protests on university campuses escalated in April 2024, spreading in the United States and other countries, as part of wider Israel\u2013Hamas war protests. The escalation began after mass arrests at the Columbia University campus occupation, led by anti-Zionist groups, in which protesters demanded the university's disinvestment from Israel over its alleged genocide of Palestinians. In the U.S. over 2,950 protesters have been arrested, including faculty members and professors, on over 60 campuses. On May 7, protests spread across Europe with mass arrests in the Netherlands. By May 12, twenty encampments had been established in the United Kingdom, and across universities in Australia and Canada. Some protesters have referred to the movement as the \"student intifada\".\nThe different protests' varying demands include severing financial ties with Israel, transparency over financial ties, an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions, and amnesty for protesters. Universities have suspended and expelled student protesters, in some cases evicting them from campus housing. Some universities have relied on police to forcibly disband encampments and end occupations of buildings, while others made agreements with protesters for encampments to be dismantled. Universities that have cut or paused ties with Israeli institutions, or companies involved with Israel and its occupied territories, include Portland State University, Trinity College Dublin, the University of Helsinki, the University of Copenhagen, and Ghent University. The occupations have also resulted in the closure of Columbia University, Cal Poly Humboldt, and the University of Amsterdam; rolling strikes by academic workers on campuses in California; and the cancellation of a few university graduation ceremonies in the U.S., with protests occurring at various ceremonies.\nUniversity of California\n\"UAW ON Strike\" signs\nStrike\nOn May 15, members of United Auto Workers Local 4811, the union representing 48,000 graduate students on 10 campuses in the University of California system voted to authorize a strike because the university unfairly change policies and discriminated against students who were exercising their right to free speech and created an unsafe work environment by allowing attacks on protesters. The authorization does not guarantee a strike, but allows the executive board to call a stand up strike at any time. The first of such strikes began on May 20 at UC Santa Cruz, by academic workers over; labor practices, the police response to the protests, and the arrest of union members involved in protests. The University applied to the state labor board for an injunction against the strike, but it was rejected on May 23. On May 28, the second week of rolling strikes began at UC Davis and UCLA. The third week of the strike is scheduled to begin on June 3 at UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara and UC Irvine.\nOn June 3, the associate vice president for systemwide labor relations at UC stated: \"UC will file a breach of contract action against UAW in state court as a next step.\" The same day, the Public Employment Relations Board rejected UC's call for an inunction a second time. The request did not meet the high burden of irreparable harm if the strike is allowed to continue.\nUC Berkeley\nEncampment at UC Berkeley on April 25, 2024\nStudent protesters put up more than a dozen tents on Sproul Plaza at University of California, Berkeley, stating they would remain until the university divested from companies involved with the war. University officials pledged to remove protesters who put up tents or \"disrupted academic activity\" by force. On May 14, the encampment at Sproul Plaza was dismantled by protesters after reaching an agreement with chancellor Carol Christ to begin efforts to secure a permanent ceasefire.",
    "Galaxy located in VirgoIC 3078 is a spiral galaxy with a ring structure located in Virgo. Its redshift is  0.066148, meaning IC 3078 is located 905 million light-years from Earth. With an apparent dimension of 0.50 x 0.5 arcmin, IC 3038 is about 133,000 light-years across. It was discovered by Royal Harwood Frost on May 7, 1904 and is listed in the Virgo Cluster catalogue as VCC 174. However, it is not a member of the Virgo Cluster, but instead a background galaxy.\nFeatures\nThe nucleus of IC 3078 is found to be active. It is a Seyfert galaxy of type 1.9 and classified a Markarian galaxy (designated Mrk 764), because compared to other galaxies its nucleus emits excessive amounts of ultraviolet rays.  More  IC 3078 is a starburst galaxy since a study published in 1983, mentions it displays a bright star-like nucleus. However, it does not display broad-line emission spectra which is the characteristic of Seyfert galaxies. Instead its features can be explained through the presence of the population of hot, young stars. IC 3078 is known to be a star-burst nuclei, in which the phenomenon might supply enough material for gravitational accretion, hence the development of active galaxies.\nAccording to a further study done by Hideaki and Yoshiaki, it is proven IC 3078 is classified an old starburst galaxy, which is deficient in O-type stars and does not exhibit strong line emission. But however, IC 3078 still has many B stars which is expected to heat up dust grains and generate strong continuum emission in far-infrared areas. Furthermore, IC 3078 lies in the \u223c9033 square degrees of the sky which is observed by the VLA FIRST survey radio catalogue. From the results, a positive detection of radio emission is found, IC 3078 included, in 775 AGN of which 214 of them show new detections at radio wavelengths.\nMoreover, IC 3078 has been observed by IRAS for its optically selected starburst nuclei to derived its far-infrared luminosity and through tabulating its distance and blue and H\u03b1 luminosity, written by Deutsch and Willner. It was also one of the galaxies to be studied by Kiso Survey for ultraviolet-excess, which was detected on multi-color plates by the Kiso Schmidt telescope for 10 survey fields and catalogued down to a magnitude of 18.\nIn a study conducted in 1995, which radio data is presented for IC 3078 and 898 other Markarian galaxies which was observed at v=4.755 GHz through the NRAO-Green Bank 300 foot (91m) telescope, scientists found that detection rates increased to (49%, 33%) amongst seyferts and to (73%, 42%) for those with starburst nuclei. From the study, it is found that IC 3078 has a radio luminosity of h^2^P_1.415_ < 10^23^ W Hz^-1^, a characteristic of normal galaxies.\n",
    "Former electoral summer palace in Engers, Germany\nSchloss Engers from the air (2017)\nSchloss Engers (2016)\nSchloss Engers (English: Engers palace) is a Baroque-style palace in Engers, near Koblenz, Germany. It is situated on the banks of the Rhine river. Johann IX Philipp von Walderdorff (1701\u20131768), Prince-Elector of Trier, constructed the palace between 1759 and 1764 based on a design by the architect Johanness Seiz\u00a0. It served both as summer palace and hunting lodge.\nToday the palace is now one of the two locations of Villa Musica, a foundation of the German state Rhineland-Palatinate and the broadcaster S\u00fcdwestrundfunk. Its goals are to support young performers of classical music and to run concerts. Also, it houses a museum with old musical instruments and paintings of Prince-Electors of Trier.\nHistory\nMap of Koblenz and its northern surroundings (2nd half 18th century) showing the residential landscape north of Koblenz with the locations of the palaces Sch\u00f6nbornslust, K\u00e4rlich and Engers\nJohann Philipp von Walderdorff\nSchloss Engers from the east from the air (2013)\nSchloss Engers seen from the opposite bank of the Rhine\nCoat of arms at the Engers palace facade\nInterior of Schloss Engers: Diana's Hall\nKunostein castle\nKuno II of Falkenstein (1320\u20131388), Archbishop and Prince-Elector of Trier, acquired the town of Engers in 1371 and built Kunostein Castle on the banks of the Rhine. His brother and successor, Werner von Falkenstein (1355\u20131418), relocated the toll station from Stolzenfels Castle near Koblenz to Engers. From then, Kunostein Castle became a Toll castle. It survived the medieval period without significant destruction.\nIn 1757, the then Archbishop and Prince-Elector of Trier, Johann Philipp von Walderdorff, decided to modernize the castle. This undertaking is interpreted as a reaction to the founding of the town of Neuwied. He changed his plans and had the castle demolished in 1758. Today, the Gray Tower of the old toll station remains.\nElectoral summer palace and hunting lodge\nJohann Philipp von Walderdorff commissioned the architect Johannes Seiz, a student of Balthasar Neumann, to build a new summer palace and hunting lodge on the site of the former Kunostein castle. The design is in late baroque-style. Construction happened between 1759 and 1762. Johannes Seiz involved stuccoist Michael Eytel, painter Januarius Zick from Koblenz, and sculptor Ferdinand Dietz to help with the interior. Since then, the palace remained more or less unchanged.\nThe Prince-Elector only stayed at Schloss Engers during the hunting season in September each year. For the rest of the time, the castle was unoccupied and was opened for visiting travellers.\nThe Prince-Elector would often come by barge from the Philippsburg palace in Koblenz over the Rhine to Engers.\nThe Elector also had other palaces and hunting lodges built in: a transformation of his family castle in Molsberg, the Electoral palace in Trier and Wittlich, Schloss Philippsfreude. Further, he was responsible for the furnishing of Schloss Sch\u00f6nbornslust, which construction was started under his predecessor, Franz Georg von Sch\u00f6nborn (1682\u20131756).\n19th and 20th centuries\nAfter the end of the Electorate, the castle was assigned to the Prince of Nassau-Weilburg as a summer residence in 1803. Following the Congress of Vienna, Engers became part of Prussia, and between 1862 and 1914, the site was used as a military school . During the wars of 1870/71 and between 1914 and 1917, it served as a reserve hospital.\nIn 1928, the site was sold to the Josefs-Gesellschaft, and a home, healing, and educational institution for people with disabilities was established. The hospital school evolved into the Christiane Herzog School, which is part of the Heinrich-Haus and focuses on motor development.\nModern times\nIn 1990, the castle building was taken over by the state of Rhineland-Palatinate and has housed the state foundation Villa Musica since 1995.\nDirectly adjacent to the castle upstream is the neo-baroque residential house for the masters (known as the Meisterhaus), built around 1900, who were trained at Heinrich-Haus. The renovated building now houses the State Music Academy of Rhineland-Palatinate since 2003.\nPanorama\n The Welfenschloss today as the main building of the Leibniz University Hanover\n",
    "\nThe 2008 Wisconsin Supreme Court election was held on Tuesday, April\u00a01, 2008, to elect a justice to the Wisconsin Supreme Court for a ten-year term.  Burnett County circuit judge Michael Gableman narrowly defeated incumbent justice Louis B. Butler, shifting the ideology of the court toward conservatives.\nThe incumbent justice, Butler, had been appointed by Governor Jim Doyle in August 2004, and was running for his first full term.  He was also the first (and so far only) African American justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\nThis race is considered a turning point in the modern politicization of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.  Candidates and outside interest groups spent about $6 million on the race, which was at that time the most expensive judicial election in state history.\nGableman won the election by 22,303 votes, carrying 51.19% of the electorate.  Butler was the first incumbent justice to lose election since 1967.\nPrimary election\nThere was no Supreme Court primary in 2008, as only two candidates ran for the seat.\nCandidates\nAdvanced\nLouis B. Butler, incumbent Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court\nMichael Gableman, Wisconsin circuit judge for Burnett County\nWithdrawn\nCharlie Schutze, Sun Prairie attorney\nGeneral election\nAdvertising\nAttack ads played a significant role in the campaign.  Following the acrimonious 2007 Wisconsin Supreme Court election, the Wisconsin State Bar attempted to induce candidates for 2008 to take a pledge not to use attack ads, and to discourage their supporters from that practice.  Butler signed the pledge and largely held his campaign to that standard.  Gableman refused the pledge and accused the Bar of bias.\nGableman's outside allies outspent Butler's on television ads at a roughly 3:2 ratio.  The largest spender on his behalf was the business lobbying group Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC).  One of their first controversial ads was known as \"technicalities\" and criticized Butler for his dissent in the case of State v. Jensen.  Jensen had been accused of poisoning his wife, Julie; she had written a letter, commonly referred to in Wisconsin as a \"letter from the grave\", stating that she believed she was being poisoned.  The trial judge ruled the letter inadmissible, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court majority reversed him; Butler dissented.  The ad accused Butler of focusing on technicalities and claimed he \"almost jeopardized\" the prosecution.  Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce also ran another ad on this same case, accusing Butler of using loopholes for criminal defendants and calling him \"Loophole Louie.\"  The two ads ran more than 3,000 times in the Spring campaign.\nAnother ad, run by the conservative Coalition for America's Families, led by a former chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, accused Butler of overturning a murder conviction despite overwhelming evidence of guilt.  Butler's decision in that case had been based on new DNA evidence that undercut a critical element of the prosecution.\nThe most controversial ad of the campaign was run by Gableman's own campaign.  The ad featured a mugshot of a convicted rapist side by side with a photo of Butler\u2014both African American men\u2014and implied Butler let the other man out of prison and allowed him to commit another rape.  In fact, Butler\u2014who was then a public defender assigned to the defendant\u2014had failed to win the man's release.  His subsequent rape was committed after he finished serving his prison sentence.  The ad was only officially run 106 times, but was repeated dozens of times by news organizations discussing the contents.  At the time, the ad was compared to the infamous Willie Horton ad from the 1988\u00a0United\u00a0States presidential election. The ad was so egregious that 13 years later, journalists were still recalling it as \"the most racist ad in the history of Wisconsin politics\".\nResults\nAftermath\nAnalysis\nA significant factor in the outcome of the 2008 Supreme Court election was the decision by state party leaders to move up the state's presidential nominating contest from the Spring general election in April to the Spring primary in February.  The presidential preference vote brought unprecedented turnout to the Spring primary, with over 1.5 million votes cast.  The Supreme Court election, taking place 42 days later at the Spring general election, received only 830,450 votes, with a margin of victory of 22,303.\nImpact\nReplacing the liberal Butler with the conservative Gableman had a significant effect on the ideology of the Wisconsin Supreme Court in subsequent years, and was the start of fifteen years of conservative control of the state court.  The conservative majority on the court would be important also in ratifying the policy agenda of Republican Governor Scott Walker and the Republican legislative majorities which would be elected two years later in the 2010 Wisconsin elections.  Subsequent Wisconsin Supreme Court elections also became increasingly bitter and partisan, with outside groups o",

It is dually affiliated to the Central Military Commission Equipment Development Department and the People's Liberation Army Aerospace Force. It is the third specialized research and training center for astronauts in the world after the Soviet/Russian Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center and the United States's Houston Space Center. Known as \"the cradle of China's space heroes\", the center's motto is \"From here into the Universe\" (\u201c\u4ece\u9019\u91cc\u8d70\u5411\u592a\u7a7a\u201d).\nHistory\nIn 1958, China began research on aerospace biomedical engineering. At that time, space pioneers Qian Xuesen, Zhao Jiuzhang and others were commissioned by the Chinese Academy of Sciences to establish the \"581 Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\", which was a high-altitude physiological research group explicitly intended to study \"the development and training of biological life support systems in rocket flight\". In 1960, this \"High Altitude Physiology Research Group\" was expanded into the \"Space Biology Research Laboratory\" to carry out space biology research and build a series of laboratories. In addition, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences were also engaged in aerospace medical engineering research.\nIn 1968, during the Cultural Revolution, Qian Xuesen, at the time establishing the general design office for spacecrafts, made a report to the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, recommending the establishment of an Institute of Space Medical Engineering. With the approval of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, on April 1, 1968, relevant units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences jointly established the \"Institute of Aerospace Medical Engineering\" in Beijing, also known as the 507th Research Institute of the PLA, what is now considered the direct ancestor of the ACC. It was affiliated to the Fifth Research Institute of the Ministry of National Defense.\nThe 507 Institute had a staff of 1,265, with He Quanxuan as the director, Zhu Yu as the political commissar, and Huo Junfeng, Chen Xin and Shi Yunfeng as the deputy directors. In the next three years, the institute continuously moved its location. In 1969, it moved from the Changping branch of Peking University to the Beijing Institute of Technology, and in 1970 it moved to the old site of Beijing Agricultural University. In 1971, the State Council of the People's Republic of China approved the establishment of a special scientific research area for the Institute of Aerospace Medical Engineering. The institute then built an experimental area in the land set aside. By December 1978, the Beijing Agricultural University wanted to move back to its original location. The 507 institute then set up 33 tents on the new experimental site, and the various teams moved into the tents to work, maintaining scientific research and production. On June 25, 1986, the laboratory building of the institute was completed, and since then the institute has been at its current location.\nIn 1970, the Central Military Commission approved the development mission of \"Shuguang\" 1 manned spacecraft, and planned to send China's first astronaut into space in 10 years. This was known as the \"714\" project. The institute participated in the research tasks of the project until the project was discontinued in 1978. After 1981, the institute started carrying out again research on manned space technology, research on the human body in zero-G environments, and satellite-borne biological research. In October 1990, China's  \"Jianbing\" 1 satellite used a biological capsule developed by the institute to carry mice for an 8-day orbital flight. This was China's first advanced orbital animal space flight test.\nOn 8 January 1992, the China Manned Space Program was started. The institute (then known in English as the \"Institute of Space Medical Engineering\", ISME) was made responsible for the astronaut system and the environmental control and life support subsystems of the spacecraft, among the seven major systems of the China Manned Space Program.\nIn 2003, China's first manned space mission \"Shenzhou 5\" was successful. The space suit worn by Shenzhou 5 astronaut Yang Liwei was embroidered with the logo of the Institute of Space Medical Engineering. This was the only time this logo appeared in a manned space mission.Shenzhou 7 The logo of the China Astronaut Research and Training Center on the spacesuit (on the right chest), used since Shenzhou 6\nIn 2005, the Institute of Space Medical Engineering was renamed to its current name of China Astronautic Research and Trainin",

He was a partner at Stephenson & Wheeler from 1886 to 1921, when he retired.\nStephenson was best known for his work for wealthy families in the environs of New York City, New Jersey, and Connecticut. These included Edgerton (Connecticut) and Wrexleigh (New York), as well as designing homes for Charles Bigelow, Thomas E. Gillespie, and Oliver Gould Jennings (882 Fifth Avenue, New York City). However, he was also the Architectural Advisor to the Church Committee of the Newark, New Jersey Diocese and in that capacity was responsible for designing or co-designing several churches, among them the Trinity Congregational church in East Orange, New Jersey (1891, in partnership with Ernest Greene).\nIn 1911, Stephenson was also responsible for an innovative design for Brewster & Co., automobile manufacturers' factory in Queen's. An article in Carriage Monthly described it: \"The new factory at Long Island City L.I., built especially for light and heavy carriage and automobile work, is of the most improved kind and will be a model for the next few generations.\" An American Architect article contended, \"The automobile factory of Brewster & Co. is an unprecedented proposition in factory construction.\" The building was particularly notable for its distinctive clocktower, which The AIA guide to New York City characterized as \"constructivist\" in style. A 2001 New York Times article went into further detail about the building and its plaza:\nThe architects Stephenson & Wheeler designed a 400,000-square-foot red brick factory, simple in style but with a high clock tower with sinuous tracery. The careful detailing of the clock tower set the building apart from other industrial buildings\u2014it seems to reflect the Secession style explored in factory and industrial architecture and public works in northern Europe around that time. The plaza originally was landscaped, but its sense of ceremonial space was destroyed by the later construction of elevated subway lines, which now completely dominate the area.\nThe Times article traces some of the building's history\u2014including the production of Rolls-Royce automobiles in the 1920s and 1930s and the building's acquisition and renovation by MetLife c. 2000. Since 2010, JetBlue's headquarters have occupied the building.\n",

    "2008 science fiction collection by Greg Egan\nDark Integers and Other Stories is a collection of five science-fiction short stories by Australian writer Greg Egan, published in 2008 by Subterranean Press. One of them, \"Oceanic\", won the Hugo Award for Best Novella, while two others were nominated.\nContents\nLuminous (1995)\nRiding the Crocodile (2005)\nDark Integers (2007)\nGlory (2007)\nOceanic (1998)\nBackground\n\"Luminous\" and \"Dark Integers\" are connected with each other. The events of the latter are set ten years after the events of the former. \"Riding the Crocodile\" is set in the same universe as Egan's novel Incandescence, but the short story is not part of it with the plot being set 300,000 years prior.\nReception\nReviews\nRich Horton, writing on the SF Site, gets the impression that \"this book serves as a good sampling, and as a sort of link between the old Egan and the new.\" He thinks that it \"makes sense to include both older and newer stories\", claiming that \"the new stories range from solid to excellent\", that \"the book at hand is strong work, and very welcome\" as well as that \"it only further whets the appetite for Egan's new novel, Incandescence.\" In further detail, Horton desribes \"Luminous\" as \"fascinating\" for its central premise, but says that \"it didn't quite sell this idea, and the thrillerish material wasn't convincingly integrated.\" Its sequel \"Dark Integers\" concerns \"not so much the idea, though that remains fascinatingly loopy, but the sad political reality that Egan derives from the underlying state of affairs.\" In \"Oceanic\", \"Egan succeeds again in marrying character with idea \u2013 perhaps in part because the central idea is more sociological than mathematical.\"\nWriting in Strange Horizons, Karen Burnham discussed suspension of disbelief in regard to multiple of Egan's short stories. Burnham indicated that \"Luminous\" and \"Dark Integers\" \"aren't necessarily Egan's best stories\" as they \"both rely heavily on their plots, with very little characterization\", and \"it's very hard to find a narrative toehold when the infodumping gets confusing\". However, she found that \"reading the introduction\" of Dark Integers and Other Stories makes \"them easier to read\". She explained, \"Then I knew that my feeling of disjointedness wasn't because I was stupid, but because the stories' conceit really was completely without basis in any real-world science or genre convention.\"\nSalik Shah claims in the Reactor Magazine, that the idea behind \"Luminous\" and \"Dark Integers\" \"would make an exciting premise for radio or film adaptation.\"\nRussell Letson, writing in the Locus Magazine, says that \"Oceanic\" \"edges into extreme post-human and/or far-future territory, but that story\u2019s armature is a kind of bildungsroman\" and \"is a whole novel\u2019s worth of material that remains background.\"\nAwards\nThe collection reached the 6th place in the Reader Poll of the Locus Award in 2009.\n\"Luminous\" was nominated in 1996 and \"Dark Integers\" was nominated in 2008 for the Hugo Award for Best Novelette. \"Oceanic\" won the Hugo Award for Best Novella in 1999. In 2001, \"Oceanic\", in 2003, \"Luminous\", and in 2010, \"Dark Integers\", all won the Japanese Seiun Award. \"Oceanic\" was also a finalist in the 1998 Aurealis Award for best science fiction short story, a long list nominee for the 1999 James Tiptree Jr Memorial Award, and a short-list nominee for the 1999 HOMer Award for best novella.\nSee also\n2008 in Australian literature\n",

    "Italian Alessandro Poerio-class scout cruiser\nAlessandro Poerio was an Italian scout cruiser, the lead ship of the Alessandro Poerio class. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1915, she served during World War I, participating in the Adriatic campaign, initially operating in the upper Adriatic Sea and later in the southern Adriatic. She took part in 66 operations during the war, often supporting raids by Italian motor torpedo boats. She was reclassified as a destroyer in 1921 due to her light displacement. Like her sister ships, Cesare Rossarol and Guglielmo Pepe, she was named after a famous Neapolitan light cavalryman who helped defend Venice from attacks by the Imperial Austrian Army during the revolutions in 1848.\nIn 1937, Fascist Italy sold the ship to the Nationalist faction in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Renamed Huesca, the ship subsequently served in the Spanish Navy until she was stricken in 1953.\nDesign\nAlessandro Poerio was an Italian \"light scout cruiser\" (Italian:esploratore leggero) measuring 85\u00a0m (278\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) long and 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) in beam. She had three Yarrow three-drum water-tube boilers with water pipes, two groups of Belluzzo steam turbines rated at 24,000\u00a0hp (17,897\u00a0kW), and two three-blade propellers. Her fuel capacity of 325 tons gave her a range of 2,400 nautical miles (4,400\u00a0km; 2,800\u00a0mi) at 13 knots (24\u00a0km/h; 15\u00a0mph). She could launch torpedoes while maintaining a constant speed of over 30 knots (56\u00a0km/h; 35\u00a0mph). Her normal displacement was 891 tons standard, and her full-load displacement was 1,270 tons.\nPlans originally called for Alessandro Poerio to have an armament of four 102/35\u00a0mm guns and eight 450-millimetre (17.7\u00a0in) torpedo tubes, but was revised during construction, and she entered service with six 102/35-millimetre guns and four 450-millimetre (17.7\u00a0in) torpedo tubes, and a minelaying capacity of 42 mines, making her armament equivalent to that of an Austro-Hungarian Novara-class scout cruiser. In 1917 two 40/39 mm guns were installed aboard her. In 1918, she was refitted with 102/45 mm guns.\nConstruction and commissioning\nAlessandro Poerio was laid down by Gio. Ansaldo & C. at Sestri Ponente, Italy, on 25\u00a0June\u00a01913. She was launched on 4\u00a0August\u00a01914 and commissioned on 25\u00a0May\u00a01915.\nService history\nRegia Marina\nWorld War I\n1915\u20131916\nWorld War I began in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23\u00a0May\u00a01915. Alessandro Poerio entered service two days after Italy declared war. On 30\u00a0December\u00a01915 she became part of the 2nd Scouting Group of the 4th Naval Division along with her sister ships Cesare Rossarol and Guglielmo Pepe, based at Venice.\nOn 1\u20132 November 1916, Alessandro Poerio, Guglielmo Pepe, and the destroyers Francesco Nullo, and Giuseppe Missori made ready to provide possible support to an incursion by MAS motor torpedo boats into the Fasana Channel on the southwest coast of Istria, a peninsula on the coast of Austria-Hungary.\nAn Austro-Hungarian Navy force consisting of the scout cruiser Helgoland and the destroyers Balaton, Csepel, Lika, Orjen, Tatra, and Triglav left Cattaro on 18\u00a0October\u00a01917 to attack Italian convoys. The Austro-Hungarians found no convoys, so Helgoland and Lika moved to within sight of Brindisi to entice Italian ships into chasing them and lure the Italians into an ambush by the Austro-Hungarian submarines U-32 and U-40. At 06:30 on 19\u00a0October\u00a01917,  Alessandro Poerio, Guglielmo Pepe, and the destroyers Insidioso, Pilade Bronzetti, and Simone Schiaffino got underway from Brindisi to pursue the Austro-Hungarians. The destroyers Ippolito Nievo and Rosolino Pilo and the British light cruiser HMS\u00a0Weymouth diverted from a voyage from Vlor\u00eb (known to the Italians as Valona) on the coast of the Principality of Albania to Brindisi to join the pursuit. After a long chase which also saw some Italian air attacks on the Austro-Hungarian ships, the Austro-Hungarians escaped and all the Italian ships returned to port without damage.\nOn 10\u00a0March\u00a01918, the destroyer Antonio Mosto, with the motor torpedo boat MAS\u00a0100 in tow, and Ippolito\u00a0Nievo, towing MAS\u00a099, set out for a raid on Portoro\u017e (known to the Italians as Portorose) on the coast of Austria-Hungary, supported by Alessandro\u00a0Poerio, Cesare\u00a0Rossarol, Pilade Bronzetti, the scout cruisers Augusto Riboty and Carlo Mirabello, the destroyer Giacinto Carini, and a French Navy destroyer squadron led by the destroyer Casque. Antonio\u00a0Mosto, Ippolito\u00a0Nievo, MAS\u00a099, and MAS\u00a0100 reached the vicinity of Portoro\u017e, but then had to postpone the operation due to bad weather. The ships attempted the raid again on 16\u00a0March, but adverse weather again forced its postponement. They made a third attempt on 8\u00a0April\u00a01918, but after aerial reconnaissance ascertained that the port of Portoro\u017e was empty, the Italians again called off the operation.\nOn 2\u00a0October\u00a01918 Alessandro\u00a0Poerio, Cesare\u00a0Rossarol,",
    "American politician and judge in Iowa (1821\u20131896)\nReuben Noble (April 14, 1821 \u2013 August 8, 1896) was an American politician and judge from Iowa.\nEarly life\nNoble was born on April 14, 1821, in Adams County, Mississippi, near Natchez. He worked on the family farm in Mississippi until 1833, when the Nobles moved to Jersey County, Illinois, due to his father's opposition to slavery, and started a new farm. Aged 18, Reuben Noble moved to the Quincy area to pursue education at a manual labor college run by David Nelson. He also began studying law with Edward H. Buckley. By 1842, Noble moved to Fair Play, Wisconsin, where he worked as a miner and lawyer. The following year, Noble settled in Garnavillo, Iowa. Noble married Harriett C. Douglas in 1844. He was active in the bar association of northeastern Iowa from 1850.\nEarly Whig and Republican political career\nPrior to 1850, Noble had served a single term as Clayton County district attorney, subsequently refusing to run for reelection. Noble was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives for District 2 in 1854, as a Free Soil Whig. During his single term in office, Noble additionally served as house speaker. Upon stepping down as a state representative, Noble moved his family to McGregor. After the Whig Party dissolved, Noble became a member of the succeeding Republican Party and was elected to its 1856 state convention in Iowa. He and Fitz Henry Warren were also considered as Republican electors in that year's presidential election, a position Noble refused.\nLater Democratic political activity, judgeship, and legal career\nThroughout Andrew Johnson's presidency, Noble supported him. In 1866, the same year he became the founding president of Iowa's Pioneer Lawmakers' Association, Noble accepted the Democratic Party's nomination to contest Iowa's 3rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives election in Iowa. Noble lost the election to Republican incumbent William B. Allison. Four years later, Noble was a Democratic candidate for the Iowa Supreme Court seat eventually assumed by James G. Day. Noble won consecutive terms as a district court judge in 1874 and 1878, but resigned shortly soon after winning his second term to privately practice law alongside Thomas Updegraff. Noble was again defeated in his 1879 bid for the Iowa Supreme Court. The Noble\u2013Updegraff legal partnership ended after Updegraff completed his second term in the United States House of Representatives, and thereafter, Noble worked as a lawyer for what became known as Milwaukee Road.\nDeath\nNoble died in McGregor, Iowa, on August 8, 1896.\n",
    "Electric multiple unit produced by Pesa Bydgoszcz in 2006\nPesa Acatus (Latin for boat) is a standard-gauge electric multiple unit produced in a single copy at the Pesa plant in Bydgoszcz in 2006, specifically for the Marshal's Office of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship. During test runs, it was a four-car unit (ED74 series, 16WE unit type, 310Ba+411Ba+411Bb+310Bb car type), and it is operated in a three-car configuration (ED59 series, 15WE type).\nThe design of the vehicle began in 2004, and a year later, it was offered in a tender and subsequently ordered. In April 2006, the production of the train was completed, and throughout that month, it underwent testing for approval for operation. On 29 May 2006, an official presentation of the unit took place in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, combined with an inaugural ride. In 2011, the unit was withdrawn and awaited overhaul, which was ultimately carried out from December 2013 to June 2014. In 2016, the technically functional vehicle was withdrawn due to the expiration of its approval for operation.\nIn 2007, a development version of the vehicle named Bydgostia was created. In 2010, the manufacturer also built the Acatus II model, and in 2014, the Acatus Plus family, but they are only related to Acatus by name.\nHistory\nOrigins\nAfter World War II, electric multiple units were produced until 1997 exclusively by Pafawag in Wroc\u0142aw. Pafawag was the manufacturer of the most popular electric multiple unit series in Poland, the EN57. After privatization in the 1990s, the plant ceased production of vehicles of this type, and the last produced unit was the ED73 in 1997. Polish State Railways then ended orders for new rolling stock, including electric multiple units.\nSince the late 1980s, Polish State Railways, and since the early 21st century also local governments, mainly purchased diesel railcars and diesel multiple units, as fuel-consuming locomotives dominated the operation of non-electrified lines. This allowed Polish manufacturers and carriers to gain experience in the production and operation of lightweight rolling stock. Additionally, existing electric multiple units of the EN57 series owned by Polish carriers were modernized.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, electric traction units from new manufacturers, such as Pesa Bydgoszcz, Newag, and Stadler, began to appear on Polish tracks. Pesa, after a deep restructuring in 1998, started producing railbuses in 2001, but in 2004, it also undertook the construction of the first electric multiple unit \u2013 the 13WE (EN95) for the Warsaw Commuter Railway, adapted to a 600 V DC. Despite plans to purchase 10 units of these vehicles, production was terminated after only one unit.\nIn 2005, the Marshal's Office of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship announced a tender for the delivery of a three-car electric multiple unit. Newag and Pesa participated in the tender, and ultimately, Pesa's proposal was considered the most advantageous. This was the first order for an electric multiple unit from Pesa adapted to a 3000 V DC.\nFulfillment of the order\nED74-01 during testing\nED59-01 at the InnoTrans fair in 2006\nOn 26 May 2005, a contract was signed for the delivery of the vehicle, which was to be completed by April 2006. Earlier, in 2004, work began on designing this unit. The task of developing a comprehensive concept for the unit was entrusted to the Marad Design studio. Marek Adamczewski, Jacek Po\u0107wiardowski, Jakub Go\u0142\u0119biewski, Mariusz Gorczy\u0144ski, and Barbara Kusz-Hallmann were involved in the train's design. On September 6, the design team received technical specifications from the manufacturer, which were clarified, specified, and supplemented over the following months. On 4 February 2005, conceptual designs were presented, from which Pesa selected one for further development in April. Documentation, visualizations, and drawings were then created, with this stage completed by August. In September, Marad Design and Pesa presented the results of their work to the client after negotiations, and they began creating the final project. Work on the design was completed in November 2005, with final interior equipment arrangements made in February 2006. The body frame was manufactured in Sanok by Autosan.\nAlthough a three-car unit was ordered, Pesa initially produced a four-car unit at its own expense. This was done to conduct tests related to the next order for four-car electric multiple units for Przewozy Regionalne and simultaneously reduce the costs of obtaining homologation for vehicles from both orders. During testing, the prototype four-car unit of type 16WE was designated ED74-01.\nOn 1 April 2006, the vehicle was completed, and its first trial run took place on the route from Bydgoszcz G\u0142\u00f3wna to Laskowice Pomorskie. On April 3, the vehicle reached a speed of 120 km/h on the same route, and two days later, the train traveled to the Railway Institute test track in W\u0119glewo near \u017bmigr\u00f3d. It arrived on April 7, and further homologation tests commenced. Tests combined with a presentation",
    "Infantry regiment of the Confederate States Army\nMilitary unit\nThe 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment was a unit of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. The 2nd Regiment was composed of volunteer companies from North Mississippi which were sent to join the Confederate forces in Virginia in the spring of 1861. As part of the Army of Northern Virginia, the 2nd Regiment fought in many of the most decisive battles of the Eastern theater of the American Civil War, suffering heavy casualties at Antietam and Gettysburg. \nFormation and First Battle of Bull Run\nThe volunteer companies of the 2nd Mississippi were assembled at Corinth in early May 1861, initially for state service, and then travelled to Virginia, arriving at Lynchburg on May 9 and mustering into Confederate service on May 10. William Clark Falkner, grandfather of the novelist William Faulkner, was elected as Colonel. The original strength of the regiment was 784 officers and men. Company L, the Liberty Guards, was formed in March 1862 as a supplemental company and joined the regiment in Virginia in April of that year.\nAs part of General Barnard Bee's brigade, the 2nd Mississippi fought at the First Battle of Bull Run in July. During this battle, the first major action of the war, the 2nd Regiment acted in support of a cavalry charge made by General J.E.B. Stuart, who wrote: \"Just after the cavalry charge our re-enforcements arrived upon the field and formed rapidly on right into line. The first was Colonel Falkner's regiment (Mississippians), whose gallantry came under my own observation\". Brigade commander General Bee was mortally wounded during the battle, and afterwards the 2nd was moved under General William H.C. Whiting's command. \n1862\nAfter spending the winter in camp, in April 1862 the 2nd Mississippi was moved to Yorktown, Virginia and reorganized, as the Regiment's initial one-year term of service had expired. The Regiment reenlisted for the remainder of the war and new officers were elected: John Marshall Stone was chosen as commander of the regiment, Falkner returned to Mississippi and later led a Partisan Ranger unit. \nThe 2nd fought at the Battle of Seven Pines, and then the Seven Days Battles near Richmond, Virginia, with General Evander M. Law commanding the brigade. At the Battle of Gaines' Mill, the 2nd Mississippi joined an advance alongside John Bell Hood's Texas Brigade that broke through the Union lines, resulting in a Confederate victory. General Whiting wrote: \"The Second Mississippi, Colonel J. M. Stone, was skillfully handled by its commander, and sustained severe loss\". The regiment then fought at the Second Battle of Bull Run, taking part in heavy fighting as part of Hood's division. \nSubsequently, the 2nd Mississippi fought at the Battle of Antietam in September, where they were engaged in some of the heaviest fighting on the bloodiest day of the war. Hood described the battle his troops were engaged in during his advance against the Federal lines: \"the two little giant brigades of this division wrestled with this mighty force, losing hundreds of their gallant officers and men but driving the enemy from his position and forcing him to abandon his guns on our left\". All of the field officers of the 2nd Mississippi were wounded in this battle, and the Regiment overall suffered 27 dead and 127 wounded at Antietam.\nGettysburg\nThe railroad cut northwest of Gettysburg.\nAfter Antietam, the 2nd Regiment was reassigned to General Joseph R. Davis's Mississippi brigade and took part in the Siege of Suffolk before moving north to Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg Campaign. On the opening day of the battle, the 2nd Mississippi was among the first Confederate troops to engage Union forces, coming into contact with General John Buford's cavalry along the Chambersburg Pike to the northwest of the town of Gettysburg. Both sides suffered heavy casualties in intense fighting, with the troops of the 2nd Mississippi clashing with the 147th New York. The commander of the 147th New York was killed before he could relay the order for his troops to retreat, so the Federals held their ground while the 2nd Mississippi inflicted massive casualties on them: the New Yorkers suffered a greater than 50% casualty rate in this engagement. After taking cover in a steep-sided railroad cut north of the Chambersburg Pike, the 2nd Regiment was battered by intense enfilade fire, and the Regiment was forced to surrender after an assault by troops of the 6th Wisconsin. Approximately 127 men and officers, amounting to about 25% of the 2nd Regiment's strength surrendered at the railroad cut.\nAnother detachment of the 2nd Mississippi was not captured, and joined Pickett's Charge on the last day of the battle. Of the approximately 60 troops of the 2nd who joined the charge, only one was not captured or wounded. Col. John M. Stone was wounded during the battle, Lt. Col. David W.

    "Fountain by Niels Skovgaard\nThe Hippocampus Well (Danish: Havhestebr\u00f8nden) is a fountain by Niels Skovgaard, carved in stone in the shape of a Hippocampus. Originally installed on Kultorvet in Copenhagen, it has now been moved to the central courtyard of the Danish Design Museum on Bredgade. A plaster model  is on display in Vejen Art Museum.\nHistory\nThe fountain photographed by Holger Damgaard on Kultorvet in 1923.\nThe fountain was created as Niels Skovgaard's submission to a competition for a new fountain on Vesterbros Torv in Copenhagen. Elijah's Church was inaugurated on the square in April  1906. At its meeting on 20 May 1908, Foreningen til Hovedstadens Forsk\u00f8nnelse decided to launch a competition for the design of a fountain for the \"new square\". The three other artists who were invited to participate in the competition were Rasmus Harboe, Hans Tegner and J. F. Willumsen. The deadline for submissions of their proposals were already in July the same year. Hans Tegner did not submit a proposal. Willumsens proposal was believed to require too much water. The board of the association did not have a clear favourite between Skovgaard's and Harboe's proposals. It was initially decided to install 1;1 models of both works on the square but Skovgaard was unable to meet the deadline and Harboe's proposal was therefore selected as the winner.\nThe architect Hans Henrik Koch had been strongly in favour of Skovgaard's proposal. In November 1910, at a board meeting in Fonden til Kunstneriske Formaals Fremme, he proposed that it should be installed in another location. It was ultimately decided to install it on Kultorvet. It was unveiled in August 1916. The greenish stone from Norway soon turned out to be badly affected by the weather. In 1923 the fountain was therefore moved to a more protected location in the courtyard of the Danish Museum of Arts & Crafts.\n\nOther versions\nDetail of one of the plaster models in Vejen Art Museum.\nA plaster model from 1908 was acquired by the Ny Carlsberg Foundation in 1943. It is in the collection of Sor\u00f8 Art Museum.\nA 1:1 plaster model was put on storage in  Christiansborg Palace. In 1996, the severely damaged model was transferred to Vejen Art Museum. It was subsequently restored and is now on display in the museum's Skibbelund Hall. Om April 2004, Bejen Kunstmuseum bought another plaster model of the work (19.2 \u00d7 18.8 \u00d7 28.2\u00a0cm) at auction. A stoneware version is located in a private garden.\n",

    "\nL\u00e9on Lacombe (12 April 1885 \u2013 5 April 1913) was a French anarchist, criminal and murderer. After being arrested in March 1913 for the murder of an anarchist newspaper editor, he was incarcerated at La Sant\u00e9 Prison in Paris after confessing to two additional murders, being charged with a total of four counts of murder. The following month, Lacombe committed suicide by diving off the prison roof.\nLife\nLacombe was born on 12 April 1885, in Aubin, Aveyron, to Victor Lacombe and Marie-Jos\u00e9phine Cibi\u00e9, a coal sorter who raised him as a single mother. Lacombe began working in the coal mines as a 12-year-old and later underwent military service, after which he moved to Decazeville, working at a mine in C\u00e9rons. Lacombe began taking interest to anarchism and started participating in anarchist gatherings in the area. Afterwards, Lacombe was fired from the mine in C\u00e9rons resulted by accusations of theft. Engineer Albert Artous, the man who fired him, was fatally shot in his home on January 12, 1912. The perpetrator was suspected to be Lacombe, who, due to being an anarchist, struggled to find another job. After moving and finding work in Paris, he began burglarizing and shooting people, including a station dispatcher at Les Aubrais station on September 14, 1912. On November 9, he reportedly fatally shot a man at a post office in Bezons during a burglary. As he became sought by authorities, Lacombe began suspecting a bookstore seller of being an informant, and shot him at his home during the night of December 5, 1912.\nArrest\nLacombe was sought after by French authorities since December 1911. While on the run, he crossed in and out of the border to Belgium, and continued to evade authorities until being arrested by detectives on March 11, 1913, during a street fair on Boulevard de la Vilette in Paris. He was noticed by detectives for his distinctive heart tattoo on his right hand. While being subdued by authorities, Lacombe made an unsuccessful attempt to reach for his coat pocket. Authorities later found that he had been in possession of dynamite, two revolvers loaded with ammunition, and two fuzes. As Lacombe was escorted to the police station, a mob tried to physically attack him.\nLacombe had been further sought after for a three-month period for the murder of M. Ducret, an anarchist newspaper editor of L'Idee Libre. During interrogations, Lacombe confessed to murdering Ducret. He additionally made confessions for the murder of a Bezons postmaster as well as the murder of a Fleury-les-Aubrais railroad worker. According to Lacombe, he \"suspected Ducret ... of trying to betray him.\" In total, he received four murder charges. While he was incarcerated at La Sant\u00e9 Prison, prison officers took extra steps in monitoring Lacombe. He was expected to be executed by guillotine.\nSuicide\nOn the morning of April 5, 1913, while in the prison courtyard, Lacombe quickly moved to climb a nearby ladder that provided access to the roof, which he was already on by the time officers could get to him. Standing on the edge of the roof, Lacombe made threats of jumping off towards the pursuing officers. Magistrate M. Drioux attempted to convince Lacombe to surrender himself, which he replied, \"It is too late. I have finished. I killed Ducret because he was a spy. I was at Bezons and shot the postmaster in self-defence, but I am innocent of any other murder.\" Lacombe, becoming adamant on his decision to take his own life, rejected negotiations by the warden. He spoke to Georges Boucheron, his lawyer, and began crying as he requested Boucheron to take care of his mother and grandmother. Lacombe continued to speak, \"I began to beg when I was seven years old. I tried to work, but fate followed me.\" His decision to jump from the roof was set for 11:30, saying, \"At half-past eleven all will be finished.\" He then gave a salute, shouting, \"It is the moment. Tell my mother that my last thought was of her. Farewell!\" Lacombe then committed suicide by diving off the roof.\n",

    "Spanish footballer\nGuillermo Villagr\u00e1 Azcona (7 June 1907 \u2013 18 February 1970) was a Spanish footballer who played as a defender for Arenas de Getxo, Valencia CF, and Levante UD. He later became a manager, taking charge of Levante UD.\nPlaying career\nGuillermo Villagr\u00e1 was born in Buenos Aires on 7 June 1907, as the son of Spanish immigrants who, while he was still young, returned to the Basque Country. He began his football career at Barakaldo CF, and from there he made the jump to Sporting de Gij\u00f3n, then a Segunda Divisi\u00f3n team, where he played as a left midfielder, and participated in 17 games in the 1930\u201331 season and nine in the Regional Championship of Asturias in 1931\u201332. That season, just before the start of La Liga, he signed for Arenas de Getxo in the First Division, where he stayed for two years, in which he played 18 games and scored two goals.\nIn 1933, Villagr\u00e1 signed for Valencia CF, thus becoming the first Argentine player to do so. Like any good Argentine, Villagr\u00e1 was an intense and aggressive player, who took contact to the limit. He had a tremendous physical capacity, following the ball all over the field, recovering balls tirelessly, and at times it seemed like he was going to keep running even after the final whistle. He was also very versatile, and in fact, he became an all-rounder in his first two seasons, being able to play both as a winger and as a defender.\nAlthough he had few appearances, only 15 official matches in the first two years, he played a crucial role in helping Valencia reach its first Copa del Rey final in 1934, as he scored a second-half brace in the second leg of the semifinals against Real Oviedo in the Buenavista which put his side in the final against Real Madrid in Montju\u00efc on 6 May 1934, which he started in a 1\u20132 loss. He also won two Regional Championship of Valencia\u00a0 in 1934 and 1937.\nThe outbreak of the Spanish Civil War cut off his progress at Valencia. In total, he scored 2 goals in 45 league matches for Arenas and Valencia. Following the end of the war in 1939, Villagr\u00e1 opted to join the UDLG (Levante-Gim\u00e1tico merger), where he formed a defensive partnership with Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Nieto and where he retired in 1942, at the age of 35.\nManagerial career\nAfter his career as a player ended, Villagr\u00e1 remained linked to Levante UD, now as a coach, which he oversaw in two stages (1946\u201348 and 1951\u201352), the latter being an emergency solution during the 1951\u201352 academic year and ending in relegation to the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. He later coached UD Alzira for one season in 1959\u201360.\nDeath\nVillagr\u00e1 died in Valencia on 18 February 1970, at the age of 62.\nHonours\nValencia CF\nCopa del Rey:\nRunner-up (1) 1934\nValencia Championship:\nWinners (2) 1934 and 1937\n",

Born in Avdella, he became hegumen and archimandrite in Mount Athos, where he was known as \"Averchie the Vlach\" (Greek: \u0391\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bf \u03b2\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, romanized:\u00a0Av\u00e9rkios o Vl\u00e1chos).\nAverchie was sent to Romania in 1860, where he established contact with several intellectual and political figures. He was the head teacher of a school in Bucharest for Aromanian children whom he and Ioan D. Caragiani had recruited and taken to Romania in 1865 to be educated and become teachers of the first Romanian schools for Aromanians. Averchie is considered a relevant figure of the early Romanian-backed Aromanian national movement.\nBiography\nArchimandrite Averchie and his first ten students. Picture featured in Albumul macedo-rom\u00e2n in 1880.\nAverchie (or Averkios) was born in the Aromanian village of Avdella (Aromanian: Avdhela), then in the Ottoman Empire and now in Greece. Born either in 1806 or 1818, his date of birth is controversial among researchers. His secular name was Atanasie Iaciu Buda. Atanasie's father was celnic Iani Iaciu Buda, who was mayor of Avdella during the times of Ali Pasha of Ioannina. His mother was Anastasia (\"Tasa\") and he had two sisters, Mari\u021ba (born 1803) and \u0218anea (born 1805). He also had an adoptive sister, Gheorgana, whom his parents adopted at the age of four, before the birth of any of the three other siblings. She was married to a man named Panaioti at a young age. Atanasie's nephew Ioan \u0218omu Tomescu was a teacher who wrote an account on the life of Averchie published in 1929 by the Aromanian historian Victor Papacostea.\nAtanasie was orphaned by his father at a relatively young age, and after completing his education, he became a monk on Mount Athos, first at the Agiou Pavlou Monastery and then at the Monastery of Iviron. Becoming hegumen and archimandrite, Averchie was known in Mount Athos as \"Averchie the Vlach\" (Greek: \u0391\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bf \u03b2\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, romanized:\u00a0Av\u00e9rkios o Vl\u00e1chos; \"Vlach\" being a name of the Greeks for the Aromanians). In the Iviron Monastery he met the Romanian general and politician Christian Tell. When asked by Tell E\u0219ti rom\u00e2n, p\u0103rinte? (\"Are you a Romanian, father?\"), Averchie answered Da, escu arm\u00e2n (\"Yes, I am an Aromanian\"). He is also recorded as having exclaimed \u0218i eu hiu arm\u00e2n (\"I am an Aromanian too\") in 1862 during a military ceremony in Bucharest in Romania which emotionally moved him.\nIn 1860, Averchie was sent to Romania to settle the Iviron Monastery's disputes with the Romanian government regarding the lands of the monastic estates. There, he created contacts with important Romanian intellectual and political figures, including Cezar Bolliac, Dimitrie Bolintineanu, C. A. Rosetti, Dimitrie Cozacovici and even Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza himself. In 1865, 20,000 Romanian lei were allocated for the establishment of a boarding school in Bucharest for Aromanian children from the Ottoman Empire, which functioned at the monastery of the Church of the Holy Apostles. Together with Romanian Aromanian folklorist and translator Ioan D. Caragiani, Averchie recruited that same year ten children from Aromanian villages of the Pindus mountains, including some from his native Avdella, and took them to Bucharest to be educated at the school and return later as teachers of the first Romanian schools for Aromanians. Averchie was the head teacher of the school for years, and was later accused of misusing money. The school would end up being disestablished, after which Averchie retired to the Radu Vod\u0103 Monastery in Bucharest, where he remained until 1875. He then returned to his home region, retiring to a monastery in the village of Grizano, where he spent the last moments of his life.\nDespa I. \u0218omu Tomescu, daughter of \u0218omu Tomescu and grandniece of Averchie, gave an account on the death of Averchie based on what she had heard from her father and grandmother. According to her, Averchie would have died poisoned by Greek monks around February (she did not know of which year) after confessing a dying woman of a Greek family in the monastery in Grizano. Romanian Aromanian biographer and essayist Sterie Diamandi stated that \"we do not know to what extent this version corresponds to reality\" and lamented the fact that the date and details of the death of a prominent figure like Averchie were not known. Today, Averchie, together with Apostol M\u0103rg\u0103rit, are seen as some of the first and most important figures of the Aromanian national movement that was supported and promoted by Romania. Romanian researchers Anca Tana\u0219oca and Nicolae \u0218erban Tana\u0219oca defined both figures as \"the founders and organizers of the network of Romanian sc",

    "American musical effects manufacturer\nFulltone USA Inc. is an American manufacturer of effects pedals for the electric guitar.  Founded by Michael Fuller in California in 1991, Fulltone was one of the first \"boutique\" pedal companies and became best-known for its overdrive pedals, the Full-Drive and OCD, with the latter dubbed by Music Radar \"one of the most legendary overdrives ever made.\"\nHistory\nEarly pedals\nFulltone found success in the 1990s, largely through print marketing, with the popularity of the brand's Full-Drive line of overdrive pedals.  Fuller continued to expand his company's lineup, adding new overdrives like the Plimsoul and the Clyde wah pedal.\nThe Fulltone OCD\nIn 2004, Fulltone released the OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Drive), which was designed by Fuller as \"an open-sounding distortion pedal with decent headroom to more faithfully emulate a driven tube amp,\" with a circuit similar to the earlier Voodoo Labs Overdrive, itself a variation of the Ibanez Tubescreamer.  An op amp-based pedal, the OCD has gone through multiple iterations, with changes from versions 1.1 to 1.7 being generally subtle alterations of the pedal's EQ response.  Version 2 brought more noticeable changes, with a new output buffer, a 2N5457 JFET transistor input stage, and the option to use a new type of switching, enhanced bypass, instead of true bypass.\nAfter the first iteration, the drive pot's value was increased for a more \"dramatic\" distortion, and an asymmetric 1N34 germanium diode was later added to shift the character of the clipping.  The OCD features an HP/LP toggle switch\u2014standing for high-peak/low-peak but often incorrectly assumed to mean high-pass/low-pass.  HP mode adds distortion and presence, as well as a more pointed midrange, while LP mode maintains your amp's character.\nControversy\nFuller made headlines in 2020 when he made several controversial comments on social media during the George Floyd protests.  In a June 2 post, he stated, \"What is this like night 4 of looting with 100% impunity.  The pussy Mayor and Governor don't give a shit about small businesses, and it's never been more clear.\"  In response to criticism, Fuller added, \"Ahh I feel better, and flushed out some prissy boys who were raised to pee sitting down. Now I'll delete.\"  Fuller deleted the posts but in an email to a customer who characterized Fuller's comments as \"valuing storefronts over police brutality,\" Fuller replied:\nI am begging you to sell your pedals because you actually don\u2019t deserve them.  You are actually so racist that you believe the Good people who are protesting are the same as the Organized gang banger criminals who are looting 'store fronts'.\nThose 'store fronts' are good hardworking people's lives and livelihoods. I'm  fact if I see you with a Fulltone pedal I will tag it and break into your house and loot it from you, because its my free expression to do so... right?\nFuller's comments resulted in industry backlash.  Guitar Center announced it would no longer sell Fulltone products in-store or online, while Reverb.com suspended sales of all new and B-stock Fulltone pedals.  Artists like Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 pledged to sell their Fulltone gear and Jason Isbell called Fulltone pedals \"overpriced junk\" while recommending a black-owned pedal company.  The brand's own fan page also condemned the comments.\nFuller subsequently apologized, stating people were \"rightfully pissed off\" at his comments as a \"privileged white guy.\"  He stated his comments were not made at the \"good people\" protesting but rather at the mayor and governor for allowing them to be unfairly arrested while criminals took advantage of the protests to loot stores.  He later deleted his apology.\nClosing\nAfter 30 years, the company closed its Culver City production shop in 2022, with Fuller stating that making products entirely in the United States was no longer profitable.  Prices for used Fulltone pedals increased dramatically as a result\u2014as much as 500%. Josh Scott, founder of JHS Pedals, cited Fulltone's closing as the end of the boutique pedal era: \"I think that Fulltone signifies the ending of this era. There\u2019s really nothing left.\"  Despite the factory closing, Fuller stated his intention to continue making pedals in smaller quantities to protect his trademarks and patents.\nRelaunch\nFulltone relaunched in partnership with Jackson Audio in 2024, with a new facility in Nashville, Tennessee.  Fuller will continue developing products, while Jackson Audio handles manufacturing and distribution.\n",

    "Geographical area in Lombardy, Italy\nGeographical area in Lombardy, Italy\nThe Cremasque Territory (Cremish Lombard: Teretore crem\u00e0sch, Italian: Territorio cremasco) is a geographical area located in the Lombardy, corresponding to the northern part of the Province of Cremona, of which it represents the most industrialized and densely inhabited area. Its main center is the city of Crema and currently constitutes one of the 4 employment districts into which the province of Cremona is divided.\nHistory\nThe identity of the Cremasque territory and its inhabitants has been formed and consolidated around the city of Crema in the course of a centuries-old history, full of significant and lasting events that have distinguished and characterized this particular geographical area in a specific way.\nThe first documentary quotes of the locality of Crema date back to the 11th century and, since 1084, it is constantly defined as castrum Crem\u00e6, that is, a castle or a village protected by a belt of walls. If the historical certification of Crema is relatively late, its development as a center of attraction and power in the Fulcheria Island, the territory with ill-defined borders that surrounded it and to which is well attached the name of \"island\" because it is enclosed between the Adda and Serio rivers whose course widened into large swamps, called Lake Gerundo. The first written testimony of the name Insula Fulch\u00e9ria (or Insula Fulch\u00e9rii) dates back to February 1040, when the bishop of Cremona Ubaldo went to the court of Emperor Henry III to submit to him a document that would have granted the Cremonese diocese the districtio on the Insula Fulcherii at the expense of Boniface III of Canossa, margrave of Tuscany, who held it for feudal investiture.\nSince this date, Cremona's interest in Crema and the Fulcheria Island is evident. Located close to the risorgive line, in a dominant position with respect to the waterways and land, at the intersection of the main north\u2013south and east\u2013west communication lines (Bergamo-Piacenza, Milan-Cremona, Brescia-Pavia), Crema and the Cremasque territory were a territory \"in formation\", strategically important although still unsustirable and unsuitable for cultivation because mostly covered by woods and above all by swamps and marshes, heritage of an ancient sea or Lake Gerundo and constantly fed by the numerous fountains. Water was therefore the characteristic element of the whole area, enclosed and intersected by important rivers (Adda, Tormo, Serio and Oglio) and frequently subject to their violent floods if not even bed variations. It is not excluded that a spontaneous or artificial change of the bed of Serio, bringing it very close to the nascent city of Crema, together with the intense reclamations started in that eleventh century, have contributed to stimulating the expansionist aims of the much more powerful nearby cities (Milan and Cremona in particular) in a period in which there is a general degradation of the feudal institutes and the Curtense economy alongside the re-flowering and repopulation of the cities and the strengthening within them of the new grades dedicated to craftsmanship and commerce, that city bourgeoisie that, organized in influential arts and crafts guilds, will obtain increasingly relevant political and economic powers until it achieves effective independence from the feudal \"lord\" and imposes the new municipal structures.\nIn 1335 Crema and its territory were annexed to the Duchy of Milan.\nStarting in 1449, the Cremasque territory became part of the Republic of Venice, constituting a quasi-exclave included in the Duchy of Milan; a fortified and manned road, called \"la Steccata\" connected it to the Bergamo territory between Castel Gabbiano and Sola.\nThe Diocese of Crema was erected in 1580. Its borders coincide with those of the ancient Cremasque territory formed in the 11th to 12th centuries as a free municipality of Crema. In the Venetian period the representation of the Territory was entrusted to a council composed of a representative per municipality, who elected four mayors, one per door, who was entrusted with the provincial government. By the mid-eighteenth century, only the 28 main municipalities had retained the right to elect their own territorial councilor.\nFor a short period (from March 28, 1797, to July 10, 1797) Crema was the capital of the Republic of Crema, which was then dissolved and aggregated to the Cisalpine Republic.\nAfter the Congress of Vienna this territory passed to the Austrian Empire who created the Kingdom of Lombard-Venetia. Crema and the territory became part of the province of Lodi and Crema, one of the 9 Lombard Provinces of the Government of Lombardy.\nWith the beginning of the Kingdom of Italy, the Cremasque territory, on request sent to the King and the government by eminent Cremasque personalities, became part of the Province of Cremona, a traditionally enemy city of Crema.\nThe territory has its own dialect, the Cremish dialect.",

He then worked as an electrical engineer in Athens, but also studied mathematics and received in 1968 a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago. There in 1971 he received his Ph.D. with thesis On the best values of the constants in the theorems of M. Riesz, Zygmund and Kolmogorov written under the supervision of Antoni Zygmund. In 1972 Pichorides returned to Athens and worked at the National Centre of Scientific Research \"Demokritos\", where he was employed until 1983, with interruptions by leave of absence. He was from 1974 to 1979 an  attach\u00e9 de recherch\u00e9 of the CNRS in Orsay, a visiting professor from 1979 to 1980 at the Paris-Sud University in Orsay, and from 1980 to 1981 a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He organized, with Nicholas Petridis and Nicholas Varopoulos, a successful conference on harmonic analysis in Iraklion in 1978. From 1983 until his death in 1992, Pichorides was a professor at the University of Crete's mathematics department, which he co-founded. He held visiting professorships at Paris-Sud University in Orsay, Caltech, and the University of Chicago. For the academic year 1991\u20131992 he was a visiting professor at the University of Cyprus. He had short stays at the Mittag-Leffler Institute, the University of Cambridge, Brown University, and the University of Chicago. He died unexpectedly while attending a conference in Spain in 1992.\nPichorides is known for results on inequalities in the theory of Fourier series. In 1980 he received the Salem Prize for his research on Littlewood's conjecture on a lower bound for averaged exponential sums.

    "4th tallest building in Cleveland, Ohio\nThe Sherwin-Williams Headquarters is a 36-story office tower under construction in Downtown Cleveland, Ohio. At 616\u00a0ft (188\u00a0m), it is the 4th tallest building in Cleveland, and the 6th tallest building in Ohio. When completed, it will be the global headquarters of Sherwin-Williams, the largest paint and coating company in the world. The headquarters complex faces Public Square and covers portions of three city blocks. The complex includes the primary tower, a parking garage, and a pavilion, with hints of possible future expansion within the remainder of the lots.\nHistory\nSherwin-Williams was founded in Cleveland, Ohio in 1866. Since 1930, the company has been headquartered in the Midland Building, which is part of the larger Landmark Office Towers Complex. In 2019, the company announced that it was seeking to move into a larger office building, potentially leaving Cleveland altogether, although they confirmed they would be staying in Cleveland in February 2020. In March 2020, the company paid $49.4 million for the 7 acre plot of land for the building, which was previously a 1,100 space parking lot.\nIn late 2022, the final design of the building was submitted to the city. Construction of the building began in 2022, with site preparation and foundation construction, both of which were completed in 2023. In 2023, the structural steel construction began and finished, as well as the building enclosure and interior finishes, with the enclosure having finished in 2024. Interior finishing are expected to continue until early 2025. In 2024, the final details and landscaping for the building are also expected to continue into 2025. Occupancy by employees is expected in late 2024.\nThe possibility of an HQ2 has been mentioned since the design phase of the building in 2021, which would be a building adjacent to the current tower within the same lot, as job growth within the company will put the new headquarters at full capacity as soon as it is completed, at the intended 3,500 employees. Surface parking lots were intentionally left in the plans of the headquarters for future development of a Phase Two.\nDesign\nThe headquarters contains about 1 million square footage, and contains three buildings, including the primary 36-story tower, a two-story pavilion, and a 5-story parking garage. The main tower is facing W 3rd Street, while the parking garage is located on the other side of Frankfort Avenue connected via a skybridge, while there is a skybridge connecting the tower to the pavilion on the other side of the W 3rd Street. The two empty surface parking lots that remained in the plans for a potential Phase Two are within the same lots as the tower and the parking garage.\nThe design of the tower is largely glass, with the Sherwin-Williams name being located near the top of the building on both the east and west sides.

The first three floors of the building consists of the lobby and other non-office amenities. Floors 5-13 are to contain office space, and floor 14 is to contain conference rooms and terraces. The parking garage of the building contains space for a retailer, and the wall facing Frankfort Avenue is to contain anthology wall, as well as public art facing other streets. Frankfort Avenue, the street between the tower and the garage, is to be repaved with a herringbone pattern consisting of three colors, with the addition of a bike lane and bike racks.\nThe pavilion of the tower, located across the street, takes up an entire city block, although the two story pavilion building only takes up part of the lot, with the rest of the lot acting as a public plaza with lots of green landscaping. The pavilion building is to contain large glass windows visible from every side, and contains a lobby. The plaza of the pavilion contains a purple-pink color garden, a rainbow walkway alongside the pavilion building and main tower, and various trees, with dozens of species of flowers and trees within the plaza and around the headquarters complex as a whole. The lawn in the plaza is to contain a large sign saying Sherwin-Williams Global Headquarters. Additionally, various colorful directional signs for both pedestrians and vehicles will be placed around the campus.\nSee also\nList of tallest buildings in Cleveland\nList of tallest buildings in Ohio\nList of largest office buildings\n",
    "American slave trader (~1799\u20131841)\nWashington Robey (c.\u20091799\u00a0\u2013 January 1, 1841), sometimes Washington Robie, was an American tavern keeper, livery stable operator, slave trader, and slave jail proprietor in early 19th-century Washington City, District of Columbia.\nLife and work\nThe federal district in 1835, before Alexandria was retroceded to Virginia, showing Alexandria County and Washington County, and Washington City and Georgetown within Washington County\n\"CASH! CASH! CASH!\" Daily National Intelligencer and Washington Express, December 16, 1829\nRobey's 7th and 9th Street taverns and slave jails were pictured on this 1836 map produced by the American Anti-Slavery Society; the 7th Street property is listed as Neal's Jail\nView of Washington in 1852, showing Maryland Avenue between the U.S. Capitol and the Potomac River\nCentre Market, also known as the Seventh Street Market, photographed during the American Civil War\nRobey was deemed a \"resident of this city\" by the Washington Gazette at the time of his wedding to Miss Sarah Talbot in 1823. He was in the slave trade by 1825, as in fall of that year he advertised in the Washington Intelligencer that he sought \"to purchase from fifteen to twenty likely young NEGROES of both sexes from fifteen to twenty-five years of age for which the highest price will be given in cash.\" In 1829 he was located on 9th Street and again offering \"CASH! CASH! CASH\" for \"Negroes of both sexes, between twelve and twenty-five.\" Robey's ads were known to catch the attention of overseas visitors to the capital. For example, a Bristol, England newspaper reported in October 1830, \"Liberty! \u2014 The John Bull of Sunday says \u2014 \u201c Who would not he a republican\u00a0?\u2014 who that could be free would have a King\u00a0? \u2014 Read the following specimen of liberty in that glorious republic America\u00a0: one Mr Washington Robey advertises in the Washington Daily National Intelligencer thus \u2014 'Cash\u00a0! Cash\u00a0! Cash\u00a0! The advertiser will give the highest prices for likely young negroes of both sexes from twelve to twenty-five rears of age\u2019 In the same Paper there are two other advertisements offering \u2018 Cash for likely young negroes\u2019 \u2014 Vive la Liberte!\" Similarly, in 1832 a Welsh newspaper reprinted several slave-trade ads from the Washington Intelligencer, including one by Jilson Dove and one of Robey's, and commented that they would be read with \"astonishment and disgust.\"\nTogether with Williams brothers' Yellow House, and the slave jail of Franklin & Armfield in Alexandria, District of Columbia, the national capital of the United States was one of the busiest and most prominent slave-trading hubs in the country by the 1830s. These two, along with \"McCandless's tavern in Georgetown,\" were considered \"notorious.\" Robey's pen was located at one time on the east side of 7th Street near the intersection with Maryland Avenue. This tavern offered jail facilities to enslavers and other traders, including Joseph W. Neal. This location was apparently conveniently sited between the market house and the steamboat wharf.\nTrader Robert W. Fenwick was working out of Robey's first tavern at the beginning of the 1830s (\"Look Here!\" Daily National Intelligencer and Washington Express, November 7, 1831)\nRobey's jail was visited in 1833 or 1834 by a British traveler named E. S. Abdy, who later described it in his book about the United States:\nOne day I went to see the 'slaves' pen'\u2014 a wretched hovel, right against the Capitol, from which it is distant about half a mile, with no house intervening. The outside alone is accessible to the eye of a visitor; what passes within being reserved for the exclusive observation of its owner, (a man of the name of Robey,) and his unfortunate victims. It is surrounded by a wooden paling fourteen or fifteen feet in height, with the posts outside to prevent escape, and separated from the building by a space too narrow to admit of a free circulation of air. At a small window above, which was unglazed and exposed alike to the heat of summer and the cool of winter...two or three sable faces appeared, looking out wistfully, to while away the time and catch a refreshing breeze; the weather being extremely hot.\nRobey's tavern is listed in the 1834 Washington City directory. According to Frederic Bancroft in Slave-Trading in the Old South, \"The Washington Directory of 1834 indicates the ownership and location of the tavern as follows: 'Robey  Washington, Tavern, e side 7 w, btw B and Cb' . As Md. ave. cuts off part of the block north of C st., the Directory to that extent is inexplicit.\"\nIn September 1833, a man named Robert Thomas petitioned the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of habeas corpus as he claimed he was legally free and \"entitled to his freedom & is unlawfully held in confinement\" in the jail of Washington Robey. Similarly, in February 1834, Rebecca Hobbs, petitioning the same court, \"represents that she is illegally detained in confinement by a certain Thomas Magruder a negro tra",
    "Irish presbyterian minister\nJames Kirkpatrick (died 1743) was an Irish Presbyterian minister.\nBiography\nKirkpatrick was the son of Hugh Kirkpatrick, who was minister successively of Lurgan, co. Armagh, Ireland, Dalry and Old Cumnock in Scotland, and Ballymoney, co. Armagh (where he died in 1712). He was probably born in Scotland while his father was minister there. In February 1691 he matriculated from the university of Glasgow, and in February 1694 his name appears in the university list of students in theology. On 7 August (probably) 1699 he was ordained as minister of the congregation of Templepatrick, co. Antrim. The well-known \u2018Belfast Society,\u2019 which exercised an important influence on the ecclesiastical affairs of the north of Ireland, was founded in 1705, and Kirkpatrick was one of its earliest and most influential members. In 1706 he resigned his charge at Templepatrick on receiving an invitation from the presbyterian congregation in Belfast to take the place of their minister, John McBride, who had been obliged to retire to Scotland owing to his non-abjuring opinions. Soon afterwards the congregation divided on account of its numbers, and he became minister of the second congregation, a new meeting-house having been built close to the first. In 1712 he was elected moderator of the synod of Ulster. In 1720 he came prominently into notice as one of the leaders of the non-subscribing party in the north of Ireland. In 1725 he was placed with the other non-subscribers in the presbytery of Antrim, which the synod in 1726 excluded from its judicatories. In his later days he took the degree of M.D., and combined the practice of a physician with the work of a clergyman. He is said to have died suddenly in Dublin, where he had gone on business with his wife. The date of his death is usually given as 1744, but a notice by James Blow, prefixed to Kirkpatrick's posthumous \u2018Defence of Christian Liberty,\u2019 shows that he died in 1743. A copy of his portrait is in the vestry of the first presbyterian church in Belfast.\nKirkpatrick is best known by his \u2018Historical Essay upon the Loyalty of Presbyterians in Great-Britain and Ireland from the Reformation to this present year 1713, &c.\u2019 (4to, pp. xv, 564, and index of ten pages, no place or printer's name, 1713), a work undertaken to meet the desire of the general synod to possess a history of their church, and specially called for by the persistent attacks of Tisdall, vicar of Belfast, on the presbyterian body. It preserves many valuable facts and documents, and gives a good idea of the state of public sentiment in Ireland in the days of Queen Anne. It was published anonymously. Kirkpatrick also wrote: \n\u2018A Vindication of the Presbyterian Ministers in the North of Ireland, subscribers and non-subscribers, from many gross and groundless aspersions cast upon them in a late scandalous libel entitled \u201cAn Account of the Mind of the Synod,\u201d\u2019 Belfast, 1721, 8vo (anon.; by \u2018A Lover of Truth and Peace\u2019).\n\u2018A Scripture Plea against a fatal rupture and breach of Christian Communion amongst the Presbyterians in the North of Ireland,\u2019 Belfast, 1724, 8vo.\n\u2018An Essay upon the Important Question whether there is a Legislative Proper Authority in the Church,\u2019 Belfast, 1731, 8vo (anon.; by several hands, probably edited by Kirkpatrick).\n\u2018An Account of the Success of Mrs. Stephens's Medicines for the Stone; in the case of James Kirkpatrick, Doctor of Divinity, M.D., &c.,\u2019 Belfast, 1739, 8vo.\n\u2018A Defence of Christian Liberty, by a Member of the General Synod,\u2019 Belfast, 1743, 4to (unfinished).\n",

    "Municipal building in Boston, Lincolnshire, England\nThe Municipal Buildings are in West Street, Boston, a town in Lincolnshire, in England. The complex accommodates the offices and meeting place of Boston Borough Council.\nHistory\nThe first municipal building in Boston was the guildhall which was completed in 1390. In the early 19th century, the fish market at the centre of the Exchange Buildings in the Market Place was converted for municipal use and subsequently became the offices of Boston Corporation, which was duly reformed in 1836 in accordance with the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. In the late 19th century, civic leaders decided to commission more substantial premises. The site they selected was on the south side of West Street.\nThe new building was designed by James Rowell in the Edwardian Baroque style, built in red brick with terracotta dressings and was officially opened by the mayor, Alderman Joseph Cooke, in 1904. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of 10 bays facing onto West Street. The first bay on the left featured a large opening with voussoirs and a keystone which originally led to the main foyer. There were doorways in the third and seventh bays and access for the fire engine in the eighth and ninth bays. The fourth bay contained a semi-circular balcony on the first floor. The whole building was fenestrated by windows of differing style but with banded surrounds. The second, fourth, sixth, eighth and tenth bays were all surmounted by stepped gables. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber, with ornate stained glass windows, the offices for the council officers, the offices for the local police service and garaging for the fire engines.\nThe whole complex was dedicated to municipal use after both the fire service and the police service relocated to Lincoln Lane. It continued to serve as the headquarters of the borough council for much of the 20th century and remained the meeting place for the enlarged Boston Borough Council which was formed in 1974. The building also continued to serve as the local registration office with a ceremony room available for weddings and civil partnership ceremonies.\n",
    "\nIlias Mavromichalis or Bezande-Ilias (1795 - 1822) was a fighter of the Greek Revolution of 1821 and scion of the historic family of Mavromichali. He went down in history as the \"Fairyborn\" chieftain due to his beauty - which according to popular tradition he inherited from his grandmother (daughter of the Doge of Venice, Francesco Morosini).\nAlso known by the nickname \"Bezande\" (beyizade, son of the bey in Turkish) to distinguish him from his cousin of the same name, who was nicknamed Katsakos. His self-sacrifice at Styra in Euboea, on January 12, 1822, had all the characteristics of the heroic death of an ancient Spartan warrior. It was the first loss of a high-ranking member of the Revolution from the Peloponnese.\nBiography\nHe was born in Mani and was the eldest son of Petrobey Mavromichalis and Fotini Dimitrakarakou. Ilias was one of the first in the Peloponnese to be initiated into the Filiki Eteria. He represented the Peloponnesians in the pre-revolutionary assembly of chieftains in Lefkada. At the beginning of the war, he took part in the liberation of Kalamata where, as the leader of the Maniates, he succeeded in liberating the city without a fight, in the Battle of Valtetsi, Arcadia (12-13 May 1821) where he distinguished himself, together with his uncle Kyriakoulis, for his strategic virtues and boldness, he also took part in the Siege of Tripolitsa, the Siege of Acrocorinth, the Siege of the Acropolis and battles in Euboea, where he was sent with his uncle Kyriakoulis to assist Bishop of Karystos Neophytos and the chieftains Mavrovouniotis and Kriezotis.\nWhen he was appointed chief of the Arms of Attica, in November 1821, he was renowned as the warlord with the Doric style and Apollonian aspect. He went down in history as the \"Fairyborn\" chieftain. According to popular tradition, he owed his extraordinary beauty to his grandmother - who was the daughter of the Doge of Venice, Francesco Morosini. His grandfather, Giorgakis Mavromichalis, had found her unconscious on the rocks of Mani, left there by a pirate ship with which her father had fled, because she was in danger from her stepmother.\nThe youthful enthusiasm, bravery and philanthropy that characterized Ilias Mavromichali were paid for with his own life. His death caused deep sadness, depriving the Revolution of a very important leader, gifted at the same time with excellent diplomatic skills, at only 26 years of age. Ioannis Filimon writes: \"if Doris he lost Athanasios Diakos, Laconia also he lost Ilias Mavromichali\".\n",

Together with the Giralt brothers (Jos\u00e9, Armando, Mario) and Antonio Neyra, he was a member of the Madrid squad that participated in the very first national tournament played in Spain, the 1902 Copa de la Coronaci\u00f3n. In the semifinals on 13 May, Molera went down in history as one of the eleven footballers who played in the very first El Cl\u00e1sico in history, which ended in a 3\u20131 loss to the Catalans. He then helped Madrid win the club's first-ever piece of silverware, the Copa de la Gran Pe\u00f1a, the consolation trophy of the Copa de la Coronaci\u00f3n.\nMolera returned to his homeland Huelva and only returned a few months later in February, with one of the newspapers of the time dedicating a separate paragraph to his return, calling him a \"distinguished player\" and giving a \"cordial welcome\". Together with the Giralt brothers, Neyra, Pedro Parages, Federico Revuelto, and Miguel de Valdeterrazo, Molera was a member of Madrid FC's first-ever complete season, in 1902\u201303, during which he only played a single match, the 1903 Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao, which ended in a 2\u20133 loss.\nIn 1910 a certain Molera refereed a match in the Huelva provincial championship.\nPolitic career\nA lawyer and landlord by profession, Molera, an Agrarian and member of the ALGAA (Asociaci\u00f3n de Labradores y Ganaderos del Alto Arag\u00f3n), was one of the founders of Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica in Huelva. In 1913, following the death of the liberal deputy Jos\u00e9 Ariz\u00f3n, a vote was scheduled for 8 June to find its successor, but for the sake of the prevailing harmony, only one liberal candidate was going to be presented; however, the 32-year-old Molera managed to be proclaimed candidate after gathering 877 signatures (he only needed 622), and was able to participate in the Huelva elections despite the fact that neither conservatives nor liberals were interested, thus becoming the first \"agrarian\" to struggle to enter the institutions. In the elections, the liberal network and its candidate Antonio Vall\u00e9s Allu\u00e9, a 56-year-old landowner from Bandali\u00e9s, obtained 5,308 votes against the 2,190 that the incipient agrarianism Molera obtained.\nThe sector of conservative and agrarian politicians came to power during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, which they had not been able to do so with the liberal restorationist system. On 15 January 1924, the Alto Aragonese press reported that Molera had been appointed as a deputy for the Benabarre-Tamarite District by the Governor of Huesca, in accordance with the new decrees published by the dictatorship.\nDeath\nMolera died in the Hospital del Rey at Chamart\u00edn de la Rosa on 7 January 1930, at the age of 48.\nHonours\nMadrid FC\nCampeonato de Madrid:\nChampions (1): 1903\u201304\nCopa del Rey:\nRunner-up (1): 1903\nSee also\nList of Real Madrid CF players\n",

After the war, his first assignment was as a Russian military attach\u00e9 in France. He was then appointed to Denmark, Sweden and Norway as a full military attach\u00e9. In the increasingly tense international situation on the eve of the First World War, he was sent back to Paris with the rank of colonel by order of Tsar Nicholas II on March 12, 1912, where he became Russia's military representative at the French headquarters after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. For his services he was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Legion of Honor.\nAfter the Russian February Revolution in 1917, he was appointed major general by the Provisional Government. After the October Revolution in Russia in 1917, Alexey Ignatyev put himself at the service of the newly established Soviet government. As the sole authorized person, he refused to hand over 225 million gold francs, which belonged to the Russian state and were deposited in Paris banks, to the counter-revolutionary Russian government in exile. Instead, he handed the money over to the Soviet government, which had no knowledge of the existence of these financial deposits.\nIgnatyev declined the offer to become a French citizen and general, however wever, he remained in France in the years that followed and, after diplomatic relations were established between the Soviet Union and France, he worked in the Soviet trade mission in Paris. In 1935, Ignatyev returned to the Soviet Union. Here he received his old rank back from the Red Army and was later promoted to lieutenant general. He survived the purges of the armed forces of the late 30s unscathed. Ignatyev took on responsible tasks in military training and left active service in 1947. After his retirement, Ignatyev dedicated his career to literature and most famously published his book of memoirs named \"Fifty Years of Service\".\nAs Ignatiev grew older, he became frequently ill. In the fall of 1953 he became so seriously ill that he had to be hospitalized, where he died a year later and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery.\nAwards\nOrder of St. Anne, 4th class with the inscription \u201cFor bravery\u201d\nOrder of St. Stanislaus, 3rd class with swords and bow\nOrder of St. Vladimir, 4th degree with swords and bow\nOrder of St. Stanislaus, 2nd class with swords\nOrder of St. Anne, 2nd class\nOrder of St. Vladimir, 3rd degree\nThe highest favor\nMedal \"For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941\u20131945\"\nJubilee Medal \"XX Years of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\"\nKnight's Cross of the Legion of Honor (France)\nOfficer's Cross of the Legion of Honor (France)\nOrder of the Danebrog (Denmark)\nOrder of the Iron Crown (Austria-Hungary)\nOrder of the Star of Romania officer grade (Romania)\nOrder of St. Olav (Norway)\n",
    "Church in Racib\u00f3rz, PolandCastle chapel in Racib\u00f3rz, Poland\nCastle courtyard and chapel \u2013 postcard from the 1920s\nChapel windows visible from inside the castle wing\nChapel windows visible from inside the castle wing\nPart of the interior\nAltarpiece of the chapel pending restoration work\nThe Castle Chapel of St. Thomas Becket (also known as, the Pearl of Silesian Gothic, or the Silesian Sainte-Chapelle) was built at the end of the 13th century and is located in the eastern wing of the castle in Racib\u00f3rz. Originally constructed in the Gothic style, the building incorporates elements of Baroque and Neo-Gothic architecture.\nFrom 1288 to 1416, a collegiate church was located next to the chapel, founded by the Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw, Tomasz II. The temple was repeatedly ravaged by fires, including those in 1519, 1637, and 1858. In 1988, during renovation works, the so-called Schneider's map was discovered, showing a handwritten depiction of a legendary tunnel leading under the Oder river. The chapel likely housed relics of Thomas Becket or St. Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w.\nHistory\nThe chapel was built in the 1280s (between 1288 and 1293) as a result of the construction of a new stone castle. It was likely erected on the site of a Romanesque rotunda, as indicated by archaeological excavations conducted in the 1960s and 1980s. The previous church was probably dedicated to St. John the Baptist, whose patronage was transferred in 1307 to the church in Ostr\u00f3g, built around the 12th century by Mieszko IV Tanglefoot. The foundation of the new chapel could not have occurred later than 1292 when construction began, funded by Przemys\u0142aw of Racib\u00f3rz. The dedication was most likely performed by Tomasz II, who sought refuge in Racib\u00f3rz from Duke Henry Probus at that time, although the exact date of the dedication is unknown. In 1288, Bishop Tomasz II founded a collegiate church near the castle chapel as an expression of gratitude for the hospitality received. This event was described by Jan D\u0142ugosz in the Annals or Chronicles of the Famous Kingdom of Poland:Gathering a large army, both from his own soldiers and mercenaries hired with monetary contribution which he levied on the Wroc\u0142aw Church, he militarily invaded the lands of Duke Casimir of Opole and besieged the city of Racib\u00f3rz due to the presence of Bishop Tomasz of Wroc\u0142aw and his clergy there. Although the wealthier citizens of Racib\u00f3rz endured the siege for some time and promised to endure it even longer, the startled populace, feeling the scarcity and lack of food, tormented by hunger, continually wept, groaned loudly, and sighed, hurling curses and insults at Bishop Tomasz and his clergy. Touched by this, Bishop Tomasz, out of great kindness for which he was reputed, said: 'Rather let me and my clergy fall into the hands of the tyrant than these innocent people perish from hunger. We will immediately release from danger those besieged who are dying of fear and hunger. Let us, by our capture or, if it pleases God, by our death, avert the destruction threatening this city, which has sustained us for a long time and granted us refuge'. Then he puts on liturgical garments and orders some clergy to do the same. And thus, wearing the mitre and the episcopal insignia, he sets out from the city with all his clergy in exile, to face the tyrant's camp, to appease his wrath with the greatest humility. (...) The tyrant, who saw his arrival from afar, by God's grace, was seized with such great fear that, leaping from his tent, he ran as fast as he could to meet the bishop, fell face down on the ground, and as if recognizing something divine in the bishop and honoring in him the Eternal Shepherd, begged for forgiveness for his actions. Bishop Tomasz, raising him from the ground, tearfully promised to forgive him all the apostasy he had committed, as long as he persevered in this contrition and piety. And after mutual tearful embraces and kisses, the prince and the bishop entered the nearest church of St. Nicholas without witnesses.As a commemoration of this reconciliation between Bishop Tomasz II of Wroc\u0142aw and Duke Henry Probus, a monument called Unity was erected in Stara Wie\u015b. It was also then that the chapel received the rare dedication of St. Thomas Becket, whose relics were probably brought to the castle. At the collegiate church, three canons and several vicars served, their livelihood supported by tithes from several villages in the duchies of Racib\u00f3rz, Opole, and Cieszyn. In addition, the clergy at the collegiate church served as chancellors, secretaries, as well as tutors and educators to the duke's children. In the early 14th century, a wing of the duke's castle was added to the chapel. In 1309, the altar of St. Margaret was mentioned. In the 14th century, the chapel was further expanded with a porch.\nIn 1416, at the behest of John II, the chapter was transferred from the castle chapel to the parish church. In the 15th and 16th centuries, many of the revenues of the chapel disa",
    "Constituency in Seoul, South Korea\nEunpyeong B (Korean:\u00a0\uc740\ud3c9\uad6c \uc744) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Eunpyeong District, Seoul. As of 2024, 195,270 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Seodaemun\u2013Eunpyeong constituency.\nHistory\nThroughout its history, Eunpyeong B has elected members of liberal, centrist, and conservative political parties to represent the constituency. Despite conservative politician Lee Jae-oh being elected a total of five times in Eunpyeong B, in recent years, the liberal Democratic Party has been dominant in the constituency.\nDeputy Speaker of the National Assembly Kim Jae-kwang of the centre-right Reunification Democratic Party was the first member to represent the constituency. He was succeeded by Lee Won-hyung of the centre-left Democratic Party who won in the 1992 election. Lee Jae-oh made his debut in this election as the left-wing Popular Party candidate. Lee Jae-oh won the following election held in 1996 as a member of the centre-right New Korea Party, defeating incumbent Lee Won-hyung by over eight points. Lee comfortably won re-election in 2000 with 51% of the vote and narrowly won re-election in 2004 with 45.25% of the vote against Uri Party candidate Song Mi-hwa who received 43.07% of the vote. However, Lee was defeated by Moon Kook-hyun of the centrist reformist Creative Korea Party by a margin of over eleven points.\nOn October 22, 2009, Moon Kook-hyun lost his seat after he was found guilty of violating South Korean election law; specifically the political funds act. Accordingly, a by-election for the constituency was held in 2010 which saw the constituency's former member Lee Jae-oh of the conservative Grand National Party win in a landslide, securing 58.33% of the vote. In the 2012 election, Lee narrowly won re-election by a margin 1.14% against unified opposition candidate Cheon Ho-sun of the centre-left Unified Progressive Party.\nAhead of the 2016 South Korean election, incumbent Lee Jae-oh was not re-nominated as the Saenuri Party's candidate for Eunpyeong B. This move came as the Saenuri Party's pro-Park Geun-hye faction grew influential within the party and denied renomination for many party members considered to be anti-Park or pro-Lee Myung-bak. In response to this, Lee left the Saenuri Party on March 23, 2016, and announced his intention to run as an independent candidate on the following day. The Saenuri Party decided not to nominate a candidate in the Eunpyeong B constituency on March 28, 2016. Despite this, Lee Jae-oh failed to win re-election, being defeated by Kang Byung-won of the liberal Democratic Party who won with 36.74% of the vote. Kang won re-election in 2020, garnering 57.41% of the vote. Kang was not re-nominated as the Democratic Party's candidate ahead of the 2024 election after being defeated by Kim Woo-young in a party primary. Kim won the general election with 56.95% of the vote, defeating People Power Party challenger Chang Seong-ho by a wide margin.\nBoundaries\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Gusan-dong, Daejo-dong, Jingwan-dong, Bulgwang-dong, and Galhyeon-dong. The constituency is bordered Goyang B to the north and west, Eunpyeong A to the south, and Jongno to the east.\nList of members of the National Assembly\nElection results\n2024\n2020\n2016\n2012\n2010 (by-election)\n2008\n2004\n2000\n1996\n1992\n1988\nSee also\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\nNotes\n^ Independent from March 23, 2016\n^ Unified opposition candidate with the Democratic United Party\n",
    "American advanced nuclear technology company developing compact fast nuclear reactors\nOklo Inc. is an advanced nuclear technology  company based in Santa Clara, California. Founded in 2013 by Jacob DeWitte and Caroline Cochran, both graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the company designs and deploys compact fast reactors with the aim of providing clean, safe and affordable energy.\nIts chairman is OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman.\nThe company\u2019s name is derived from Oklo, a region in the country of Gabon, Africa where self-sustaining nuclear fission reactions occurred approximately 1.7 billion years ago.\nOklo's main product is the Aurora powerhouse, a compact fast neutron reactor designed to generate 15 MWe of electrical power. Building on over 400 years of combined fast reactor operational history, the Aurora is intended for off-grid applications, including data centers, artificial intelligence, remote communities, industrial sites, and military bases. It can operate for up to 10 years without refueling. Oklo has signed letters of intent with Diamondback Energy and Wyoming Hyperscale to provide emission-free electricity with its fission reactors for Diamondback\u2019s Permian Basin operations and Wyoming Hyperscale\u2019s data center campus,  respectively, over 20-year periods.  \nOklo also produces radioisotopes through its nuclear fuel recycling process and fast reactor technology.  These radioisotopes have a wide range of applications, including medical diagnostic imaging and cancer treatment; industrial uses like non-destructive testing and process control; and energy applications including radioisotope thermoelectric generators, nuclear batteries and fusion research.\nThe Aurora powerhouse utilizes heat pipe cooling, similar to the technology used in the NASA Kilopower reactor. It features a large negative temperature reactivity coefficient and lacks pumps and valves. The reactor is designed to operate without the need for nuclear refueling intervals or associated core exposure, and its core is buried underground for added safety. In its safety design presentation to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Oklo referenced a study of the EBR-II, a different reactor technology, which was described as being \"inherently protected without requiring emergency power, safety systems, or operator intervention\".\nThe company has received venture capital from various investors, including Hydrazine Capital, founded by Sam Altman with Peter Thiel as its sole limited partner; Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz; Ron Conway of SV Angels; Kevin Efrusy of Accel Partners; and Tim Draper of Draper Associates.\nIn July 2023, it was announced that the company planned to go public via a special purpose acquisition company at a value of $850 million. On May 10, 2024, Okto merged with AltC Acquisition Corp, receiving $306 millions in gross proceeds.\n",

As of May 2024, he was the most senior IDF officer wounded during the war.\nBiography\nBar Sheshet attended the Military Boarding School for Command at Merkaz Shapira. He enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and was placed in Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade. He underwent training as a fighter, and took the Infantry Commanders Course\u00a0 and Infantry Officers Course\u00a0.

Regarding operations commanded in Jenin, he said \"I told the soldiers that there is no joy in seeing a person killed, even if it is a terrorist. There is no sense of transcendence. You are happy that you completed the mission and that the terrorist will no longer harm other civilians. This is purity of arms. You do the best you can. Professional, sharp. We are not bloodthirsty\". During the initial phase of the Israel\u2013Hamas war he said, referring to Palestinians who had been displaced from their homes in the Gaza Strip, \"Whoever returns here, if they return here after, will find scorched earth. No houses, no agriculture, no nothing. They have no future.\" The statement was cited in South Africa's genocide case against Israel.\nPersonal life\nBar Sheshet lives in Neta, is married, and has six children. Although he was raised in an Orthodox Jewish home, he is no longer observant.\n",
    "Election\nThe 2024 Khabarovsk Krai gubernatorial election will take place on 8 September 2024, on common election day, coinciding with 2024 Khabarovsk Krai Legislative Duma election.

Degtyarev faced opposition from Furgal's supporters for his denouncement of the protest movement, firings of Krai Government officials and appointment of Moscow and Samara natives to his administration, which resulted in prominent Furgal allies such as both Federation Council Senators from the krai Yelena Greshnyakova and Sergey Bezdenezhnykh, Khabarovsk City Duma Speaker Mikhail Sidorov and Anton Furgal, the eldest son of the former governor, leaving Liberal Democratic Party in protest. Nevertheless, Degtyarev easily won the subsequent gubernatorial election in the first round with 56.81% of the vote, while TV presenter and actress Marina Kim (SR\u2013ZP) placed second with 25.39%.\nIn early May 2024 Governor Degtyarev was mentioned as potential future Minister of Sport along with current Deputy Minister Odes Baysultanov.

    "\nA wildfire in Bitterroot National Forest in Montana on August 6\nThe following is a list of weather events that occurred on Earth in the year 2000. There were several natural disasters around the world from various types of weather, including floods, droughts, heat waves, tornadoes, and tropical cyclones. The deadliest disaster were the 2000 Mozambique Floods which killed 800 people, and the costliest event of the year was Typhoon Saomai, which caused  $6.3 billion (2000 USD) in damages.\nWinter storms and cold waves\nIn January, an extremely powerful and historic blizzard, commonly referred to as the Carolina Crusher, hit parts of North Carolina and Central Virginia on January 25, causing thousands of power outages within the area leaving 11 inches of snow in Richmond, VA and 20.3 inches in Raleigh-Durham International Airport before moving out to the Atlantic.\nIn December, a significant nor'easter impacted the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States around the end of the month. It began as an Alberta clipper that moved southeastward through the central United States and weakened over the Ohio Valley. The storm dropped heavy precipitation throughout the Northeast, especially in northern New Jersey and eastern New York, where snowfall often exceeded 2 ft (0.61 m). Even so, as it struck on a weekend, its effects were generally minor and mostly limited to travel delays, traffic accidents, and business closures.\nDroughts, heat waves, and wildfires\nThe 2000 California wildfire season produced multiple wildfires, killing 1 or more people and injuring multiple others. Over 130 buildings were destroyed during the season, amounting to $154 million (2000 USD) in damages. The Storrie Fire on August 17 caused $22 million (2000 USD) in damages, and burned 55,261 acres of land.\nIn August and September, a large heat wave affected parts of the southern United States, with highs commonly peaking well over 100 \u00b0F.\nFloods\nThe Sena Bridge, the collapse was caused by heavy flooding in Mozambique.\nIn February and March, a large and deadly flood in Mozambique killed 800 people. The flood caused $500 million (2000 USD) in damages, and is one of Mozambique's worst-ever floods.\nThe Autumn of 2000 was the wettest recorded in the United Kingdom since records began in 1766. Several regions of Atlantic Europe from France to Norway received double their average rainfall and there were severe floods and landslides in the southern Alps.\nThe United Kingdom saw the most extensive nationwide flooding event since the snow-melt of 1947. Prior to 1947, three similar events occurred in the second half of the 19th century where prolonged rainfall led to widespread flooding throughout England in the month of November, in 1894, 1875, and 1852.\nIn November, a catastrophic flood occurred in Hawaii. The floods led to $70 million (2000 USD) in damage, but there were no fatalities. The flood was indirectly triggered by Tropical Storm Paul.\nTornadoes\nMain article: Tornadoes of 2000\nThere were 1,075\u00a0tornadoes in the United States alone, collectively resulting in 41 deaths. \nDamage in Camilla, Georgia from an F3 tornado on February 13\nOn February 13 and 14, a deadly tornado outbreak killed 18 people, caused 23 injuries and caused more than $20 million (2000 USD) in damages. It was the  single deadliest tornado outbreak in the United States between June 1999 and October 2002.\nOn March 28, a small but deadly tornado outbreak caused extensive damage in downtown Fort Worth, Texas, causing damage to skyscrapers and other buildings. 2 people were killed by this tornado, and 80 more were injured. $450 million (2000 USD) were recorded. Another F3 tornado touched down as part of the outbreak, but caused little damage and no injuries.\nOn April 23, a tornado outbreak produced 33 tornadoes across Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana, with three of these being rated F3. An F1 tornado moved through Shreveport, Louisiana, injuring six people and causing $10,000+ (2000 USD) in damages. In total, 12 people were injured, but no fatalities were recorded.\nOn May 11 and 12, an F3 tornado killed one person near Cedar Falls, Iowa. Another F3 tornado caused two fatalities in Laguna Park, Texas.\nOn May 17 and 18, a small storm system produced 69 tornadoes. One tornado was rated F3, and caused damage to multiple buildings. 2 people were injured.\nOn July 14 an F3 tornado touched down and moved toward Green Acres Campground at Pine Lake, Alberta. 12 people at the campground were killed and over 100 were injured. Winds of up to 300 km/h (190 mph) caused $15.2 million (2000 Canadian dollars) in damage to the campground. It was the fourth-deadliest tornado in Canadian history.\nOn July 25, a small outbreak produced 12 tornadoes, one of which was a violent tornado that hit the city of Granite Falls in Yellow Medicine County, and the tornado killed one person and injured 15 others. It is one of the strongest tornadoes in Minnesota history.\nOn September 20, an F4 tornado",

    "\nMilitary unit\nThe Baicheng Ordnance Test Center of China, also known as the PLA's 31st Testing and Training Base (MUCD Unit 63850) is a directly subordinate Corps Grade unit of the PLAGF based in  Pingtai County, Taobei District, Baicheng City, Jilin Province.  It is a multi-functionality and comprehensive conventional weapons equipment test range in China, and performs the function of national target range. Most of the existing conventional small weapons and equipment of the People's Republic of China are tested and finalized by the center before being inducted by the army. The center is responsible for research and testing tasks of China's conventional weapons and equipment, including finalization, appraisal, scientific research, production delivery and testing, and the preparation of firing ranges.\nHistory\nIn September 1953, the Central Military Commission approved the construction of the People's Liberation Army Ordnance Test Range (from the on referred to as \"Baicheng Range\") in the Dacaodian area of Baicheng, Jilin Province, to undertake the performance assessment of ground artillery, infantry weapons, weapon type tests, etc. On August 26, 1954, the Ordnance Test Range was officially established. It was one of the 156 key projects built by the Soviet Union as part of their aid to China.The People's Liberation Army Ordnance Test Range was approved by Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Peng Dehuai. In early September 1954, the first batch of personnel went to the horqin grassland for construction. Under the guidance of the \"three-side\" policy of \"building, testing and training of cadres\", the test team was initially formed, in which the light weapons test team initially built up the test apparatus, and learned the test methods under the guidance of Soviet expert A. Volkov. In April 1956, the Ordnance Test Range was renamed as the First Ordnance Scientific Test Range of the People's Liberation Army, which belonged to the General Armaments Department of the PLA, with Maj. Gen. Zhang Yixiang as the director, Maj. Gen. Li Kungliang as the political commissar, and Maj. Gen. Zheng Helin and Maj. Gen. Liu Zhirui as the deputy political commissar and the deputy director successively.\nOn 9 June 1956, the range held a temporary range opening ceremony. 1955 September 8 to October 24, a factory in northeast China managed to copy the production of a certain type of pistol (probably a Tokarev) and sent it to the range to carry out product quality inspection tests. The first environmental simulation laboratory was completed in 1958 and put into use. In July 1960, the Soviet experts withdrew, but that did not affect the normal construction of the range.\nIn March 1959, after Han Zhenji became the director of the Ordnance Department of the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the Baicheng Range was placed under the establishment of the Ordnance Department of the General Logistics Department, with the Ordnance Department of the General Logistics Department became responsible for its daily management. The General Staff Department of the PLA was responsible for arranging the testing of weapons here by all military branches, and the deputy chiefs of staff in charge of this work were Zhang Aiping and Peng Shaohui.After the General Staff leadership and Han Zhenji study, the Ordnance Department of the General Logistics Department decided that the Baicheng range should report to the General Logistics Department Party Committee, requesting to strengthen the comprehensive utilization of the range, improve the range test capacity to study the issue.General Logistics Department sent a team of experts to carry out research, put forward the program reported to the General Staff Department, approved by the State Council, the Central Military Commission, decided to extend the main target road, used to meet the requirements of anti-aircraft weapons and other long-range weapons testing. At that time, during the troubles of the Great Leap Forward, the target range completed its expansion in 1960 after a hard struggle, and the area of the range reached 1,795 square kilometers.\nAt the beginning of 1960, the national defense industry started out large-scale construction of the Third Front, and the Central Military Commission decided to build a new weapons testing ground in northwest China. Han Zhenji (\u97e9\u632f\u7eaa) organized the Ordnance Department of the General Logistics Department, together with the relevant departments to study the decision of the Central Military Commission, and sent specialists to participate in the site selection.After argumentation, Zhou Enlai approved the construction of the second test site of the conventional weapons test base in a second place, which was subordinate to the Baicheng base in terms of establishment. This became the future China Huayin Weapons Testing Center (\u4e2d\u56fd\u534e\u9634\u5175\u5668\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5fc3)\nOn March 22 and July 10, 1961, Han Zhenji attended the All-Army Logistics Work Conference and All-Army Logistics Work Sy",
    "\nCaroline Nompozolo (born 1908) was the first native South African woman to qualify as a physician. She studied medicine at the School of Medicine of the Scottish Medical Royal Colleges and was later house surgeon at St Charles' Hospital.\nEarly education\nShe was educated at Healdtown High School in Eastern Cape Province, where Nelson Mandela was also a pupil from 1937. She went on to study science at South African Native College, Fort Hare in Alice in the Eastern Cape. The South African Native College, later the University of Fort Hare, was founded in  1916 on  the  site  of  a former British military garrison. The College offered European style higher education and alumni include Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo and Robert Mugabe. Nompozola's ambition, however, had always been to study medicine. In 1937, after completing the first year of science course, she applied to the University of St Andrews to study medicine but was rejected on the grounds that the university did not recognise the South African Native College. Her examination passes  were however recognised by the School of Medicine of the Scottish Medical Royal Colleges, to which she successfully applied to study medicine. As the first black women to do this her story was reported in the press.\u201cBefore she sailed for Europe she was met at nearly every railway station by teachers, journalists and clergymen who wished her Godspeed\u201d. (The Daily Colonist, July 1938)\nMedical education\nThe Principal of the School of Medicine,  Professor John Orr accepted her application and arranged for her to be admitted as a medical student to Anderson\u2019s College, Glasgow, where she studied anatomy and physiology, with further classes then being taken at St Mungo\u2019s College, Glasgow, both part of the extramural school. Her clinical training was carried out at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Western Infirmary, the two main Glasgow teaching hospitals. \nShe qualified as a doctor with the Triple Qualification in 1942.\nMedical career\nShe received funding to travel to Dublin for postgraduate courses in midwifery and paediatrics. \nIn 1953 she was a house surgeon at the St Charles Hospital in West London.\n",

Later that month, she won her first race at another maiden race at Hanshin.\n1999: Three year old season\nNarita Top Road winning the Kikuka-sh\u014d\nNarita Top Road won his first graded race when he won that year's Kisaragi Sho. The horse then went on to the Yayoi Sho, where he beat Admire Vega. He was then entered in to the Satsuki Sho, where he finished third behind T M Opera O and Osumi Bright\u00a0. The horse also ran in the Tokyo Yushun, where he finished second behind Admire Vega.\nAfter taking the summer off, the horse once again finished second behind Admire Vega at the Kyoto Shimbun Hai. Later, at the Kikuka-sh\u014d, the horse took the fourth position in the pack before taking the lead at the fourth corner. Narita Top Road held on to the lead from there and won the race, even as T M Opera O closed the gap. After winning the Kikuka-sh\u014d, he was entered in to that year's Arima Kinen but finished 7th.\n2000: Four year old season\nNarita Top Road started the season off with the Kyoto Kinen, where he finished second behind T M Opera O; and later to the Hanshin Daishoten and Tenno Sho (Spring), both of which the horse finished third behind T M Opera O and Rascal Suzuka\u00a0. After a summer break, the horse was entered in to the Kyoto Daishoten, where he finished second behind T M Opera O and finished 5th at the Tenno Sho (Autumn). After finishing 4th at the Stayers Stakes, Kunihiko Watanabe\u00a0, who had been the horse's jockey up to this point, resigned from the position, and the role went to Hitoshi Matoba\u00a0. However, the horse could not win the Arima Kinen, which was the horse's next race.\n2001: Five year old season\nNarita Top Road started the season with the Kyoto Kinen, but finished third behind Maquereau. As Matoba retired around this time, Watanabe returned to jockey duty for the Hanshin Daishoten. Narita Top Road won the race with a course record of 3:02.5.\nLater that year, the horse ran in the Kyoto Daishoten. However, the horse did not finish the race as Stay Gold made physical contact with the horse, resulting in Watanabe to fall off and injuring both the horse and jockey. Subsequently, Stay Gold was disqualified as a result of this incident.\n2002: Six year old season\nNarita Top Road once again started the season with the Kyoto Kinen, where he managed to win the race after being nearly beaten by Matikane Kinnohosi\u00a0. He was then entered in to the Hanshin Daishoten, where he easily beat Jungle Pocket. However, he finished third behind Manhattan Cafe and Jungle Pocket later at the Tenno Sho (Spring).\nFollowing this race, the horse spent the summer off, returning victoriously at the Kyoto Daishoten, but was unable to secure a single victory until his retirement at the Arima Kinen that year.\nStud career\nFollowing his retirement, Narita Top Road stood stud at the Shadai Stallion Station. His most successful progeny was Bella Rheia\u00a0, who won the Flora Stakes and finished second in the Yushun Himba in 2007.\nNarita Top Road died on November 7, 2005, 6 years to the day after his Kikuka-sh\u014d win after suffering a heart failure.

    "\nThe AVIC AS700-class of airships (otherwise known as the Xiangyun-class which translates to auspicious clouds) is a class of non-rigid airships built for commercial and tourism use. It is developed and built by AVIC as its first attempt in the civilian airship market.\nDesign and development\nThe AS700 is a medium-sized blimp that is around 48 meters (158\u00a0ft) long, a height of 12 meters (39\u00a0ft) and a total volume of around 3,500 m3 (123,600\u00a0ft3). It is powered by helium like all modern airships.\nThe AS700 has an ellipsoid hull, with a rigid tail configuration done in an \"X\" positioning rather than the traditional \"+\" positioning. The design is considered as a light and cost-effective capsule-shaped airship. The tail has flight control surfaces to allow in ease in steering. The gondola of the airship possess a non-retractable single-point landing gear under the rear which creates a center of gravity that gives the AS700 stability when being ferried on the ground.\nAs a non-rigid airship, the AS700's envelope is a single lift gas cell manufactured from a multi-layer fabric-film laminate composite material that provides the needed strength, low helium leak rate, tear and weather resistance. Within the outer envelope, the airship possess ballonets for pitch control. The ballonets are made from lightweight polymer cells which is equipped with helium safety valves to prevent over-pressurization and to allow for a safe landing in the event of maneuvering system failure.\nThe AS700 feature modern fly-by-wire flight control systems with advanced avionics, with the gondola being big enough to house a single pilot alongside 9 passengers and can be configured with a food service facility and a washroom. The large windows are designed to open in flight. Pilot controls are done with a side stick controller, which makes the blimp easy to operate. It can also be configured for unmanned operations.\nAn interesting aspect of the AS700 is its thrust-vectoring features. The blimp possess modern thrust vectoring propulsion systems that allows the AS700 to do both STOL and VTOL operations. The maximum takeoff weight is 4,150\u00a0kg with the maximum range being 700\u00a0km. Likewise, its maximum flight time is recorded to be 10 hours and is capable of achieving a maximum speed of a 100\u00a0km/hr. Since it is a civilian blimp, AVIC recommends that the airship to not fly under treacherous weather conditions such as thunderstorms, snowstorms, heavy fog or lightning.\nOverview and history\nThe AS700 is designed largely for civilian usage, specifically, in the tourism sector. The project first began in August 2018. According to the project manager of the AS700, Du Wei, he stated that the airship's market is built in line with China's consumption transformation and upgrading needs. Specifically for low-altitude sightseeing and tourism as well as potentially expanding the ship's services to emergency rescue, urban public services and other fields.\nCurrently, three prototypes were built. The first was an unmanned platform that flew in October 2022 as a technological demonstrator. The second and third prototypes were manned vehicles tasked in completing various tests to ensure safety checks. The second prototype made its maiden flight in Hubei on the 29 December 2022. The flight lasted 39 minutes. On the 13 December 2023, the Civil Aviation Administration of China issued a type certificate for the AS700, making it the first manned airship in China to be domestically developed and certified. The third prototype successfully made its maiden voyage on April 2, 2024, in Hubei province again. The flight took one hour and 46 minutes.\nAVIC estimates that there is a market demand for 100 airships of this type over the next 10 years, but currently, it has only received orders of around 18-20 copies which should delivered by the end of 2024.\nSpecifications\nGeneral characteristics\nCrew: ca. 1 pilot\nCapacity: ca. 9 passengers\nLength: 48\u00a0m (158\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in)\nDiameter: 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in)\nVolume: 3,500\u00a0m3 (123,600\u00a0cu\u00a0ft)\nUseful lift: 4,150\u00a0kg (9,149\u00a0lb)\nPowerplant: 2 \u00d7 Lycoming IO-390-C3B6 aviation piston engines , 160\u00a0kW (215\u00a0hp) each\nPerformance\nMaximum speed: 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph, 54\u00a0kn)\n",
    "Statue at San Jose State University, United States\nVictory Salute, commonly referred to as the Olympic Black Power Statue, is a monument depicting the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute performed by African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos. The monument consists of two bronze statues covered in a fiberglass mosaic, atop a concrete base designed to emulate the Olympic podium. It was created in 2005 by Portuguese artist Rigo 23 and is installed next to Tower Hall on the San Jos\u00e9 State University campus, in San Jose, California, United States.\nHistory\nThe photo recreated by Victory Salute\nIn 1968, as members of San Jose State's Speed City era of athletics, Tommie Smith and John Carlos competed in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. After earning gold and bronze medals respectively, the duo raised a Black Power salute while \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" played, which became one of the most defining acts of protest of the civil rights movement. Despite disapproval of the protest among the general public, San Jose State President Robert D. Clark expressed his support of the act.\nIn Winter 2002, San Jose State student, Erik Grotz, initiated a project to honor Smith and Carlos at their alma mater; \"One of my professors  was talking about unsung heroes and he mentioned Tommie Smith and John Carlos. He said these men had done a courageous thing to advance civil rights, and, yet, they had never been honored by their own school\". Grotz worked with Department of Art Chair, Dr. Robert Milnes to create a mock-up to pitch to the University's Associated Students board, who approved the project on December 11, 2002 and began fundraising.\nThe Associated Students raised over $300,000 for the project and initially intended the statue to be placed next to the now former location of the Scheller House on the Paseo de San Carlos. However, the project was moved to be on the lawn adjacent to the Tower Hall and the Robert D. Clark Hall in order to be in a more central location on campus and to honor President Clark's support of the protest. On October 16, 2003, the 35th anniversary of the protest, Portuguese artist Rigo 23 was announced to be the sculptor for the project.\nVictory Salute was assembled in early October 2005, and was unveiled to the public on October 17, 2005, drawing hundreds in attendance. A panel discussion was held featuring Smith and Carlos, as well as silver-medalist Peter Norman, fellow Speed City era sprinter Lee Evans, and head coach Payton Jordan. Additional speeches were given by vice-mayor of San Jose Cindy Chavez, San Jose State President Don W.

    "Street in Warsaw\nFrancuska Street is a street in Warsaw's Saska K\u0119pa neighborhood, beginning at Przymierza Square and ending at George Washington Roundabout. Along the street, there are residential houses (including historic buildings from the interwar period), and the trees growing alongside it give it the character of an avenue.\nThe oldest surviving houses were built in the 1930s. In September 1939, battles took place on Francuska Street. The street retained its commercial character even after the end of World War II, which became even more apparent after 1989. Since 2006, it has been the venue for the main events of the Saska K\u0119pa Festival, and since 2012, also for the French Festival. Its name is dedicated to France, the formal ally of the Second Polish Republic.\nMileage and traffic\nFrancuska Street is part of the transportation route consisting of Wersalska Street\u2013Paryska Street\u2013Przymierza Square\u2013Francuska Street\u2013Washington Roundabout. It begins at the intersection with Zwyci\u0119zc\u00f3w Street at Przymierza Square and ends at Washington Roundabout. Along the way, it intersects with Obro\u0144c\u00f3w, Walecznych, Berezy\u0144ska, and Lipska streets. Francuska Street is two-way and single-lane throughout its entire length, with dedicated turning lanes at Zwyci\u0119zc\u00f3w, Obro\u0144c\u00f3w, Berezy\u0144ska, and Lipska streets. There are no bike lanes along the street, but it is served by public bus routes.\nHistory\n1 Francuska Street: memorial plaque\n2007 Saska K\u0119pa Festival\nRenovations in 2010\nThe name of Francuska Street was established by a resolution of the Warsaw City Council on 27 September 1926.\nThe construction of the street began in the 1930s, facilitated by an agreement reached on 14 October 1931 between local landowners and city authorities. The development of the street was also boosted by the activities of the Water Company of the Wawer District, which led to the establishment of a network of canals. By 1935, buses of line S were already operating along the street, terminating at Washington Roundabout. In 1938, the street had an asphalt road surface and sidewalks (the asphalt was laid in 1937, making Francuska the third street in Saska K\u0119pa to be asphalted). Greenery strips were planted along the street between 1937 and 1938.\nInitially, plans were made to build a church along Francuska Street, but ultimately another location was chosen. However, more houses gradually appeared, quickly distinguishing the street from the rest of the district. As Bronis\u0142aw Kopczy\u0144ski wrote:Saska K\u0119pa, and it wasn't that long ago, in 1933 it had only a dozen or so houses and villas on Miedzeszy\u0144ska Street, then the main artery, and a few on Francuska. Fields, meadows, and orchards stretched out on both sides, with a manor house here and there.The rapid pace of construction and delayed implementation of regulatory plans resulted in heterogeneous development. This effect elicited conflicting opinions. For example, Adam Wolmar wrote in 1935 about Francuska Street:Palace next to palace, villa next to villa, all almost as beautiful as a dream, harmonized with the background, with the surroundings of classical geometric proportions, singing with bright planes and victorious beautiful simplicity. Indeed, \u017boliborz has not a single street maintained in such noble style.On the other hand, Marek Leykam criticized the appearance of the street:Built with a broken line of fronts, carelessly laid out by casual 'omentr\u00f3w' before the city began to lay out streets. One house stands next to another, each different in its ugliness. A four-story tenement with a nice gable wall next to a modernly drawn villa, touching a tenement house blushing with its roof. Loose construction amidst dense, anarchy of all possible forms.During the defense of Warsaw in September 1939, a crucial barricade was located at the corner of Francuska and Zwyci\u0119zc\u00f3w streets. Polish soldiers from the 21st Infantry Regiment \"Children of Warsaw\", the 21st Vistula Uhlan Regiment, and the 336th Infantry Regiment fought here against the German 44th Infantry Regiment from East Prussia, whose arrival was preceded by Luftwaffe bombings. Seven defenders were awarded the Silver Crosses of the Virtuti Militari as early as 27 September 1939.\nIn 1942, in one of the apartments on Francuska Street, Anna Jachnina wrote the lyrics of the song Siekiera, motyka.\nAfter the end of the German occupation, the Capital Reconstruction Bureau decided to maintain the street's existing character, i.e., its role as both a transportation route and a commercial area. During the socialist realism period, plans were made to build a monumental colonnade surrounding the southern semicircle of Washington Roundabout with an interruption at the entrance to Francuska Street. However, the project was not realized, and residential buildings were erected instead. After years of transformation, the street became even more distinctly characterized by its commercial and service functions.\nSince 2006, Francuska Street has been the main venue for e",
    "House on Chatham Island, New Zealand\n43\u00b045\u203252\u2033S 176\u00b046\u203242\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff43.7644\u00b0S 176.7782\u00b0W\ufeff / -43.7644; -176.7782\nThe German Mission House (also known as the Maunganui Stone Cottage) is a 19th-century stone cottage at Maunganui on northern Chatham Island, New Zealand. Johannes Engst and Johann Baucke, members of a group of German Moravian missionaries, built the house in the late 1860s alongside Baucke's son William. The building was constructed from stone sourced from the nearby volcanic cone, Maunganui Bluff. The Moravian mission in the Chathams was broadly unsuccessful (failing to gain a single convert on the islands), and Engst alone stayed on the island, residing as a farmer at the house until his retirement in 1900. The house continues to serve as a private residence, although it is frequently visited by tourists to the islands. In 1991, it was listed as a Category 1 historic place by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. Repair work was intermittently carried out on the structure from 1998 to 2010 in response to damage to the masonry.\nHistory\nJohannes Engst, 1874The house and surroundings during Engst's residence, 1870s\nIn 1842, five German Moravian Church missionaries, led by schoolmaster Franz Schirmeister, were sent to New Zealand by the Gossner Mission. Unable to find a suitable location to preach, they sailed to the Chatham Islands. They arrived in February 1843, initially settling at Te Whakaru on the main island of Chatham. Although ultimately failing to make any converts among either the M\u0101ori or Moriori inhabitants of the islands, they are credited with the introduction of shipbuilding and sheep farming, and established the island's first school.\nAll members of the mission lived apart for some time in order to connect with the local community. From 1866 to 1868 Johannes Gottfried Engst and Johann Baucke, alongside Baucke's son William (born on the island), constructed a stone cottage at Maunganui on the northern coast. The cottage was constructed with stone from the adjacent Maunganui Bluff, a 178\u00a0m (584\u00a0ft) volcanic cone, using mortar derived from pipi shells. The doors and window lintels of the house were made from akeake wood. In addition to sheepherding, the missionaries grew orchard trees, vegetables, and macrocarpa at the site. Several outbuildings, including a woolshed and stable, were constructed at the site, although only the Mission House is now extant.\nJohann Baucke left the Chathams in the late 1860s, following the death of his wife and a feud over land with Archibald Shand. Engst continued to live and farm at the site, employing Baucke's children as labourers. Reverend P. C. Anderson visited the house in 1882, describing it as \"a capital house... The blocks of which it is built are nearly a foot square, cut with the axe, so it must have involved an enormous amount of labour to build.\" Engst retired from farming in 1900, around eighty years old, and moved to Te One, where he died in 1910.\nModern history\nThe German Mission House remains a private residence. Various small improvements and additions have been added to the structure by its owners since its construction. It is frequently visited by tourists, although its remote location requires a half-day round trip by vehicle. The site holds great historical significance to Chatham Islanders. An entry fee and prior permission from the owners is required to visit the site.\nStructure\nWindow and garden of the house, 2023\nThe German Mission House is rectangular, with a gable roof. Initially thatched, the modern roof is fashioned out of corrugated iron. The exterior stonework of the structure was initially exposed, but later plastered with lime. Early in its history, a veranda was installed on the building, but it has since been removed, leaving only a foundation line. Three bedrooms were placed inside the roof, accessible by a staircase on the western side of the house. These were initially lit on either end by windows in the western and eastern ends of the house; however, the eastern window has since been removed.\nThe building's ground floor is constructed from blocks of tuff and basalt, sourced from the western edge of the house. A stone-lined cellar was built at this spot. Timber floors are placed above this foundation. The building is split into three rooms, the middle the largest, each of which contains a casement window on the north side. The internal walls between these rooms are constructed from ponga logs, with plaster lining.\nModern interior fixtures for the kitchen and laundry have been installed in the house, alongside a modern bathroom in the eastern room. A lean-to was added in 1955. A possible earlier lean-to is evidenced by remaining stone foundations. Two chimneys, one on the southern wall and one on the western, were initially installed. The western chimney collapsed at some point before 2010.\nConservation and repairs\nThe house and surroundings, 2023\nThe house was listed as a Category 1 historic place by the New Zealand His",
    "English footballer (1867\u20131951)\nThis article is about the former Juventus forward. For the goalkeeper, see Jack Savage (English footballer).\nGordon Thomas Savage, commonly known as John Savage, (18 February 1867 \u2013 23 April 1951) was an English footballer who played as a forward.\nCareer\nSavage began his career in England, playing for Notts County.\nLater moving to Italy, Savage was a member of the first Torino Football & Cricket Club\u00a0 side, playing alongside fellow Englishmen Edward Dobbie\u00a0 and Herbert Kilpin, the latter of whom would later become a founding member of AC Milan. In 1891, Savage signed for Internazionale Torino, following the merger between Torino Football & Cricket Club and Nobili Torino, once again playing alongside Dobbie and Kiplin, as well as compatriot George Beaton\u00a0. During Savage's time at Internazionale Torino, he captained the club, as well as being called up for an Italian representative side on 30 April 1899 in a 2\u20130 loss against a Swiss representative side, in which is now seen as a precursor to the Italian national team.\nIn 1900, Savage signed for Juventus, becoming the first foreign player at the club. Over the course of two seasons, Savage made five appearances with Juventus. Savage is best known, however, for providing Juventus with their famous black and white striped shirts. In 1901, after seeing the state of Juventus' pink shirts, which Savage likened to being similar to a \"gang of war survivors\", Savage sent a letter to Nottingham-based tailoring company Shaw and Shrewsbury, requesting new shirts for the club. Nearly a month later, Savage presented his teammates with new black and white shirts, the same colours of former club Notts County. Initially, Juventus' Italian players were not keen on the shirts, with Juventus founding member Domenico Donna comparing them to funeral attire, however, opinions were soon changed, following the upturn in Juventus' form, with Donna labelling the new shirts as \"a symbol of old fashioned Piedmontese elegance\". Juventus' close connections with Notts County remain into the 21st century, with Notts County being chosen to play Juventus to open their new Juventus Stadium in September 2011.\nFollowing his time at Juventus, Savage refereed the 1902 Italian Football Championship final between Genoa and AC Milan.\n",
    "School\nThe Pre-Military Mechina Bnei David known as Eli Mechina is the first pre-military academy established in Israel. The mechina was founded by Rabbis Eli Sadan and Yigal Levinstein in the settlement of Eli. Over the years, additional institutions have been established alongside the mechina, including a higher yeshiva, a yeshiva for army graduates and seminary for girls. These institutions are called \"Bnei David-Eli Institutions\", and they are headed by Rabbis Sadan and Levinstein.\nHistory\nThe preparatory mechina was established in 1988 by Rabbis Sadan and Levinstein, owners in Mateh Binyamin. It was established to allow religious young men enlisting for full military service to do so with Torah values and strengthening their religious identity. The need for its establishment arose, among other things, from the fact that military service led to a decline in the observance of Torah and commandments among many religious young men who enlisted immediately after high school. In light of this, the study content at the mechina is somewhat different from the traditional yeshiva study. There is a special emphasis on the study of thought and philosophy according to the teachings of Rabbi Kook, as preparation for the encounter with secular society during military service, with the challenges involved. However, the studies at the Bnei David mechina include in-depth and comprehensive Talmud study in a yeshiva style. The mechina is ideologically affiliated with the \"Yeshivot HaKav\" (line yeshivas).\n46 graduates of the academy were killed in their service in the IDF and in hostile actions, including Roi Klein, who was awarded the Medal of Courage, Emmanuel Moreno - a lieutenant colonel in the Sayeret Matkal, Eliraz Peretz, and Hadar Goldin. During the Israel-Hamas war, 21 graduates of the mechina were killed.\nIsrael Prize\nAs the first and one of the most prominent pre-military academies, Bnei David is considered a symbol of pre-military academies and religious Zionism, and has been visited by, among others, President Reuven Rivlin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In 2016, the Israel Prize was awarded to Rabbi Eli Sadan for lifetime achievement and special contribution to society and the state. The prize committee's reasoning stated: \"Rabbi Sadan's actions not only led to a significant increase in the number of young people interested in meaningful military service and integrating into society as involved and caring citizens, but they also built a bridge and connection between parts of society and brought closer the different streams that make up Israeli society. His actions led to significant joint efforts for the common good through closeness and understanding while ensuring the imparting of values.  The graduates of the academies are very prominent in the public sector, in the fields of welfare and society, in education and volunteering, and in other mission-oriented roles. In the diverse places where they integrate, the dedication, motivation, care, and \"big thinking\" they absorbed during their studies at the academies are evident.\"\nPreparation for Military Service\nUnlike some other preparatory programs, the students of this program defer their enlistment through a high yeshiva track for about one to two years (\"Torato Umanuto\" and after the deferral, enlist for a regular three-year service. About ninety percent of first-year students continue to the second year. During vacations, the students receive training in navigation and basic weapons training. The program has produced a number of high-ranking officers in the military. In an average cycle, which includes about 140 students, over 50% continue to officer training courses and command roles. In 2021, 22 students from the institutions completed an officer training course in one cycle. The program frequently hosts lectures by senior military officers, who talk about IDF operations and the command track.\n",

Some scholars believe Phalguna Krishna Panchami to be his birth date. In some parts of the subcontinent, scholars believe Kartika Shukla Dvadashi to be his birthday. In Gujarat, Yajnavalkya's birthday is considered to be on the seventh day in the month of Kartika.\nLiterature\nAccording to the Puranas, Yajnavalkya is considered to be an incarnation of Brahma, and he is sometimes regarded to be a Brahmarshi. In one legend, when Brahma gave place to Gayatri instead of his wife Savitri in a yajna, Savitri cursed him in anger due to which he was later born as Yajnavalkya in the house of a sage named Charana.\nAccording to the Skanda Purana, Brahma incarnated himself as Yajnavalkya in response to a curse from Shiva.\nAccording to the Mahabharata, Vaisampayana, Yajnavalkya's maternal uncle and renowned teacher of the Vedas, grew resentful when the latter received knowledge of the sacred texts from Surya and started teaching them. A dispute arose between the two men regarding the selection of the dakshina (honorarium) to be offered at the sacrifice of Janaka. In the Vishnu Purana, Vaisampayana is replaced by Paila. Vyasa asked Yajnavalkya to return the knowledge of the Vedas which he had obtained, and the latter promptly regurgitated them from his mouth. Two other sages present took the form of tittiri birds and instantly devoured the texts, thus lending them the name Taittiriya Upanishad. In the same text, Yajnavalkya wins Janaka as a disciple as well as a reward of one thousand cows from the latter after offering satisfactory answers to his questions, proving himself to be a consummate scholar.\nHe is attributed the authorship of a number of texts such as the Shatapatha Brahmana, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Ishopanishad, Pratyekshasutra, Yajnavalkaya Smriti, and the Yoga Yajnavalkya, and is hence regarded a significant figure in ancient Indian philosophy. \nAccording to the Matsya Purana, Yajnavalkya is referred the Gotrakar of the Vasishtha clan, bearing the name Yajnadatta. Yajnavalkya has also been referred to as Kaushika in many texts, including the Mahabharata.\nObservances\nHis birth anniversary is celebrated every year with great reverence and devotion. On this occasion, prayers, worship and meetings are organized all over India and the texts written by Rishi Shrestha are recited. Also, people try to implement his teachings in their lives and guide themselves. The philosophy of Yajnavalkya is considered to be the philosophy of the soul. Yajnavalkya Jayanti is celebrated with great enthusiasm by the Brahmin communities in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. It is also celebrated in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.\nEvery year on the Phalguna Shukla Panchami, one day cultural program is organised at the campus of the Yajnavalkya Ashram in the Mithila region locally known as Yajnavalkya Mahotsava.\n",

Le Comte\".\nThe three generations of women who inspired Reynold's Madam La Compt include Mme. Marie Joseph Le Compte, her daughter, Marie Josette, and mother, Marie Josephte, and perhaps her grandmother, Marie Magdeleine. Although much of these women's lives are centered in Fort St. Joseph, Fort Michilimackinac, and Cahokia, it began in the late 17th century in the frontier of New France with Symphorosa Ouaouaboukoue, a Native American woman, likely a Menominee, and Jean Baptiste R\u00e9aume, parents of Marie Magdeleine. French government in Quebec operated forts throughout the territory for fur trading. This family engaged in the fur trade and supplied food and goods to fur traders and the forts. As they navigated through their lives, many indigenous people were their friends, some were enemies of the forts, where more people lived with families. Later generations lived in Cahokia, a settlement on the Mississippi River, across from what is now St. Louis, Missouri. It was an important fur trading center and along the fur trade river network within New France.\nLegend\nMadam La Compte was born in Fort St. Joseph, New France of Canada, then lived in Mackinac between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, both of which were part of New France of Canada when she lived there and ultimately became the state of Michigan. From about 1765, she lived in an area west of Lake Michigan, 50 years before the city of Chicago was founded.\n\"Madam La Compt\" appears in the Pioneer History of Illinois written by the former Governor of Illinois, John Reynolds (1788\u20131865). The book is based on Reynolds' memories and contains many factual errors. According to Reynolds, the woman who became \"Madam La Compt\" was born in 1734 at Fort St. Joseph, New France of Canada. She married three times, first to Pelate Sainte Ange and they moved to the Chicago area. In 1780, she married Monsier La Compt, a French Canadian, at Cahokia. They had a lot of children. After her second husband's death, she married Thomas (Tom) Brady.\nHer neighbors, living along the lakes, included Potawatomi, Kickapoo people, and other neighboring Native American tribes. She became influential among the tribes, by learning their languages, requesting their opinions, and looking out for their interests. When warned multiple times of impending attacks on white settlements, she went to the tribe's encampment and stayed there while she mediated for the ending of the planned attack.\nOn one night she met several hundred warriors near the French village at Quentin Mound, where they had camped. At times like these, she might stay with them several days as they talked through their grievances. The inhabitants of the village were often waiting, with their arms in their hands, ready for defence; when they would see this extraordinary woman escorting to the village a great band of warriors, changed from war to peace. The Indians were painted black, indicating the sorrow they entertained for their hostile movements against their friends. The Indians feasted for days, in the villages. They would remain in peace for some time after these reconciliations. Madam La Compt died in Cahokia in 1843.\nThe story was repeated in Henry McCormick's The women of Illinois in 1913, where she was called the \"Frontier Angel\",, in Adolph Suess's The romantic story of Cahokia, Illinois in 1947 and in Illinois historical publications. The Illinois State Historical Society stated that the events occurred during the Revolutionary War (1775 to 1783) and until 1795.\nDoubts on its authenticity\nUlrich Danckers wrote that John Reynolds created a legend of \"Madam La Compt\" that was actually about her daughter, Marie Joseph La Marche, who lived with her husband Louis Le Compte from about 1772 to 1808. All three women \u2014 Marie Josephte L'Archev\u00eaque (born ca. 1733), Marie Joseph La Marche (Mme Le Comte, born 1753), and Marie Josette Languedoc (born ca. 1773) \u2014 died by the time he published the book in 1859.\nJohn Francis McDermott wrote in 1949 that he believed \"Madam La Compt\" is based upon Marie Josephte L'Archev\u00eaque and Marie Joseph La Marche. Besides the two or three women, Reynolds' adventurous story may also include experiences of Mme. Le Compte's grandmother and her second husband Louis-Therese Chevalier, both leaders in the St. Joseph community.\nReynolds moved to Illinois in 1800 and came to know Marie Joseph La Marche, whose second husband was Louis Le Compte, and Marie Josette Languedoc, her daughter with Joseph Languedoc.\nFort St. Joseph, Fort Michilimackinac, and Cahokia figure in the lives of the women.

    "The 2023 Cricket World Cup match between India and Pakistan.\nCricket is the most popular sport in South Asia, with 90% of the sport's worldwide fans being in the region.\nHistory\nColonial era\nOne reason for cricket's initial adoption in South Asia was its similarity to local games, such as gilli-danda (pictured above) and seven stones.\nThis section is an excerpt from Cricket in India \u00a7 History.\nCricket was brought to India in the early 1700s, with the first documented insurance of cricket being played in 1721. At the time of its introduction, it was used as a medium for Indians to integrate into British cultural norms. By serving as a bridge between the two groups, it made assimilating much easier. In its early time in India, it was played and used by Indian elites to gain favor with the British which not only aided in the value of the sport due to its association with the elite but its high status helped it spread throughout India. Although it began as a foreign sport, the sport ultimately became associated with India and began to play a role in India's identity. In the late 1800s, cricket's image began to move away from being an exclusively upper class sport as players from lower castes and underprivileged communities began to play and make their mark. Overtime, cricket shifted from an English introduced game and began to weave itself into the fabric of Indian culture and community. Although other games remained prominent in the eyes of the media, cricket's increased association with India and its label as an Indian sport began to grow which diminished the importance of other sports in the public eye.\nContemporary era\nAn Afghan soldier playing cricket. Afghan refugees who lived in Pakistan and India brought the sport back to Afghanistan, and it is now one of the most popular sports in the country.\nCricket has helped shape national identities across South Asia, contributing to the self-esteem of peoples throughout the region and creating cultural bonds between them. The game has played a role in reducing caste discrimination and other social barriers among South Asians. Cricket's role in South Asia has often been associated with local geopolitical events; for example, India-Pakistan matches have been affected and even cancelled at times due to tensions between the two countries, while the opposing sides in the Sri Lankan Civil War were willing to declare a ceasefire for the duration of the 2007 Cricket World Cup.\nCricket started to become the most popular sport in South Asia around the time of India's 1983 Cricket World Cup victory, overtaking the previous local favorite field hockey. Further growth happened with the televising of cricket in regional languages. Another major milestone in Indian cricket was the 2007 launch of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which has become one of the wealthiest sports leagues in the world. These developments have led to South Asia becoming very important in world cricket's decision-making, and being a financially important place for other countries to tour when playing international cricket.\nIndia and Pakistan have a very heated cricket rivalry, with India-Pakistan cricket matches (particularly at global events) being some of the highest-viewed matches in global sport. Cricket has been suggested by a number of commentators as a possible way to create peace between the two countries.\nSee also\nSport in South Asia\nSouth Asian diaspora#Sport\nStreet cricket (also known as gully cricket in South Asia)\nTennis ball cricket\n",
    "The Altai Gold Rush, a mountain range in Siberia whose name comes from a Turko-Mongolian word meaning \"gold coin\" (cf. Altun), peaked in the middle of the CE.19th century, after having begun in the previous century, when silver deposits were also exploited for their gold content.\nHistory\nThe Ore Altai\u00a0 is found mainly in the region between the Tcharysh and Irtysh rivers. For precious metals, the Altai, considered the natural southern limit of Siberia, has two mineralogical regions. The Nerchinsk, with its gold-bearing sands, had silver mines in operation since the years 1720, penalized by the extreme poverty of the ore and worked by populations of the Finnish race, on the extreme borders of Siberia and then exploited by Akenfi Demidoff. That of the Alataou mountains, where gold mining is much more recent, sees its expansion date back only to 1830.\n\"A considerable quantity of gold and silver from the mines of Siberia, the region of Nerchinsk and the mountains of Altai] arrived by the last sledges,\" says the Gazette de France of April 4, 1772, taking news from St. Petersburg, Gold and silver from the mines of Siberia, the region of Nerchinsk and the mountains of Altai]\"'. Their greatest prosperity was reached around 1765, and it was gold that was sought at the beginning of the following century, by the chemical dissolution of silver, mined in Kbolivano-Voskressenski, and in the vicinity of Nerchinsk, where 12 mines annually supply 3000 poods (one pud represents 16 kilos) in 1838, i.e. 48 tons of silver. The Altai, a word which means \"the golden mountain range\" in Turko-Mongolian, is also found in rich mines at Schlangenberg, Smeinogorsk, Ridderski and Syrianowski. This Altai gold rush was followed by a Ural Gold Rush, which lasted a little longer.\nIn 1829, the German naturalist, geographer and explorer Alexander von Humboldt led a scientific expedition to the Altai, in order to study terrestrial magnetism and geology. Organized by the Emperor of Russia, it counted among its members the scientist Plato of Chihatcheff\u00a0, (1802\u20131892), author thirteen years later of the first two ascents of the Pic d'Aneto, summit of the Pyrenees The exploitation of the gold districts of the Altai was then shared between individuals and the Russian crown. By reserving for itself the western side of the chain, the latter has handed over the eastern side to the efforts of private industry. The 20% to 25% duty levied for the benefit of the Tsar of Russia, however, encourages some of the gold extracted to be concealed, as much as possible: only a fifth of the production is declared, according to an engineer's estimate.\nAlexander von Humboldt calculated that the gold production of the whole of Russia accelerated between 1823 and 1838, thanks to the mines of the Altai, with an average of 15.2 tons of gold per year. In 1836, 293 golden poods (one pood is equal to about 16 kilograms) came from the Urals and 104 poods from the Altai. The following year, in 1837, the Altai gave 160 golden poods and the Ural 309 poods. In 1844, layers of gold sand of the same type as those of the Urals were discovered in the Altai, the production of which was distributed to the east by the Popof house, which specialized in the trade of Inner Asia. As a result, in 1845, the Urals yielded only 5 tons of gold and the Altai 16 tons. The year 1847 was the peak of gold production in Russia. The Mining Administration shows a figure of 28.5 tons for the combined results of the Ural and Altai.\n",
    "At least two local elections that directly elect chiefs of township were held in December 1998 in China. Although not considered as a mature democratic process and were not widely known, these two polls were still remarked with historical significance as they resulted in the first popularly elected executive leaders since the founding of the communist state.\nBackground\nThe 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1978 marked the start of \"Reform and Opening Up\", the policy of economic reform. Following the meeting, political reforms were pursued, albeit at a limited scale. On 1 July 1979, the 5th National People's Congress (NPC) enacted election law\u00a0 that regulates the NPC and people's congresses at local level, and a new legislation on local governance\u00a0 that includes expansion of election coverage. Pilot schemes were implemented for the election of county-level people's congresses between late 1979 and early 1980 by the Ministry of Civil Affairs under the directives of the CCP Central Committee, and the first formal election was held during that period. The two legislation were further amended in 1982, 1986, and 1995.:8-12 In 1997, the Central Committee asserted that \"grass-root regimes and autonomous organisations of townships shall have sound democratic electoral systems\". A year later the Law on Organization of Village Committees was implemented, and Sichuan branch of the CCP ordered other cities and townships in March 1998 to follow the precedence of Bazhong, where executives of the city were chosen by \"public nomination and selection\" mechanism (Chinese: \u516c\u63a8\u516c\u9009). In September Sichuan CCP published tentative rules on choosing executives and party seniors in towns and townships, which allows them to be nominated by organisations, public, or self-nomination, or through examinations. Between October and 27 December 1998, all 178 deputy chiefs of the 79 towns and townships in Nanbu County were chosen by the public nomination mechanism.:435\nNancheng Township\nNancheng local election was held on 5 December 1998 to elect the new Chief and Deputy Chief of Nancheng Township\u00a0, Qingshen County, Sichuan. Incumbent Deputy Chief Shang Zhizhong was elected as the new Chief, while a nonpartisan candidate succeeded Shang as the new deputy.\nPrelude\nFollowing the provincial directive and with the arrangement of the Sichuan CCP, the local governments and party branches of Nancheng Township and Qingshen County, the upper administrative division, started planning the direct election of Nancheng Township chief and deputy chief. An opinion polling was conducted with a total of 750 questionnaire distributed.:434\u20135 Amongst the 723 responses, more than 95% of party executives and 85% of villagers agreed to the elections.:376\nAs a result, Qingshen County CCP, under the arrangement of the Sichuan CCP, established task force and election committee to materialise the election. Nancheng people's congress adopted three bills (on implementing the trial work of the direct election, the primary election, and the formal election) and a resolution (that confirms an election would be held) on 5 November that provide details of the conduct of the election.:376\nElectoral system\nResolutions adopted set out the eligibility of the election. Candidate of the township chief and the three deputies may be chosen amongst the residents. The chief shall have at least two years of experience as a deputy section head of a department (Chinese: \u526f\u79d1\u957f) or other senior positions in the county's administration; a university degree; a Chinese Communist Party membership, and shall not be aged 40 or above. The deputy chief shall have at least three years of working experience in county's administration, people's organization, or township's administration; have completed high school; and shall not be aged 40 or above, but party membership is not compulsory.:440 One of the elected deputy chief shall be a woman and another shall be at most 30 years old. Residents fulfilling these criteria may receive early nomination.:376\nPotential nominee may nominate themselves, or be nominated by electorates or recommended by the party. They also need to be vetted by Nancheng and Qingshen CCP before entering the primary, which residents would select two candidates for township chief and four for deputy.:440 In the formal election on 5 December, each person is entitled to one vote for township chief, and three votes for deputy chief.:376:440\nCampaign\n10 people were nominated for the township chief but two withdrew later, and 5 withdrew amongst the 27 deputy chief nominees. Nancheng party branch then vetted the remaining nominees, approving 4 and 15 nominees for chief and deputy chief election respectively.:442 A further screening by Qingshen's official confirmed 3 candidates competing for the chief, and 8 candidates for the deputy chief.:377\nA campaigning conference was organised on 19 November at the Nancheng primary school.

    "1991 song by Tony Banks and Nik Kershaw\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" is a song by English musician Tony Banks featuring English singer Nik Kershaw. It was released by Virgin on 7 May 1991 as the lead single from Banks's third solo studio album, Still. The song was written by Banks and Kershaw, and produced by Banks and Nick Davis. It reached number 76 in the UK Singles Chart.\nBackground\nTony Banks collaborated with Nik Kershaw after getting in contact with him by phone. Banks became an admirer of Kershaw after getting a copy of his 1989 album The Works. He later recalled the album had \"some wonderful stuff on it\" and liked Kershaw's voice. Banks told Sound on Sound in 1991, \"He was very enthusiastic about working with me, and it was nice that he decided to sing my songs, seeing as he'd never sung for anyone else.\" Kershaw co-wrote two tracks with Banks and provided vocals on them and another track for Banks' album Still: \"Red Day on Blue Street\", \"I Wanna Change the Score\" and \"The Final Curtain\".\nRelease\nAlthough Kershaw's name appeared alongside Banks's on the single's picture sleeve, it was omitted on the vinyl's label by Virgin Records. Banks told Simon Mayo in 1991, \"I wanted to have the  as 'Nik Kershaw with Tony Banks' but the record company said people would probably think it was Nik's record anyway and they were worried it might not be associated with the  album. But they weren't supposed to go as far as leaving his name off!\"\nMusic video\nThe song's music video was directed by Nick Willing. It features Banks and Kershaw performing the song as the background changes to show them in different locations and settings.\nCritical reception\nUpon its release as a single, Music & Media called \"I Wanna Change the Score\" a \"catchy track\". Andrew Hirst of the Huddersfield Daily Examiner noted that the \"artful chorus is badly let down by the bland bits inbetween\". Marcus Hodge of the Cambridge Evening News commented, \"Kershaw sounds remarkably like his protege, Chesney Hawkes, but he seems to have given Chesney his best song as this is quite dreary.\" South Wales Echo gave a one out of five star rating and wrote, \"The score is nil-nil, both deserve the red card for taking part in this meaningless MOR friendly.\"\nTrack listing\n7\u2013inch single (UK and Europe) and cassette single (UK)\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" \u2013 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" \u2013 4:41\n12\u2013inch single (UK and Europe)\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" \u2013 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" \u2013 4:41\n\"Big Man\" \u2013 4:10\nCD single (UK)\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" \u2013 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" \u2013 4:41\n\"Big Man\" \u2013 4:10\n\"The Waters of Lethe\" \u2013 6:31\nCD single (Japan)\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" \u2013 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" \u2013 4:41\nPersonnel\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\"\nNik Kershaw \u2013 vocals\nDaryl Stuermer \u2013 guitar\nTony Banks \u2013 keyboards\nJames Eller \u2013 bass\nGraham Broad \u2013 drums\nLu\u00eds Jardim \u2013 percussion\n\"Hero for an Hour\"\nTony Banks \u2013 vocals, keyboards, bass synth\nDaryl Stuermer \u2013 guitar\nMartin Robertson \u2013 saxophone\nVinnie Colaiuta \u2013 drums\nLu\u00eds Jardim \u2013 percussion\nProduction\nTony Banks \u2013 production (all tracks)\nNick Davis \u2013 production and engineering (\"I Wanna Change the Score\", \"Hero for an Hour\")\nMark Robinson \u2013 assistant engineering (\"I Wanna Change the Score\", \"Hero for an Hour\")\nSteve Hillage \u2013 production (\"Big Man\")\nSteve Chase \u2013 engineering (\"Big Man\")\nDavid Hentschel \u2013 production and engineering (\"The Waters of Lethe\")\nDavid Bascombe \u2013 engineering (\"The Waters of Lethe\")\nOther\nCarl Studna \u2013 photography\nWherefore Art \u2013 design\nCharts\n",

She graduated in 1929. After graduation, she taught physics and mathematics at a school in Rostov-on-Don until 1930. Blinova then worked as a meteorologist in the North Caucasus Weather Bureau Hydrometeorlogical Service of the Soviet Union.\nIn 1931 Blinova began a three-year internship in Leningrad at the main geophysical observatory named after Alexander Voeikov. Blinova specialized in dynamic meteorology and in 1934 successfully defended her dissertation for her candidacy as a doctorate. She then because a research assistant at the institute.\nIn 1936, Blinova continued the work of mathematician Nikolai Kotschin, investigating the conditions for the stability of weather fronts. Then in 1938 she began studying atmospheric circulation. She developed a complete theory of radiative equilibrium in the atmosphere. She examined the wave-like disturbances in the general east\u2013west flow in the atmosphere, which enabled her to quantitatively explain atmospheric centers of activity. She also analyzed the formation and development of tropical cyclones, anticyclones and other macro-processes. After the start of the German-Soviet war and the Leningrad Blockade, she evacuated to Yekaterinburg with the staff of the observatory.\nIn 1943 Blinova was transferred to the Central Weather Forecasting Institute in Moscow. She developed methods for long-term weather forecasting by integrating the Friedmann vortex equation. She successfully defended her doctoral dissertation in 1946 for her doctorate in physical-mathematical sciences.  In 1953 she was elected a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences.\nBlinova worked at the Institute of Applied Geophysics in Moscow beginning in 1958. From 1961 onward she headed the Department of Planetary Dynamics of the Atmosphere of the Meteorological Computing Center at the Hydrometeorological Service of the USSR.\nBlinova married the mathematician and meteorologist Ilya Afanasyevich Kibel.

    "Bugle is a British car brand founded in 1970.\nBrand history\nRoland Sharman, who already had experience selling VW buggies from GP, founded Bugle Automotive Traction & Manufacturing Company of London in Fulham in 1970. There was a connection to Lotusmere. The production of automobiles began. The brand name is Bugle. After a fire the company moved to Reading in 1971. In 1971 the name was changed to Bugle Development & Marketing Ltd. In 1972 another fire caused the temporary end.\nIn the early 1970s Stephen Foster of Fibresports of Basildon purchased some molds, made kits with them and offered them between 1972 and 1979. The brand name is not known.\nFrom 1979 to 1985, Chris Watson of CW Autos of Yorkshire continued production and marketing as Bugle. In 1995 James Hall of GT Moldings of Portslade took over the original molds, redesigned them and offered kits until 2003. Brothers Tony and Rob Armstrong from Chelmsford took over the project in 2003, founded Bugle Buggies and have been making Bugles ever since. A total of around 891 copies have been created so far.\nExports have so far taken place to the US, Saudi Arabia, Malta, Portugal, Cyprus, Jordan, Sardinia and Switzerland.\nVehicles\nBuggy\nVW buggies are created. At first they resembled the American Bugetta. The basis is a shortened chassis from the VW Beetle. Hussein I of Jordan ordered four vehicles and Rocket Wheel Industries of California ordered 75 kits. The price of \u00a3160 for a kit in the early 1970s was higher than comparable offers. Since 1995, the chassis have been shortened less.\nA vehicle was auctioned at the end of 2017 for \u00a34,840.\nBuggy Plus 2\nThis model was only available from 1970 to 1972 (by Bugle Automotive Traction & Manufacturing Company of London) and from 1979 to 1985 (by CW Autos).

    "Chinese real estate platform\nKE Holdings Inc. (KE; Chinese: \u8d1d\u58f3\u63a7\u80a1\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8; pinyin: B\u00e8ik\u00e9 K\u00f2ngg\u01d4 Y\u01d2uxi\u00e0n G\u014dngs\u012b) is a publicly listed Chinese real estate holding company that engages in the provision of an integrated online and offline platform for housing transactions and services through its subsidiaries. It is the largest online real estate transaction platform in China.\nInvestors often refer to the collective business as \"Beike\".\nBackground\nLianjia (formerly Homelink) was founded as a real estate brokerage by Zuo Hui in November 2001 with an initial staff of 27 people.\nDue to the competition for real estate brokerages, information was not centralized and it was difficult to maintain accurate up to date information.  In April 2018, Zuo, Peng Yongdong and Shan Yigang launched Beike, an online platform that helps match customer to real estate agents. KE was incorporated in July 2018 as a holding company for both Lianjia and Beike.\nAt the start, Beike drew most of its senior management from Lianjia. It aimed to establish an independent third-party trading platform similar to Taobao that would allow resources to be open to all real estate agents. Zuo came up with the idea of an agent cooperation network after studying multiple service listing systems in the U.S.\nKE received financial backing from Tencent, SoftBank Group and Hillhouse Investment.\nIn August 2020, KE held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) raising US$2.12\u00a0billion. On the first day of trading, the stock jumped 87% valuing the company at just under US$40\u00a0billion.\nIn May 2022, KE became a dual-listed company after it listed its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\nBusiness structure\nKE owns two majors businesses. Lianjia and Beike. Lianjia is a real estate agent while Beike is an online platform that helps match customers to estate agents (which includes Lianjia). Lianjia has been compared to Redfin while Beike has been compared to Zillow. \nKE operates four business segments:\nExisting home transaction services\nNew home transaction services\nHome renovation and furnishing\nEmerging and other services\nControversies\nOn 20 May 2021, KE's co-founder and then chairman, Zuo died of illness resulting in KE's stock price dropping more than 10% afterwards. According to a shareholder, although Zuo was diagnosed with cancer several years ago, KE never disclosed his health issues in its regulatory filing which could raise the risk of allegations of failure to disclose key information. Peng succeeded by Peng who became KE's new chairman.\nShortly after, it was stated that the State Administration for Market Regulation was investigating KE for suspected anticompetitive practices. However KE via WeChat released a statement saying it was \"fake news\".\nIn December 2021, Muddy Waters Research announced it taken a short position against KE after it released a report stating that KE had committed \"systemic fraud\" and inflated its sales and revenue figures in its financial statements. KE stated the report was flawed and had used an invalid methodology although it would conduct an internal review of the allegations. Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP launched a class action lawsuit on behalf of investors against KE accusing its disseminating false and misleading Information. In April 2024, judge Gregory H. Woods dismissed most of the shareholder case but stated there was some validity based on the report that KE's filings did contain false statements.\nIn April 2022, KE was added to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission watchlist after failing afoul the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.\n",
    "Irish nationalist\nHervey Montmorency Morres (7 March 1767 \u2013 9 May 1839) was an Irish nationalist.\nBiography\nMorres was the eldest son of Matthew Montmorency Morres and Margaret, second daughter of Francis Magan of Emo, co. Westmeath. He was born at Rathailean Castle, County Tipperary, on 7 March 1767. At the age of fifteen he entered the Austrian service. He served as ensign under Field-marshal Lacy against the Turks, distinguishing himself at the siege of Belgrade in 1789, and was transferred with the rank of lieutenant into Count Kavanagh's regiment of cuirassiers. He subsequently served as a volunteer in the army of Prince Hohenlohe against the French republic, and commanded a company of skirmishers at the siege of Thionville. He fought with distinction in the army of the Rhine under Marshal Wurmser in 1793, and was afterwards aide-de-camp to Prince Charles of Fiirstemberg. He quitted the Austrian service in 1795, and, having in September of that year married Louise de Helmstadt at Heidelberg, he returned to Ireland and took up his residence at Knockalton in co. Tipperary. Shortly after his arrival he addressed a memorial to the lord-lieutenant, the Earl of Camden, on the disturbed state of Ireland, advocating the formation of a strong military force, composed impartially of Catholics and Protestants. He was thanked for his suggestions, but informed that they were impracticable.\nOn the rumour of Hoche's expedition in 1796 he accepted a commission as aide-de-camp to General Dundas; but, becoming disgusted at the violent measures of government, he became in November of that year a United Irishman. He was chosen a county representative for Tipperary in May 1797, and nominated colonel of the regiment of Nenagh infantry. In February 1798 he was attached to the general military committee, and soon after appointed adjutant-general of Munster. He was very active in forwarding the organisation of his province, and, subsequent to the arrest of the Leinster Directory on 12 March, he was made a member of the new executive. He avoided an attempt that was made to arrest him on 28 April, and having been assigned the capture of the batteries and magazines in the Phoenix Park, he was busily engaged in working out his plans when the whole scheme of the insurrection was frustrated by the capture of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Morres managed to escape from Dublin on 4 June, and lay concealed in co. Westmeath till the arrival of Jean Joseph Amable Humbert's expedition on 22 August. Thinking that Humbert would not immediately risk a decisive engagement, he endeavoured to restrain the ardour of the men of Westmeath\u00a0; but after the passage of the Shannon, 'taking part in the right flank of Lord Cornwallis's army, with a body of from two to three thousand ill-armed peasants and several chiefs of the union, he made such dispositions as he judged might prove most favourable to the progress of the invading army' (Castlereagh Corresp. ii. 95).\nAfter the capitulation of the French army at Ballinamuck he escaped to Dublin, and thence through England to Hamburg, where he arrived on 7 October. He was cordially welcomed, as an old friend of her husband, by Lady Fitzgerald; but, having been included by name in the Rebel Fugitives Act, he did not feel secure in Hamburg, and applied to the French resident, Marragon, for permission to proceed to France. His apprehensions were not unfounded. His secret correspondence with the French minister was revealed to the English cabinet by Samuel Turner and on 24 November he was arrested, at the instance of the British agent, Sir James Crawford, at the American Arms, together with James Napper Tandy, William Corbet, and James Bartholomew Blackwell. This act was contrary to the law of nations and despite the protests of Marragon. After ten months' close confinement the senate of Hamburg consented to his extradition, and at midnight on 28 September 1799 he was, with his three companions, conveyed on board an English frigate at Cuxhaven. The subserviency of the senate of Hamburg caused universal indignation, and drew down upon them Napoleon's wrath, which was only appeased by the payment of a fine of four millions and a half francs and a public apology. The arrival of Morres and his companions in England caused considerable excitement, but they were shortly afterwards removed for trial to Ireland. The prosecution against Morres and Tandy broke down on a point of law. Morres pleaded that he had been arrested eight days before the time assigned by the act for his voluntary surrender had expired, and, after a long argument, his objection was sustained by Lord Kilwarden. But it was not till 10 December 1801, after more than three years' imprisonment, that he was released on bail. His wife having died at the age of twenty-six, on the very day of his arrest at Hamburg, Morres, after a brief visit to Paris, married, at Dublin, Helen, widow of Dr. John Esmonde, hanged as a traitor in 1798, and daughter of Bartholomew",

    "Not to be confused with the 13th-century Chronicle of the Abbey of St Edmund.\nThe ruins of Bury St Edmunds Abbey.\nThe Bury Chronicle (Latin: Chronica or Cronica Buriensis), Bury St Edmunds Chronicle, or Chronicle of Bury St Edmunds, formerly also known as the Chronica Abbreviata (\"Abbreviated Chronicle\"), is a medieval English chronicle compiled by John of Taxster and two other unknown Benedictine monks of Bury St Edmunds Abbey in the 13th and 14th centuries.\nAuthorship\nThe first part of the Bury Chronicle was compiled by John of Taxster or Tayster, who claimed to have joined the monastery in 1244 or 1255. Galbraith makes the first date that of Taxster's vows and the second that of the first continuator's. The issue is somewhat obscured by the mistaken dual chronology introduced by Marianus Scotus and employed by John of Worcester and Taxster.\nFrom the year 1265, another monk continued his work and, from Easter 25 March 1296, a third monk continued their work. The second author\u2014often but baselessly identified as John of Everden\u2014also revised Taxster's account, including some additional information on the monastery's finances and adding several passages from a few classical authors and medieval historians. The third author did not share the second's interest in financial matters, although he continued to record military and local details. Galbraith believed the poor phrasing and many mistakes of the second continuator's text resulted from a less educated monk piously appending a rough draft of the first continuator about 50 years later without much understanding of what he was transcribing.\nContents\nThe Bury Chronicle generally directly copies its source texts from the Creation to the year 1212. Most items up to 1131 are taken from John of Worcester, probably from the copy now held as Bodleian Library MS 297, which includes substantial additions concerning the history of the abbey. Other items are taken either directly or via secondary sources from Apuleius's Golden Ass, Aulus Gellius's Attic Nights, Justin's summary of Trogus's Philippic History, Eutropius's Summary of Roman History, Jerome's translation of Eusebius's Onomasticon, Augustine's Confessions and City of God, Boethius's Consolations of Philosophy, Gildas's On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain, Bede's Ecclesiastical History, Herman of Bury's On the Miracles of St Edmund, John of Salisbury's Policraticus, William of Malmesbury's Deeds of the Kings of the English and Deeds of the Bishops of the English, Freculf's 12 Books of History, Peter the Devourer's Scholastic History, and Sigebert of Gembloux's Chronicle. From 1131 to around 1212, its main sources are Ralph de Diceto's Chronicle and the Annals of St Edmunds (Annales Sancti Edmundi, BL Harley MS 447). (The exact beginning of Taxster's original contributions is uncertain because the only surviving manuscript of the Annals is missing its final pages.)\nMarginalia in the revised and continued version note its additions to Taxster's account came from Apuleius, Orosius, Eutropius, Boethius, Freculf, Marianus Scotus, and John of Worcester. Although the account has been said to end in 1301, its general record actually ends in 1300 with only minor entries afterwards in the years 1301, 1313, 1326, 1329, 1334, and 1335.\nLegacy\nContent from the Bury Chronicle was subsequently used by numerous other historians and annalists in eastern England, including John of Eversden, John of Oxnead, and Bartholomew Cotton.\nManuscripts\nTaxster's section of the Bury Chronicle survives in 2 manuscripts. The first, possibly Taxster's own holograph, comprises folios 3 to 43 verso of British Library MS Cotton Julius A 1. It was damaged somewhat by the 1731 Cottonian Library fire. The other comprises folios 109 to 124 verso of Arundel MS 6, once the property of John Erghome (fl.\u20091353\u20131385), Edward North, and William Howard and now held by the College of Arms, used as a continuation of a version of John of Worcester's Chronica Chronicarum (Chronicle of Chronicles). This only contains the first continuation to Taxster's work, ending in 1295.\nThe revised and fully continued version of the chronicle is Arundel MS 30, held by the College of Arms. As of 2002, Antonia Gransden's 1956 dissertation providing it was the only edition of the chronicle's initial section before 1212. She subsequently published the section from 1212 to 1301 in 1964.\nJohn of Worcester's Chronicle of Chronicles was also appended with Taxster's notes in the Peterborough Abbey version held as Cambridge Corpus Christi College MS 92. The Colchester Chronicle (BL Harley MS 1132) is another version of the Bury Chronicle, unusual in ending in 1193 and in specifically crediting William of Malmesbury for its treatment of Sceafa.\nEditions\nThe full chronicle has not been published. Benjamin Thorpe published a certain number of years from the Peterborough copy in 1849, from 1152 to 1294 according to Gransden but from 1152 to 1295 according to Thorpe himself, from 1173 to 1",

    "Yugoslav partisan (1897\u20131942)\nJanko Jolovi\u0107 (January 14, 1897 in Bandin Od\u017eak - September 1942), was a Yugoslav partisan and the first president of the Regional National Liberation Committee in Rogatica.\nBiography\nEarly life\nJanko was born on January 14, 1897, in Bandin Od\u017eak on Glasinac plateau near Sarajevo. He comes from a working class but wealthy family. After the First World War, he married Ljubica, with whom he had a daughter, Jela, and three sons.\u21b5Several members of the Jolovi\u0107 family were members of the Serbian volunteer units in Russia and on the Thessaloniki front. Janko's older brother, Milivoje Jolovi\u0107, participated in the October Revolution as a Red Army fighter. After returning from Russia in 1923, he tried to convince Janko to flee to Russia, where the proletariat is in power. Janko refused and remained in his country, working and later fighting for workers and peasants' wellbeing.\nPublic and political engagements\nAt the outset of the Second World War, Janko was among the first partisans fighting Germans, with a goal of defense and ultimately liberation of people regardless of their religion and ethnicity.\nHe is listed as a member of the leadership of the KPJ and SKOJ in Sokolac - as part of the organ of the revolutionary movement before the armed uprising. Janko's party task was to organize forest workers in Romanija. On that occasion, Hasan Brki\u0107 stayed with him on several occasions, with whom he arranged the organization of URS woodworkers' unions.\nThe following were chosen for the headquarters of the Romanija company, which had to expel the Ustashe and gendarmes from the region: Slavi\u0161a Vajner \u010ci\u010da (company commander), Pavle Goranin Ilija (commissioner), Oskar Danon Jovo (assistant commander), Danilo \u0110oki\u0107 (assistant commander), Slobodan Princip, Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 and Brnako Milutinovi\u0107 \"Obren\" (staff members).\nJanko and \u010ci\u010da organized gatherings in Bandina Od\u017eak and invited people from all the villages of Glasinac to join the company. Janko visited Serbian, Croatian and Muslim villages, organized village guards, listed volunteers and assigned them to \u010ci\u010da's company.\nIn August 1941, he participated in the liberation of Sokolac, Vlasenica and surrounding towns. In September of the same year, the free territory extended from Romanija all the way to the Drina. Soon after that, the KPJ District Committee was formed in Romanija, of which Janko was a member.\nThe liberation of Rogatica followed. The attack lasted until 16\u201323. October, when native and Ustasha troops were expelled from Rogatica. Immediately after the liberation, Janko approached the formation of the County NOO, whose president he was elected at the suggestion of Slavi\u0161a Vajner.\nCapture and death\nIn the spring of 1942, Janko retreated with the people from Fo\u010da towards the Piva. However, the supreme headquarters in Vrbnica made a decision that all units from Romanija would break through back to their terrain and continue the fight. Groups started to break through as soon as they were ready to move. Janko led a larger group of people with several fighters to Romanija. When they arrived in the village of Borija, they were surrounded by Chetniks. All fighters surrendered to protect the people. A group of about fifteen partisans from Romanija was taken to the forest towards Borija for shooting, but the shooting was abandoned at the last moment, so they were handed over to the Ustashe authorities in Trnovo. The Ustashe took them from Trnovo to prison in Sarajevo. Janko was soon returned to Rogatica by the Usta\u0161e, where he was imprisoned in the Regional Government (the place where his Regional People's Committee is also located). After the intervention of the people of Rogatica, Janko was released from prison.\nDuring the night of September 11, he was caught in a shepherd's hut on Bandina Od\u017eak, by the Chetnik Dobrica \u0110uki\u0107 and his Chetnik group. The Chetniks wounded his wife Ljubica by stabbing her multiple times with a bayonets, and Janko was kept tied to a spruce tree for four days. On the fifth day, Dobrica \u0110uki\u0107 and Du\u0161an Vukovi\u0107 took him under the Romanija Cliffs, a steep karstic rock face featuring a deep jama (cave) called Zvek or Bezdan, they tortured him and threw him alive into the pit.\nLegacy\nA street in the Sarajevo neighborhood of Dobrinja bears his name.\n",
    "County building in Boston, Lincolnshire, England\nCounty Hall is a municipal building in Church Close in Boston, a town in Lincolnshire, in England. It served as the offices and meeting place of Holland County Council.\nHistory\nFollowing the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, The county council of the Parts of Holland secured accommodation in the Sessions House in Boston. After finding that arrangement unsatisfactory, county leaders decided to commission dedicated offices. The site they selected was on the east side of the square off Church Close where some older buildings had once stood.\nThe new building was designed in the Gothic revival style, built in ashlar stone and was completed in 1927. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of 11 bays facing onto the square. The central section of three bays was projected forward to form a full height porte-coch\u00e8re. There were three arches with hood moulds on the ground floor, an oriel window in the central bay on the first floor, and an observation window with a ballustraded parapet and finials above. The rest of the building was fenestrated by mullioned and transomed windows. The roofline was lightly castellated and, internally, the principal room was the council chamber.\nA four-storey building designed in the modern style and known as the County Hall Annex was erected to the north of county hall in the mid-20th century. The Holland County Council was abolished when the newly formed Lincolnshire County Council was formed at the County Offices in Lincoln in 1974. The local public library service subsequently relocated to county hall.\nIn 2016, developers, Paul and Amy Wilkinson took possession of the whole site (including the sessions hall, county hall and county hall annex) with a view to converting the buildings for alternative use. The public library continued to operate on the ground floor of county hall but the upper floors were converted to create the County Hall Business Centre with 19 business units. The ground floor of the annex was subsequently converted for retail use and was re-opened by the boxer, Callum Johnson, as Waterfall Plaza in December 2016. The upper floors of the annex were converted for use as an apartment hotel and reopened as such in summer 2017.\nMeanwhile, in county hall, the library was closed for five weeks in April 2023 to allow alterations to be made to the building: the alteration work involved creating a dedicated library entrance at the back of the building in Bank Street so that a substantial part of the building could also be converted for use as a hotel.\n",

    "Football club\nFV Dudenhofen (officially: Fussballverein 1920 eV) is a football sports club from Dudenhofen in the Rhineland-Palatinate Rhein-Pfalz-Kreis. The first team has been playing in the Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar since 2019.\nHistory and records\nThe club was founded in 1920. After the interim dissolution after the end of the Second World War, the club was re-established on February 16, 1946, which then merged with TV Dudenhofen. In 1949, the team was dissolved again. In addition to football, the club also offers table tennis.\nThe greatest success before the end of the war was the Mittelpfalzgau Championship in 1931, Amateurliga Vorderpfalz. Four years later, the Dudenhofen champions managed to get promoted to the Amateurliga S\u00fcdwest. After the 1970\u201371 season, the team had to be relegated two years later. In 1980, it went back to the district league. This was followed by a direct resurgence before the Dudenhofener succeeded in 1987 in what is now called the Verbandsliga S\u00fcdwest, the highest amateur league. This time the team lasted two years before the Dudenhofen team had to be relegated to the newly created Landesliga Ost in 1989.\nTwo consecutive relegations brought the club into the district league in 1993, before two consecutive promotions brought the Dudenhofen team back to the state league in 1997. After direct relegation, the club went up again in 2001 to the national league. Six years later, the club returned to the league and reached the final of the S\u00fcdwestpokal in 2009, which they lost 3\u20130 to FK Pirmasens. Two years later, the Dudenhofen team became runners-up in the Verbandsliga S\u00fcdwest behind Arminia Ludwigshafen.\nIn 2015, the club again reached the final of the Southwest Cup. In front of more than 1800 spectators, Dudenhoven beat TuS Mechtersheim in the local derby. On May 13, 2015, FV Dudenhofen met regional league club FK Pirmasens for the second time since 2009 in the final. In a game that was balanced until the end, FV Dudenhofen had to accept the 1\u20130 winning goal from FK Pirmasens in the 120th minute of the game and thus lost for the second time against the regional league team in an association cup final.\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, the club was able to win the championship in the Verbandsliga S\u00fcdwest and the associated promotion to the Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar to celebrate.\nFormer players\nAlfred Volk\u00a0\nNiels Schlotterbeck\nOlaf Schm\u00e4ler\nWerner Adler\u00a0\n",
    "For the Danish drama, see Zappa (1983 film).\n2020 American film\nZappa is an American documentary film about the musician Frank Zappa.  Directed by Alex Winter, it was released on November 27, 2020.\nFrank Zappa (1940\u20131993) was an American composer, bandleader, and guitarist. Best known for writing and performing a large body of unconventional rock music and releasing many albums, his work combined multiple music genres. He held iconoclastic views about music, the music industry, and American culture and politics.\nThe Zappa documentary tells the story of his life and career. Director Alex Winter had free access to Zappa's extensive archives. The film includes footage of performances by Zappa and his various bands, as well as many interviews of people who knew or worked with him. In addition to Zappa himself, the interview subjects include Bruce Bickford, Pamela Des Barres, Bunk Gardner, Mike Keneally, Scott Thunes, Ian Underwood, Ruth Underwood, Steve Vai, Ray White, and Gail Zappa.\nReception\nZappa was nominated for a Critics' Choice Award for Best Music Documentary.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 96% of 71 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"As rich and complex as its subject's best work, Zappa honors the life and career of a musical legend without falling into hagiography.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 76 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\nPeter Sobczynski of RogerEbert.com gave the film three and a half out of four stars and wrote, \"Zappa contains maybe two real flaws. While some of Zappa's lyrics have been criticized for being sexist and puerile\u2014this is the guy who wrote the deathless classic 'Don't Eat The Yellow Snow'\u2014that aspect of his musical output is pretty much glossed over. The other problem is that the lack of any full performances of his songs will not exactly bolster the case for his musical genius among those who do not already lean in that direction. Other than that, the film is a complex and surprisingly satisfying portrait of an artist who defiantly marched to the beat of a different drummer (or two).\"\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety wrote, \"When Winter takes on a subject like this one, he doesn't just explore it; he surrounds and penetrates it. Yet what surprised me about Zappa \u2014 it's the source of its emotional power \u2014 is that the movie insists on seeing Frank Zappa not from the outside but, rather, in the way that he saw himself: as a deadly serious and obsessive aesthete-musician in freak's clothing, a man consumed by breaking out of what he viewed as the shackling boundaries of the pop-music business.\"\n",
    "\nOfer Winter (\u05e2\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e0\u05d8\u05e8; born February 3, 1971) is an IDF officer with the rank of Brigadier General. He served as the commander of 98th Paratroopers Division, the military secretary to the Israeli Minister of Defense, the Chief of Staff of the Central Command, the commander of the Givati Brigade, the commander of the Northern Brigade in the Gaza Strip, the commander of the 646 Brigade, the commander of the Duvdevan Unit, and the commander of the Givati Reconnaissance Battalion.\nBiography\nWinter was born in Rekhasim and grew up in Kiryat Ata. He is the eldest of four siblings. According to him, he received his combat heritage from his father David (Dutzo), who during the Yom Kippur War was a soldier in the 113th Armored Battalion and fought on both sides of the Suez Canal for 19 consecutive days.\nFrom 1985 to 1989, he studied at the Or Etzion Military Boarding School for Command, and continued at the Bnei David pre-military academy in Eli in the second cohort.\nMilitary Service\nWinter during the uncovering of a tunnel in the Gaza Strip, during Operation Protective Edge\nHe enlisted in the IDF in November 1990 and volunteered for Sayeret Matkal. He underwent training as a fighter in the unit. After the infantry officers course he was a team commander in the Maglan unit, which he joined following his commander Tal Russo. He was later appointed commander of a combat platoon in Maglan. Within the unit, he participated in dozens of operations, including Operation Grapes of Wrath. He later served in the Givati Brigade and was appointed commander of the spearhead company in the Tzabar Battalion. He was then appointed commander of the Givati Reconnaissance Company from 2000 to 2002 and led it in many operations in the Gaza Strip.\nIn 2003, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and appointed commander of the Givati Reconnaissance Battalion, serving in the position until 2005. He led the battalion in fighting against Palestinian terrorism during the Second Intifada in the Gaza Strip. For his actions in a series of operations deep in the Gaza Strip, the battalion under his command was awarded a unit citation on April 22, 2004, by the Southern Command commander, Dan Harel. In May 2004, the battalion suffered six casualties in the first APC disaster, in which a Givati engineering APC was destroyed. For the series of actions carried out by the reconnaissance battalion under his command, the battalion was awarded the Medal of Valor on April 14, 2005.\nHe later served as the IDF attach\u00e9 to the Marines from 2005 to 2007. In 2007, he was appointed commander of the Duvdevan Unit. At his initiative, the unit participated for the first time in fighting in the Gaza Strip during Operation Cast Lead. During his command, the unit won the Chief of Staff's Award for Outstanding Units for operational activity. He completed his role in November 2009. In December 2009, he was promoted to the rank of colonel and appointed commander of the Shualei Marom (646) Brigade, completing his role in May 2011. On May 18, 2011, he was appointed commander of the Northern Brigade in the Gaza Strip, a position he held until July 21, 2013.\nGivati Brigade Commander\nOn August 22, 2013, he was appointed commander of the Givati Brigade and led the brigade, among other things, during Operation Protective Edge. At the beginning of the operation, on July 9, 2014, a \"Commander's Page for Battle\" he wrote to the brigade's soldiers was published, in which, in addition to messages such as emphasizing mission accomplishment and defending the people and the homeland, he wrote:\"The history has chosen us to be at the forefront of the fight against the fierce Gazan terrorist enemy, who defies, curses, and reviles the God of Israel's armies. I lift my eyes to the heavens and call with you, \"\u0160\u0259ma\u02bf Y\u012bsr\u0101\u02be\u0113l Hashem \u02be\u0115l\u014dh\u0113n\u016b Hashem\u02bee\u1e25\u0101d\" O Lord, God of Israel, please make our path successful, as we go and stand to fight for Your people Israel against the enemy who blasphemes Your name.\"The commander's page was published in the media and sparked a discussion about the place of religion and faith in the army.\nDuring the operation, the brigade's fighters under his command killed many terrorists and uncovered and destroyed combat tunnels and infrastructure used by Hamas. The brigade played a central role in the Battle of Rafah. In a lecture he gave in 2021, he said he opposed the action that started the battle, as he believed the risk outweighed its benefit, but the Southern Command commander, Sami Turgeman, held a situation assessment and decided to carry it out.\nIn January 2015, following the dismissal of the Tzabar Battalion commander on suspicion of sexual harassment, the Chief of Staff, Benny Gantz, decided to issue him a command note, stating that \"in this event, it was necessary to act according to the procedures and orders and to be familiar with them alongside the command handling.\" However, Gantz emphasized that his involvement in the event was \"professional,",

Its primary export was computer hardware\u2014chiefly computer monitors\u2014through its American subsidiary ADI Systems. For a time, it was the fifth largest monitor manufacturer in the world, with major customers including Apple, Compaq, and Optiquest.\nHistory\nADI Corporation (an initialism for Advanced Data International) was founded in Taiwan in March 1979 by Liao Jian-cheng. The company was originally a diversified concern, manufacturing a number of disparate products, including footwear for Nike, Inc. By the time the company entered the market for computer hardware in the 1980s, ADI still had a contract with Nike to produce shoes. Its first computer-related exports were data terminals and computer monitors.\nIn 1986, Liao Jian-cheng merged ADI with his other corporation Cheng Chang Enterprises Co., Ltd. In 1987, the company went public on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Around the same time, the company established Quimax Systems, an American subsidiary dedicated to importing the company's monitors and terminals manufactured in Taiwan. A major customer of Quimax in the 1980s was Esprit Systems, a seller of terminals that was spun off from Hazeltine Corporation within the decade. In 1989, ADI became a major shareholder in Espirit, and in 1990 the year they led a group of other Taiwanese companies in a takeover of Espirit that transformed the public American company into a privately owned venture.\nBy the turn of the 1990s, ADI was a leading manufacturer of terminals and displays in Taiwan. ADI began offering monitors under their own name starting in 1993, under the subbrand MicroScan. Major customers of ADI soon included Apple Computer, Compaq, and Optiquest.:\u200a72\u200a:\u200a118\u200a Of these customers, Compaq was by far the largest, ADI producing nearly all of their monitors in the 1990s. In November 1994, Compaq formed a joint venture with ADI to raise factories in Mexico, Brazil, and Europe to assemble and store ADI's monitors, helping reduce the travel time from Taiwan to ADI's major exports. Unit shipments increased from 1.1\u00a0million in 1993 to 1.6\u00a0million in 1994. Also in 1994, ADI piloted the production of an i486SX subnotebook, although it never came to fruition.\nIn 1998, ADI obtained the rights from Sony to sell monitors with Trinitron picture tubes, starting with the MicroScan 5GT. Around the turn of the millennium, the company began selling flat-panel monitors, chiefly LCDs.\nADI went defunct around the same time they let their American website domain name expire in December 2006.\n",

Richards immigrated to the United States in 1831 with his family, settling initially in New York City, where his father became the minister of a church in Hudson, before the rest of the family relocated to Penfield, Georgia.\nRichards stayed in New York and attended Colgate University (then called Madison University), before graduating and moving to Penfield in 1840. In 1841, Richards married Cornelia Richards (n\u00e9e Bradley), also a writer, having met her in New York.\nCareer\nRichards began professionally writing with contributions to the Augusta Mirror, a literary paper published between 1838 and 1841. He later contributed to various periodicals, including the Southern Ladies' Book and Family Companion (Macon, Georgia), the Southern Quarterly Review (Charleston, South Carolina), the Christian Review (Boston, Massachusetts) and The Knickerbocker (New York).\nIn the 1840s, Richards started his own publications, beginning with the Orion, a literary magazine aimed at fostering literature in the South. This was named after the Orion constellation. Orion featured works by prominent Southern writers of the time, including William Gilmore Simms, as well as well-known Northern writers.\nHe later founded the Southern Literary Gazette (Athens, Georgia) and the educational magazine Schoolfellow (Athens).\nLater years\nIn the 1850s, Richards shifted his focus to the ministry, serving pastorates in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Illinois until his death. He continued to write, mainly on religious topics and physical science, popularising these subjects through his lectures in the United States and Canada.\nHe died on May 19, 1892, at the age of 73 in Chicago.\nLegacy\nRichards made notable contributions to literature during his relatively short career as a magazine editor, particularly in the South.

The 21-year old Hearns had won all but two of his 28 fights by knockout while the 22-year old Cuevas was in the midst of a four-year reign as WBA welterweight champion and had knocked out 11 opponents in his 12 title fights dating back to 1976, though at 6'1\", Hearns possessed a four-inch height advantage over the 5'9\" Cuevas. Hearns claimed to have \"no fear\" of Cuevas and stated \"If I see an opening to get my right hand on him, then I think I'll knock him out.\"\nThe fight was scheduled shortly after the heavily hyped and much watched Leonard\u2013Dur\u00e1n fight in which Dur\u00e1n had defeated Leonard to win the WBC's version of the welterweight title. Both Cuevas and Hearns expressed heavy interest in a possible unification match with Dur\u00e1n should they win this bout with Cuevas stating he would \"outbrawl, outbox and outpunch\" Dur\u00e1n while Hearns exclaimed that he \"can't wait to get Dur\u00e1n\" after defeating Cuevas.\nThe fight\nDuring the first round, Hearns, with a distinct height and reach advantage, used his left jab effectively to keep the much shorter Cuevas at bay and frequently hammered him with numerous combinations while Cuevas struggled to penetrate Hearns' defense leading to Hearns easily winning the round on the judges scorecards. Hearns continued to control the fight in the second round before landing a big right hand to Cuevas' head which dropped the champion face first to the canvas. Cuevas was able to answer the referee's 10-count and rose to his feet but was clearly hurt and on wobbly knees causing his manager Lupe Sanchez to enter the ring to prevent further damage which in turn led referee Stanley Christodoulou to end the fight and award Hearns the victory via technical knockout at 2:39 of the round.\nFight card\n^Note 1 For WBA Welterweight title ^Note 2 For WBA and The Ring Super Featherweight titles ^Note 3 For WBA lightweight title\n",
    "Municipal building in Clevedon, Somerset, England\nClevedon Town Hall is a municipal building in Old Street in Clevedon, a town in Somerset in England. The building, which was commissioned as a primary school but currently accommodates the offices and meeting place of Clevedon Town Council, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe Council House\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with the town's role as a seaside resort, a local board of health, chaired by Sir Arthur Elton, was appointed in Clevedon in April 1853. In 1894, the local board of health was succeeded by Clevedon Urban District Council. In the 1930s, the council was accommodated in rooms at 12A Hill Road but, its first permanent home was Claremont House on Highdale Road. The house had been commissioned as a summer retreat for the Bristol merchant, George Weare Braikenridge. It was designed in the Gothic Revival style, built in ashlar stone and was completed in the mid-19th century. The council acquired Claremont House, for use as its offices and meeting place, in 1938.\nThe building, which became known as The Council House, continued to serve as the headquarters of the council for nearly four decades, but ceased to be the local seat of government when Woodspring District Council was formed in Weston-super-Mare in 1974. The council continued to use the building to accommodate its housing services department until, being surplus to requirements, it was sold to a developer, who converted it into apartments in the late 1980s. It is now known as Claremont Hall.\nThe Town Hall\nThe current building was commissioned by the parish vestry at St Andrew's Church, as St Andrew's Primary School. It was designed in the Tudor style, built in rubble masonry and was completed in around 1860. It incorporated two schoolrooms, at right-angles, and a house for the schoolmaster. A small, one-storey extension was added to the rear schoolroom in about 1900.\nThe school closed in 1995, and, in 1999, the building was grade II listed.  In 2001, it was converted into a town hall, with Clevedon Town Council relocating from its former headquarters at Clevedon Village Hall.\nArchitecture of the Town Hall\nThe single-storey building is constructed of stone. The design involves an asymmetrical main frontage of four bays facing onto Old Street. The left-hand bay, which is gabled, is projected forward and fenestrated by a bi-partite mullioned window on the ground floor and by a casement window on the attic floor. There is a gabled porch to the right of the first bay and the other bays are fenestrated with bi-partite mullioned and transomed windows with pointed heads.  The extension to the rear schoolroom is in brick, while its roof has visible scissor-braced trusses.\n",
    "Scottish playwright\nNot to be confused with Archibald MacLaren.\nArchibald Maclaren (2 March 1755 \u2013 1826) was a Scottish playwright.\nBiography\nMaclaren was born in the highlands of Scotland on 2 March 1755, entered the army, and served in the American war under Generals Moore and Clinton. His regiment returned to Scotland to recruit, and in 1783 Mr. Jackson's company produced his farce of the 'Coup de Main' at Edinburgh. On the conclusion of the war he was discharged, and joined Ward's itinerant troop of players at Montrose. He is said to have been a bad exponent of English parts, in consequence of his strong Scottish accent, but in Scottish, Irish, and French characters he was not unsuccessful.\nIn 1794 he enlisted as a sergeant in the Dumbartonshire Highlanders, and went with them to Guernsey, where he was engaged to act as prompter in the theatre, and where several of his pieces were performed. Thence his regiment proceeded to Ireland, and took part in the suppression of the rebellion. While in Ireland he wrote another farce, 'What News from Bantry Bay?' but it was not immediately produced, from fear of the United Irishmen. After the battle of Vinegar Hill he was discharged and went to London, where his dramatic writings afforded precarious support to his family till his death in 1826.\nThe following is a list of his works: \nI.

    "\nMusical artist\nQuannnic (born 2004 or 2005; stylized in all lowercase) is an American musician. Initially presenting a digicore sound, they began releasing music as Quannnic in 2021 and released their debut studio album, Kenopsia, on February the next year. A track from the album, \"Life Imitates Life\", unexpectedly became viral on TikTok and charted on Billboard's Hot Hard Rock Songs. Quannnic's second studio album, Stepdream, was released in November 2023, and they later co-headlined an American tour with Jane Remover. On Quannnic's musical style, sources mostly described it as shoegaze, with Kenopsia mixing glitch elements and Stepdream emo.\nCareer\nOriginally from Florida, Quannnic has played guitar since they were six. They initially presented a digicore sound. According to Eli Enis of Stereogum, \"As a young teenager self-producing music in their bedroom, quannnic picked up a decent buzz making bleary, blown-out pop-rap songs in the same world as artists like d0llywood1, quinn, and angelus.\" However, by 2021, they felt creatively constrained by that sound and began shifting towards more rock-oriented styles. That year, they started releasing music under the name quannnic. Their debut studio album, Kenopsia, was independently released in February 2022. In early 2023, a track from the album, \"Life Imitates Life\", suddenly became popular on TikTok. By November, the song had been used in 16,000 clips on the platform, and it charted at number 23 on Billboard's Hot Hard Rock Songs with 525,000 official streams earned in the U.S. On Spotify, it had 30 million streams by December. On its popularity, quannnic said: \"It was just really weird to me that something I made when I was 16 could get this much attention now. It impacted the way I make music. It got a lot more stressful.\" The album was later reissued by deadAir Records.\nIn November 2023, Quannnic released their second studio album, Stepdream. Quannnic co-headlined Jane Remover's 2024 U.S. tour, which began in February of that year. Quannnic played at the Sick New World Festival on April 27, 2024.\nMusical style\nQuannnic's profile at NTS Radio describes them as an indietronica and shoegaze artist, while their profile at AllMusic says they blend shoegaze, lo-fi, noise, and electronic bedroom pop. Philip Sherburne of Pitchfork described quannnic's music as containing much Auto-Tune and \"post-everything bedroom beats\", which \"restored some of shoegaze's crystalline detail in their sparkling, digitally rendered high end\". Eli Enis of Stereogum said that quannnic's music has an \"artificial rumble\" comparable to Parannoul's computerized sound in To See the Next Part of the Dream. Quannnic has named Superheaven as an influence.\nAlthough quannnic employed various digital instruments on Kenopsia, they prefer using a real guitar to create their shoegaze elements. Eli Enis of Stereogum described Kenopsia as a mix between shoegaze, the glitchy elements of digicore, and Deftones-like nu-gaze, with a singing akin to emo-rap. Jordan Darville of The Fader wrote that it \"embraced glitch-pop and the anime intro electronics of Porter Robinson\", being similar to old songs by Jane Remover. Singaporean band Sobs chose Kenopsia as one of their favorite albums of 2022 to Brooklyn Vegan, with member Celine saying: \"Indie rock melodies glimmering with autotune over a gloomy hyperpop-meets-shoegaze backdrop. Perfect record for the post-internet music consumer\". Kristen S. H\u00e9 of Junkee said that \"Life Imitates Life\" could be \"mistaken for a lo-fi Deftones cover\"; quannnic said that the track was inspired by that band and Paramore, and Enis highlighted its \"grungy\" elements.\nEnis found Stepdream to be influenced by Elliott Smith and Jeff Buckley and felt that quannnic \"swerved in a more collegiate singer-songwriter direction\" with it. Similarly, Darville wrote that the album shows quannnic's capabilities \"as a songwriter of brooding guitar-based jams\". He felt that, \"eneath the foggy textures and hazily cooed lyrics, there's a real sense of stakes on Stepdream, like its songs are quannnic's last, best chance to define \". Leor Galil of Chicago Reader said that Stepdream is inspired by alternative rock subgenres such as emo and shoegaze. Abby Kenna of Ones to Watch said that, with the album, \"quannnic refines their unique perspective, blending their influences that reach from metal to folk while keeping their voice and emotional turmoil consistent.\"\nDiscography\nNotes\n^ Quannnic is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns.\n",
    "Painting by Carl Spitzweg\nThe Warlock, also known as The Wizard and the Dragon, is the title of two oil on canvas paintings by German painter Carl Spitzweg, from 1875 and 1880. The original painting is now held in the Museum Georg Sch\u00e4fer, in Schweinfurt, while the other is in a private collection. The two paintings are almost identical in motif but differ in size and color.\nDescription\nIn the lower half of the painting, a warlock stands in the middle of a dark rocky landscape. Around him six or seven skulls were arranged in a circle. He has his staff held high in a pose similar to a schoolmaster or a tamer. In front of him, a not very large dragon rises with its mouth open, clinging to a boulder with its front paws, around which its snake-like tail is wrapped. The mythical animal black wings stand out against a red glow that comes from the underground, probably from a crevice in the rock. Thick, lead-gray smoke curls above it, behind which a sunlit fairytale castle becomes visible next to a towering column. The castle is not unlike Neuschwanstein Castle, whose construction had began in 1869. The artist's monogram signature, the stylized S, can be found at the bottom left of the painting.\nReception\nUrsula Seibold-Bultmann, writing in the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung, sees the dragon as the F\u00e1fnir, from the Nordic mythology and the painting as a swipe at \u201cthe Wagner enthusiasm of the Bavarian King Ludwig II\".\nProvenance\nThe smaller of the two paintings, measuring 29.8 \u00d7 21.9 centimeters, has the catalog raisonn\u00e9 number 1394 and was handed over to the Georg Sch\u00e4fer Museum in Schweinfurt, where it has been on display since 2000.\nThe second version (c. 1880)\nThe larger painting measures 47.1 \u00d7 26.2 centimeters and has the catalog raisonn\u00e9 number 1395. In the early 1930s it was in the art collection of the Jewish industrialist Leo Bendel. He faced persecution after the Nazis came to power, in 1933. He and his wife Else had to sell furniture and works of art below value in order to raise funds for emigration. Bendel sold The Warlock on June 15, 1937, for 18,000 Reichsmarks to the Heinemann Gallery in Munich. This process, similar to others taken by Jewish art collectors at the time, is legally viewed as a loss of property due to persecution, and the painting can be therefore considered as Nazi looted art. On August 12, 1937, the wife of baking powder manufacturer August Oetker, Lina Oetker, purchased the painting for 28,000 Reichsmarks. In 1968 it came to Rudolf-August Oetker through inheritance; since its founding, it was the property of the Rudolf August Oetker GmbH art collection.\nIn June 2006, the Bendel heirs contacted Kunstsammlung GmbH and initiated a conversation to negotiate a \u201cfair and equitable solution\u201d in accordance with the Washington Declaration. However, Kunstsammlung GmbH refused any conversation. In October 2016, the Oetker Group announced that the art collection was being examined in search of possible stolen art and that The Warlock would probably be returned. In November 2019, the Rudolf-August Oetker GmbH art collection returned the painting to the heirs of the Jewish art collector Leo Bendel, who had been murdered by the Nazis.\nSee also\nList of claims for restitution for Nazi-looted art\n",
    "Spanish athletic coach (1931\u20132009)\nCarlos Gil P\u00e9rez (28 January 1931 \u2013 25 December 2009) was a Spanish athletics coach. From 1979 to 1988, he was Spain's top national coach, serving as the technical director of the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation (RFEA). He has been called one of the \"fathers of Spanish athletics\".\nLife\nP\u00e9rez was born in Santiago de Compostela, Spain on 28 January 1931. From 1979 to 1988, he held the position of technical director of the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation (RFEA). Under his leadership, Spanish athletics achieved its first Olympic medals at the Moscow Olympics in 1980 and in Los Angeles in 1984.\nAt the 1982 European Athletics Indoor Championships in Athens, Spain achieved one of its great milestones by winning five medals. Three years later, in Budapest, Spain rose to the highest category of continental athletics.\nP\u00e9rez also made significant contributions in sports administration. Within the RFEA, he revamped the technical infrastructure by introducing experienced coaches, thereby fostering sport development. Additionally, he played a pivotal role in initiating athlete support programs, including the creation of ADO scholarships. These scholarships provided financial assistance, offering 80,000 pesetas over four years to athletes with the potential to excel in Olympic Games and top-level championships.\nReturning to his hometown, Perez coached the first Salamanca-born national champion in any sport in 1958; under his guidance, Jos\u00e9 Luis Albarr\u00e1n claimed the title of Spanish champion in the 200 meters at the old Anoeta Stadium in San Sebasti\u00e1n.\nIn Salamanca, he trained dozens of athletes under his guidance from 1955 to 2009, with notable mentions including his five Olympic athletes: Jos\u00e9 Luis Albarr\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Para\u00edso, Rosa Colorado, Antonio S\u00e1nchez, and Frutos Feo. They also achieved numerous Spanish records.\nIn 1968, he received a Silver Medal of the Royal Order of Sports Merit in Salamanca from Juan Antonio Samaranch. In 2007, he received the Silver Medal again from King Juan Carlos I. In 2010, he received the Gold Medal posthumously.\nP\u00e9rez was frequently seen at the Helm\u00e1ntico Stadium in Salamanca, coaching athletes even at over 70 years old. In his later years, he worked with athletes like Adri\u00e1n Ingelmo, \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda, Saturnino Gonz\u00e1lez, David Berrocal, Pedro Ceballos, and Elvis Gonz\u00e1lez, among others.\nPerez died on 25 December 2009 in Salamanca.\nSexual misconduct allegations\nOn 7 May 2024, a 57-year-old former discus thrower, under a pseudonym, claimed that P\u00e9rez sexually abused him when he was 17 years old. Three other people came forth with similar allegations published in the newspaper El Pa\u00eds.\nWorks\n\u2014 (1974). Union Deportiva Salamanca: 1923-1974  (in Spanish).

It was one of four Khalka khanates that emerged from remnants of the Mongol Empire after the death of Dayan Khan's son Gersenji Khongtaiji in 1549.\nThe first ruler of Zasagt tribe was Gersenji's eldest son, Ashikhai. At the beginning of the 17th century, Ashihai's grandson Laihur was awarded the title of \"khan\" by Abtai Sain Khan. Laihur was murdered in 1587. His son Subadai succeeded and crowned himself the \"Bogd Zasagt Khan\". Later, Norob, Vanchig, and Tseng\u00fc\u00fcn succeeded to the title of khan.\nIn 1687, Shar, the Zasagt Khan, was defeated and killed by T\u00fcsheet Khan Chakhundorj. His younger brother Tsevenjab succeeded as the new khan, however, Khalka was invaded by Dzungar Mongolian forces under Galdan Boshugtu Khan in the next year, Tsevenjab had to flee to Ulanqab where he pledged fealty to the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing China.  On 3 June 1691, Tsevenjab attended the Dolonnuur Assembly together with T\u00fcsheet Khan, Sechen Khan and more than 500 noyans and taijis. Since then, the Khalkha Mongols in Outer Mongolia submitted to the Qing dynasty. The three khanates, Zasagt Khan, Sechen Khan and T\u00fcsheet Khan, became three provincial subdivisions or aimags of Qing China.

    "American author (1851\u20131925)\nEva Best (n\u00e9e, Williams; pen name, Saturn; 1851\u20131925) was an American story writer, poet, music composer, dramatist, and painter. She worked as a newspaper editor. She wrote a great deal in dialect.\nBest was among the first persons to recognize the poetry of Paul Laurence Dunbar and was influential in bringing him before the public. In his youth, Dunbar was an elevator attendant in the same building in which Best's father conducted an architect's office, and she became acquainted with the youth and his literary endeavors through seeing him in her father's building.\nEarly life\nEva Williams was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, December 19, 1851. She was the eldest daughter of John Insco Williams and Mrs. Mary Williams, who removed to Chicago, Illinois. Her father was an artist and painted the first bible panorama ever exhibited in the United States. Her mother is also an artist of merit as well as a writer of verse and prose. Eva's brother, Charles Insco Williams, was an artist and architect. A sister, Lulu, married William I. Buchanan.\nCareer\nBest started her literary career as a poet. \"The Beautiful Thought\", \"Love and Hate\", \"A Promised Day\", and \"Thou Art\" are included in The New Cycle (1899), while \"The Power of Thought\" was included in the Bible Review (1905).\nShe began writing for the papers in 1871, encouraged to do so by W. D. Bickham, of the Dayton Journal (now, Dayton Daily News). In 1872, she began contributing to the Cincinnati Saturday Night, and afterward for The Cincinnati Times-Star, under the nom de plume of \"Saturn\". She then wrote for Godey's Magazine, for Arthur's Lady's Home Magazine , and for Peterson's Magazine. Her first short story appeared in one of the Frank Leslie's periodicals. That was followed by stories in other publications. In 1882, her services were sought by the editor of the Detroit Free Press, with Best becoming the editor of the household department of that paper. She was also a regular contributor to Ansel Nash Kellogg's Newspaper Company. In 1900, Best joined The New Cycle where her editorial work focused on \"The Home Circle\" department; she also provided poems and short stories.\n\"My past has placed me where I am today and my tomorrow will find me where I have earned the right to be.\" (Eva Best, 1926)\nBest wrote several dramas. The first, An American Princess, ran at least six seasons. A comedy drama, Sands of Egypt, was in the hands of Miss Elisabeth Marbury, of New York City. A Rhine Crystal was being used by Miss Floy Crowell, a New England artist. Best's other plays, The Little Banshee and Gemini, the former in Irish dialect, the latter a two-part character piece, were written for Miss Jennie Calef. In all these plays the music, dances, ballads and all incidental scores were distinctively original. In her dramatic work, she composed both the songs and the music with which her dramas were interspersed.\nBest wrote a number of ballads. One of her peculiar advantages in the writing of stories was her ability to sketch such illustrations as she required to visualize her thoughts. She devoted some attention to art. She often painted landscapes, flower pieces, and fruits, and was also extremely apt and original in the art of designing.\nPersonal life\nIn 1869, she married William H. Best, of Dayton, Ohio, and made her home in that city. They had two children, a son and a daughter.\nEva Best died in Dayton, Ohio, April 17, 1925, after being ill for four months.

    "Savitri (Savi) Naipaul Akal (b. 1928) is a memoirist and former teacher from Trinidad. She is the daughter of author Seepersad Naipaul and his wife Droapatie (n\u00e9e Capildeo), and the sister of V. S. Naipaul and Shiva Naipaul.\nEarly life and education\nSavitri (Savi) Naipaul Akal was born at the Lion House in Chaguanas, Trinidad, in April 1928. She is the fifth child and fourth daughter of Droapatie Naipaul (n\u00e9e Capildeo) and Seepersad Naipaul.\nThe Naipaul family lived for a time at Lion House (Anand Bhavan), the historic home of the Capildeo clan in Trinidad, before living at 26 Nepaul Street (now Naipaul House and Literary Museum). Both houses were memorialised in her brother V. S. Naipaul's novel A House for Mr Biswas, and would be revisited by Naipaul Akal in her memoir, The Naipauls of Nepaul Street.\nNaipaul Akal studied at Tranquillity Intermediate School and St. Joseph's Convent in Port of Spain. She obtained a BA degree partially from Edinburgh University in Scotland (1961\u20131963), and completed at the University of the West Indies at St. Augustine, Trinidad (1968). She followed this with a Diploma in Education in 1973.\nCareer\nFrom 1968 to 1972, Naipaul Akal worked as a part-time tutor in Sociology at the University of the West Indies at St. Augustine, Trinidad, followed by a full-time post as a teacher of Geography at the Convent schools and at Tranquillity. In 1980, she retired from the latter, having risen to Vice-Principal. Until the 2010s, she ran an up-scale boutique, Smaks, in Valsayn.\nIn 2018, Naipaul Akal published her memoir of the literary Naipaul family, The Naipauls of Nepaul Street (Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, 2018). Both she and her sister Kamla had wanted to write a memoir about the family and their time at 26 Nepaul Street (now Naipaul House and Literary Museum),  but Savi had deferred to her elder sister. When Kamla passed before she could accomplish it, Savi's surviving family encouraged her to write the memoir.\nThe Naipauls of Nepaul Street\nSavi Naipaul Akal's memoir tells of the Naipaul family's literary beginnings, their life at 26 Nepaul Street (now Naipaul House and Literary Museum), and the eventual emigrations and dispersals that led to the end of their time there. In the memoir, she tells the story of her parents, and their role in the large family of seven children.\nThe memoir is unique in expanding upon the lives of the Naipaul women, who were often overlooked in literary biographies until that point. Though the women of the Naipaul family were briefly given additional focus when Nicholas Laughlin added unpublished correspondences with these women to Letters between a Father and Son (as co-editor of its second edition), V. S. Naipaul later removed these letters and restored the earlier text for subsequent editions.\nNaipaul Akal writes of how her mother, Droapatie, managed the family's finances and ensured all seven children (including the five daughters) went to university. She also explains that V. S. used his mother as a source of information \u2014 via savage \"interrogations\" \u2014 to inform his own writing. The book also explores Droapatie's diplomatic handling of her husband's desire for independence \u2014 as well as his job as a reporter and his literary ambitions \u2014 against the demands of being a part of the large, high-profile Capildeo family.\nThe book also covers the time V. S. Naipaul was in Oxford, his \"war of words\" with their brother Shiva, and the surprise early deaths of their father Seepersad and then Shiva, too. Like Vidia's early work, she portrays a family encouraged by Seepersad's belief that books and literature would be a way to better themselves.\nWriting in the Trinidad Express, Bridget Brereton called the book \"lively\" and \"moving\", and said it was \"a valuable record of a remarkable family and a formative period in Trinidad's social and cultural evolution\".\nIn The Spectator, Patrick Skene-Catling describes Naipaul Akal herself as \"evidently ... sharply observant as well as affectionate\" and says she mostly maintains \"admirable moderation, balance and good humour\" on her subjects. On the subject of her brother V. S. Naipaul, however, he argues that Vidia's own work needs to be read alongside Savi's to offer some \"justification\" for the actions she criticises.\nSavi Naipaul Akal donated photographs to Naipaul House for its restoration as a museum. Her son, Ashvin, donated much of the museum's memorabilia and is the treasurer of the organisation charged with managing the museum, the Friends of Mr Biswas.\nPersonal life\nSavi Naipaul Akal married into the Akal family. Her son Kiran has developed her former Valsayn-based boutique into an international tea and spirits brand, SMAKS Luxury Group. Her other son, Ashvin, is treasurer of the Friends of Mr Biswas \u2014 the group which manages Naipaul House and Literary Museum.\nNaipaul Akal has remained close with her brothers and sisters.

    "\nThe Great Tijaniyya Zawiya in Fez (\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a\u062c\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0631\u0649 \u0628\u0641\u0627\u0633) is a Sufi zawiya, mosque, and Sufi religious landmark located in the city of Fez, Morocco, in the neighborhood of Humat al-Dardas, currently known as Al-Balida. It is considered one of the main centers of the Tijaniyya order, founded by Abu al-Abbas Ahmad al-Tijani in the late 18th century. The zawiya houses the tomb of Abu al-Abbas al-Tijani, which is a pilgrimage site for followers of the order during the period of Mawlid al-Nabi from all over the world, including Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, and Sub-Saharan Africa, especially Senegal. Since 2007, the zawiya has periodically hosted an international forum for the Tijaniyya order, which in 2014 included Sufis affiliated with the order from 47 countries.\nHistory\nBefore the construction of the zawiya, Abu al-Abbas al-Tijani used his house in the city of Fez as a space for worship and remembrance along with his followers. He decided to build the zawiya in 1800 and bought a ruined, abandoned house, where the madmen used to gather for remembrance, in the Huma al-Dardas neighborhood, with a large vine in its center, which is the tree under which he would later be buried. Some of his opponents protested the construction process and took the matter to Sultan Moulay Suleiman, who did not accept their grievances and approved the process, even contributing financially to the construction of the zawiya. The construction process began in the month of Rabi' al-Awwal in 1800, and the zawiya in its initial form consisted of two spaces: the first housing the mausoleum extending to the current minaret, and the second extending to Bab al-Jiyad. The zawiya would later extend to the Laranga Mosque on one side and to Darb Janiara on the other, with 8 doors being added. Tijani followers claim that Abu al-Abbas al-Tijani had predicted this expansion during his lifetime. Due to the status and spiritual and political importance of the zawiya, the sultans of Morocco took care of it after the death of Abu al-Abbas al-Tijani in 1815, including expansions and additions to the courtyard, decorating the mausoleum and minaret with green tiles, and inscriptions containing verses of prophetic praise.\n\u0627\u0644References\n^ a b \"\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0641\u0627\u0633. \u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628\". 20 November 2017.

Wang is credited with inventing stress-free copper polishing technology\nInitially the tools were position as a competitor to chemical metal planarization but did not find any success. Due to strong backing, ACMR pivoted and shifted focus to wafer cleaning by carving out a niche.\nIn 2005, ACMR and Shanghai Venture Capital Co. established a joint venture in Shanghai named ACM Research (Shanghai). It would become majority owned by ACR and all major operations were eventually moved to China.\nThe first major customer for ACMR was SK Hynix who started placing orders for its cleaning tools in 2013. ACM's proprietary technology, Space Alternated Phase Shift (SAPS) has been shown to be more effective at removing random defects on wafers than jet spray or conventional megasonic cleaning technologies.\nIn November 2017, ACMR held its initial public offering and became a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq exchange.\nIn December 2017, ACMR formed ACM Research Korea to better service SK Hynix and would focus on hardware design and manufacture.\nIn November 2021, ACMR (Shanghai) listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market.\nIn March 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission named ACMR as a company that faced delisting if it didn't hand over detailed audit documents to support its financial statement. This came as a result of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. ACMR's stock price dropped 27% as a result. In response, ACMR changed its auditor from BDO China Shu Lun Pan in Shenzhen to Armanino in San Ramon, California so it would no longer be subject to the related delisting guidelines.\nIn April 2022,  ACMR planned to build a fab equipment plant in Korea. It was speculated this was done to avoid being involved the China\u2013United States trade war.\nKey customers of ACMR include SK Hynix, SMIC,  Hua Hong Semiconductor and Yangtze Memory Technologies.

    "Municipal building in Harlow, Essex, England\nHarlow Civic Centre is a municipal building in Harlow, a town in Essex, in England. It is the offices and meeting place of Harlow District Council.\nHistory\nThe old Harlow Town Hall\nAfter Harlow was designated as a new town on 25 March 1947, the new Harlow Development Corporation commissioned its own offices, Adams House on the east side of the Market Square. A simple, three storey office block, it was designed by a Manchester-born architect, John Graham, and completed in the early 1950s.\nHarlow became an urban district in 1955, and the new council was initially accommodated at Netteswell Hall and Netteswell House, on Park Lane. However, the new council leaders needed a permanent meeting place and the site they chose was on the south side of Cross Street in an area known as The High. The new town hall was designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd in the modern style, built in concrete and was officially opened by Lord Attlee in 1960. The design involved a nine-storey tower with a rooftop viewing room which was designed by John Graham. Gibberd had originally wanted the tower to be at least 15 storeys high but cost constraints did not allow that.\nBy the early 21st century, the town hall was becoming increasingly dilapidated and civic leaders decided to demolish it, and to commission a new mixed-use complex involving a retail mall and new civic offices. The site selected incorporated the footprint of the old town hall but also extended south towards a landscaped area, which contained concrete lined pools known as the Water Gardens. The old town hall was demolished in 2002. The Water Gardens, which contained a series of sculptures by Henry Moore, had to be severely truncated to accommodate the new development.\nThe new complex was designed by Benoy Architects in the modern style, built in concrete and glass and was officially opened by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester on 19 May 2004. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage facing south onto the gardens.

    "1983 studio album by Mark Murphy\nBrazil Song (Canc\u00f5es Do Brasil) is the 20th album by American jazz vocalist  Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 51 years old in 1983 and released by the Muse label in the United States in 1984. This album is collection of Brazilian jazz songs.\nBackground\nMurphy had recorded Brazilian music previously on Mark Murphy Sings (\"Empty Faces\"), Who Can I Turn To (\"Star Sounds\"), Midnight Mood (\"Sconsolato\"), and others. However, Brazil Song was Murphy's first all-Brazilian jazz album. He later released Night Mood in 1987 dedicated to Ivan Lins. He continued to record many Brazilian songs during his career, singing many of them in Portuguese. In his book A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers, Will Friedwald pointed out that Murphy dedicated his late nightclub sets to Brazilian rhythms in his Birdland engagements.\nAfter touring in 1982 Murphy spent two weeks in Rio. He absorbed the music and culture and collected recordings of Brazilian jazz. He was inspired to make an album devoted to the music. In the liner notes to Brazil Song, he told Michael Bloom, \"We've lost the great era of singer/songwriters and the Broadway stage. They write musicals but they don't write songs anymore - not songs you can take out and do as independent numbers. I don't hear much new material that knocks me out. So, the best songs now being written are coming from Brazil. It's almost as though they've written into the Brazilian Constitution that it is illegal to write a bad song.\"\nAlso in the liner notes Murphy writes about his experience visiting a museum dedicated to Carmen Miranda \"who personally brought the Samba (her country's gift to popular music) to the USA and the world\". He had been a longtime fan of Miranda after seeing her movies. Murphy dedicated the album to her and to \"Elis Regina, the greatest of the contemporary Brazilian singers - who brought us so much joy and excitement and died much too soon\" who \"must be mentioned in this dedication as well, as must my two new favorite Brazilian lady singers. Rose and Leny Andrade\".\nRecording\n\"No one asked me to make this album\", Murphy told Bloom in the liner notes. \"I did it because I thought that Brazilian songs were not being done correctly - that North American singers have not been able to capture the correct musical pulse of this music, mainly because of the Tin-Pan-Alleyish lyrics given to some of the tunes. The rhythmic pulse has a different timing; I think that's a quality inherent in the Portuguese language. So I try to sing the English lyrics as though they were Portuguese.\"\nThe recording was made with a San Francisco-based group, Viva Brasil, who Murphy found to be authentic interpreters of Brazilian songs. \"I knew I couldn't do this project with a pickup group,\" Murphy explained to Bloom. \"I had to have a unit, musicians that knew each other well.\" Jay Wagner, Viva Brasil's keyboardist, did the arranging and played synthesizer. The other members included singer Julia Stewart, percussionist Michael Spiro, pianist Michael Austin-Boe, guitarist Claudio Amaral, and drummer Rubens Moura.\nMurphy sings \"Outubro\" in Portuguese, his first recording in Portuguese. Jones points out in his Murphy biography that many singers prefer original lyrics in Brazilian songs because the English versions tend to drastically change the original meaning. Murphy produced the album with Lupe De Leon, who had worked on Stolen Moments and would go on to produce Night Mood and September Ballads.\nReception\nScott Yanow assigns 3 stars to this release in the AllMusic Guide to Jazz.\nAuthour Will Friedwald said, \u201cWhen it comes to the bossa nova, no other American jazz singer can touch Murphy\u201d.\nMurphy biographer Peter Jones singles out \"Two Kites\", \"Nothing Will Be\", and \"Bridges\" for praise.\nTrack listing\n\"Desafinado\" (Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, Newton Mendon\u00e7a) \u2013 4:02\n\"Two Kites\" (Jobim) \u2013 3:36\n\"The Island\" (Ivan Lins, V\u00edtor Martins) \u2013 4:03\n\"Bolero De Sat\u00e3\" (Paulo C\u00e9sar Pinheiro, Guinga) \u2013 3:49\n\"She\" (Claudio Amaral) \u2013 2:58\n\"Someone to Light Up My Life (Se Todos Fossem Iguais A Voce)\" (Jobim, Gene Lees, Vinicius de Moraes) \u2013 2:57\n\"Nothing Will Be\" (Ronaldo Bastos, Milton Nascimento, Renee Vincent) \u2013 3:57\n\"Outubro (October)\" (Nascimento, Fernando Brant) \u2013 3:58\n\"Bridges\" (Brant, Lees, Nascimento) \u2013 3:59\nPersonnel\nPerformance\nMark Murphy \u2013 vocals\nMichael Austin-Boe \u2013 piano\nClaudio Amaral \u2013 guitar\nRubens Moura \u2013 drums\nChalo Eduardo \u2013 percussion\nMichael Spiro \u2013 percussion\nJulia Stewart \u2013 vocals\nJay Wagner \u2013 synthesizer, arranger\nProduction\nJack Leahy \u2013 engineer, Russian Hill Recording, San Francisco, Ca.

    "\nThe CF-V21P is a notebook-sized laptop released by Panasonic in 1993. It was the first notebook computer to have an integrated CD-ROM drive as an option, albeit it only supports up to 3.5-inch-diameter mini CDs instead of standard 4.7-inch-diameter discs. It was discontinued in 1994.:\u200a111\u200a\nSpecifications\nOn its release in October 1993, the stock CF-V21P featured an Intel i486SX microprocessor clocked at 25\u00a0MHz, initially upgradable to a 50-MHz i486DX2. Later, the company made the i486DX4 clocked at 75\u00a0MHz available as a processor upgrade. The stock amount of RAM on the motherboard is 4\u00a0MB, expandable to up to 20\u00a0MB with aftermarket RAM cards. The notebook was sold with either 80\u00a0MB or 120\u00a0MB internal hard disk drives, with a 450\u00a0MB drive later made an option on the high-end. For a pointing device, Panasonic built the CF-V21P with a trackball positioned at the center of the palm rest, with the left- and right-click buttons to either side of it.\nFor screen technology, the notebook was optioned with either a 9.5-inch monochrome STN display; a 10.4-inch color TFT display; or a 9.5-inch STN touchscreen with pen stylus. The screen housing can be detached from the bottom housing and either removed (for upgrading); or flipped around and closed onto the keyboard, making the laptop able to be operated like a tablet computer (useful when equipped with the touchscreen display). All displays were native VGA resolution: 640\u00a0\u00d7 480 pixels. The on-board graphics chip contains 1\u00a0MB of on-die VRAM, supporting a maximum resolution of 1024\u00a0\u00d7 768 pixels at 256\u00a0colors on an external monitor.\nBesides the two type-II or one type-III PC Cards, the CF-V21P supports a number of optional accessories via a multibay slot on the side of the computer\u2014trademarked by Panasonic as the \"Multimedia Pocket\". In this multibaby fits either a 3.5-inch floppy drive, a second NiMH battery, a TV tuner card (allowing the laptop to be used as a television receiver), or a CD-ROM drive. The lattermost option made the CF-V21P the first notebook computer on the market to have an integrated CD-ROM drive as an option. However, it was hamstrung by the nonstandard maximum dimension of its supported media\u20143.5-inch-diameter mini CDs\u2014for which very little commercial software on the market was available on its release. This option may have appealed to companies purchasing fleets of the CF-V21P, who likely had contracts with CD-ROM mastering facilities to manufacture proprietary software packages relevant to internal company functions; or to those who had access to early CD-R burners (which in 1993 were very expensive).\nPanasonic also offered for the CF-V21P a port replicator and a docking station, the latter of which houses 16-bit ISA slots for yet more options, including a Pentium upgrade board and a capture card to store analog video onto the hard drive. As stock, the CF-V21P has no on-board audio; Panasonic sold a 16-bit PC Card sound card to allow the notebook to classify as a multimedia PC. Depending on the configuration ordered, the CF-V21P weighs between 5.7 to 8.2 pounds (2.6 to 3.7\u00a0kg).\nDevelopment\nThe CF-V21P was designed and manufactured by Panasonic in Japan. The company's plants were equipped to produce between 40,000 and 50,000 units of the CF-V21P in a 12-month period. The company produced the LCD panels in-house, while Intel provided the chipset and Western Digital provided the on-board graphics chip.:\u200a210\u200a\nReception and legacy\nAnush Yegyazarian of PC Magazine concluded that the CF-V21P \"offers a lot of flexibility for upgrading (or downgrading) to suit most user needs, but  lags in performance. Specifically, he rated the computer's raw number-crunching performance below-average, as was its hard drive performance, although graphical performance scored high marks. Clare Newsome of PC User found the notebook \"an impressive piece of design which takes notebook modularity and upgradability to a new level. Unfortunately this level is both beyond the budgets of many users and the developments of software vendors, who have yet to accept the 3.5-inch CD format\". PC World's Bryan Hastings called the TFT display of his review unit \"luxurious\" and was impressed by the large hard drive but found the battery life subpar and the notebook overall overpriced for most users.\nPanasonic followed up the CF-V21P with the V41 in late 1994, which added a full-sized CD-ROM drive.:\u200a111\u200a\nNotes\n^ IBM's ThinkPad 755CD, released in 1994, was the first notebook computer with a full-sized CD-ROM drive.:\u200a111\u200a\n^ PC Week remarked that Panasonic was likely unable to meet the high demand for the CF-V21P.\n",
    "American YouTube streamer\nLeticia Padua, known online as SheraSeven or Shera Seven, is an American livestreamer, YouTuber, dating coach, and social media personality. Her YouTube livestreams give dating advice to single women about marrying rich and getting money from men. She is also known as the \"sprinkle sprinkle lady\" for her catchphrase, \"sprinkle sprinkle\". Clips from her livestreams began going viral on TikTok in 2023. Critics have complimented her content for its humor while also describing her as controversial, variously calling her views on heterosexual dating \"deeply nihilistic\", \"Machiavellian\", and \"completely unprogressive\".\nCareer\nPadua began making YouTube videos as SheraSeven in 2013. Clips of SheraSeven's livestreams began being posted on TikTok in the spring of 2023. She had over 500 thousand YouTube subscribers by November of that year. Clips of her on TikTok amassed over 20 billion views by August 2023, and videos tagged with her catchphrase, \"sprinkle sprinkle\", had over two billion views on the platform by 2024. A fan account of hers, Sheralations, had almost 400 thousand followers on TikTok before being leaving the platform in 2023. Kerame Marcellus of Essence called Shera Seven \"a favorite on TikTok\" for her \"candid dating and money advice for women online\". In January 2024, SheraSeven was featured in Brandon Blackwood's Valentine's Day campaign.\nPublic image\nSheraSeven often encourages women over the age of 25 to employ manipulation tactics and reverse psychology to get rich older men to pay for their expenses while avoiding broke men, to whom she refers as \"dusties\", as a way to game the patriarchy. She is known online as the \"sprinkle sprinkle lady\" for her catchphrase, \"sprinkle sprinkle\", which she says after giving words of advice. Her fans have often jokingly described her as a female version of Andrew Tate. Critics have described her as controversial for her views on gender.\nSteffi Cao of Bustle identified SheraSeven as one of a crop of \"dark feminine\" influencers, whose content \"pull viewers in with\u00a0... confidence and humor\", and summarized their philosophy as being that \"men are interchangeable, problematic, and take up too much emotional space\". For Vox, Rebecca Jennings called SheraSeven \"among the funniest people on the internet\" and \"extremely entertaining\", but added that she was \"part of a wave of arguably regressive and deeply nihilistic 'dating experts' currently taking over TikTok\" and that \"her philosophy ultimately reduces women to sexual objects whose value decreases the less traditionally attractive they become\". Tara Kenny of Dazed wrote in 2023 that SheraSeven and other women dating advice influencers took \"a hardline, Machiavellian stance that sets them apart from their softer, touchy-feely counterparts\" and that parts of their content \"fall into the same toxic thought patterns as those manosphere channels they're trying to counteract\". For Indy100, Kate Plummer called her opinions on gender roles in heterosexual relationships \"completely unprogressive\", while Raquel Rosario S\u00e1nchez wrote for The Critic that she \"dispense faux-empowerment\".\nPersonal life\nSheraSeven's husband, James Scott, works as an SQL developer and appears in the background of many of her livestreams.\n",

He spent the rest of his entire career in the Spanish First Division, playing with Atl\u00e9tico for six years until 1950 and then with Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a for seven years until 1957.\nAt Atl\u00e9tico, he managed to win the League title in 1949\u201350, and also the 1941\u201347 FEF President Cup, the longest tournament in the history of Spanish football, playing in the decisive match against Valencia CF in 1947, which had been in stand by since 1941, featuring in defense alongside Aparicio and keeping a clean sheet in a 4\u20130 win. For the colchonero side, he played 108 competitive matches, including 95 in the league, and scored 7 goals for the club, all of which were in the league; at Deportivo, he scored 11 goals in 135 competitive matches, which were all in the league, so in total, Cuenca scored 18 goals in 230 league matches.\nOn 29 May 1955, Cuenca received a tribute at the Riazor stadium with a friendly match between Brazilian club Vasco da Gama and Deportivo, which was reinforced by the likes of Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, as well as the Celtics Pablo Olmedo and Carlos Torres, although Deportivo still lost 1\u20136.\nCuenca was always a great ball handler, with measured passes into space, very difficult to intercept; he was also very noble on and off the field, never having problems with his teammates.\nDeath\nAfter hanging up his boots, Cuenca set up a sports equipment establishment in La Coru\u00f1a next to his colleague Waldo Botana. Cuenca died in Madrid on 3 February 1969, at the age of 45, as a result of cancer.\nHonours\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid\nFEF President Cup (1): 1941\u201347\nLa Liga (1): 1949\u201350\n",

    "1965\u20131966 mass arrests in Ukraine by the Soviet government\nFrom August 1965 to May 1966, the government of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic orchestrated a mass arrest of intellectuals associated with the counter-culture Sixtier movement. Occurring simultaneously with the Sinyavsky\u2013Daniel trial, the purge occurred without the knowledge of western media until the publication of journalist Viacheslav Chornovil's petition (popularly known as The Chornovil Papers). An estimated 190\u2013200 people were arrested during the purge.\nBackground\nThe Khrushchev Thaw led to the emergence of new expressions of culture in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Following filmmaker Alexander Dovzhenko's 1955 call for the \"expansion of the creative boundaries of socialist realism\", young Ukrainian intellectuals began creating art and artistic criticism that openly defied socialist realist principles in what later became known as the Sixtier movement. The Sixtiers played an important role in Ukraine's cultural revival following the Stalin era.\nSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was removed in 1964, bringing an end to the Khrushchev Thaw. While some of the Sixtiers chose to cooperate with the newly established government of Leonid Brezhnev, many others were further radicalised. Ukrainian samydav took an increasingly-confrontational attitude towards the government, Ukrainian diaspora publications were more frequently distributed, and the movement to preserve Ukrainian culture adopted a greater political character.\nPurge\nIn late August 1965, the KGB issued orders to its Ukrainian branch to begin arresting intellectuals. From 24 August to 4 September 25 leading Sixtiers (seven in Kyiv and 17 in Lviv, according to the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group; other sources claim further locations, for those arrested, such as Odesa for Gereta and Krasne railway station for Mykhailo Horyn.) were arrested on charges of anti-Soviet agitation. While the dates of the arrests are agreed upon, sources differ as to the individuals arrested on each date. For example, Bohdan Horyn recalled that he and Mykhailo Horyn were arrested on the same date as Kosiv (26 September), while the Resistance Movement in Ukraine encyclopedia states that Kosiv was not arrested until 27 September, being arrested alongside Zalyvakha and Gereta.\nThe initial arrests had the opposite of the intended effect; far from cowing the Ukrainian intelligentsia into cooperation with the government, it encouraged them to more actively protest against worsening human rights conditions. On 4 September 1965, at the film theatre Ukraine\u00a0 premiere of Sergei Parajanov's Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors, leading Ukrainian intellectual Ivan Dziuba, along with student Vasyl Stus and with the support of journalist Viacheslav Chornovil, staged a protest against the arrests. Dziuba claimed that the film's status was overshadowed by the ongoing purge, and began listing the names of those arrested. As he was being escorted out of the theatre by the director, Stus called on those \"against the revival of Stalinism\" to stand up.\nAfter September, the arrests continued, although at a decreased rate. Sviatoslav Karavanskyi was arrested in Odesa on 13 November, according to both Bohdan Horyn and Resistance Movement in Ukraine. Shevchuk's arrest, according to Horyn and Resistance Movement in Ukraine, later occurred in Zhytomyr on 23 May 1966, the last of the significant arrests.\nA total of around 190 to 200 people were arrested.\nThe Chornovil Papers\nAt the time of the purge, Viacheslav Chornovil was a state journalist associated with the Lviv Komsomol. Tasked with covering the trials of those purged and giving evidence against intellectuals, Chornovil refused to give evidence to support the conviction of Osadchy (as well as Mykhailo and Bohdan Horyn and Zvarycheska, according to historian Vasyl Shvydkyi). As a result, he was fired from his job as a correspondent at the Second Reading newspaper. Chornovil wrote a series of papers documenting the 1965 purge and those arrested, and sent them to the Ukrainian government. For the first of the papers, he was arrested on 8 July 1966 and sentenced to a 20% reduction in salary. For an open letter to Ukrainian communist leader Petro Shelest, in which he argued that the arrests were contrary to Soviet law, Chornovil was arrested and sentenced to eight months of hard labour in Mordovia. Chornovil's writings were later compiled into a single book and smuggled overseas to France, where they were published as The Chornovil Papers.\nThe Chornovil Papers captivated the attention of the American public, which had previously been focused on the simultaneous Sinyavsky\u2013Daniel trial.

    "Lifeboat station in Anglesey, Wales\nBeaumaris Lifeboat Station is located in the town of Beaumaris, on the Isle of Anglesey, in Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1891.\nFor many years, Beaumaris was home to four different Inshore lifeboats, all named Blue Peter II after funds were raised by the BBC TV programme, but since 2010, the station has operated the B-class (Atlantic 85) Inshore lifeboat Annette Mary Liddington (B-838).\nHistory\nOn 7 November 1890, in very rough seas in the Menai Strait, the Penmon lifeboat Christopher Brown capsized after recovering 5 crew from the Undaunted, aground on Lavan Sands. The lifeboat self-righted, and all were recovered. Following this, the crew requested of the RNLI, that a larger sailing lifeboat be placed in the Menai Strait. Beaumaris Lifeboat Station started with the arrival of the 42-foot lifeboat Henry Dundas (ON 271), previously at St Mary's, on 6 October 1891. The boat was moored afloat, and renamed Tom and Jenny.\nThe lifeboat was called on service 6 times over the following 4 years, rescuing 2 lives. However, in 1896, a new larger boat was placed at Penmon, and the Beaumaris station was closed on 16 April 1896. Tom and Jenny (ON 271) would be transferred to Rosslare Harbour, where she would serve for a further 15 years.\nIn 1910, it was decided to re-open the Beaumaris station, and place a motor-powered lifeboat there. Construction began of a new boathouse, pier and deep-water roller-slipway near Tre-Castell Point, costing \u00a34,500. An order was placed with Thames Ironworks for a 43-foot Watson-class lifeboat, with a 60\u00a0hp Tylor 'D' petrol engine, providing 7\u00bd knots, and costing a further \u00a33,727. Completed in August 1913, she was first taken to Cowes Regatta, where a short trip was taken by King George V. The boat remained in Cowes due to construction delays with the new boathouse, eventually arriving in Beaumaris in July 1914, where it would be named Frederick Kitchen (ON 621). Over the following 31 years at Beaumaris, Frederick Kitchen would launch 38 times, and rescue 46. The Penmon station was subsequently closed on 31 March 1915.\nIn 1966, the BBC TV programme Blue Peter launched an appeal for 60,000 paperback books, the sale of which would fund a new Inshore lifeboat for the RNLI. Such was the success of the appeal, that four new lifeboats were provided. The BBC TV programme would eventually fund 28 lifeboats located around the UK and Northern Ireland.\nBeaumaris would receive their first Inshore lifeboat, Blue Peter II (D-127), in 1967. A small boathouse was erected near Victoria Terrace, replaced with a more permanent building nearer the pier in 1975. Further works were carried out to extend the building in 1983 and 1991, with a completely new station being built in 2000.\nBlue Peter II (D-127) would serve for 7 years, launching 123 times, and saving 45 lives. She would be replaced by a larger B-class (Atlantic 75) lifeboat in 1976, and two further Atlantic type boats, all named Blue Peter II. After her service at Beaumaris, Blue Peter II (D-127) would go on display at Flambards Theme Park, Helston.\nIn 1991, with a Mersey-class lifeboat stationed at Llandudno, and a Tyne-class lifeboat at Moelfre, it was decided to close the boathouse and slipway near Tre-Castell Point, which was subsequently demolished. Beaumaris lifeboat The Robert (ON 955) was withdrawn and retired from service on 7 July 1991.\nIn 2010, Beaumaris received their latest Inshore lifeboat, an B-class (Atlantic 85) lifeboat, Annette Mary Liddington (B-838), the boat being funded by local donations, and from the bequest of Mr John Grover Liddington, in memory of his mother.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Beaumaris\nRNLI Silver Medal\nDavid Griffiths, Seaman - 1830\nWilliam Lewis Walker, Collegian - 1831 (Medal and Silver Boat, double award)\nRalph Williamson, Capt. of yacht Campeadora - 1831 (Medal and Silver Boat, double award)\nRNLI Bronze Medal\nDavid Gallichan, Coxswain - 1982\nThe Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\nJohn Charles Askew, Helmsman - 1976\nDavid Jones, Helmsman - 1978\nVellum Service Certificates\nJohn Askew, crew member - 1978\nSimon Dubberley, crew member - 1978\nDr Jack Dubberley, crew member - 1978\nA Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman of the Institution\nBeaumaris Coxswain and Crew - 1959\nMartin Broughton, crew member - 1998\nBeaumaris lifeboats and tractors\nAll-weather lifeboats\nAll-weather lifeboat withdrawn in 1991\nInshore lifeboats\nLaunch and recovery tractors\n^ ON is the RNLI's Official Number of the boat.\n^ a b Op.

    "2019 novel by Jean-Claude Grumberg\nThe Most Precious of Cargoes: A Tale (French: La Plus Pr\u00e9cieuse des marchandises\u00a0: Un conte) is a novel by French author and playwright Jean-Claude Grumberg, published on 10 January 2019 by \u00c9ditions du Seuil. It is a postmodern fairy tale set during the Holocaust. It was translated into English by Frank Wynne, and published on 29 September 2020 by HarperVia.\nPlot\nA Jewish family with two infants is deported on a freight train from the Drancy internment camp to the Auschwitz concentration camp in February 1943. The mother fears that she will not be able to feed both children with her milk, so she decides to throw one of them outside in the snow, wrapped in a prayer shawl.\nIt is there, deep in the Polish forest, that she is found by a woodcutter's wife, a kind, modest woman who likes to watch the messages and the shouts of people on the trains without knowing what is happening to them and who has always wanted to have a child. She sees the screaming child and its fine scarf as a gift from God - her \"little cargo\", as she calls it - and takes it home with her, where she has an argument with her husband. He realises that the child is Jewish, who he deems as a member of the \"accursed race\". He describes the parents as \"heartless\" and \"the ones who killed God\", and refuses to keep the child, not least because of the death penalty that threatens anyone who shelters a Jew. However, after his wife's earnest pleas, he allows her to keep the child.\nDespite the rationing imposed during the war, the woman works to feed the child and raise it lovingly. From then on, she no longer observes the trains from which people had previously thrown pieces of paper at her, and does not ask herself what happened to the other people on the freight train, because she is too preoccupied with her newfound happiness.\nEpilogue\nThe novel concludes with a metafictional epilogue that directly addresses the reader's curiosity as to whether or not the narrative is a \"true story\". Grumberg affirms: \"Of course not, absolutely not\". However, this is immediately followed by a similarly absolute denial of the events of the Holocaust: \"There were no cargo trains crossing war-torn continents to deliver urgently their oh-so-perishable cargo. No reunification camps, internment camps, concentration camps, or even extermination camps. No families were vaporized in smoke after their final journey. No hair was shorn, gathered, packaged, and shipped. There were no flames, no ashes, no tears.\" Steven G. Kellman wrote for Tablet, \"Since we know that these genocidal horrors did occur, that\u2014hard as it is to believe\u2014there were in fact cargo trains that transported human beings to extermination camps, we are forced to read Grumberg's indelible 'fairy tale' as accurate history.\" Kirkus Reviews and the Los Angeles Review of Books assessed the epilogue as an appeal for the reader to question the relationships between storytelling and history, and between myth and truth.\nThe epilogue is followed by an appendix for \"Lovers of True Stories\" which states the numbers of the convoys on which the author's father and grandfather left, the number of people on board, and that of the survivors.\nReception\nIn a starred review, Kirkus Reviews proclaimed, \"It is difficult, in 2020, to write a work of fiction about the Holocaust that is original; even simply in this sense, Grumberg's work succeeds where many have failed.\" Rapha\u00eblle Leyris of Le Monde wrote that the narrative's \"acerbic tenderness for its characters prevents it from falling into simple pastiche\".\nFilm adaptation\nMain article: The Most Precious of Cargoes (film)\nAn animated film adaptation of the same name was directed Michel Hazanavicius, who co-wrote the screenplay with Grumberg. The film, which features the voices of Dominique Blanc, Gr\u00e9gory Gadebois, Denis Podalyd\u00e8s and Jean-Louis Trintignant, was selected in the main competition at the 77th Cannes Film Festival.\n",

    "16th Century French noble and diplomat\nJean \u00c9brard, seigneur de Saint-Sulpice (26 August 1519\u20135 November 1581) was a French noble, governor, soldier and diplomat during the latter Italian Wars and the French Wars of Religion. Born into the first family of the province of Quercy Saint-Sulpice began his military service during the reign of Fran\u00e7ois I, seeing service at the siege of Boulogne in 1544. Under his successor Henri II Saint-Sulpice operated as a client of the constable Montmorency and fought at the defence of Metz in 1552 and capture of Calais in 1558. During Henri's reign he began his diplomatic role and was tasked with presenting Henri's position to the delegates negotiating the Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis after a shift in the crown's position. He received a further diplomatic role securing the withdrawal of French forces from Siena as a term of the peace.\nDuring the reign of Charles IX he moved to be a patron of the queen mother Catherine. He led two further diplomatic missions, first to Espa\u00f1a and then Portugal in 1560 and 1561 respectively. In mid 1562 he replaced the bishop of Limoges as the French ambassador to Espa\u00f1a. In this role he unsuccessfully campaigned to get Espa\u00f1a to declare war on England after the latters entry into the first French War of Religion in September 1562. When Espa\u00f1a objected to the peace that the French crown negotiated with the rebels Saint-Sulpice and Catherine took the line that Espa\u00f1a should not trouble itself with French internal affairs. In the crisis over the excommunication of the queen of Navarre Saint-Sulpice relayed information of a Spanish plot against her to the French court thus aiding in its neutralisation. He counselled taking a course of caution during further disputes with Espa\u00f1a over Papal precedence and a rebellion in Corse. Throughout this period Catherine had hoped for a personal meeting with Felipe and Saint-Sulpice helped arrange this meeting which was to transpire at Bayonne in June 1565. Felipe would not participate however but rather his wife \u00c9lisabeth. His efforts to convince Felipe of the wisdom of a new royal marriage between the kingdoms was a failure. Relieved of his charge in 1565 he returned to the French court where he had been established as a conseiller d'\u00c9tat (councillor of state). During the second war of religion he fought at the battle of Saint-Denis. Absent from his territories in the third war of religion, his relatives endeavoured to secure the preservation of the families lands in Quercy. When the surintendant de la maison (superintendent of the household) of the king's brother Alen\u00e7on died in 1569, Saint-Sulpice replaced him, and used the position to insert many of his children into Alen\u00e7on's household. In this capacity he would be with Alen\u00e7on during the siege of La Rochelle at which one of his sons was killed. During the fourth war of religion Saint-Sulpice engaged in internal diplomatic efforts and was tasked with the arrest of the governor of Languedoc the baron de Damville.\nAfter the death of Charles and the ascent of his brother Anjou as Henri III, Saint-Sulpice found his position in Alen\u00e7on's household compromised by his rebellion. In August 1576 he departed from the role and was soon followed by his relatives. At the Estates General called as a term of the peace his eldest son Henri \u00c9brard was killed by one of Alen\u00e7on's men. Saint-Sulpice was one of the diplomats involved in the negotiations that brought the sixth war of religion to a close in September 1577. The king subsequently tasked him with a role in the peace's enforcement. Saint-Sulpice joined with Catherine for a new internal peace effort in August 1578, crossing much of southern France in a mission that concluded with the Treaty of N\u00e9rac which established him as a commissioner for the peace in Guyenne. As a reward he was made a chevalier (knight) of the Ordre du Saint-Esprit (Order of the Saint-Esprit) the most senior order of French chivalry. He died on 5 November 1581 and was succeeded to his titles by his son Bertrand.\nEarly life and family\nJean \u00c9brard was born on 26 August 1519, the second son of Antoine \u00c9brard (\u20131563) and Marguerite de L\u00e9vis. He had a full brother Christophe \u00c9brard, the abbot of Marcilhac in Quercy. He also had a half brother Nicolas \u00c9brard, the sieur de Cluset from his father's second marriage, and a half sister Jeanne \u00c9brard who married Ren\u00e9 de Pins-Montbrun. Jean helped facilitate the marriage of his half brother to an heiress named Vignan. His father fought several times for the king but generally preferred to maintain a rural existence.\nThe \u00c9brard family traced the possession of their various lands between Cahors and Figeac back to the 13th century. They enjoyed relations with many important families of the region such as the Cardaillac, Gourdon, Vaillac, Lauzi\u00e8res, Th\u00e9mines, Genouillac, Estang and Arpajon. In the late 15th century the family took advantage of litigation to increase the value of the cens (tax for usage of the land",

    "Australian writer\nJeannie Lockett - social and political writer\nJane Lockett (27 August 1847 \u2013 14 November 1890), better known as Jeannie Lockett, was a colonial Australian writer and schoolteacher. Her articles on social and political issues were published in England in the 1880s. She also wrote short stories and non-fiction for the Australian press, sometimes as Jennie Lockett or Jeannie Leckett or Beattie. Her novel, Judith Grant, was published posthumously.\nLife\nBorn Jane Beattie on 27 August 1847 in Bathurst, New South Wales, she was one of 15 children of writer Mary Anne (died 1906) and Hugh Beattie (died 1890). The family later settled at Wagga Wagga where Hugh established the Brooklyn vineyard. She married Thomas Lockett in Wagga on 27 May 1868. He was a blacksmith who had grown up on the goldfields at Lambing Flat (now Young).\nAfter her marriage, Lockett worked as an assistant schoolteacher at Hamilton Public School in 1880. In 1884 at Camperdown Public School she received a promotion. In 1888 she had  been transferred to Plunkett Street Public School as mistress overseeing the female students. She also tutored students sitting for matriculation examinations for university entrance.\nAlongside her teaching, Lockett sent articles on the Australian social and political scene which were published in The Westminster Review, The Nineteenth Century (TNC) and St James's Gazette. In 1885 her article on \"Female Labour in Australia\" was published in TNC in the hope of attracting women migrate to Australia to work as domestic servants. It was republished in The Bathurst Free Press and Mining Journal, described as a \"well-written paper\" but a review in the Australian Town and Country Journal felt it would do little to lessen the servant shortage.\nLockett died aged 43 on 14 November 1890 at St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst and she was buried at Waverley Cemetery.

    "1622 execution of 55 Christians in Nagasaki\n17th-century anonymous painting of the Great Genna Martyrdom currently at the Church of the Ges\u00f9, Rome\nThe Great Genna Martyrdom (\u5143\u548c\u306e\u5927\u6b89\u6559, Genna no daijunky\u014d), also known as the Great Martyrdom of Nagasaki, was the execution of 55 foreign and domestic Catholics killed together at Nishizaka Hill in Nagasaki, Japan, on 10 September 1622. Beginning in 1614, Christianity was banned in Japan and a smuggling incident concerning two foreign missionaries prompted the killing. The mass execution was part of the persecution of Christians in Japan by Tokugawa Hidetada, the second Shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate.\nBackground and execution\nBackground\nA nationwide ban on Christianity was promulgated in 1614 during the shogunate of Tokugawa Hidetada. In Nagasaki, several measures were taken to implement this ban. Tronu Montane, a scholar at the Kansai Gaidai University described these measures as a \"straightforward policy of elimination of Christians that had a dramatic impact on Nagasaki Christian community\".\nAfter the death of Tokugawa Ieyasu \u2013 the first Shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate \u2013 in 1616, the persecution of Christians in Japan focused on the promotion of apostasy and the elimination of foreign missionaries. This policy was implemented in Nagasaki by Gonroku, the bugy\u014d from 1615 to 1625. Large-scale executions were not uncommon parts of this policy of Christian elimination: 23 Christians had been concurrently executed in Edo (Tokyo) in August 1613; 43 in Kuchinotsu, Arima, in November 1614; and 53 in Kyoto in 1619.\nExecution\nThe \"Great Genna Martyrdom\", took its name from the Japanese era name of Genna, which denotes the time from July 1615 until February 1624; the mass killing is also known as the Great Martyrdom of Nagasaki. It was preceded by an incident with the Christian Japanese Merchant Hirayama J\u014dchin, who had received an official seal to trade with Manila. In 1620, Hirayama tried to smuggle two Mendicant priests disguised as merchants (Pedro de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u00a0 and Luis Flores) on his way back from Manila into Japan, but before they could enter Japanese territory, his ship was attacked by Dutch and the English forces and its cargo was confiscated. The crew of the ship, including the priests, were imprisoned in Hirato.\nHirayama claimed that his official seal should grant his ship protection; the Dutch and English, however, argued that the presence of priests forfeited this protection. After two years of imprisonment, the priests confessed that they were indeed Christian missionaries. This confession resulted in the burning alive of the two priests and Hirayama as well as the decapitation of the remaining crew in Nagasaki on 19 August 1622.\nDue to this smuggling incident, the prosecution of Christians was intensified and the bugy\u014d Gonroku ordered the killing of all priests currently imprisoned in the Nagasaki and \u014cmura prisons as well as some of their followers. In total, 55 Christians were to be executed. The execution of these 55 Christians, now known as the Great Genna Martyrdom, occurred on 10 September 1622 on Nishizaka Hill in Nagasaki. It thus happened on exactly the same place as the crucifixion of the 26 Martyrs of Japan on 5 February 1597.\nAn early account of the execution is provided in a 1624 pamphlet by Andres de Parra printed in Madrid. The pamphlet in Spanish is titled Relacion breve de los grandes y rigurosos martirios que el a\u00f1o passado de 1622. dieron en el Iapon a ciento y diez y ocho illustrissimos Martyres, sacada principalmente de las cartas de los Padres de la Compa\u00f1ia de Iesus que alli residen: y de lo que han referido muchas personas de aquel Reyno, que en dos nauios llegaron a la ciudad de Manila a 12. de Agosto de 1623 ('A Brief Account of the Great and Rigorous Martyrdoms which Last Year, 1622, Were Inflicted in Japan on One Hundred and Eighteen Illustrious Martyrs, Drawn Principally From the Letters of the Fathers of the Society of Jesus Who Reside There, and From What Has Been Reported by Many Persons of that Kingdom, Who Arrived in Two Ships at the City of Manila on 12 August 1623'). The pamphlet was translated in part into English in 1927.\nThe Imago primi saeculi, a 1640 book about the Society of Jesus, contains a description of the Great Genna Martyrdom:\nTo make the punishment longer and more cruel, the fire was six cubits away from the (martyr\u2019s) body. The arms were lightly bound to the posts, and  were tied loosely. And they were made so that they were not difficult to untie. Those who did not dare to endure the punishment could escape if they wanted to. But there was not one of them who did not look to the heavens with his eyes, not one who did not endure the fire without moving his heart and body, even though the wood was burning strongly around them.\u2014\u200aImago primi saeculi, pp. 528\u2013529\nWhile this account implies that the condemned in principle could have untied their restraints, this would not have resulted in them being able to flee.

It aired from 12 December 2022 to 14 April 2023 and starred Aurra Bhatnagar Badoni, Vaishnavi Prajapati, Rachi Sharma, Adirija Roy and Kunal Jaisingh in lead roles. It is a sequel to Barrister Babu.\nPlot\nAniruddh and Bondita are taking their daughters, Durga and Devi, to Darjeeling for their fifth birthday, when the family are in a terrible car crash. Aniruddh and Bondita die, and Durga is thrown from the car into a bush by the side of the road; Devi, still in the car, suffers a head injury and loses her memory. The other driver rushes to the scene of the crash, where he finds Devi with her dead parents, and takes her with him, leaving behind the unconscious Durga.\nDurga is struggling with nightmares about the accident and with fear of Sumona and her husband Polash, who bully the girl and plan to get the whole Roy Chaudhary property in their own name. Meanwhile, Devi, now called Charu, has been adopted by circus workers called Banke and Bholi, and does fearless acrobatics, but she dreams of getting a proper education and becoming a barrister. The two girls share a special connection, which allows each of them to feel the other's pain.\nBinoy angers Sumona by deciding to take Durga to a better hospital in Delhi for treatment. The girls see each other, and Charu tries to run away from her adoptive parents, only to be caught and sold to a brothel. With Durga's help, she and her adopted sister, Chumki, manage to escape, and she comes with Durga to Kolkata. There, Charu fights off Durga's bullies, and the two girls perform a Shradh puja ceremony for their parents.\nSoon after, Charu figures out that Kalnemi, whom Durga is afraid of, is Polash in disguise. Polash denies it, blames someone else, and tries to manipulate Sampoorna, but Sampoorna and Binoy are impressed by Charu and decide to adopt her.\nMeanwhile, Sheru, the owner of the brothel, has threatened Bholi that unless she returns Charu and Chumki to him, he will take her in their place. Bholi and Banke travel to Kolkata; Bholi insinuates herself into the family, while Banke takes out a loan from Binoy. On Durga Puja, Banke sees a portrait of Aniruddh and Bondita and realizes everything. To prevent him from coming clean to Binoy and Sampoorna, Bholi has Sheru kill him.\nBholi then introduces Chumki to the family as Devi and has her accuse Durga of hitting her, claims that Charu killed Banke, and Charu is arrested. With Durga's help, Charu escapes and disguises herself as Chaturvuj to evade Bholi and the police. She tries to blackmail Bholi, but it backfires. She is saved by Banke, who is alive but has lost his memory. Eventually, Bholi manages to get Charu arrested again, and Durga swears to Sampoorna to never meet Charu again. Durga is sent to study in Darjeeling, and Charu, who thinks the twelve years she is facing in prison are Durga's fault, is devastated.\nDurga and Charu, now grown up, have both become barristers, despite Charu still being in prison. Charu blames Durga for her imprisonment and thinks of her as an enemy, but Durga has secretly been sending all of her pocket money for Charu's education.\nCast\nMain\nRachi Sharma as Barrister Durga Roy Choudhary \u2013 Bondita and Anirudh's elder daughter; Devi's twin sister (2023)\nAurra Bhatnagar Badoni as Child Durga (2022\u201323)\nAdrija Roy as Barrister Devi \"Charu\" Roy Choudhary Banerjee \u2013 Bondita and Anirudh's younger daughter; Bankey and Bholi's adopted daughter; Durga's twin sister; Chumki's adopted sister; Anirban's wife (2023) \nVaishnavi Prajapati as Child Devi/Charu (2022\u201323)\nMohit Kumar / Kunal Jaisingh as Anirban Banerjee \u2013 Abhiroop's elder son; Mihir's brother; Latika's step son; Devi's husband (2023)\nRecurring\nChandan K Anand as Binoy Roy Choudhary \u2013 Trilochan's brother; Shubhra's widower; Sampoorna's second husband; Aniruddh, Somnath, Batuk and Shashwati's father; Durga and Devi's grandfather (2022\u20132023)\nPravisht Mishra as Barrister Anirudh Roy Chaudhary \u2013 Binoy and Shubhra's eldest son; Sampoorna's step-son; Somnath and Batuk's brother; Shashwati's half-brother; Bondita's husband; Durga and Devi's father (Dead) (2022)\nAnchal Sahu as Barrister Bondita Roy Chaudhary \u2013 Sumati and Arvind's daughter; Sampoorna's cousin; Anirudh's wife; Durga and Devi's mother (Dead)(2022)\nJyoti Mukherjee as Sampoorna Jadhav Roy Chaudhary \u2013 Sundaram and Devoleena's daughter; Bondita's cousin; Saurabh's widow; Binoy's second wife; Shashwati's mother; Anirudh, Somnath and Batuk's step-mother; Durga and Devi's aunt/step-grandmother (2022\u20132023)\nKaushiki Rathore as Shashwati \"Sumona\" Roy Chaudhary \u2013 Binoy and Sampoorna's daughter; Aniruddh, Somnath and Batuk's half-sister; Durga and Devi's cousin/aunt; Polash's wife (2022\u20132023)\nSayantan Banerjee as Polash \u2013 Sumona's husband (2022\u20132023)\nSudeep Sarangi as Bankey \u2013 Devi's adoptive father, Bholi's husband; Chumki's father (202",
    "\nIn European Union law, sincere cooperation (Article 4(3) TEU) is one of the foundational principles of the European Union, which determines that the Union and the Member States are required to implement any necessary measures to guarantee compliance with the duties stemming from the Treaties \"in full mutual respect\".\nSincere cooperation is mentioned explicitly not only in the Treaty on European Union but also in the Court of Justice of the EU's case law, applicable to different exclusive, shared, supporting competences, such as the environment, the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice, public health, competition rules governing the internal market, and others.\nThe jurisprudence of the CJEU has elaborated on four main responsibilities that derive from the principle of sincere cooperation:\n1) An obligation for respect and assistance between the EU and Member States in attaining the Treaties' objectives\n2) Member States have an active obligation to cooperate and comply with original and derivative European law\n3) Member States need to refrain from taking any measures that would impede the aims and goals of the Union\n4) Member States should facilitate the institutions of the EU to accomplish the Union's objectives.\nLegal origins\nIn Article 10 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) from 2002, the provision contains the outlines of what is today known as \"the principle of sincere cooperation\":\n\"Member States shall take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of this Treaty or resulting from action taken by the institutions of the Community. They shall facilitate the achievement of the Community's tasks.\nThey shall abstain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of this Treaty.\"\u2014\u200aTreaty establishing the European Community (Consolidated version 2002), Article 10\nHowever, since the Treaty of Lisbon the provisions have been enhanced through Articles 4(3) and Article 24(3) of TEU:\n3.   Pursuant to the principle of sincere cooperation, the Union and the Member States shall, in full mutual respect, assist each other in carrying out tasks which flow from the Treaties.\nThe Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union.\nThe Member States shall facilitate the achievement of the Union's tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the Union's objectives.\u2014\u200aTreaty on European Union, Article 4\nInitially, it is notable that sincere cooperation gained a more significant prominence in the founding treaties and a more central position, that follows immediately after the Union's values. More importantly, the relationship with the principle of sincere cooperation has been widened as a two-way street, that does not only involve the Member States but also requires reciprocity from the Union's institutions. This balance can be witnessed in Article 13 TEU:\n2.   Each institution shall act within the limits of the powers conferred on it in the Treaties, and in conformity with the procedures, conditions and objectives set out in them. The institutions shall practice mutual sincere cooperation.\u2014\u200aTreaty on European Union, Article 13\nThis balance with sincere cooperation between inter-parties relationship, regarding the Member States and the Union, has been extended to intra-institutional relationships, within the EU. The constitutional origin of this intra-institutional commitment to sincere cooperation could be traced in CJEU case law, such as the case Greece v Council from 1986 and Luxembourg v Parliament from 1981, where the Court established that \"the operation of the budgetary procedure..., is based essentially on inter-institutional dialogue. That dialogue is subject to the same mutual duties of sincere cooperation which, as the Court has held, govern relations between the Member States and the Community institutions...\".\nAside from the extension of sincere cooperation on an intra-institutional level, it is crucial to underscore that there is a mixed relationship between sincere cooperation (Article 4(3) TEU), and the requirement of unity and close cooperation. The latter are duties applicable to the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy. For instance, Article 24 TEU, underlines:2.   Within the framework of the principles and objectives of its external action, the Union shall conduct, define and implement a common foreign and security policy, based on the development of mutual political solidarity among Member States, the identification of questions of general interest and the achievement of an ever-increasing degree of convergence of Member States' actions.\n3.   The Member States shall support the Union's external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity and shall comply with the",
    "Dutch composer and conductor\nJohannes Theodorus (Jan) Ingenhoven (Breda, 19 May 1876 \u2013 Hoenderloo, 20 May 1951), was a Dutch composer and conductor. He was one of the first to introduce new influences shaping twentieth century European music into the Netherlands before World War 1, and also took contemporary Dutch music into Germany.\nCareer\nJan Ingenhoven was born into a family of gifted amateur musicians: his father (a baker) played oboe and violin and an uncle played the saxophone. He learned the clarinet at an early age, sang in a choir and was soon conducting local choirs in Breda and Dordrecht. From 1902 he studied harmony and composition with Ludwig Felix Brandts Buys (1847\u20131917). After his marriage to Johanna Hermine Frantzmann in 1905 he settled in Munich and continued his studies with the Austrian conductor Felix Mottl.\nIngenhoven promoted Dutch music abroad, organizing a Dutch Music Festival in Munich in 1906 that included his own music and pieces by his contemporaries Alphons Diepenbrock, Johan Wagenaar and Carl Smulders (1863\u20131934). The following year he put on a similar festival in Berlin, introducing music by Anna Cramer, Kor Kuiler (1877\u20131951) and Corn\u00e9lie van Oosterzee.\nBetween 1906 and 1909 he conducted the M\u00fcnchner Orchester Verein and the Dutch Philharmonic Orchestra. He also led the M\u00fcnchner Madrigal Vereinigung choir (1909\u201312), with which he toured successfully across Europe. After 1915 he moved to Switzerland (Lake Thun) and also spent time in Paris. His wife died in 1929 and after that Ingenhoven composed very little. He donated his Swiss house to the Dutch Association for Contemporary Music in 1937, moving to Darmstadt for a short time before settling back in the Netherlands. He retired to the Veluwe district, where he died in 1951, aged 75.\nMusic\nIngenhoven composed orchestral music in a late Romantic style, comparable to Franz Schmidt, Richard Strauss and Alexander Zemlinsky. Typical are the three orchestral Symphonic Poems (Lyrical, Dramatic, Romantic) composed between 1905 and 1908: the second of these was performed three times by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in September 1915, conducted by Evert Cornelis. Other large scale orchestral pieces in much the same vein are the Symphonische Fantasie \u00fcber Zarathustras (1906) and the Symphonische Fantasie Brabant and Holland (1910\u201311).\nA more original side of his work is seen in his songs, vocal quartets and choral music. The song cycle Blumenlieder (1907\u20138) - seven flower songs with words by various authors - experiments with a declamatory style which closely reflects the accents, relative lengths and inflections of the text. The vocal quartet \u2018Nous n\u2019irons plus au bois\u2019 (1909) from the 4 quatuors \u00e0 voix mixtes, was claimed by Ingenhoven to be the first atonal vocal work by a Dutch composer.  The choral settings put an emphasis on intricate polyphony, derived both from Renaissance music and his contemporary Max Reger.\nIngenhoven also composed much chamber music, including three String Quartets, a Quintet for woodwind, a Clarinet Sonata, two Violin Sonatas, two Cello Sonatas, and various combinations of trios. His later music showed an increasing influence from French music (particularly Debussy) and a turning away from Romanticism to a more objective style. In particular, the later chamber works combine his interest in polyphony with a more homophonic approach, harmonically ambiguous with long melismatic melodies of little thematic function.\nHis work as a composer was admired by contemporaries such as Matthijs Vermeulen, Willem Landr\u00e9 and Dani\u00ebl Ruyneman, but after his German period Ingenhoven himself did little to promote his compositions.\nSelected works\n4 quatuors \u00e0 voix mixtes (1903\u20139)\nSymphonic Poem No. 1 Lyrical, for small orchestra (1905)\nSymphonic Fantasy on \"Zarathustra's Night Song\" for bass soloist and orchestra (1906)\nSymphonic Poem No. 2, Dramatic for orchestra (1907)\nThree movements for string quartet (1907\u201308)\nBlumenlieder, (Flower Songs), song cycle (1907\u20138)\nTwo songs with piano accompaniment: Evening Serenade, The Dreaming Lake (1908)\nSymphonic Poem No. 3, Romantic for small orchestra (1908)\nSint Jansvier (words Guido Gezelle), a capella choir (1909)\nKlaus Tink, ballade for baritone and small orchestra (1909)\nNordic landscape for male voices, soloists and orchestra (1910)\nSymphonic Fantasy on \"Brabant en Holland\" for orchestra (1910-11)\nString Quartet in One Movement (1911)\nQuintet, op. 23 for flute, oboe, clarinet, horn and bassoon (1911)\nAn die Nacht (words Clemens Brentano), four part a capella choir (1911)\nString Quartet No. 3 (1912)\nPi\u00e8ces pour 3 instruments divers No. 1, piano trio, 1912\u201313\nSymphonic Concerto for violin, cello, piano and chamber orchestra (1912-13)\nMietje (words Guido Gezelle), four part a capella choir (1913)\nPi\u00e8ces pour 3 instruments divers No. 2, flute, clarinet, harp, 1914\u201315\nClarinet Sonata (1916-17)\nPi\u00e8ces pour 3 instruments divers No. 3, violin, cello, harp, 1918\nCello Sonata No. 1 (1919)\nViol",

The episode was written by consulting producer Matt Lambert, and directed by Takeshi Fukunaga. It was released on Hulu on April 2, 2024, and it also aired on FX on the same day.\nThe series is set in 1600, and follows three characters. John Blackthorne, a risk-taking English sailor who ends up shipwrecked in Japan, a land whose unfamiliar culture will ultimately redefine him; Lord Toranaga, a shrewd, powerful daimyo, at odds with his own dangerous, political rivals; and Lady Mariko, a woman with invaluable skills but dishonorable family ties, who must prove her value and allegiance. In the episode, Toranaga meets his estranged half-brother to discuss terms of merging their two armies to invade Osaka as part of Crimson Sky. \nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.540 million household viewers and gained a 0.09 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349. The episode received critical acclaim, who praised the performances and production values.\nPlot\nIn 1554, a young Toranaga leads his first battle, which ends in his victory against the warlord Mizoguchi. Mizoguchi surrenders, admiring Toranaga's determination and mastery of battle. Toranaga honors Mizoguchi's wishes, and the latter commits seppuku by stabbing himself in the stomach before Toranaga beheads him. \nIn 1600, Toranaga meets with his estranged half-brother, Saeki Nobutatsu. Toranaga wants to unite their armies to invade Osaka as part of Crimson Sky, and Saeki agrees to help his brother. Despite that, Toranaga has no plans for Blackthorne's role in the invasion, refusing to let him command his ship. During dinner, Saeki reveals he has been offered the fifth regency in place of Sugiyama, and Toranaga must either surrender to the council in Osaka or face imminent war. After blocking off all routes to Ajiro, Saeki also informs Yabushige that his general has been executed, ending his chance of successfully playing both sides. \nAfter threatening Blackthorne, Buntaro asks Toranaga permission to kill him. He refuses, claiming he would have to kill Mariko as well, and he knows Buntaro cannot bring himself to do it. Mariko herself asks to commit seppuku, but Toranaga also refuses to let her do it. When Saeki returns, Toranaga proclaims that there will be no Crimson Sky. Against the wishes of Nagakado and Yabushige, Toranaga states he will go to Osaka and surrender. Without Toranaga's knowledge, Nagakado, with Kiku's aid, attempts to kill Saeki at Ajiro's teahouse. Saeki attempts to flee the ambush, but trips into the teahouse's pond as Nagakado catches up to him. However, as Nagakado attempts to kill Saeki, the former slips and fatally hits his head on a rock.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn March 2024, Hulu confirmed that the seventh episode of the series would be titled \"A Stick of Time\", and was to be written by consulting producer Matt Lambert, and directed by Takeshi Fukunaga. It was Lambert's second writing credit, and Fukunaga's first directing credit.\nWriting\nCommenting on Toranaga's relationship with Nagakado, Hiroyuki Sanada explained, \"Toranaga sees the possibility in his son, but not enough yet.\" He said that Toranaga's actions are trying to make Nagakado understand build a new world, albeit not one that Toranaga will live to see.:\u200a7:58\u20139:12\u200a\nReception\nViewers\nIn its original FX broadcast, \"A Stick of Time\" was seen by an estimated 0.540 million household viewers and gained a 0.09 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349, according to Nielsen Media Research. This means that 0.09 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a slight increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was seen by an estimated 0.523 million household viewers and gained a 0.10 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349.\nCritical reviews\n\"A Stick of Time\" received critical acclaim. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating for the episode, based on 4 reviews.\nMeredith Hobbs Coons of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \"A\" and wrote, \"Naming this episode after this time-keeping device is an apt choice, as we find our heroes (and villains) in a bit of a waiting period for most of it. That said, it isn't boring; it's loaded and tense. The vibe is atmospheric and hazy, like scented smoke. We also find ourselves grappling with the fact that this is the seventh of ten episodes, which means the time we have with these characters and breathtaking landscapes will soon run out.\" Jesse Raub of Vulture gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"And so we say farewell to a would-be warlord who never got the chance to experience the thrill of battle.

Redshank was also a producer, as were Harvey Kirkby and Rhys Kirkby-Cox from Everyone You Know on \"Different Kinds of People\". \"Rodeo\" and \"When the Party Ends\" were released as singles in March and June 2023, respectively. Both also received music videos. The EP has garnered a generally positive reception.\nBackground and development\nBimini Bon-Boulash is a British drag performer who signed with Relentless Records in 2022, after competing on the second series (2021) of RuPaul's Drag Race UK. Their recording debut was a verse for \"UK Hun?\" (2021), as part of the United Kingdolls, a girl group formed for a main challenge on Drag Race. Prior to When the Party Ends, Bimini had released the singles \"Different Kinds of People\" and \"Tommy's Dream\", performed at the Download Festival and Glastonbury Festival, and attended the Kerrang! Awards.\nComposition\nBimini Bon-Boulash performing in 2021\nThe extended play (EP) When the Party Ends has six tracks. Bimini has said the EP was heavily influenced by the musical preferences of their parents. Hive Magazine said the EP has \"banging alt electro-pop\" tracks with various collaborators. The tracks were co-written by Bimini and produced by Redshank.\nHive described the opening track \"Don't F*ck with My Groove\" as \"a very danceable track with its disco dub-influences and pulsing house beats, all revolving around the single lifestyle \u2013 getting ready for the good times with mates on nights out (and all the chaos that occurs in between).\" The magazine called \"On Pause\" a \"clear heartbreak dance anthem, reflecting on former relationships and the process of breaking up, with its distorted drum n' bass and Bimini spitting strong Cockney bars in the booming background\".\n\"Different Kinds of People\" is the EP's third and shortest track. It was produced by Harvey Kirkby and Rhys Kirkby-Cox from Everyone You Know. Hive said the song offers a \"hyped lively energy to envision yourself on the dancefloor\". The magazine said \"Sex Drugs Disco\" has repetitive rhythms and \"consistent\" chants reminiscent of music by The Prodigy, with lyrics that \"are distinct and unashamedly vulnerable - detailing the vicious confusing cycles of chasing the thrill before the agonising aftermath, the difficulty of trying to quit while you're still ahead\". \"Rodeo\" was written by Bimini, Billie Blonde, and Redshank. Bimini has said, \"Rodeo makes me wanna jump around screaming at the top of my lungs. It's a song that I wrote with Billy and Redshank about 18 months ago and was a real defining moment in my sound both lyrically and musically. When I hear it now it reminds me of how far I've come and how resilient we are as humans. I was in a real dark spell when this song was written but through the shade you can hear some hope and my sassy attitude.\"\nThe EP's final and title track was also co-written by Bimini, Blond, and Redshank. Bimini has said: \"The thudding beat and the deep bass, mixed with my heart spilling out over a house beat, makes this song so special to me...  filled with raw emotion, ex lovers and crying on the dance floor vibes.  is my baby and I\u2019m so glad it's coming out in the world\". Hive said the song has a thudding bass, a memorable chorus, and an abrupt end. Bimini repeats the line \"the shit gets real when the party ends\".\nPromotion and release\n\"Rodeo\" and \"When the Party Ends\" were released as singles in March and June 2023, respectively. Both tracks also received a music video. According to Hive, the video for \"Rodeo\" starts with Bimini approaching a mechanical bull covered in tin foil, wearing a white cowgirl outfit and a large fake fur hat, possibly as a parody of the cover art for Beyonce's 2022 studio album Renaissance. The video ends with Bimini winking and the revelation that filming took place in a \"standard, unglamorous\" British pub. The combination of drag with pub lad-ish culture works surprisingly well for the concept. The magazine's Katherine Monk-Watts opined, \"The combination of drag with pub lad-ish culture works surprisingly well for the concept.\"\nIn July 2023, Bimini announced plans for the EP to be released on 14 July, with three previously unreleased tracks. The EP's cover art depicts Bimini with glittered tears streaming down their cheeks.\nReception\nRolling Stone UK said Bimini has garnered \"a reputation as a musical chameleon with no thought or care for traditional boundaries\", and said the title track \"dials things down and presents a more thoughtful viewpoint\". Eric Brain of Hypebeast described the EP as \"hedonistic and nostalgic at the same time\" with \"lots of contrasts throughout the project\". Brain opined, \"Upbeat drum'n'bass rings out heavily alongside intimate explorations of Bimini's youth and personal politics \u2013 but it's this range of emo",

    "\nThe Abbey of St. Budoc (French: Abbaye de Saint_Budoc), commonly called Beauport Abbey, was a 13th-century Premonstratensian abbey in the region of Brittany known as the Pays de Saint-Brieuc (pays historique) (the Historical Country of St. Brieuc). It was a major institution in the economic life of the region, having sovereignty over both commercial and maritime trade, as well as its supervision of the spiritual life of the inhabitants of that province. Even after its devastation under the ravages of the French Revolution, its surviving structures soon came to recognized a generation later by the acclaimed writer and historian Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e as a major example of the architecture of its era. He began a call for its preservation, which continues to this day.\nFoundation\nOrigins\nDuring the 1170s, Count Henri de Tr\u00e9gor\u00a0, a relative of the Duke of Brittany, established a canonry of Premonstratensian canons regular (commonly called Norbertine canons) on the isolated island of Saint-Riom, just off the coast of northern Brittany. A small hermitage had been established there in the 6th century by Celtic monks from Ireland, in line with the monastic practice there. After Henri's death in 1183, his son, Alain I de Go\u00ebl\u00a0, transferred the abbey to the canons of the noted Abbey of Saint-Victor in Paris. This transfer received the official approval of Pope Innocent III in 1198.\nThese canons, however, came to find the island too confining in terms of both their growth as a community and their style of ministry, based on their established experience in an urban environment. Thus they decided to withdraw their men.  Another factor in their decision might have been the attempts then taking place by the local bishop of the Ancient Diocese of Dol--in which the abbey was located--to have his diocese promoted to an archdiocese, claiming ancient privilege. Church authorities were skeptical of these claims, however, and opposed the promotion.\nFacing the departure of the Victorine canons, the count decided to make use of an abandoned monastery dating from the 8th or 9th century which lay in his domaine on the mainland. It had been left in ruins by Viking raids during the previous century. That location, known as the Abbey of Beauport, was of significance to his family. Its name was a reference to the family's claim of descent from the King of ancient Go\u00eblo\u00a0, the father of St. Budoc, and recalled a monastery of that name, Beau Port (Latin: Bellus Portus), which Budoc was claimed to have founded in Ireland. This helped to bolster the family connection to the famed local spiritual figure.\nAlain approached the Abbey of La Lucerne in Normandy, requesting that 25 Norbertine canons be sent to establish a new community on the site. To this end, he drew up a charter, dated March 13, 1202, establishing the new community and transferring all the property of the abbey on Saint-Riom to the new foundation. At that point only the abbot and three Victorine canons were left on Saint-Riom.\nThe abbot of La Lucerne Abbey himself led the contingent of founders, composed of canons and laybrothers, to their new foundation. It was to be headed as prior by the canon Raoul, from Ardenne Abbey, who had volunteered to join the new community. In addition to the goods of the Saint-Riom Abbey, the count gave the canons ownership of the parish churches on the islands of Saint-Riom and Br\u00e9hat, in addition to the revenues from twenty parishes, including nine located in the English Diocese of Lincoln. Additionally, he authorized an annual market day in the nearby town of Paimpol, the revenues from which were to be dedicated to the support of the canons, due to which it came to be called \"Monks Fair\". Furthermore, two of the count's brothers, Conan and Geslin, as well as several other lords of the region pledged large amounts of lumber for the construction needed to revive the abbey. As he had done for the previous foundation, these donations were confirmed by Pope Innocent in 1202.\nDecline and end\nBy the time of the French Revolution, the abbey was in shambles and deteriorating. Only twelve religious were left, with the complex being run by thirteen servants. The decree of secularization of 1790 ended the community.\n",
    "Norwegian filmmaker (born 1982)\nIzer Aliu (born 1982) is a Norwegian-Macedonian director and screenwriter. He is most well-known for his 2016 debut feature film, Hunting Flies. He wrote and directed TV series Countrymen (Jordbrukerne) and a second feature film, 12 Dares (12 bragder), while a third feature film is under way as of May 2024.\nEarly life and education\nIzer Aliu, who is of Albanian descent, was born in Macedonia in 1982. He moved to Sweden when he was two years old, and grew up mostly in Norway and Sweden, later becoming a Norwegian citizen.\nHe first studied international relations and philosophy, before studying filmmaking at the Norwegian Film School at Lillehammer. There he taught young people in filmmaking workshops, as part of Filmbussen (\"the cinema bus\"), which travelled to schools in the vicinity. He graduated in 2012. He has spoken of the gratitude he feels towards his teachers, \"who made me realize things I cannot imagine living without today\", and his filmmaking education.\nAs of 2023 Aliu was a PhD student at the Film School, researching \"if all editing is a lie\". He intends to explore the process of editing through the life of making a film, from writing, through production, to post-production, and investigate whether there is a way \"to 'cut' without 'cutting'\".\nCareer\nIliu's first short film, made as a student for exam purposes, was To Guard A Mountain (\u00c5 vokte fjellet; 2012), which received the Amanda Award for best short film  at the Norwegian International Film Festival, among others.\nHis next short film was The Good Life, Over There (Det gode livet, der borte), which was nominated for the Amanda.\nHis breakthrough came with his debut feature film, Hunting Flies, a political film which explores \"the birth, the flourishing and the fall of a dictator, within a school setting\". There was only one professional actor in the film.\nIn 2018 Aliu made a short film, Crazy Love (L'Amour Fou), produced by frequent collaborator Khalid Maimouni. In this film, a man pretends to be mad in order to scare his neighbours in his small village, and then moves to the city to do the same thing.\nHe co-wrote the Rubicon TV Franco-Norwegian comedy TV series Countrymen (Jordbrukerne; 2021) with experienced writer-creator Anne Bj\u00f8rnstad (Lilyhammer, Beforeigners). The series, which was filmed in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, centres on four immigrant men who move from Oslo to a little village in Telemark, south-eastern Norway. Khabib, the leader of the group, has big plans that rarely go the way he intended. Bj\u00f8rnstad learnt Muslim prayers and learnt about the religion from an imam during the shooting. After being screened at Canneseries, Countrymen was broadcast on NRK in October 2021.\nIn 2022, his second feature film, 12 Dares (12 bragder), which he wrote and directed, premiered at the 2022 Gothenburg Film Festival on 2 February 2022. After being screened at several other festivals, it was released in Sweden on 15 December 2023 by SVT. The film, a comedy drama, is a Swedish-Norwegian co-production, produced by Lizette Jonjic of Zentropa Sweden, Maria Ekerhovd of Mer Film, and Khalid Maimouni of Storyline. Its title derives from the plotline: a 16-year-old boy in Sweden has to do 12 dares to prove his loyalty to his friends.\nAs of May 2024 Aliu's third feature film, 4 Guys and a Bag, is in post-production.\nHe says that what challenges him most in filmmaking is balancing his \"need to be impulsive and improvise based on the surroundings\" with the lengthy and meticulous planning needed to make a film. About his filmmaking: Regarding my international ambitions: I have great ambitions, mostly because film is a universal language, with regional limitations. I think that as long as you are locally based, but express yourself globally, it makes it easy for everyone to gain insight in what being a human really entails.

    "Spanish footballer and manager\nPedro Pablo Areso Aramburu (29 June 1911 \u2013 1 December 2002) was a Spanish footballer who played as a defender for Real Betis and FC Barcelona in Spain, and for Tigre and River Plate in Argentina. He also played for the Spanish national team on three occasions in 1935.\nAs a manager, he took over teams in Spain, Portugal, Venezuela, and Chile, including RCD Espanyol in 1963\u201364.\nPlaying career\nPedro Areso was born on 29 June 1911 in Ordizia, Gipuzkoa. After playing for a few years in his hometown teams, Villafranca de Oria, and then Barakaldo CF, Areso moved to Tolosa, where he played for Tolosa CF in the 1928\u201329 season. There, he stood out as a great defender and thus caught the attention of the many scouts who were fishing in the Basque youth academy in those years, with Real Murcia acquiring his services in the summer of 1930, along with his partner in the Tolosa defense Gabriel Andonegui.\nAreso was signed by Real Betis in October 1932, making his debut a few days later, on 12 October, in the 1932\u201333 Mancomunado Centro-Sur regional championship against CD Nacional de Madrid at the El Parral field in Madrid. He adapted to the Betis defense very quickly, becoming an undisputed starter and thus playing in all of the remaining official matches of the season. He was fast and forceful and always stood out for his maturity and understanding of the game. The following year, goalkeeper Joaqu\u00edn Urquiaga and defender Seraf\u00edn Aedo joined Betis, thus forming the famous defensive triplet that was the basis of Betis' historic league title in 1934\u201335, conceding a mere 7 goals in the entire tournament. In his 3 seasons at Betis, Areso played a total of 52 League games, 16 in the Copa del Rey, 26 in the Joint Regional Championship, 2 in the Andalusia Cup and 14 friendly matches.\nIn the summer of 1935, Areso was the star signing of FC Barcelona, where he joined coach Patrick O'Connell, but the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 put a premature end to his career at Bar\u00e7a. During his short time there, the central defender became known in Barcelona as l'Stop.\nDuring the civil war, Areso played for several teams in Argentina and Venezuela, such as Tigre (1938), Racing de Avellaneda (1939\u201340), River Plate (1941), C.D. Vasco (1942\u201345) before returning to Spanish football in 1945, where he played a season for both Racing de Santander and Gimn\u00e1stica Burgalesa, finishing his career with his hometown team. In his last years, he combined the position of footballer and coach.\nInternational career\nOn 24 January 1935, Areso made his debut with the Spanish national team in a friendly match against France at the Chamart\u00edn, playing in defense alongside his club teammate Aedo, and together they kept a clean sheet in a 2\u20130 win. Never before and never since have two Betis players debuted together in the national team in the same match. He went on to play a further two matches for Spain, both being friendlies in 1935, against Portugal in Lisbon (3\u20133) and then Germany in Cologne (1\u20132).\nOn 1 January 1936, Areso earned his first and only international cap for the Catalan national team in a match against Andalusia at the Nervi\u00f3n in Seville, featuring in defense alongside Ram\u00f3n Zabalo in a 1\u20135 loss.\nDuring the Civil War, Areso and Aedo were part of the Basque Country national team that was organized by the Basque government of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguirre to play various friendly matches in Europe and later in America. After the end of the tour, he settled in Argentina and returned to Spain in 1945, while Aedo stayed forever in Mexico.\nManagerial career\nAreso began his managerial career at the helm of Racing de Santander in 1946, at the age of 35. He then took charge of Gimn\u00e1stica Burgalesa in the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n, replacing Florentino Florenza. He then moved to neighboring Portugal, to take charge of Atl\u00e9tico de Portugal, a first division team that was in a delicate situation, but Areso managed to put together a homogeneous, magnificent team, which rose to third place, so he received tempting offers from Benfica and Belenenses, but Atl\u00e9tico did not let him leave.\nAfter Portugal, Areso went on to coach teams in Venezuela and Chile. In the later, he guided La Serena to the 1961 Copa Chile. In 1963, he was hired by RCD Espanyol as a technical director, where he formed a tandem with Alejandro Scopelli, but due to poor results he did not even finish the 1963\u201364 season.\nLater life and death\nAreso was a central character in the Basque novel Ez dadila eguzkia sartu (Let not the sun go down).\nAreso died on 1 December 2002, at the age of 91.\nNotes\n^ One source wrongly states that he was born on 15 March 1909.\n",

Members provide advise on every aspect of stamp collecting as well as friendship, knowledge and experience.\nLocation\nThe members of the NHPS are located throughout the USA.\nHistory\nThe NHPS was established on October 15, 1914, at 831 Chapel Street, the brainchild of six collectors\u2014Edwin B. Brown, William F. Bishop, William H. Hitchings, Fred G. Simpson, Robert E. Hall, and F. G. Parker. Edwin B. Brown and F. G. Parker were early stamp dealers.\nThe NHPS is not the oldest stamp club in the United States, but is the oldest that has met continually since its founding. A New Haven chapter of the Brothers of Philately had been active for 10 to 15 years, making the NHPS the second club formed in New Haven. When the Brothers disbanded, some of the members joined NHPS. The New Haven Women's Philatelic Society merged with the Hew Haven Philatelic Society in the 1970s.\nIn 1972 NHPS founded the Southern New England Stamp Exhibition (SONEX) which ran for many years. In the 1990s NHPS became co-host of a monthly stamp show, and became sole host in the in the mid 2005. The fourth Monthly Stamp Show is held at the YMA Annex Club at 554 Woodward Avenue, New Haven, CT.\nAPS Charter member\nThe NHPS has been a charter member of the American Philatelic Society #005-025899, since 1947.\nOrganization\nThe society operates by its set of by-laws. The Executive Board consists of the elected officers (president, vice president, secretary, treasurer) and committee chairs.\nWeekly business meeting\nNHPS Holds a weekly stamp business meeting, auction and program.

    "\nThe sensory drive hypothesis is a hypothesis in population ecology that posits that when local environmental conditions differ between conspecific populations, communication systems will adapt to these conditions. Sensory drive predicts that both communication signals and perceptual systems will adapt to these local environmental conditions. Divergence will then occur based on the intensity and direction of selection on the mating signals and on the sensory systems acquiring information regarding predators, prey, and potential mates.\nThe sensory drive hypothesis has two primary assumptions. The first is that greater sensory stimulation results in preferences for mates with the stimulating trait, meaning exaggerated traits are expected to have greater signal value and generate more mating because they cause a stronger response from the sensory system. In this sense, it is possible for sensory drive to contribute to the formation of runaway traits when sexual selection is working in the same direction as the sensory biases. The second assumption is that biases are relatively fixed and show limited developmental plasticity.\nMating signals, perceptual systems, and behavioral responses are not independent. As a result, as one of these diverges based on selective pressures, the others should also diverge unless under independent selection against divergence. While sensory drive is likely not the primary driver involved in speciation, it is able to set the initial evolutionary trajectory of an aspect involved in these communication signals that can be acted on by evolutionary forces to drive speciation.\nTo find support for the sensory drive hypothesis, there needs to be a match between the biases of the sensory system predicted by environmental constraints and a match between signals and that sensory bias. As of 2018, support has been found for the sensory component with there being a strong bias towards aquatic systems (57% of studies) and visual signals (83% of studies). There is also support for the signal component with more bias towards terrestrial systems (71% of studies) and visual signals (57% of studies). There have also been papers focused on identifying support for both the sensory and signal components; of these papers, only those with support for the sensory drive hypothesis have been published. Similar to the studies focusing on the sensory component, there is a bias towards aquatic systems (62% of studies) and visual signals (86% of studies) with the majority of these being focused on fish taxa (55% of studies).\nVisual signals and vision\nIn a typical vertebrate eye, light passes through the ocular media (cornea, lens, and vitreous humor) before reaching the retina, where it passes through several layers of cells before finally reaching the photoreceptors. Transmission properties in each layer vary according to wavelength. One study found that cone cell sensitivities vary between individual guppies, which influenced Endler's original hypothesis in 1992. Scientists do not yet understand how color preferences are impacted by this variation. Additionally, UV waves may be transmitted through the eye differently in different individuals and/or populations; this has been documented in birds, especially warblers. This may be selectively advantageous for a species if its predator is incapable of seeing UV wavelengths, allowing for conspecific communication without drawing attention from predators. Sensory drive could explain differences in UV preference if properties of the ocular media are not uniform between populations. For example, two closely related species of Anolis lizards differ such that the males of the species that is more sensitive to UV wavelengths reflect UV light on their dewlaps (used for signaling to mates) more than the males of the species that is less sensitive to this light. In general, marine organisms tend to have a greater capacity for visual tuning than terrestrial vertebrates, which could partially explain why most of the studies that find evidence of sensory drive focus on aquatic systems.\nThere is a great diversity of colors in the animal kingdom, which is potentially explained by color perception and how the environment drives its evolution. One aspect of this is color contrast (when an object's color appears to be different when seen in front of varied backgrounds). For instance, an animal will perceive the color of a yellow bird differently when it is viewed in front of a dark brown tree trunk versus a bright blue sky. This connection between environment and detection is an integral part of the sensory drive hypothesis.\nThree mechanisms for the evolution of visual perception have been proposed relating perception, signal, and environmental factors. The first ignores the effects of environmental conditions and proposes that color and perception traits coevolve as a result of social selection, e.g., females\u2019 preferences for certain colors in males.

    "Dutch general and commander serving the Danish East India Company (17th century)\nRoland Crapp\u00e9 or Roelant Crapp\u00e9 (Hindi: Reland Crepi; d 13 March 1644) was a Dutch colonial official serving the Dutch and Danish East India Company. He became director general of the Ceylonese department of the Danish East India Company in 1618 and became commander in chief and governor of Tranquebar upon his seventh arrival in the Indies in 1624. During his leadership, new factories and offices were established and Danish trade went exceptionally well. He died in 1644 only a few years after his homecoming to Denmark.\nEarly life\nAccording to Icelandic J\u00f3n \u00d3lafsson, Roland Crapp\u00e9 was born into a poor Dutch family. He would early on go to sea where he acquired his first literacy. He would also make five voyages to India in Dutch service: first as a ship's boy, then as a merchant.\nEarly career\nIn March 1616 the Danish East India Company was founded and at approximately the same time Crapp\u00e9 came to Denmark. An expedition was meanwhile prepared to set sail for Ceylon to establish a Danish monopoly on the island.\nFirst expedition\nBecause of his previous experiences in India, Crapp\u00e9 was appointed director general of a new Ceylonese department of the Danish East India Company and was to leave for Ceylon with the vessel \u00d8resund a couple of months before the rest of the Danish expedition to prepare for the arrival of admiral Ove Gjedde.\nThe capital Thanjavur, by later Danish governor Peter Anker\nCrapp\u00e9 arrived with \u00d8resund on the shores of Ceylon as the first representatives of the Danish expedition in late January 1619. The king of Kandy, Senarat, demanded that Crapp\u00e9 campaigned against the Portuguese, and hereafter Crapp\u00e9 would sail up the Coromandel Coast to raid Portuguese outposts.However, he would be intercepted off Karaikal and imprisoned by the Portuguese authorities.\nLuckily for Crapp\u00e9, because of his earlier experiences, he had local contacts in the various Indian kingdoms, and he thereby got in contact with a high official of the local kingdom of Thanjavur, who helped rescue Crapp\u00e9 and some other of his crew. Later Crapp\u00e9 and 15 of his men went to the capital of Thanjavur, where Crapp\u00e9 allegedly had friends that could help them. Through his friends, Crapp\u00e9 got an audience with the Nayak of Thanjavur Raghunatha. The Nayak had seen a benefit in bonding with another European power in the hopes of weakening the Portuguese influence in his realm, and he granted the Danes the local fishing village of Tharangambadi, which they quickly renamed Tranquebar (Danish: Trankebar). Crapp\u00e9 recalls the event:\nHere, my men, you can see how wonderfully God has helped us precisely because of our information from my good friends in Thanjavur to ask the Regnato Naicguo that the village of Trangenbari \u2013 where our office is now located \u2013 that the proceeds of this place must now be given to the poor people from \u00d8resund\u2014\u200aRoland Crapp\u00e9\nCrapp\u00e9 would send a man named Jan Peitersen to Ceylon to inform admiral Gjedde about the deal. Gjedde arrived in September 1620 and concluded a treaty with the Nayak, which promised the Handover of Tranquebar to the Danes. Despite being signed by Gjedde, the treaty with the Nayak and the subsequent territorial transfer was heavily the good work of Crapp\u00e9.\nAt Gjedde's arrival at Tranquebar, tensions began to arise between him and Crapp\u00e9.

It went better in the Sunda Islands, where Crapp\u00e9 would establish trading posts at Achin, Jepara, Banten, Sukadana, Banjarmasin, and Makassar. These factories and trading posts would be vital for Danish trade, Makassar would even be described as a center for Danish trade by a later Dutch report.\nIn India, he would establish a factory at the trading hub of Masulipatnam, which was originally an unimportant fishing village, yet in the 17th century, its commercial importance began t",
    "American character actor and opera singer\nGeorge Kunkel in 1908.\nGeorge Kunkel (December 29, 1866 \u2013 November 8, 1937) was an American character actor and operatic baritone. The son of two well known 19th century actors, he should not be confused with his father; the theatre manager, minstrel show performer, and songwriter George Kunkel (1823\u20131885).\nKunkel began his stage career performing alongside his mother, the actress Ada Proctor, in 1887. By 1896 he began appearing with professional light opera companies as a comedian and baritone; touring throughout North America and to Hawaii over the next six years. From 1901-1905 he was active as both an opera singer and an actor in dramatic and comedic plays in Australia and New Zealand. He was a member of the San Francisco Opera Company from 1905-1908, and briefly returned to the company in 1909. He was a member of the Aborn Opera Company in 1908 and 1911. In 1911-1912 he starred in numerous plays at the Orpheum Theatre in Cincinnati.\nKunkel transitioned away from his stage career and became a star of the silent film era from 1913-1921. He briefly returned to stage performances in California in 1927-1928. He died in Los Angeles in 1937.\nEarly life, family, and stage debut\nGeorge's father, George Kunkel, Sr.\nGeorge Kunkel Jr. was born in Baltimore, Maryland on December 29, 1866. He was the son of theatre manager, actor, and singer George Kunkel and his wife Addie Kunkel. His mother was an actress who was known on the stage as Ada Proctor. His sister was the soprano Mamie Kunkel; known on the concert and oratorio stage after her marriage to the composer and choral conductor Edward M. Zimmerman (1859-1922) as both Marie Kunkel Zimmerman and Marie Zimmerman.\nKunkel's mother was born in Montreal, Canada, and her first marriage was to John Proctor, theatre manager of the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. She married George Kunkel after her first husband's death. She had a son from her first marriage, the actor John Proctor, who was George Kunkel Jr.'s half brother. She died at her son John's home in Philadelphia in 1892.\nKunkel's father was a well known blackface minstrel show performer and theatre manager of the 19th century who became famous for his portrayal of Uncle Tom in a stage adaptation of the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin on stages in the United State and England. His father died in 1885. George Kunkel Jr.'s career as an actor began with a revival of this play that was staged by theatrical producer and actor J. Newton Gotthold in 1887 at the Harris Theater in Cincinnati. Like his father, he was known on the stage as George Kunkel. Kunkel portrayed the role of Phineas with the actress Sallie Partington as Topsy and his mother, then billed as Mrs. Kunkel, as Ophelia. He reprised that role at the same theater in 1888.\nCareer\nGeorge Kunkel in 1907.\nEarly career\nBy 1896 Kunkel had joined Charles L. Young's touring Columbian Comic Opera Company for performances in the United States and Canada. His repertoire with the company that year included the roles of Beppo in Fra Diavolo and Hackenback, magistrate of Trautenfeld, in Carl Mill\u00f6cker's The Black Hussar. He continued to portray leading comic roles with the company on tour in 1897 to cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Winnipeg, Denver, Dallas, and Olympia, Washington; starring in performances of Scott Marble and Richard Stahl's Said Pasha and Edmond Audran's La mascotte. He portrayed Rocco in the latter opera the following year with the Merrie Bell Opera Company.\nIn early 1899 Kunkel became the leading male actor in Rose Stillman's company which was then performing in Albuquerque, New Mexico. With that troupe he starred in several comedic plays, among them Charles Reade's Nance Oldfield, and a stage adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's Edith's Burgler. He then became a member of the Boston Lyric Opera Company (BLOC), making his debut with the company in June 1899 in Still Pasha. He portrayed the part of Hadad in that opera on tour with BLOC to the Hawaiian Opera House in Honolulu later that year. When the company staged a production of La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in 1899 it interpolated a new song written by Kunkel, \"The Ice Man\", into the production.\nIn 1900 Kunkel toured with the BLOC for performances in Los Angeles. His repertoire with that company included the title role in J. Cheever Goodwin's Wang which he first performed on tour to the Metropolitan Opera House in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Other roles with the BLOC included Captain De Merimac in Les noces d'Olivette; Lotteringhi, the cooper, in Boccaccio,  M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s in Faust, Gaspard in The Chimes of Normandy, and the title role in Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado.\nAustralia and New Zealand\nIn 1901 Kunkel became the leading male comic opera star of the Josephine Stanton Opera Company; an organization with who he toured Australia, and New Zealand. He had a particular triumph at the Criterion Theatre in Sydney as Goodwin's Wang. In 1902 he was engaged at the T",
    "Tribe of the Kyrgyz people\nThe Bughu, also known as the Bu\u011fu (Kyrgyz: \u0411\u0443\u0433\u0443), is a Kyrgyz tribe\u00a0.

Kylzhyr was the son of Tagai-biy. Orozbak had five sons: Aryk-myrza, Asan-myrza, Kara-myrza, Myrzakul-myrza and Tokoch-myrza, who later became the founders of the divisions of the same name. The most numerous offspring belong to Myrzakul-myrza. From his two sons Alseit and Tynymseit, most of the Buginians descend. Sometimes the descendants of Aryk-myrza are separated into a separate independent tribe - Aryk Tukumu.\nEtimology\nThere is a legend with the name \"Bugu\" according to which Aryk-myrza and Kara-myrza, chasing a young deer (in Kyrgyz \"bugu\"), will rule her to the edge of the cliff. The deer will turn into a girl.

According to the population census in 1897, the total number of Kyrgyz on the territory of the Russian Empire was 634.8 thousand people. Accordingly, in percentage terms, the Buginians accounted for about 12% of the total number of Kyrgyz in the Russian Empire.\n",
    "Austrian politician and editor\nBaier at the 2023 Die Linke party conference in Germany\nWalter Baier (born 1954) is an Austrian politician for the Communist Party of Austria (KP\u00d6). He was his party's federal president from 1994 to 2006. He is the leader of the Party of the European Left since December 2022 and the party's lead candidate for the European Commission in the 2024 election.\nBiography\nBorn in Vienna, Baier was the son of a communist who was interred at Dachau concentration camp, but Baier did not ascribe to communism until into his adult years. Baier was the federal president of the KP\u00d6 from 1994 to 2006.\nIn October 2004, Baier sold the Ernst-Kirchweger-Haus, a Vienna building owned by the party and rented out to communal groups for a symbolic rent of one Austrian schilling a year. The running of the house had cost \u20ac17,000 a year. He faced criticism from some on the Austrian left, including Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Elfriede Jelinek. The criticism intensified when the buyer turned out to be a real estate company whose director shared a name and possibly an address with a man doxed as a neo-Nazi in 1977; the house was named after an Austrian communist murdered by Nazis.\nIn 2009, a lawsuit against Baier by the writer on far-right politics Wolfgang Purtscheller\u00a0 was dismissed in the Vienna Commercial Court. Purtscheller had said in an interview with Der Standard that Austria's three main parties after World War II, including the KP\u00d6, had specialist units for former Nazis. In his history of the party, Baier called Purtscheller's claim a distortion of history, and Purtscheller sued to prohibit the sale of Baier's book. The court dismissed the suit, citing Baier's freedom of speech.\nIn 2011, Baier was one of four atheists invited by Pope Benedict XVI to the Inter-Faith Summit in Assisi, Italy. The others were Guillermo Hurtado\u00a0, Julia Kristeva and Remo Bodei.\nBaier was elected leader of the Party of the European Left in December 2022. In his first speech, he called for Russian withdrawal from Ukraine and an end to the war through negotiations, while also championing anti-racism, feminism and climate action. Baier was elected unopposed as the party's lead candidate in the 2024 European Parliament election, seeking election to the European Commission, but was not put on any electoral list to be elected to the European Parliament.\n",
    "\nDown the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan is a 2001 biography of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan by British writer Howard Sounes. It is notable for making public the knowledge of Dylan's marriage to Carolyn Dennis, and that the two had a daughter. The book was published by Grove Press on May 24, 2001, to coincide with Dylan's 60th birthday.\nReception\nVariety's Sherri Linden wrote of the book:\nSounes's spare, flat prose is at first a disappointment, given the poetic force of its subject. But in a relatively brief number of pages, as Bob tomes go, the author sketches a straight-ahead portrait, his interviews often reaping indelible anecdotes or quotes. The fast-paced book has a fine, never heavy-handed interest in details, interweaving stories of Dylan's domestic life with a chronicle of his prodigious output of 40-plus recordings, including his groundbreaking sessions in Nashville and seminal work with the Band.\nLinden also praised in particular Sounes's coverage of Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour. Neil Spencer, reviewing the book for The Observer, stated: \"Engagingly written and scrupulously researched, it proves a sympathetic but never fawning account which moves evenly through Dylan's career; too evenly, since the comings and goings of years on the road are never going to yield the cultural payback of his mercurial Sixties.\" Perry Meisel of The New York Times commended Sounes's coverage of Dylan's recording sessions and tour rehearsals, but critiqued the book for \"succumbing to\" a \"myth\" view of Dylan's later career, and concluded: \"While Sounes has added a wealth of new information to Dylan studies, he has a tin ear when it comes to orchestrating what he has found.\" Salon's Allen Barra wrote that the book \"has the definite virtue of being the last one you'll ever need to read about Dylan\", though he criticized Sounes for perceivedly writing as \"a fan, not a critic,\" and disagreed with Sounes's presentation of the state of rock and roll music in the early 1960s.\nIn his 2021 book The Double Life of Bob Dylan: Vol. 1, 1941\u20131966: A Restless, Hungry Feeling, fellow Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin refers to Sounes as \"a former tabloid reporter aka professional dirtdigger\", and Down the Highway as a \"depressingly well-trundled, semi-literate stroll\". In response, Sounes called Heylin \"a clunky, self-indulgent writer\", and stated: \"He seems to be very upset that, in 2001, I got a lot of publicity because I revealed that Dylan had a secret second marriage, to a woman called Carolyn Dennis, which made headlines all over the world and helped make the book a bestseller.\"\nSee also\nBob Dylan bibliography\n",

Constantin de Volney, the French politician and orientalist, who visited Jaffa on his journey to the east, reported it had walls twelve to fourteen feet high and three to five feet wide. These walls were breached by Napoleon in 1799. Following the appointment of Muhammad Abu Nabbut as the Turkish governor of Jaffa by Sultan Sulayman Pasha, a western wall was constructed along the sea, encircling the city. Simultaneously, an eastern wall was also erected, featuring a singular gate known as the \"Jerusalem Gate.\" This gate served as the starting point for the main road to Jerusalem. Behind it, the Sidney Smith Fort, ws built in 1800 with the help of British engineers and funding, and named after the British admiral who helped in the battle against Napoleon's invasion. A ditch was dug along to the eastern wall facing the land,  (now near the Clock Square and Yefet Street).\nIn the late 1860s, additional gates were opened in the eastern wall to ease traffic flow. Such alterations would have been unlikely while the walls served as the city's primary defense. However, stable political conditions and advancements in artillery rendered their defensive significance obsolete by that time. Subsequently, the old city wall began to be dismantled. Houses and shops were constructed alongside its path, utilizing the wall stones as building material.\nRemains of the wall\nToday, remnants of the wall can be seen in the eastern part of Yefet Street in the section between the Clock Square and Louis Pasteur Street. There are several covered alleyways, such as Rivka and Shlomo Abulafia Streets,which once served as pedestrian shortcuts through the wall.\nGallery\nA remain of the wall of Jaffa near the Flea Market\nCovered alleyway, once an narrow opening in the wall used by pedestrians.

He began his military service during the reign of Ahmad Shah Qajar.\nBackground\nAli Akbar was born on February 28, 1896, in Tehran. His family was Azerbaijani and Shiite. His father, Ali Naqi Khan Kangerlu (son of Khan Mohammad Khan), was among the first Iranian officers of the Persian Cossack Brigade. He was born in 1863 in the village of Khaneqah Sorkh near Urmia, and he passed away in Tehran in 1903, where he was buried in Imamzadeh Masoom fa. Ali Akbar's grandfather, Reza Qolikhan, migrated from the Nakhchivan region to the south of the Aras River in 1828, following the Turkmancha treaty between the governments of Iran and Russia. Many people and tribal leaders unwilling to accept Russian citizenship did the same. Ali Akbar attended high school at the Cossack Brigade military school in Tehran. At the age of 18, he entered the Gendarmerie officer school and was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. During his service in the gendarmerie, he was assigned to the 6th regiment of Lorestan. After participating in intense fighting to ensure regional order, he was reassigned to Isfahan with the 6th regiment. Later, he joined the National Defense Committee with this regiment in Sultanabad. He participated in the Bid Sorkh (Red Willow) pass battle between the Iranian forces and the Tsarist Russian army and was awarded medals for bravery in battle.\n\nCossack Brigade and Uniformed Troops: Gilan Wars\nIn 1918, he resigned from the Gendarmerie and joined the Cossack army with the rank of second lieutenant. He served in the Cossack Atriyad in Rasht. Displaying great bravery in the wars with Mirza Kuchik Khan, he quickly rose through the ranks, reaching the rank of colonel within five years. At the age of 26 he was appointed as the commander of the Gilan brigade, one of the largest units in Iran's army. During this time, he was directly involved in fierce battles between the Iranian military and the Russian Bolshevik forces, who had invaded Gilan and occupied various areas, including the cities of Rasht, Bandar Anzali, and Astara. Afterward, he became the head of the Mazandaran military. His diary detailing the Gilan wars serves as a valuable source for historians. In these notes, General Derakhshani clearly wrote that while the people of Gilan fully supported Mirza Kuchik Khan against the government forces, they sincerely supported the soldiers of the Iranian government in the war with the Bolsheviks.\nUrmia: Command of the Sepahban Regiment and Forces of Three Provinces\nOn October 21, 1933, Ali Akbar Derakhshani was appointed as the commander of the newly established Sepahban regiment in his father's hometown, Urmia. This regiment had the crucial task of safeguarding the northwestern border areas of the country. Shortly after, he was entrusted with the command of the forces of three provinces - Urumieh, Khoy, and Salmas, which included the Layamout (Deathless) Cavalry Regiment. This marked the beginning of his extensive missions in the western regions of Iran.\n\nThe people of Urmia and its surroundings had endured many hardships due to foreign occupation, prolonged bloody clashes among nomadic groups and sectarian conflicts, which resulted in murder, plunder, and insecurity. The city and its neighboring villages were left in semi-ruinous conditions. Two infantry companies and a machine gun company of the Sepahban regiment were housed in dilapidated buildings without basic amenities like toilets, forcing soldiers to relieve themselves in nearby alleys. Derakhshani worked tirelessly to address various shortcomings. Additionally, since other government offices were not fully established yet, he also focused on improving the living conditions of the people.\nWithin a few months, conditions for the residents began to improve. However, the soldiers' living conditions remained dire, with irregular and delayed delivery of salaries, rations, and clothing. The government lacked the funds to build barracks, leaving only the remnants of Russian barracks which locals had scavenged to repair their own homes. Derakhshani, with the cooperation of local commissions and support from residents, embarked on rebuilding a new barracks on the ruins, with Ayatollah Arab Baghi, the religious authority of West Azerbaijan, encouraged the reconstruction effort. Without central government funding, Derakhshani mobilized residents to construct a thirty-meter avenue followed by additional squares and streets.\nHis other initiatives included establishing a telephone line between Urmia, Salmas, and Khoy, utilizing leftover wires from the Russian army, and recruiting builders and carpenters from Tabriz to expedite city reconstruction efforts.\n\nCampaign in the West\nOn November 5, 1924, Ali Akbar Derakhshani was appointed to lead the advance forces, composed of the Sepahban regiment a",

She initially participated in protests with the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), a right-wing movement in Thailand. However, after listening to other activists about the crackdown on the Red Shirt 2010 protests at Ratchaprasong, Bung became an anti-monarchy activist.\nIn 2020, Bung became a leader of a monarchy reform group\u2014Thaluwang\u00a0 (meaning \"break through the palace\"). As a result, she was charged with multiple criminal charges, including l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 charges. While detained on these charges, Bung and other detainees protested the Thai justice system by going on a hunger strike, which severely damaged her health. They had two demands: reform of the justice system, and to stop imprisoning political dissenters. She began a hunger strike in June 2022, which continued for 64 days. She began another hunger strike on 27 January 2024, a day after she was detained. On 14 May 2024, Bung died at Thammasat University Hospital from sudden cardiac arrest, after being transferred from the Central Women's Correctional Institution of the Department of Corrections. The total duration of Bung's temporary detention, from the start of her hunger strike protest to the day of her death, was 109 days.\nHowever, the cause of her death remains a mystery, whether she really died from sudden cardiac arrest or due to a lack of timely medical treatment, since Thammasat University Hospital told her lawyer that the hospital found that the medical treatment from the Department of Corrections was done incorrectly. The lawyer told the press that:\n... The endotracheal tube, which is normally inserted into the trachea, was mistakenly placed in the esophagus. This caused the measurement of her breathing to show zero respiration when she arrived at Thammasat University Hospital. It is unclear why no report was made, and why the treatment was concealed... The question arises whether the Department of Corrections had inserted the breathing tube into her esophagus while she was still on the bed, and if this mistake was the cause of Bung's death.\nEarly life and education\nNetiporn Sanesangkhom was born on 8 August 1995. She grew up in a law-focused family; her father was a judge, and her sister is a lawyer. She attended Triam Udom Suksa Nomklao School, where she was a student council member. She then pursued a degree in finance at the Faculty of Business Administration at Kasetsart University. In addition, she worked as a tutor, teaching English to elementary, middle, and high school students.\nSocial activism\nBung became interested in activism beginning in high school, when she served as a student council member. As a member of the student council, she encouraged her peers to maintain proper hairstyles and adhere to uniform regulations. However, some of her friends protested against these rules, which led her to question the fairness of such regulations.\nIn 2014, Bung joined the People's Democratic Reform Committee protests while still in high school. However, upon entering university to study finance at the Faculty of Business Administration, Kasetsart University, Bung was exposed to a broader range of information through social media platforms like Twitter. The extensive and diverse social debates she encountered there eventually shifted her political stance.\nOne event that significantly influenced Bung's political change was the \"Big Cleaning Day.\" During the event, some Bangkok residents cleaned the protest sites of the Red Shirts movement after the May 2010 crackdown, which had resulted in nearly 100 deaths and thousands of injuries. This event was seen as an attempt to erase evidence that could shed light on the truth of the crackdown and provide justice to the victims and their families.\nBung primarily focused on monarchy reform, including abolishing Section 112, the section of Thai criminal code which prohibits criticism of the monarchy.\nCharges and imprisonment\nOn 30 May 2022, the specialized prosecutor from the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Criminal Cases, Southern Bangkok 4, filed charges against eight activists and independent media members, including Bung, in the Southern Bangkok Criminal Court. The charges included \"jointly defaming the King, jointly inciting unrest, jointly obstructing officials in the performance of their duties by committing offenses with three or more people, jointly insulting officials performing their duties, and jointly disobeying official orders\" under Sections 112, 116, 136, 138, 140, and 368 of the Criminal Code. The key points of the indictment stated that:\nThaluwang activists conducting a survey with the question, \"Would you be willing to give your house to the royal family?\" at the Victory Monument on 13 March 2022\nThe eight defendants...jointly defamed, insulted, and showed malice towar",
    "Diplomatic mission of Sweden in Jerusalem\nDiplomatic mission\nThe Consulate General of Sweden, Jerusalem is the diplomatic mission of Sweden in Jerusalem. The history of the Swedish consulate in Jerusalem dates back to 1901 when Herman Zethelius proposed its establishment due to the increasing Scandinavian presence in the city. Initially serving as an honorary consulate, it later became a vital hub for Swedish nationals and others seeking assistance in the region. Over the years, the consulate's responsibilities expanded to include monitoring the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process and facilitating development cooperation initiatives. In 1991, the honorary consulate was upgraded to a career consulate general, reflecting the growing importance of Sweden's presence in the region. The consulate's buildings have changed locations several times, with the current chancery situated in Sheikh Jarrah, East Jerusalem, and the residence in the Greek Colony area, West Jerusalem. The Swedish consulate's role remains pivotal, providing consular services, promoting dialogue, and contributing to peace-building efforts in the region.\nHistory\nIn a submission to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on 4 March 1901, Herman Zethelius, the Swedish consul in Smyrna, proposed the establishment of a Swedish\u2013Norwegian honorary consulate in Jerusalem. The proposal was based on the increase of Scandinavian residents in Jerusalem, who were primarily American and English colonists. At that time, the Scandinavians numbered around 110 people, including those who had become American citizens but still felt a strong connection to their countries of origin. Most Scandinavians were poor but skilled artisans and farmers, engaged in fruit preservation and weaving, which had potential for trade in Palestine. Despite their good qualities, they were subjected to persecution and harassment, particularly from certain missionaries due to religious differences. Because of these difficulties and the lack of official representation, the Scandinavians had suffered great injustices. The Swedish mission in Constantinople and other authorities recommended the establishment of a consulate, which was decided by King in Council on 17 August 1901. The consulate was established with a district comprising Palestine and the city of Damascus, which area was restricted to only the Jerusalem Sanjak at the time of the announcement of the exequatur. The first honorary consul was the Jewish Dr. Isaac Gregory d'Arb\u00e9la. He obtained his position primarily due to the recommendations given by the consul Zethelius, for the so-called Larsonites from N\u00e5s who were in Jerusalem. On 30 May 1902, he was granted resignation from the consular service.\nOn 10 July 1903, the German theologian and orientalist Gustaf Dalman was appointed as the new honorary consul. The consulate, which was the youngest among Jerusalem's twelve consulates, began its operations on 9 February 1904, and was located in the house of the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology, where its director, Gustaf Dalman, had his residence. At this time, there was a Swedish colony in Jerusalem consisting of 37 people, almost all of whom belonged to the Christian-communist Overcomers' Society (Overcomersamfundet). The consulate's primary task was to \"protect and safeguard these Swedes, to teach them not to forget their mother tongue in their English-speaking surroundings, and to strengthen their national sentiments.\" In addition to the Swedish colony in Jerusalem, which also included a Jewish family, the consulate's concern extended to the young work of the Swedish Jerusalem Association (Svenska Jerusalemsf\u00f6reningen) in Palestine. This consisted of a small school for Arab children in Jerusalem, which was annexed to the German deaconesses' orphanage Talitha Kumi, as well as Dr. Ribbing's medical work in Bethlehem, where the doctor's family, along with two female assistants, formed a small Swedish colony of six people. The consulate was also used by Danish workers who sought out Jerusalem and, in the absence of a Danish consulate, sought help from the Swedish consul.\nDalman resigned in 1921, and the Swiss Jonas Kuebler was appointed acting honorary consul, followed by the first Swede, Hol Lars \"Lewis\" Larsson, who became the regular honorary consul in 1925. He was one of about 35 residents from N\u00e5s, Dalarna, who emigrated to Jerusalem in 1896, which inspired Selma Lagerl\u00f6f's novel Jerusalem (1901\u20131902).\nOn 27 September 1947, a bomb exploded at the gate of the Swedish consulate in Jerusalem. The explosion caused some minor damage to the building, but no one was injured. The police suspected that the bomb was placed by a Jew or an Arab who was angry about the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine that the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine had developed under the chairmanship of the Swede Emil Sandstr\u00f6m. The bomb attack occurred during Consul Larsson's visit to Sweden when his son Edmund Larsson served as acting h",

    "Football clubTSV Sasel is a sports club from the Hamburg district of Sasel in the Wandsbek district . In addition to association football, the club offers badminton, ballet, basketball, handball, judo, karate, tennis, table tennis, gymnastics and volleyball, with the handball division forming SG Hamburg-Nord together with SC Poppenb\u00fcttel and TSV Duwo 08.\nHistory\nThe club goes back to SV Sasel , which was founded in the spring of 1925 and was joined in 1933 by members of the workers' association FTSV Sasel, which was banned by the National Socialists . In December 1935 the club adopted its current name.\nFootball\nIn 1963, TSV was promoted to what was then the fourth-class Hammonia association league and made it straight into the regional league . Relegation followed in 1966 after the Sasel team lost out in a playoff against the Harburg clubs Borussia and Rasensport . Three years later they were relegated to the district league. It was not until 1994 that TSV returned to higher leagues and in 2001 managed to return to Hamburg's top division, now known as the Verbandsliga .\nWith a third place in the 2002/03 season, Sasel achieved promotion to the Oberliga Nord, Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein season, after the Sasel team, together with Wedeler TSV and TSV Kropp, were able to prevail against VfB L\u00fcbeck in the promotion games . In this league season, TSV reached 12th place in the table out of 18 teams, but had to immediately be relegated back to the Hamburg Association League due to the merger of the two seasons into a single-track Oberliga Nord . Back in the association league, TSV celebrated the championship in the 2004/05 season . However, due to the complex licensing process, the club decided against promotion.\nThe successful team then fell apart and was relegated to the regional league a year later. There the team came third in the Hansa relay in the 2010/11 season and prevailed on penalties against FC Elmshorn in the playoff for promotion to the Hamburg Oberliga . However, TSV Sasel finished the 2011/12 season at the bottom of the table with only ten points and 100 goals conceded. Only one game of the season could be won. After two seventh places and one sixth place in the regional league, the club was in first place in the regional league Hammonia at the winter break of 2015/16, but missed the return to the Oberliga Hamburg at the end of the season as third in the table. In the 2016/17 season, Sasel became champions of the regional league and was promoted back to the top league. After TSV Sasel was able to finish the season in the top half of the table there for three years in a row, they achieved the greatest cup success in the club's history in the 2019/20 season when the team reached the final of the Hamburg Cup . However, this was lost 5\u20131 against the regional league team Eintracht Norderstedt . Sasel ended the 2022/23 season as Hamburg champions. \u00a0The team also reached the final of the Hamburg Cup again, which they lost 0\u20131 against FC Teutonia 05 Ottensen . At the end of the season, Daniel Zankl ended his coaching career at Sasel after nine years. It had already been announced in March that Marco Stier would be his successor. \u00a0At the end of February 2024, he resigned from office with immediate effect for health reasons.\nAchievements\nChampions of the Verbandsliga/ Oberliga Hamburg\u00a0: 2005, 2023\nVenues\nWhile the first men's team generally plays its home games on the Parkweg sports field, the football games of the other teams, especially those of the youth teams, also take place on the Alsterredder school sports field of the Oberalster high school .\nThe sports field on Saseler Parkweg was a grand square for a long time . Since such a surface is not permitted for games in the Oberliga Nord, the first men's team had to use the Alsterredder school sports field , which is a grass field, for their home games in the 2003/04 Oberliga season .\nIn 2013 the Grandplatz was replaced by an artificial turf pitch. \u00a0In addition, privacy walls were built on the north and east sides of the square. \u00a0As part of this renovation, the sports field on Parkweg was renamed the Alfred Mager Stadium in the summer of that year . \u00a0This honors Alfred Mager, who was chairman of the TSV for 45 years.\nTable tennis\nThe club's table tennis department consists of eight men's, four boys' and three student teams in the 2023/24 season. The first men's team plays in the Oberliga Nord-Ost. In the youth sector, Sasel plays in the performance class, the highest league in Hamburg, for both boys (U19) and school students (over 15). \u00a0The club's top player is the former German international Oliver Alke .\nHandball\nIn the mid-1980s, the HSG Sasel/DUWO syndicate was founded with TSV Duwo 08, \u00a0which achieved promotion to the Regionalliga Nord several times, but was unable to establish itself there. When the syndicate was expanded to include the SC Poppenb\u00fcttel handball department in May 2005, it renamed itself SG Hamburg-Nord . \u00a0With around 1,000 members of the",

    "Pseudonym\nEarliest recorded use of \"Pseudo-Ovidius\" (1744)\nPseudo-Ovid or Pseudo-Ovidius is the name conventionally used to designate any author of a work falsely attributed to the Latin poet Ovid (43 BC \u2013 AD 17/18). The term first appears in the second edition of the Lexicon Latinae Linguae Antibarbarum Quadripartitum of Johann Friedrich Nolte\u00a0 in 1744. The collective term for such texts is Pseudo-Ovidiana, which may be defined simply as \"works not authored by Ovid that circulated under his name\".\nClassification\nThere are several types of pseudo-Ovidian text. Some texts were intentionally written in Ovid's name in order to deceive (forgery). In other instances, anonymous texts attracted an Ovidian attribution. Many of these strongly imitate Ovid, but the motivations and expectations of their actual authors are largely unknown. Another class of pseudo-Ovidian text are interpolations in other authentic works of Ovid.\nSome works were only \"intermittently Ovidian\", that is, they were only occasionally ascribed to Ovid, like the Conflictus veris et hiemis, which was also attributed to Vergil, and the Birria, which was in fact by Vitalis of Blois\u00a0. According to Ralph Hexter, Wilken Engelbrecht\u00a0 suggests that \"when teachers and students relied for their study of the auctores increasingly on florilegia and excerpts, imitations of Ovid crafted only two centuries earlier could more readily be mistaken as ancient productions\". Hexter has suggested the term \"para-Ovidian\" as an alternative, since the prefix \"pseudo-\" is often taken to imply deception.\nMere imitation of Ovid, popular throughout antiquity and the Middle Ages, does not constitute Pseudo-Ovidiana. Neither does the use of Ovid's name or persona in an overt work of fiction constitute Pseudo-Ovidiana. Baudri of Bourgueil wrote an exchange of letters between Florus and Ovid in the style of the Heroides, but they were always understood as works of fiction and correctly ascribed to Baudri.\nQuestionable works\nThe authenticity of several of the 21 letters found in Ovid's Heroides has been questioned. The same is true of the couplets that introduce each letter. Any inauthentic material would, by definition, be pseudo-Ovidian, although \"the Heroides themselves pose a challenge to any stable concept of authenticity, since Ovid the author prides himself on masquerading in turn as Penelope, Phyllis, Briseis, Dido, Oenone et al.\" In the fifteenth century, Juan Rodr\u00edguez del Padr\u00f3n passed off three letters of his own\u2014Carta de Madreselua a Manseol, Troylos a Brecayda and Brecayda a Troylo\u2014as Ovid's in his Bursario, otherwise a Castilian translation of Heroides.\nSeveral excerpts of Ovid's Amores circulated independently during the Middle Ages. One of these, Amores 3.5, which appeared under the titles De somno and De rustico, has often had its authenticity doubted.\nTwo poems datable to the first century have been ascribed to Ovid, but are suspect. Halieutica was accepted as Ovid's by Pliny the Elder, but has been doubted on grounds of style. Nux, on the other hand, is one of the best Ovidian imitations if it isn't authentic. It was treated as Ovid's by Conrad of Hirsau, who included it in his accessus ad auctores, and Desiderius Erasmus, who published a commentary on it.\nList of pseudo-Ovidian works\nConsolatio ad Liviam de morte Drusi (1st century), only attributed to Ovid from the 16th century\nDe cuculo, also attributed to Alcuin of York, attributed to Ovid beginning in the 12th century\nDe Lombardo et lumaca, a political satire written against Frederick Barbarossa following the battle of Legnano (1176)\nDe luco, also called De nemore or Conflictus Voluptatis et Diogienis\nDe lupo, also called De monacho\nDe medicamine surdi, also known as De medicamine aurium, De speculo medicaminis, De speculo medicinae or De herbarum virtutibus, inspired perhaps by Pliny's reference to Ovid's verse recipe for a cure for angina\nDe mirabilibus mundi, a medieval bestiary\nDe nuce\nDe pediculo (before 1250), a poem about a louse modeled on De pulice\nDe philomela (10th century)\nDe puellis\nDe pulice (12th/13th century), \"a versified dirty joke\" about the flea (pulex) based on the poem about the gnat (culex) found in the Appendix Vergiliana\nDe quattuor humoribus\nDe sompnio, an apocalyptic allegory presented as a dream\nDe vetula, the longest of the Pseudo-Ovidiana\nDe ventre, also called Altercatio ventris et artuum, De quattuor elementis or De quattuor complexionisbu hominum, a debate between the parts of the body\nDe vino, also called De Baccho, actually by Eugene of Toledo\nDoctrina mense (13th/14th century)\nEligia de ludo scacchorum, a poem on chess\nElegiae in Maecenatem (1st century), only attributed to Ovid from the 16th century\nOvidius puellarum, also called De nuntio sagaci, an imitation of Ovid cited as his work in the Tegernsee love letters\nExcerpts of the 12th-century poem Facetus: Moribus et vita circulated under Ovid's name as supposed pieces of the authentic Ars amatoria and Remedia amori",
    "Prison camp during the Bosnian War\nKamenica camp or Gostovi\u0107i camp was a prison camp operated by the El Mud\u017eahid, a force of Muslim volunteers operating as part of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ABiH) during the Bosnian War.\nThe camp\nThe camp was located in the Gostovi\u0107i valley, 10 kilometres south of the town of Zavidovici in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was solely manned by elements of the El Mud\u017eahid who although were an independent volunteer force, were under the command of the ABiH. The camp was in operation throughout mid-1995 and housed Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) POWs and Serb civilians captured during the four-month Battle of Vozu\u0107a.\nAtrocities\nThe Battle of Vozu\u0107a commenced on 27 May 1995. By 21 July, over a dozen VRS soldiers were captured on Mount Ozren and brought to Kamenica camp by the El Mud\u017eahid. The POWs, some injured, were subjected to acts of torture and were provided inadequate food and water. One of the POWs was reportedly beheaded by the El Mud\u017eahid, with a surviving captive forced to kiss the severed head of their fellow soldier. The severed head was hanged on a wall in a room housing the prisoners.\nOn 10 September 1995, ten VRS soldiers surrendered to soldiers of the ABiH. After being taken to ABiH headquarters, they were transported to Kamenica camp and arrived on 17 September 1995. After arriving at the camp, the captives were beaten. During this time period, an elderly Serb civilian was brought to the camp and joined the POWs. The Serb civilian was beaten and stripped of his clothes. He subsequently died. On 29 September 1995, the ten POWs were transferred to Zenica.\nOn 11 September 1995, approximately 60 VRS soldiers and an unknown number of Serb civilians were captured in the village of Vozu\u0107a by the ARBiH. The captured Serbs were ordered to march to the village of Kesten where en route, two VRS POWs were killed. After arriving at Kesten, members of the El Mud\u017eahid seized the Serb captives from their ARBiH guards at gunpoint. The captured Serbs were transported to Kamenica camp where the POWs and civilians (including three women) were held separately. The three female civilians were subjected to beatings and sexual assault, including rape. The POWs were subjected to acts of torture including the severing of body parts, roasting, fracturing of limbs and gouging of the eyes. All POWs captured in Vozu\u0107a were executed, with many subjected to beheading and post-death mutilation of the body. The three female captives were later released.\nTrials\nIn 2005, Rasim Deli\u0107, former chief of staff of the ABiH who in 1993 signed an order authorising the formation of the El Mud\u017eahid, was indicted for war crimes that included crimes committed at the Kamenica camp. Deli\u0107 was found guilty and sentenced to three years imprisonment for failing to prevent or punish the cruel treatment of captives at Kamenica camp. In 2015, Sakib Mahmuljin, former commander of the 3rd Corps of the Bosnian Army was indicted for war crimes that also included crimes committed at the Kamenica camp. In 2021, Mahmuljin was found guilty and sentence to eight years imprisonment. However, Mahmuljin fled to Turkey and subsequent requests for extradition have remained unanswered.\n",
    "Galaxy in the constellation Leo\nNGC 3800 is an intermediate spiral galaxy located in the constellation Leo. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 3,653 \u00b1 24\u00a0km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 53.9 \u00b1 3.8 Mpc (\u223c176 million ly). NGC 3800 was discovered by German-British astronomer William Herschel in 1784.\nNGC 3799 and NGC 3800 are two gravitationally interacting galaxies and appear in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the symbol Arp 83. Halton Arp describes these as an example of galaxies by presenting a bridge of matter between them and having a high surface gloss.\nThe luminosity class of NGC 3800 is II and it has a broad HI line.\nTo date, four non-redshift measurements give a distance of 42.125 \u00b1 1.162 Mpc (\u223c137 million ly), which is well outside the Hubble distance values. Note, however, that it is with the average value of independent measurements, when they exist, that the NASA/IPAC database calculates the diameter of a galaxy and that consequently the diameter of NGC 3800 could be approximately 32.8 kpc (\u223c107,000 ly) if we used the Hubble distance to calculate it.\nNGC 3800 group\nThe galaxy NGC 3800 is part of a group of galaxies named after him. The NGC 3800 group has at least 16 members. Other New General Catalog galaxies in this group are NGC 3768, NGC 3790, NGC 3799, NGC 3801, NGC 3802, NGC 3806, NGC 3827 and NGC 3853. Other galaxies in the group are UGC 6631, UGC 6653, UGC 6666, UGC 6794, MCG 3-30-33 and MCG 3-30-38.\nAbraham Mahtessian also mentions the existence of this group, but only the galaxies NGC 3768, NGC 3790, NGC 3801 and NGC 3827 appear there. The galaxy NGC 3853 appears in Mahtessian's article, but under another entry where it forms a galaxy pair with UGC 6666, designated as 1139+1618 (CGCG 1139.7+1648). Similarly, the galaxies NGC 3799 and NGC 3800 are also listed under another entry in this article as a pair of galaxies.\nThe NASA/IPAC database indicates that NGC 3800 is possibly a field galaxy, that is, it does not belong to a cluster or group and is therefore gravitationally isolated. Scientists have concluded that this is most likely not the case.\nSee also\nList of NGC objects (3001\u20134000)\nAtlas of Peculiar Galaxies\nExternal links\nNGC 3800 at SIMBAD\n",

The height of the tower reaches 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft), making it the tallest building in Ingushetia and the tallest observation tower in the North Caucasus.\nHistory\nSee also: Ingush towers\nMedieval Ingush towers at Erzi\nThe construction of towers in the North Caucasus originated in ancient times, which is associated with the remains of megalithic cyclopean dwellings (ca. II-I millennium BC), found on the territory of the ancient Ingush villages of Targim, Khamkhi, Egikal, Doshkhakle, Kart, and others. In the Middle Ages, a period of revival of the tower culture of the North Caucasus began, the phenomenon of which, according to researchers, mostly manifested in the mountains of Ingushetia, which was labeled by many as \u201cthe country of towers\", to the extent that in 2022 the region's tourism committee announced that the Federal Service for Intellectual Property (Russia) patented the slogan \"Ingushetia \u2014 Land of Towers\".\nTraditionally, each Ingush clan (teip) built one or several tower settlements. A tower was a reliable home, protection and personification of the unity of the entire family. The Tower of Concord was conceived as a unifying symbol for the entire Ingush people.\nConstruction\nConstruction in May 2013\nThe project was implemented at the expense of the personal funds of the businessman and philanthropist Alikhan Kharsiev\u00a0. Construction began in 2012. At the same time, the norms of the ancient Ingush custom of building the tower were taken into account, according to which its construction must be completed within 365 days. Thus, the construction of the building from the foundation to the pyramidal roof (Ingush: malkha tkhov) was completed in 2013.\nDesign and development\nLocal artists were invited to create paintings to decorate the walls inside the tower, in combination with specially selected lighting to give the building its own character and individuality. The paintings recreate the images of famous heroes of Ingush mythology: Koloy-Kant, Seska-Solsa and others, while other images depict the Amazons, Sarmatians and Sumerians. Other paintings depict the recent past of Ingushetia (Battle of the Caucasus, Deportation, etc.). In the ethnographic museum on the ground floor, the life of a traditional home is recreated. Meeting room on the ground floor\nThe floor plan of the tower make it possible to hold various cultural events, scientific conferences, in particular, readings, meetings of the Council of Teips (Me\u1e23k-K\u1e23el), youth forums, etc. A national-style cafe and an ethnographic museum are located on separate floors. The multifunctional monument plays an important role in the consolidation of the Ingush society, since it belongs not to one clan, as was the case many centuries ago, but to all residents of Ingushetia. At an altitude of 85 meters the towers has an observation deck made of super-resistant glass, from which a panorama of the city of Magas and the surrounding area opens up. To get to the observation deck, one is required to walk more than a kilometer along a spiral ramp since there is no elevator.\nAn underground restaurant, a small shopping center and a parking lot on the square by the tower are set to be build. According to architect Sergei Tkachenko, the possibility of constructing another high-rise building of a different style with functional premises (toilets, elevator) close to the tower with a high-rise passage between the two buildings is being considered.\nGallery\nRussian post stamp with the image of the Tower of Concord\nView of the Tower of Concord through the arch of the Alanian Gates at the entrance of Magas\nView of Magas, Ali Yurt and Ekazhevo\nNighttime illumination of the Tower of Concord\nSee also\nIngush towers\nNine Towers\n",

    "Emirate of Th\u00e2alibi that ruled Algiers\nThe Emirate of Algiers was an emirate founded by the Th\u00e2aliba after the weakening of the central authority of the Banu Ziyan state, and the negative impact on the situation in Algeria, which was divided into small, disjointed emirates, such as the Emirate of Jebel Kuku in the Kabylia region, the Emirate of the Zouaoua in Hodna and Zab, the Emirate of the Beni Jelab in Touggourt and Wadi Righ, and the Emirate of the Beni Mezzoug in Noufique on the western border, and the kingdom ended by turning into the Ottoman state.\nTh\u00e2alibas\nThe Th\u00e2alibi (also referred to as Th\u00e2alibas) dynasty ruled the Emirate of Algiers from the mid-14th century to the early 16th century. Though not as prominent as some of the later Algerian rulers, the Th\u00e2alibi period laid the groundwork for Algiers' rise as a major power in the region.\nRise of the Emirate\nInformation about the Emirate's origins is somewhat unclear. It emerged following the decline of the Zayyanid dynasty in the 13th century, with Algiers likely gaining independence sometime in the mid-14th century. The Th\u00e2alibi family came to power during this period, establishing a hereditary emirate.\nCapture of Algiers (May\u2013September 1516)\nIn 1510, the Spanish gained a foothold near Algiers by controlling a small island and forcing the ruler, Salim at Toumi, to submit. Salim even had to travel to Spain and pledge allegiance to their king.\nFast forward to 1516. S\u0101lim, desperate to get rid of the Spanish, invited the Ottoman corsair brothers, Oru\u00e7 and Hayreddin Barbarossa, for help. Oru\u00e7 arrived with a combined force and local support, but failed to capture the Spanish-held island.\nThings took a turn when Oru\u00e7 suspected S\u0101lim of working with the Spanish. He ordered S\u0101lim's execution.\nThis power struggle wasn't over though. S\u0101lim's son escaped to Spain and found an ally in King Charles V. This alliance set the stage for future clashes between the Ottomans and the Spanish in the region.\nSpanish expedition to Algiers\nIn 1510, Spain established a foothold near Algiers by controlling a small island and forcing the city's ruler, S\u0101lim al-T\u016bm\u012b, to submit. Seeking to expel the Spanish, al-T\u016bm\u012b invited the Ottoman corsair brothers, Oru\u00e7 and Hayreddin Barbarossa, for help in 1516.\nForces\nOttomans: Led by Oru\u00e7 Barbarossa, with only 1,500 men. His force included:\nTurkish companions\nAndalusian immigrants skilled in firearms (\"Fauquefels\")\nCity inhabitants (initially believed to support the Spanish)\nSpanish and Moors: A combined force of 25,000, including:\n10,000-15,000 Spanish soldiers\n10,000 Moors from T\u00e9n\u00e8s\nOuru\u00e7's Plan\nAllow the enemy to land with minimal resistance.\nUtilize city fortifications and ambush tactics to wear down the Spanish.\nLaunch a full-scale attack when the Spanish were exhausted.\nSpanish Plan\nLand and establish a camp on the coast.\nCapture the high ground overlooking Algiers.\nCoordinate with T\u00e9n\u00e8s's army for a combined assault.\nThe Battle\nSpanish troops made a tactical error by climbing the heights in scattered formations, ignoring warnings.\nOru\u00e7's forces harassed them from higher ground during the ascent.\nThe promised army from T\u00e9n\u00e8s never arrived, demoralizing the Spanish.\nOru\u00e7 launched a coordinated attack from the city and surrounding areas.\nThe Spanish retreated in chaos, suffering heavy losses during a subsequent storm.\nOutcome\nOru\u00e7's strategic use of terrain and his well-trained force, despite being outnumbered, secured a decisive victory against the Spanish and Moorish army. This battle marked the rise of Ottoman influence in North Africa.\nAssassination of Salim at Toumi\nSalim at-Toumi (Arabic: \u0633\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0645\u064a\u200e\u200e) was a ruler of the Emirate of Algiers in the early 16th century. He was the leader of the Tha\u00e2liba tribe. The city's merchants gave him power.\nAccording to some accounts, he was married to Zaphira, a princess.  Spain threatened Algiers, and Salim at-Toumi agreed to pay them tribute. The people of Algiers wanted help from the pirate brothers, the Barbarossas. Salim at-Toumi lost power and the Barbarossas took over. Arudj Barbarossa killed Salim at-Toumi.City of Algiers in the 16th century, by Georg Braun\nSuicide of Princess Zaphira\nIn order to exonerate himself in Zaphira's eyes, Aruj paid false witnesses to name fake assassins of Selim, who confessed under torture before being strangled. The regent sent a letter to Zaphira, recounting how he had the true murderers of her husband assassinated. But Zaphira responded that she would rather commit suicide in the face of his tyranny if he did not allow her to leave Algiers.\nAruj visited Zaphira, who stood up to him. Irritated, Aruj gave her one more day before marrying her. The next day, Aruj returned determined to marry her. When she refused him again, he attempted to rape her. Having hidden a dagger under her robe, Zaphira tried to kill him but only managed to wound his arm. Aruj called someone to disarm her, but Zaphira poisoned herself with a vial she had also concealed in her",

From 1924 to 1925, he studied again at the State Industrial Art School, and from 1925 to 1931 as a student of Nikolai Triik at the Pallas Art School. For his successful studies, he was awarded a scholarship from the Government Fine Arts Endowment\u00a0 to study in Paris (1931\u20131932). In the following years, short study trips took him to Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Finland, Sweden and Russia.\nCareer\nIn the second half of the 1930s, Leps lived in P\u00e4rnu, where he opened his studio, gave lectures at the folk high school, and organized excursions to art exhibitions in Tallinn. From 1944 to 1949, he lived as a war refugee in Ulm, Germany. In 1949, he emigrated with his wife to the United States, where he first worked as an art teacher and portrait painter, later as an advertising artist in Hartford, Connecticut, and then in Chicago until his death.\nWork\nStarting in 1928, Leps appeared at all exhibitions in Estonia organized by the Visual Arts Endowment Fund\u00a0 of the Cultural Endowment of Estonia and the Pallas art association. His paintings were also presented at foreign Estonian art exhibitions in Riga, Moscow, Germany, and elsewhere. Leps became known as a portraitist, and as a landscape and genre painter. The works of this prolific artist were found in many private collections, several art museums, and in the pre-war collection of the P\u00e4rnu Museum.\nDuring his years of exile in Germany, Leps continued his intensive artistic activities, appearing at almost all exhibitions of Estonian art held in Germany. He organized and managed the first applied arts and crafts association of Estonian refugees in Ulm, Estonian Handicraft.\nAfter emigrating to the United States, Leps mainly painted portraits of local doctors, politicians, and business figures for the first two years. In 1952, he started working as a painter for the General Outdoor Advertising Company. Due to his outstanding technical knowledge and skills, he was promoted to work at the Chicago headquarters of the same company, where he remained until 1965, when a serious illness forced him to quit his job.\nFamily\nLeps's wife was the graphic artist Pauline Elfriede Leps-Estam (1903\u20132002), whom he married on July 11, 1930. Their son was the educational researcher Ants Arvo Leps (1936\u20132008).\nLegacy\nErich Leps' wish was that his art collection would be sent to the P\u00e4rnu Museum in his homeland after his death. With the help of Minia Virve Leps and family friend Mai Treude, and with the support of the National Archives of Estonia, it turned out to be possible to fulfill the artist's wish. More than 120 works by Erich Leps, in addition to works by his wife, as well as works by and archive materials of Ida Emilie Adamson, Edmund S. Valtman, Salme Rosalie Riig, and even Eduard Wiiralt, were sent to Estonia.\n",
    "Armed skirmish between Bangladesh and Myanmar\nThe 2014 Bangladesh-Myanmar border skirmish was an armed skirmish between Bangladesh and Myanmar in May 2014.\nThe skirmish took place between troops of the Border Guard Bangladesh and the Burmese Border Guard Police in Naikhongchhari, Bandarban.\nCause\nThe RSO, formed around 1980, had been demanding rights for Rohingyas. The Myanmar government identifies the group as a militant organisation, The Rohingya Solidarity Organisation launched an armed rebellion, in the previous century, however discontinued in 1998. The Tatmadaw continued operations against rebels for years.\nMyanmar claimed, that the person killed who's body they had, they thought was a Rohingya Separatist, and accused Bangladesh of harbouring RSO insurgents, which led to the killing of Corporal Mizanur Rahman, which was later proven incorrect.\nBangladeshi official said \u201cWe told them very clearly that there was no such organisation in Bangladesh and will never be.\u201d\nMaj Gen Aziz said he reiterated to the BGP, the government's stand against letting anyone use Bangladesh's soil to plan or launch attacks against any sovereign state.\n\u201cWe told them to give us information, if any, on where in Bangladesh the RSO is located or has set up camps \u2026 We will drive them out right away.\u201d\nHe said the BGB, after the meeting, launched operations in collaboration with the army but did not find any RSO bases inside Bangladesh.\nConflict\nIn an unprovoked attack, BGP shot at BGB patrols at Naikhongchhari border in Bandarban on May 28, leaving Mizan dead. The Myanmar force then intruded into Bangladesh and took away his body, his firearm and ammunition, creating huge tension and firing at the border.\nOn May 30, Myanmar border guards attacked another BGB team, when it neared the border searching and waiting for Mizan. A gunbattle then took place between the two sides.\nAftermath\nAfter the incident, Myanmar deployed the Army to stand guard with its border police along its border with Bangladesh, while BGB called for reinforcement with heavy weapons.\nMyanmar finally handed over Mizanur's body to BGB the following day and the, 120 rounds of ammo, the foreign ministry summoned the Myanmar ambassador in Bangladesh, twice demanding the body and withdrawal of the army, That Myanmar had deployed along the border.\nSee also\nTatmadaw\nBangladesh Armed Forces\n2001 Bangladesh\u2013India border clashes\n2005 Bangladesh-India Border Clashes\nDeaths along the Bangladesh\u2013India border\n2019 Bangladesh-Indian border clash\n1979 Bangladesh-Indian skirmishes\n2015 Bangladesh-Arakan Army border clash\nBorder Guard Forces\nBorder Guard Police\nBorder Guard Bangladesh\nRohingya Solidarity Organisation\nBorder Security Force\nOperation Clean and Beautiful Nation\n",
    "Municipal building in Bedminster, Bristol, England\nBedminster Town Hall is a former events venue in Cannon Street in Bedminster, a suburb of Bristol in England. The building is currently in use as a furniture shop.\nHistory\nIn the late 19th century, a group of local businessmen decided to form a company, to be known as the Bedminster Town Hall Company, to finance and commission a new public hall for the parish. The site they selected was on the southwest side of Cannon Street.\nThe new building was designed in the Italianate style, built in brick at a cost of nearly \u00a36,000 and was completed in 1891. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of four bays facing onto Cannon Street. The central two bays on the ground floor featured round headed openings flanked by half-height columns with imposts supporting architraves. The outer bays on the ground floor and all the bays on the first floor were fenestrated by bi-partite round headed windows with tracery. There were pilasters separating the bays on the first floor and, at roof level, there was a modillioned cornice. Internally, the principal room was the main hall which was 67 feet (20\u00a0m) long and 51 feet (16\u00a0m) wide. It had seating for 750 people on the ground floor, 450 in the gallery, and standing room for another 350 people.  An adjoining building, erected at the same time, housed a liberal club.\nThe building was extensively used as a venue for concerts hosted by the Bristol South Musical Society. Performers included the contralto, Dame Clara Butt, who appeared in April 1893 and again in December 1894. However, the venture was not financially successful and the company which had developed the building was wound up in 1898. In 1909, the building was leased to the cinema pioneer, Ralph Pringle, who converted it into a cinema. It remained an independent cinema until 1954, when it was closed and was converted into a shopping mall. It was officially reopened as the \"Bedminster Shopping Hall\" on 11 February 1954. It was described two years later in the Estates Gazette as a \"unique arcade\" with \"28 shops\".\nThe fa\u00e7ade was later rebuilt in the modern style with a shop front on the ground floor and a series of nine tall casement windows on the first floor. By the early 21st century, it accommodated a furniture store, trading since around 2001 as Bedmaker, and since around 2009, as Kustom Floors.\n",
    "Norwegian radical feminist organization\nThe Women's Group Ottar (Norwegian: Kvinnegruppa Ottar) is a Norwegian radical feminist women's organization founded in 1991. It has its historical roots in the Norwegian Marxist-Leninist movement of the 1970s and has been described as the most radical women's organization and \"a final offshoot of 70s feminism.\" Ottar began as an offshoot of the Women's Front, and later, it splintered again, resulting in the creation of two new groups with explicitly trans-exclusionary profiles, Women's Declaration International (WDI) and Kvinneaktivistene. The Women's Front described WDI as \"transphobes.\" While mainly focused on combating pornography and prostitution from a radical feminist perspective, Ottar has also faced criticism from the Red Party, the Red Youth, LGBT+ rights groups and others for promoting or tolerating anti-trans and anti-Jewish views within its ranks, and some prominent members such as Kari Jaquesson have expressed support for trans-exclusionary radical feminism (TERF) and declared themselves to be TERFs. Ottar members have also engaged in doxxing and harassment of trans women by publishing pre-transition photos of them. Ottar has promoted several anti-gender beliefs, including opposition to the word \"cisgender\" and opposition to trans people's access to public restrooms in accordance with their gender identity. Ottar has accused the Norwegian Organisation for Sexual and Gender Diversity of working for prostitution as \"a nice way to recruit young men into the gay community and has claimed that the Norwegian Humanist Association and Amnesty International are linked to an alleged \"prostitution industry.\" Ottar's claims have been criticized by LGBT+ rights advocates as conspiracy theories and by the Norwegian Humanist Association as unworthy of serious attention. For several years, Ottar has participated in the anti-trans FiLiA conference, which opposes what it refers to as \"gender ideology\" and which is closely linked to WDI and regarded as one of the world's most active gender-critical groups. In 2024 Ottar faced strong criticism when the chair of its largest chapter referred to a Jewish woman as a \"Zionist pig.\"\nHistory\nThe Women's Group Ottar has its historical roots in the Norwegian Marxist-Leninist (Maoist) movement of the 1970s and the Women's Front. In 1991, the most radical and anti-pornography faction broke away from the Women's Front after disputes over views on pornography and prostitution. They formed loosely organized groups with different names: the first breakaway group formed the original Kvinnegruppa Ottar in Stavanger, while breakaway groups from Oslo and Bergen formed Kvinnegruppa Oslo \u00d8st and Kvinneaktivistene. From 1993, they united under the name Kvinnegruppa Ottar, named after sex educator Elise Ottesen-Jensen, also nicknamed \"Ottar.\" The groups emphasized a flat structure and were skeptical of formal and hierarchical organization, with individual groups being autonomous and collaborating sporadically in the early years. Only in 2006 did Kvinnegruppa Ottar adopt a more formal structure with national meetings and a directly elected national board. In the 2020s, two breakaway groups focused exclusively on anti-trans politics were founded: Kvinneaktivistene and Women's Declaration International (WDI) Norway, with a significant overlap in membership with Ottar and the Women's Front. Internationally, WDI is regarded as an anti-LGBTQ+ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nViews\nKvinnegruppa Ottar is particularly focused on pornography and prostitution. In public debates, the group has strongly criticized organizations like the Norwegian Humanist Association and Amnesty International, linking them to an alleged \"prostitution industry.\" Kristin Mile, the secretary-general of the Norwegian Humanist Association, described Ottar's claims as unworthy of serious attention. Ottar has accused queer people and the Norwegian Organisation for Sexual and Gender Diversity of working for prostitution as \"a nice way to recruit young men into the gay community.\" Daisy S\u00e6len Hafstad and Vegard R\u00f8dseth Tokheim described Ottar's statements about Fri and queer people as \"hate speech and conspiracy theories.\" On behalf of Ottar, Ane St\u00f8 and Kari Jaquesson reported the state broadcasting company NRK to the police in 2015 for airing a comedy sketch where a \"porn actress\" had parodied Jaquesson. The report was dismissed as baseless.\nAccusations of harassment\nConspiracy theorist and former television personality Kari Jaquesson has represented Ottar in several debates. In 2016 Jaquesson was criticized, e.g. by the Red Youth, for asking other women to \"suck cock ten times a day.\" Ottar defended Jaquesson, stating that she is \"politically solidly founded in Ottar's radical feminism.\" A survey by YouGov found that the public figures viewed most negatively by Norwegians were Donald Trump, Kari Jaquesson and Vladimir Putin. In 2019, Jaquesson was removed from the nom",

She has served in the national parliament, the Pan African Parliament and as a government minister.\nLife\nKabia was born in Sierra Leone. She had an unusual early life as her parents left her and her younger brother with her grandmother in Lunsar when she was three, so that they could establish a life in Britain. They did not return until she was eight by which time she was very attached to her grandmother. They took her and her brother back to the UK and she spent some time having to readjust to her re-united family.\nShe was homesick for Sierra Leone and her grandmother and her parents paid for to have a vacation in Lunsar. She realised that she was living a very different life in England to her former peers and she and her English schoolmates became involved in fundraising even before the Sierra Leone Civil War began in 1991. Kabia would take holiday jobs to pay for her later visits to Sierra Leone. She graduated in biochemistry in England before she went to America. In the USA she organised a group called African Women of Substance who raised funds and conducted protests.\nShe later took an MBA with the University of Milan.\nShe is supported by Vital Voices as an \"Engage Fellow\" and by the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Foundation as an Amujae Leader.\nShe was working in the office of her country's president as an advisor on diaspora affairs until she decided to be the first woman to contest the Port Loko District constituency.

    "Video portal installation connecting two cities\nThe New York\u2013Dublin Portal (also simply known as The Portal) is an interactive installation created by Lithuanian artist Benediktas Gylys to allow people in New York City and Dublin to interact with each other using two 24-hour live streaming video screens. The second series of installations in Gylys' Portal series, the New York\u2013Dublin Portal has been compared to Paul St George's past art installation named the Telectroscope, which connected New York to London in 2008.\nHistory\nThe Portal sculpture concept was created by Benediktas Gylys. The first of these to be unveiled was the Portal linking Vilnius, Lithuania to Lublin, Poland on May 26, 2021. Following its success, it was confirmed in March 2024 that by spring, Dublin and New York would be the next cities to receive them.\nOn Wednesday, May 8, 2024, the portals were introduced in their respective cities, with the New York screen being installed on the Flatiron South Public Plaza at 23rd Street, Fifth Avenue and Broadway next to the Flatiron Building, while the Dublin screen was positioned on O'Connell Street. In a press release on the same day, Gylys said they will only remain in place until autumn. To celebrate the launch, people in both cities held up signs to greet each other, with people on the New York side performing a dance routine.\nBy Monday, May 13, the connecting screens were turned off temporarily after participants behaved improperly. Some on the Dublin side displayed pornography and imagery of the September 11 attacks, projected profanities from their phone screens, and performed indecent exposure. On the New York side, an OnlyFans model exposed her breasts to those in Dublin. A Dublin City Council spokesperson said the authority had seen a \"very small minority\" behaving unsuitably, and technical solutions to address it are being implemented. The Council ruled out the possibility of blurring the video feed.\nOn Sunday, May 19, the New York and Dublin Portals were placed back online with updated digital technology to blur the screen if a person enters a visual field too close to the Portal. This has prevented several attempts by individuals to project images through the portal's camera system.\nReception\nShortly after the New York-Dublin Portal was reactivated in May 2024, the novelist Megan Nolan wrote for The Guardian: \"There was something simian about , not only in that it felt zoo-like being regarded by the other side as they waited to be entertained, but also in the way that people behave when language is out of bounds.\"\nSee also\nIrish Americans in New York City\nTelectroscope\nVilnius\u2013Lublin Portal\n",
    "\nNGC 7609 or known as Arp 150 and HCG 95A, is a large elliptical galaxy located in Pegasus. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 11,879 km/s, which corresponds the galaxy to be located 554 million light-years away from Earth (169.7 Mpc). NGC 7609 was discovered on October 5, 1864, by Albert Marth and included in Halton Arp's, Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies in galaxies that produces jets.\nWith a surface brightness of apparent magnitude 14.59, NGC 7609 is classified as a low surface brightness galaxy (LSB). LSB galaxies are diffuse galaxies with surface brightness that is one less magnitude, of the night sky. \nA pair of interacting galaxies\nA SDSS survey image and from the Hubble Space Telescope, showed that NGC 7609 is interacting with nearby galaxy, PGC 71077 (HCG 95C) whose spiral arms is currently being absorbed by the larger entity. A double-nuclei is present in HCG 95C, which is considered a merger remanent of two disk galaxies. Two tidal tails are also found in NGC 7609 and HCG 95C region, which seems to connect together, and there is a linear bridge between two galaxies indicating nuclear activity is taking place in HCG 95C. From the study written from Vilchez & Iglesias-Paramo in 1998, H\u03b1 emission is detected in the nuclei of both galaxies and also the larger tidal tails (the eastern tail).\nA long slit spectra of NGC 7609 shows, it exhibits red-shifted H-alpha + and  emission lines that is indicative to a LINER-type AGN (Active Galactic Nucleus).\nSloan Digital Sky Survey of NGC 7609\nFrom the spatial profiles, this indicate non-nuclear starburst activity triggered by tidal forces while nuclear spectrum indicates non thermal activity. From the further IUE observations of HCG 95C, it presents a featureless continuum with transient outburst captured in one observation, showing galactic emission  of red-shifted N v (1240 A) and C IV (1550 A). This result depicts HCG 95C is in the early stages of merging with NGC 7609.\nAccording to another study, it is suggested that a dwarf galaxy might have been created at the tip of the northern tidal tails.\nHickson 95 group\nNGC 7609 is a member of Hickson Compact Group 95. There are total of four galaxies in the group, in which the members are PGC 71074, PGC 71077 and PGC 71080. Of all the four galaxies, PGC 71080 (HCG 95B) is a foreground galaxy, as its line-of-sight velocity of 8000 km/s significantly differs from the velocity of the other members per published by Hickson et al.\nPrescence of ultra-diffuse galaxies around HCG 95\nA study mentions there is a detection of 89 candidate ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), around NGC 7609 and HCG 95, in which one is linked with. It is a gas-rich galaxy with H i mass 1.1 x 10 M\u2299, detected by Very Large Array, and has a stellar mass of M 1.8 x 10 M\u2299. This indicates that UDGs partially overlap with population of nearly dark galaxies found in deep H I surveys. The results show high abundance of blue UDGs in the HCG 95 field is favored by the poor galaxy cluster environment residing in H I-rich large-scale structures.\n",
    "Israeli military officer (1964\u20132002)\nDror Yitzhak Weinberg (Hebrew: \u05d3\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d2; October 26, 1964 - November 15, 2002) was a Colonel in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Killed during the 2002 Hebron ambush, Weinberg was the highest-ranking officer killed in the Second Intifada.\nBiography\nWeinberg was born in Kfar Saba to Uriel and Bat-Sheva. When he was two and a half years old, his two uncles, his mother's brothers, were killed in the Six-Day War. He studied in a state-religious school in his hometown. He was a member and a guide in the Bnei Akiva youth movement in Kfar Saba. In high school, he studied at the Noam religious high school in Pardes Hanna and then at the Yashlatz in Jerusalem.\nMilitary Service\nWeinberg enlisted in the IDF in 1983 and volunteered for Sayeret Matkal. He underwent a training course as a fighter in the unit, completed an infantry officers' course with distinction, and served as a team commander in the unit. In Sayeret, he participated in various covert operations and was decorated for one of these operations. He also took part in an operation to free hostages in the Bus 300 affair. Weinberg served in the unit as a valued team commander. In 1987, he moved to the Paratroopers Brigade and served as the deputy commander of the August 1987 company in Battalion 890. In 1988, he completed a company commanders' course and took command of the support company in Battalion 890. As a commander, he led the company in operations in Lebanon, on one hand, and fought against improper norms introduced by veteran soldiers in the company, on the other. During his command, the company was crowned as the outstanding company. Afterwards, he served as a battalion operations officer, went to study at the Command and Staff College, and returned to serve as an operations officer in the brigade. He went on to study for a bachelor's degree in Political Science and Middle Eastern studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nAfter completing his studies, Weinberg was appointed as the commander of Battalion 890 of the Paratroopers Brigade, a position he had aspired to since moving to the paratroopers, and led it during the fighting in southern Lebanon. During his command of the battalion, it achieved operational successes and was awarded the title of outstanding battalion in the brigade. He then served as the commander of the Maglan unit. In this position, he made significant changes in the unit's special capabilities and led it to operational successes in Lebanon. In 1999, Weinberg was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and commanded Brigade 623 (a reserve Paratroopers Brigade) and concurrently the Intelligence and Reconnaissance School (MoS) in Tze'elim. In his last position, he served as the commander of the Judea Brigade (\"Hebron Brigade\") in the Judea and Samaria Division. As the brigade commander, he managed to establish good relations both with the Jewish settlers and with the Palestinians. Weinberg insisted on a determined fight against terrorists in a focused and pinpoint manner, without unnecessary harm to \"uninvolved\" civilians and those innocent of any crime. The approach was successful, and Hebron was considered relatively calm. Shortly before his death, Weinberg was informed that he had been decided to be appointed as the commander of the regular Paratroopers Brigade.\nThree weeks before the attack, as part of the \"Judea First\" plan, the IDF withdrew its forces from the city of Hebron. The withdrawal was against Weinberg's opinion, who estimated that the withdrawal would damage the IDF's ability to efficiently thwart attacks. In the days before the attack, information was received about the organization of a cell to carry out an attack, but IDF forces refrained from entering the area of the city of Hebron due to the \"Judea First\" plan.\nOn the night of Saturday, 11th of Kislev 5763 (November 15, 2002), a terrorist cell carried out an attack on the \"Worshippers' Route\" in Hebron. Weinberg, who was at the brigade headquarters at the time, rushed to the event. When he got out of the jeep to locate the terrorists, he was hit by a bullet and died of his wounds shortly after. In the incident, 12 people were killed, including soldiers and members of the Kiryat Arba emergency response team.\nWeinberg was buried in the military cemetery in Kfar Saba, next to his two uncles who were killed in the Six-Day War. Thousands of civilians and soldiers attended his funeral. He was eulogized by the Chief Rabbi of Israel, the Minister of Defense, the Chief of Staff, his friends, and his family. He left behind a wife and five children. A few months after his death, his widow gave birth to another son named Dror Nehemiah. In 2005, she remarried, to Avi Roeh. During Operation Protective Edge, one of his sons was moderately injured. Another son was severely injured.\nCommemoration\nIn January 2003, the \"Bnei Dror\" fighters' company was established in Battalion 97 \"Netzach Yehuda\", named after Dror.\nNamed after him ar",
    "Brazilian soldier and politician\nPedro Aur\u00e9lio de G\u00f3is Monteiro (12 December 1889 \u2013 16 October 1956) was a Brazilian army general and politician, noted as one of the architects of the Cohen Plan and of the subsequent 1937 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat.\nBiography\nPedro Aur\u00e9lio de G\u00f3is Monteiro was born in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds do Quitunde, Alagoas. The son of Pedro Aureliano Monteiro dos Santos and Constan\u00e7a Cavalcanti de G\u00f3is Monteiro. Coming from a family with military tradition, he began his career at the Porto Alegre War School and reached the rank of army general. Over the years he adopted a loyalist stance when fighting the Copacabana Fort revolt, tenentism and the Prestes Column during the 1920s. The outbreak of the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 led him to exercise military command of it, contributing to its success.\nFrom 1 June 1931 to 25 April 1932, he commanded the 2nd Military Region, based in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nHe also commanded the 1st Military Region, in Rio de Janeiro, between 24 May and 9 July 1932.\nHe then commanded the federal troops that put down the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932 and, during the fighting, he lost his brother, captain C\u00edcero Augusto de G\u00f3is Monteiro, who was a member of the 9th Infantry Regiment of the Brazilian Army.\nAfter this event, he was appointed Minister of War in the Get\u00falio Vargas government, between 18 January 1934 and 7 May 1935, until Eurico Gaspar Dutra was chosen as his successor, which did not prevent G\u00f3is Monteiro from actively participating of the establishment and maintenance of the Estado Novo (1937\u20131945), an event that helped consolidate his family as the dominant political force in Alagoas, a state governed by two of his brothers between 1941 and 1945.\nDemonstrating the fascist stance of Get\u00falio Vargas' political actors during the Estado Novo, among whom G\u00f3is Monteiro was one of the most prominent names, Cl\u00e1udio de Lacerda Paiva described the Vargas government agents in the following terms: \"the one who censored was Lourival Fontes, the one who tortured was Filinto Muller, the one who instituted fascism was Francisco Campos, the one who carried out the coup was Dutra and the one who supported Hitler was G\u00f3is Monteiro\".\nAt the time he was Minister of War, he drafted the National Security Doctrine that inspired several laws in this regard both in the Vargas Era and in the 1964 military regime. In September 1937, G\u00f3is Monteiro \"discovered\" the Cohen Plan, which was a false planning, written by the then captain Ol\u00edmpio Mour\u00e3o Filho, of a communist revolution in Brazil. This plan was later used by Vargas as justification for the 1937 coup that gave rise to the Estado Novo.\nIn the 1934 indirect presidential election, he came third, winning 4 votes (1.61%).\nG\u00f3es Monteiro was Chief of Staff of the Army between 2 July 1937 and 27 December 1943.\nHe returned to the Ministry of War in the last days of Vargas in power, on 9 August 1945. He remained in the position during the Jos\u00e9 Linhares government and in the first months of the Dutra administration, until 14 October 1946.\nAfter leaving power, he was elected senator for the Social Democratic Party in 1947. In 1945, his brother Ismar de G\u00f3is Monteiro had been elected to that same position and in 1958 it was Silvestre P\u00e9ricles' turn to reach the country's senate. However, in 1950 Pedro Aur\u00e9lio was unable to be re-elected and even rejected an invitation to be vice-president on the Vargas ticket.\nHe was chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces between 15 February 1951 and 1 December 1952. He was then a justice in the Superior Military Court, from 15 December 1952 until his death on 16 October 1956.\n",

Multi-story exclusively commercial buildings, such as Breda Department Store in Opava, did not emerge until the 1970s in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9.\nHistory\nMerchant V\u00e1clav J. \u0160palek owned a house at the corner of Velk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed and Klicperova ulice, which burned down in July 1910. \u0160palek commissioned architect Vladim\u00edr Fultner to design a new building. Due to the narrow original medieval plot, Fultner decided to orient the main fa\u00e7ade of the new building not towards the square but towards Klicperova street.\n\u0160palek Department Store was designed as a five-storey corner house with two entrances and an ornamental fa\u00e7ade. Despite facing critique from Klub Za starou Prahu (Club for old Prague) and the architect Jan Kot\u011bra, who regarded the proportions of the construction unreasonable, the design was accepted and built by Josef Jihlavec in 1911. In the 1930s, the building was taken over by the company Ba\u0165a. The house was declared a cultural monument in 1958.\nIn the 21st century, the building was unused for several years and started to decay but a total reconstruction of the house and its conversion into living spaces took place in 2020.\nArchitecture\nThe house has five floors. The fa\u00e7ade towards the square is axially symmetrical, with an arcade in the ground floor and three large windows on the first floor. The higher floors are distinguished by a risalit with each storey containing five narrow windows. The roof forms a mansarda from which a dormer emerges. At the ends of the fa\u00e7ade, there are two corner towers.\n",
    "Musical artist\nAndy Boy (born Anthony Boyd, November 10, 1904 \u2013 unknown) was an American Texas blues pianist and songwriter. He was part of the \"Santa Fe Group\", a loose ensemble of black blues pianists who played in the many juke joints abutting the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.\nDetails of his life outside of his recording career are sketchy, including a complete lack of information relating to his death.\nLife and career\nAnthony Boyd was born in 1904 in Galveston, Texas, United States.\nHe created some notoriety in the 1920s, when one newspaper reported that Andy Boy had been accused of having attempted to kill his wife. On another occasion, Boy was arrested along with several others for illegal gambling, after police raided a local bar. Boy used the experience some months later when composing one of his songs, \"House Raid Blues\". Robert Shaw recalled meeting Andy Boy and stated about him \"He was a little fellow, just a little older than me. He was the top kicker of Galveston\".\nHis piano playing incorporated ragtime stylings into the blues. Combining that in his left hand with a jazz element, was counteracted by clusters of chords or runs with his right.  He accompanied the blues vocalist Joe Pullum on eleven songs, all of which were recorded on August 13, 1935. They were released as a series of singles on Bluebird Records. Andy Boy then recorded eight solo tracks in San Antonio. He also accompanied Walter \"Cowboy\" Washington on four sides at the same recording session, which  took place on February 24, 1937.\nHis recording career over, he left Texas to move to Oklahoma. In the early 1940s he was reportedly in Kansas City, and when his whereabouts were queried in 1960 by Paul Oliver, Buster Pickens told him that Andy Boy was still alive and residing in New York, but thereafter the trail ran dry.\nAll of Boy's recordings were collated on the compilation album, Joe Pullum Vol. 2 (1935-1951), released in 1994 by Document Records. The 2021 release, I Need You Blues, covered the same material but lacks Boy's work accompanying Pullum.\nConfusion\nIn the book Blues and Gospel Records: 1890\u20131943 (1997), it stated that \"This performer's surname was 'Boy'\". However, subsequent research revealed differing information. Michael Hortig, an Austrian author, photographer and blues historian, eventually uncovered his birth details as shown above.\nAndy Boy's 'stage name' is not to be confused with the brand name used by the California-based D'Arrigo Brothers, for their range of fresh vegetables.\nLegacy\nBill Wyman chose Walter \"Cowboy\" Washington's recording of \"Ice Pick Mama\", with piano accompaniment from Andy Boy, as one of the tracks on the compilation album, Bill Wyman's Blues Odyssey (2002).\nSee also\nList of Texas blues musicians\n",

    "French admiral\nFran\u00e7ois Frix Michelier (8 February 1887 \u2013 23 May 1966) was a French admiral who served in both World War I and World War II. He is best known for commanding French forces during the Naval Battle of Casablanca.\nBiography\nIn 1907, Michelier enrolled in the French Naval Academy at the age of 20. During the First World War, he held several commands and functions; Most notably, he was briefly a liaison and intelligence officer with the Royal Navy.\nOn 10 November 1928 Michelier was promoted to the rank of Frigate captain. He was promoted to deputy director of Military Personnel of the Fleet at the Ministry of the Navy and Colonies. Then on 6 March 1938 Michelier was appointed to vice-president of the French Navy technical committee and as  president of the higher shipwreck commission. He was then assigned as head of fleet construction for the French Naval Ministry.\nWorld War II\nOn 29 September 1939 Michelier was promoted to Major General of the Navy. He then became the Secretary General of the Ministry of the Navy on 18 June 1940. During the Battle of France, Michelier along with most of the French Naval general staff were captured by the German Army in the town Rochefort. The general staff were released shortly after their capture and Michelier became a member of the French delegation to the German Armistice Commission on 1 July 1940. Later in July 1941 he became the interim president of the comminison. On 25 March 1941, Michelier was promoted to squadron vice-admiral. He was then made commander of the vichy naval forces station in Morocco and as commander and chief of the Atlantic theater of operations. He arrived in Morocco on 20 October 1941. He was placed under the direct command of the Vichy French Ministry of the Navy for all naval operations. Michelier was also placed under the command of Residents-General of Morocco Charles Nogu\u00e8s and served as commander of the Casablanca-Rabat sector.\nAllied landings in North Africa\nMichelier was warned of the upcoming Allied landing in Morocco by General Antoine B\u00e9thouart. However, Michelier and Nogu\u00e8s give no credibility to the information given. He informs Nogu\u00e8s (who also received information from B\u00e9thouart) of the lack of confirmation of this potential Allied operation, while nevertheless knowing that a convoy is passing Gibraltar towards the east. After the landing on the 8th, Michelier coordinated the defense and did not stop the fire until 11 November. He continued resisting even after receiving a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief of the French Armed Forces Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan to stop resisting. Michelier believed that Darlan was already captured thereby invalidating him from issuing orders. Additionally, Michelier had received orders from Darlan two weeks earlier that he was to hold out until the end if the allies attacked. He also received information from Admiral Gabriel Auphan that Vichy French leader Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain wished for Michelier to resist an allied invasion to his full capacity if one were to occur.\nAfter the ceasefire, Michelier was more cooperative with the Allies, even wishing to repair both Allied and French damaged ships to resume fighting against the Germans. Under Darlan's orders, he retained the role commander in chief of the navy in the Atlantic. However, after Darlan's assassination, he was dismissed from his position and placed on leave that June. After clashes with Admiral Philippe Auboyneau in May, Free French leader Charles de Gaulle requested his replacement; Michelier was relieved of his duties on 7 July 1943 and was automatically retired in December of the same year.\nAfter the war\nMichelier was brought before a French court on the charges of treason, but he was able to get case dismissed on the grounds he was carrying out the orders of the Admiralty. He testified during Nogu\u00e8s treason trial before the French High Court. Michelier died in 1966 in Toulouse.\n",
    "American geologist and petrologist\nFor the American film and television composer, see Robert Folk.\nRobert \"Bob\" Louis \"Luigi\" Folk (September 30, 1925, Cleveland, Ohio \u2013 June 4, 2018) was an American geologist and petrologist, specializing in sedimentology, sandstone petrology, and carbonate petrology. He is known for the 1959 eponymous Folk classification of sedimentary rocks, which, with some minor modifications, is still in use today. He is one of the founders of what is sometimes called \"Soft Rock Geology\".\nBiography\nRobert Louis Folk and his older brother, George Kinkead Folk, were the sons of George Billmyer Folk, a lawyer in Cleveland, and Majorie Kinkead Folk, a talented pianist and painter. After graduating from Shaker Heights High School, Robert L. Folk matriculated in 1943 at Pennsylvania State College (which in 1953 was renamed Pennsylvania State University). There he graduated in geology with a B.S. in 1946, an M.S. in 1950, and a Ph.D. in 1952. His Ph.D. thesis Petrography and petrology of the Lower Ordovician Beekmantown carbonate rocks in the vicinity of State College, Pennsylvania was supervised by Paul Dimitri Krynine (1902\u20131964). Folk married Marjorie Thomas in September 1946. In autumn 1951, Robert Folk, with his wife and son, moved to Houston, Texas, where he had employment as a sedimentary geology working for Gulf Oil Research.  He was soon assigned to a field project in Pascagoula, Mississippi, where his second child, a daughter, was born. Folk was appointed in September 1952 as an assistant professor in the geology department of the University of Texas at Austin. There he was promoted to associate professor and then full professor, including the Professorship in Sedimentary Geology (1977\u20131982) and the Carlton Professorship of Geology (1982\u20131988). He retired in 1988 as professor emeritus. In 1988 he was employed as senior research scientist at the Bureau of Economic Geology, University of Texas at Austin. He was a visiting professor in 1965 at the Australian National University, in 1973 at the University of Milan, and in 1980 at Tongji University in Shanghai. As professor emeritus, he was extremely active in research until shortly before his death. Folk was the author or coauthor of more than 100 research papers. He with colleagues did fieldwork on beach pebbles in Tahiti, desert sands in central Australia, sandstones in Texas and West Virginia, limestones in Texas, Yucat\u00e1n, and Italy. He was also involved in archeological geology in Yugoslavia, Israel, southern Italy, and Egypt.\nHis book Petrology of Sedimentary Rocks, based on his course notes for graduate students, first appeared in 1957, went through 6 editions, and was revised periodically until 1980.\nIn 1973 Robert Folk, with his wife and daughter, spent six months in Italy, where he was a visiting professor at the University of Milan, upon the invitation of Riccardo Assereto, who was a professor of geology there. From 1973 to 1988 Robert Folk spent every summer doing fieldwork in Italy. He and his family greatly enjoyed Italy, and he encouraged people to call him \"Luigi\". Folk had a variety of hobbies.\nRobert and Marjorie Folk were married for 70 years and had two sons and a daughter. Robert Folk was predeceased by his wife and their two sons. Upon his death in 2018, he was survived by his daughter, four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.\nDisputed research on alleged nannobacteria\nFolk believed that he had discovered, in the early 1990s, evidence of nannobacteria in rock from hot springs of Viterbo in the Lazio region of Italy. However, Folk's interpretation of his empirical discovery is generally rejected by experts in bacteriology.\nAwards and honors\nRobert Folk received in 1989 the Neil Miner Award from the National Association of Geology Teachers (NAGT) and in 1997 the Distinguished Educator Medal from the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG). He was awarded the William H. Twenhofel Medal in 1979 from the Society Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists (SEPM), now formally renamed the Society for Sedimentary Geology, the Sorby Medal in 1990 from the International Association of Sedimentologists, and the Penrose Medal in 2000 from Geological Society of America (GSA).\nOn May 22, 2001, the Board of Regents of the University of Texas (U.T.) established the R. L. Folk/E. F. McBride Petrography Fund to sponsor a rock sample identification contest held annually for U.T. geology students. Initial funds were provided by Rodger E. Denison (1932\u20132016), a geologist and U.T. alumnus.\nSee also\nNeomorphism\nSelected publications\nArticles\nFolk, R. L. (1951). \"Stages of textural maturity in sedimentary rocks\".

    "\nMedical condition\nPost-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is used to describe persistent neuropathic pain that follows breast surgery, such as mastectomy and lumpectomy. PMPS manifests as consent pain and unusual sensations in the upper and lateral thoracic, axilla, and medial and posterior arm and shoulder intercostal nerve distribution region.\nPMPS can be caused by a direct nerve injury, indirect nerve injury, or by the development of scar tissue or a traumatic neuroma following breast cancer surgery. Risk factors for the development of PMPS include younger age, history of headaches, and quadrantectomy with axillary lymphadenectomy. While the exact mechanisms of PMPS aren't fully understood it is thought to be caused by neuralgia of the intercostobrachial nerve.\nThe diagnosis of PMPS is based based off symptoms, exclusion of other possible causes of pain, and a history of mastectomy. Differential diagnosis of PMPS includes phantom breast pain, cervical radiculopathy, pectoralis minor syndrome/neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, scapulothoracic bursitis, glenohumeral joint adhesive capsulitis, shoulder impingement syndrome, myofascial pain, and lymphedema.\nThe risk of PMPS can be reduced by managing mental health concerns prior to surgery, preforming sentinel lymph node biopsy over a more extensive axillary lymph node dissection, and properly controlling perioperative pain. Antidepressants such as amitriptyline and venlafaxine can be used to manage PMPS. Pregabalin and gabapentin are also considered first line treatment for PMPS. Topical capsaicin can be used to relieve nerve pain. Peripheral nerve blockade or neurolysis are used to treat peripheral nerve pain.\nSigns and symptoms\nPost-mastectomy pain syndrome is a chronic neuropathic pain that usually manifests as continuous pain along with aberrant sensation in the upper and lateral thoracic, axilla, and medial and posterior arm and shoulder intercostal nerve distribution region. Pain is most likely to start after surgery, although adjuvant therapy, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, may sometimes cause new symptoms to appear. PMPS pain has been described as searing, excruciating cold, or electric shock feelings, as well as numbness, tingling, or pins and needles. There may also be mechanical allodynia and hypoesthesia.\nCauses\nThe development of a traumatic neuroma or scar tissue after the breast cancer surgery, or direct nerve injury,\u00a0such as transection, compression, ischemia, stretching, and retraction, might result in postmastectomy pain syndrome. On the other hand, indirect nerve injury can happen during or after surgery. Peripheral nerves may become compressed and stressed during surgery due to retraction and improper arm posture. Stretch and compression injuries following surgery can result from scarring, seroma, and hematoma. Nerve damage can then lead to a variety of sensory abnormalities, such as tingling, burning, or numbness.\nRisk factors\nThe biggest risk factors for PMPS are age less than fifty, quadrantectomy with axillary lymphadenectomy, and headache. Other risk factors include prior surgery site pain, lower educational attainment, recurrent somatization, sleep disturbances, and axillary dissection.\nThe majority of scientific research indicates that a woman's risk of developing PMPS decreases\u00a0with age. This could be explained by the fact that younger women with breast cancer had worse prognoses in terms of the tumor's aggressiveness and the possibility of a recurrence.\nRegarding the kind of surgery, current research indicates that, regardless of the method used, axillary lymphadenectomy is the risk factor most significant for PMPS.\nLastly, it was discovered that patients with a history of headaches were more likely to acquire PMPS; this finding could be attributed to central sensitization. Frequent headaches are thought to cause a condition of central hypersensitivity, which is initially only functional but may become more permanent as a result of neural plasticity prolonging the pain process.\nMechanism\nAlthough the precise cause and mechanism of PMPS are unknown, multiple factors seem to be involved. Neuralgia of the intercostobrachial nerve is currently thought to be the most frequent cause of PMPS. The cutaneous lateral branch of T2, known as the intercostobrachial nerve, passes through the serratus anterior muscle and innervates the axillary region and upper arm. Numerous modes of injury during axillary dissection, including as stretching or compression during retraction and frank transection, are linked to damage to the intercostobrachial nerve. The dorsal root ganglion and nerve injury site are thought to be the sites of ectopic neuronal activity, which underlies the underlying pathology. This leads to heightened sensitivity to chemical or mechanical stimuli and consequent pain perceptions.\nDiagnosis\nIn the absence of an infection or recurrent disease, the diagnosis of postmastectomy pain syndrome is based on the characteristi",
    "Welsh football manager (born 1979)\nChris Hughes (born 12 September 1979) is a Welsh football manager. He managed Cymru Premier club Newtown from November 2013 to January 2024, leading them to the Welsh Cup final in 2015 \u2013 their first since 1897 \u2013 and three qualifications for UEFA competitions.\nFootball career\nHughes played as a midfielder or forward for Buckley Town. He then worked as an assistant manager at that club, Rhyl, Caersws and Prestatyn Town.\nPossessing a UEFA A Licence, Hughes left his post at Prestatyn after four years to become manager of Newtown on 5 November. The club's previous manager Bernard McNally had left to be head of youth at Shrewsbury Town. Newtown regularly finished low in the table before Hughes's arrival, having been spared relegation from the 2011\u201312 Welsh Premier League because of the conditions of other clubs. On Hughes's debut on 8 November, the team won 4\u20130 away to Connah's Quay Nomads.\nIn the 2014\u201315 Welsh Cup, Hughes led Newtown to their first final since 1897, with a 2\u20131 home win over Rhyl in the semi-finals. The team lost the final 2\u20130 to The New Saints at their own Latham Park ground on 2 May 2015. Fifteen days later, they won 2\u20131 away to Aberystwyth Town in the play-off final to qualify for the UEFA Europa League; Tomos Hughes of the North Wales Pioneer named him Manager of the Season for this feat.\nIn Newtown's first European games since the 1998\u201399 UEFA Cup, Hughes led Newtown to home and away 2\u20131 wins over Valletta of Malta in the first qualifying round in July 2015; the next round was a 5\u20131 aggregate loss to FC Copenhagen.\nIn May 2021, Hughes's club defeated Caernarfon Town 5\u20133 away to qualify for the UEFA Europa Conference League. He then signed a contract for another two years. In July, his team were eliminated 5\u20130 on aggregate by Dundalk of the Republic of Ireland in the first qualifying round. Hughes suggested that Welsh football should be played through the summer like the League of Ireland in order to be more competitive in European qualifiers.\nA third-place finish in the 2021\u201322 Cymru Premier led to a second consecutive Conference League qualification, the first time in Newtown's history that they played in Europe for two seasons in a row. Hughes's club won 6\u20134 on aggregate over HB T\u00f3rshavn of the Faroe Islands in the first qualifying round before falling 6\u20132 over two games to FC Spartak Trnava of Slovakia in the second.\nOn 10 January 2024, following three successive defeats, Hughes resigned from Newtown; the team were already guaranteed a top-six finish. He said he was proud that his first managerial job had lasted over a decade, but said that the club was now in a safe place to move on, and he wanted to spend more time with his family.\nPersonal life\nHughes has worked in sports development for Wrexham County Borough Council. He is a lecturer in football coaching at Wrexham University.\n",
    "Supreme Deity in Chinese religion and mythology\nTaiyi, also known as Donghuang Taiyi, is a Chinese deity and associated with the Polaris  in ancient Chinese astronomy. He was the highest deity of certain Pre-Qin and Han dynasties and was worshiped as the emperor of the heavens. In philosophy, Taiyi is a symbolism of the  Tao, or the origin of the universe. During the period of Emperor Wu of Han, worship of Taiyi was an official belief, ranked above the Wufang Shangdi and worshipped by the Emperor himself. \nThe Deity Taiyi\nTaiyi is regarded as the god of the Polaris, the most honored star god in folk beliefs, and is called Donghuang Taiyi in the poetry of Chuci.   In Sima Qian's \u201cRecords of the Grand Historian it\u2019s stated that \u201cZhongguang  , the star of the heavenly pole, whose one is bright, is also the permanent residence of Taiyi\u201d.   Late Han Dynasty writer Zheng Xuan wrote that  \u201cTaiyi\u00a0: the name of the God in the Polaris (Beichen). He lives there and is called Taiyi.\u201d  Zhang Shoujie  wrote in the Tang Dynasty: \u201cTaiyi, another name of  the Tiandi\u201d.\nTaiyi manipulates good and bad fortune in the human world. The Weishu  writes: \u201cTaiyi is the master of wind and rain, water and drought, war and revolution, famine and plague\u201d . By worshipping Taiyi, one can invoke the gods and goddesses. During worship, the faithful entertained the gods with songs and dances.\nTaoism in the Han Dynasty also worshipped Taiyi, and at the end of the Han Dynasty, the Taoist fraction known as the  Taiping Dao honored Taiyi. Cultivators of the Tao medicate about Taiyi. One of its foundational texts, the Taipingjing, writes  \u201cEntering the room to contemplate the Tao...... is the way to ascend to Taiyi from Heaven.\u201d  Taiyi was also transformed into one of the Shenshen deities of Taoism.\nDonghuang Taiyi\nDonghuang Taiyi (Chinese: \u4e1c\u7687\u592a\u4e00; pinyin: T\u00e0iy\u012b Sh\u0113ngshu\u01d0; lit. 'Taiyi Gave Birth to Water') is the name of the opening hymn of Chuci\u2019s Jiuge, a collection of ceremonial hymns for the Chu Dynasty Emperor.  It describes the worship of Donghuang Taiyi. Although it's never specified whether Donghuang is a title or a name, many modern depictions use it as his surname.\nTaiyi Creates Water\nTaiyi Shengshui (Chinese: \u592a\u4e00\u751f\u6c34; pinyin: T\u00e0iy\u012b Sh\u0113ngshu\u01d0; lit. 'Taiyi Gave Birth to Water') is an ancient Chinese text written around 300 BC during the Warring States period. It is part of the Guodian Chu Slips.\nIt is a Taoist creation myth.

The text's inclusion in the Guodian \"Laozi C\" bundle has led some scholars to suggest it may have been considered part of the Tao Te Ching.:\u200a8\u200a\nHistorical Status\nIn 133 BC, the fangshi Miuji (cn: \u8c2c\u5fcc) proposed that Taiyi was positioned above the Five Emperors.  The Emperor Wu of Han took his advice and began worshipping Taiyi as the foremost deity.   \nThis was opposed by many Confucians, who believed that Huangtian Shangdi (Chinese: \u7687\u5929\u4e0a\u5e1d; pinyin: Hu\u00e1ngti\u0101n Sh\u00e0ngd\u00ec)  was the foremost deity. In 5AD, the Emperor Ping of Han declared that Taiyi was the Huangtian Shangdi and began to refer to him as the Huangtian Shangdi Taiyi (Chinese: \u7687\u5929\u4e0a\u5e1d\u6cf0\u4e00; pinyin: Hu\u00e1ngti\u0101n Sh\u00e0ngd\u00ec T\u00e0iy\u012b)   .   Later Han Dynasty national-level ceremonies kept the status of the Shangdi but began to drop Taiyi, instead of only worshipping Huangtian Shangdi as the supreme deity. Taiyi fell in status and was often worshipped among other lesser deities. \nDuring the Tang and Song Dynasties, Taiyi was once again worshipped in official ceremonies.\nShangyuan Festival Traditions\nRegarding the origin of the custom of hanging lanterns at the Shangyuan Festival or Yuanxiao Festival, there have been various theories. One is the honoring of Donghuang Taiyi by the Emperor Wu of Han.  Song Dynasty text \u201cQu Wei Jiu Wen \u66f2\u6d27\u65e7\u95fb\u201d wrote \u201cOn the Shangyuan lights: The Tang Dynasty inherited the custom from the Han Emperor's honoring of Taiyi by lighting his temple from dusk to dawn.\u201d \nThe name Shangyuan might have also came from the Taoist honoring of it is because in Taoist thought, the Lantern Festival lanterns are lit in order to worship the Shangyuan Tianguan, or Heavenly Officials.\nDepictions in Art\nIn the state of Chu ,  Taiyi was depicted as half-beast with a double-feathered mianguan, a loong under each limb, and stepping on the moon on one foot and the moon on the oth",
    "Borzenko in 1950sAndrey Andreyevich Borzenko  (Russian: \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0437\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e; December 4, 1920, Tashkent, USSR \u2014  February 21, 1993, Tashkent, Uzbekistan) was a  Soviet boxer, Honored Trainer of Uzbekistan, Master of Sports, referee, two-time heavyweight boxing champion of the Uzbek SSR (1938, 1939).\nThe prototype of the main character of Georgy Sviridov\u2019s novel The Ring Behind Barbed Wire.\nBiogra\u0440hy\nBorzenko was born in Tashkent in 1920.\nHe began boxing in the Sidney Jackson section in the mid-1930s. Twice, in 1938 and 1939, he won the heavyweight boxing championship of the Uzbek SSR.\nHe was called up to serve in the artillery unit of the Red Army on September 24, 1941, with the rank of Red Army soldier. Participated in hostilities and was wounded twice. He was captured during the retreat of Soviet troops across the Dnieper in 1941.\nAt first he was kept in a prisoner of war camp near Dresden, and after two escape attempts he was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp.\nThe German officer who selected athletes for the Buchenwald amateur ring from among the newly arrived prisoners, having learned about Borzenko's sports past, forced him to participate in exhibition boxing fights for the entertainment of the camp staff. In total, before his liberation on April 11, 1945, Borzenko fought more than 80 fights in Buchenwald, winning all of them.\nAccording to his son, after his release he served for some time in Smersh.\nAfter the Great Patriotic War he returned to Tashkent. He graduated from the Tashkent Medical Academy, became a surgeon, and worked at the City Clinical Hospital No. 6 of Tashkent.\nHe was married and had two children   a son, Andrey, and a daughter, Olga.\nAndrey  Borzenko died in 1993. He was buried at the Botkin Cemetery in Tashkent.\nIn culture\nBorzenko did not talk about his stay in the Buchenwald concentration camp for a long time. However, Georgy Sviridov, a writer and the first head of the USSR Boxing Federation, who had personally known Borzenko since 1947, persuaded him to make his life story public. In the book The Ring Behind Barbed Wire  (1960), Sviridov wrote the heroic image of Andrey Borzenko (in the text of the book   Burzenko)   an active participant in the anti-fascist underground of Buchenwald, forced to enter the ring to stop beating defenseless comrades and give the underground members the opportunity to collect and test weapons.\nIn 2022, the documentary film  Borzenko: Ring Behind Barbed Wire  was released (directed by  Aleksey Degtyarev and  Elena Moshtal-Geladze, narrated by Sergey Garmash).\nSee also\nHarry Haft\nSalamo Arouch\nVictor Perez\nSzapsel Rotholc\nJohann Trollmann\nTadeusz Pietrzykowski\n",
    "2021 soundtrack album by Billy Bang\nLucky Man: Music from the Film is the soundtrack to the 2010 film Lucky Man, directed by Jean-Marie Boulet and Markus Hansen, documenting violinist and Vietnam veteran Billy Bang's 2008 visit to the country, 40 years after his participation in the Vietnam War as a tunnel rat. The album consists of field recordings created during Bang's travels across Vietnam, during which he interacted with local musicians, and came to appreciate the country's culture while at the same time seeking closure for the trauma he experienced during the war. The recording was released in 2021 on vinyl, CD, and as a digital download by BBE Music in association with IF Music.\nReception\nIn a review for Jazzwise, Kevin Le Gendre wrote: \"Bang was nothing if not open-minded and his ability to blend a wide range of black music, from hard blues to open avant-garde, serve him well here in the company of skilled traditional players... This is deeply poignant music that offers invaluable catharsis to the horrors of war.\"\nKarl Ackermann of All About Jazz stated: \"The music is unlike anything else that Bang had recorded... Bang sometimes sounds like he has conquered his demons, but at other times, his pain is palpable... Bang's trademark acerbic but animated style is peppered with the violinist's inner dialog.\"\nWriting for Strings Magazine, Greg Cahill called Bang's playing \"poignant,\" and commented: \"The personal nature of these field recordings has a healing effect and sheds new light on Bang\u2019s own dogged pursuit of peace.\"\nJazz Journal's Matthew Wright described the music as \"wonderful,\" with Bang \"relating to and recognising the link between the Vietnamese style of playing and sound and his own.\" He praised the track titled \"Mystery of the Mekong,\" featuring Bang's violin \"soaring above a rich aggregation of strings, resonant cellos and almost rhapsodic support from the piano.\"\nIn an article for Truth and Lies, Justin Turford called the album \"an extraordinary soundtrack to an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man,\" with music that is \"unlike anything I've heard before.\" He singled out the track titled \"Dan Da,\" on which Bang's violin joins Duc Dau's dan da, a stone lithophone, describing it as \"the most perfect example of improvisational skill between two masters from different worlds,\" and noting: \"Their elation and excitement is palpable as they push and drive each other to new heights and is a privilege to behold.\"\nTrack listing\n\"Lucky Man: Introduction\" \u2013 4:10\n\"Billy playing with the Banhar Gong Group of Kuntum (traditional and improvised)\" \u2013 6:16\n\"Lucky Man: Flashback Tunnel Reflections\" \u2013 1:26\n\"Mystery of the Mekong\" \u2013 6:59\n\"Lucky Man: The Sun Rising - Introduction to Song for Don Cherry\" \u2013 1:03\n\"Song for Don Cherry\" \u2013 13:26\n\"Lucky Man: Flashback Memories\" \u2013 1:45\n\"New Saigon Phunk (Extended Version)\" \u2013 11:35\n\"Lucky Man: Traditional Vietnamese Catru Music\" \u2013 0:59\n\"Lucky Man: Billy Reflecting on Memories and Feelings\" \u2013 0:51\n\"Jungle Lullaby (Live at the Sax n'Art Club)\" \u2013 12:26\n\"Lucky Man: Quynh Anh Pham's Memories About Her Father\" \u2013 1:07\n\"Dan Da\" \u2013 9:45\n\"Lucky Man: Billy Speaking About Music and Art\" \u2013 0:47\n\"Lucky Man: Flashlight and a 45 Tunnel Memories\" \u2013 1:53\n\"Lucky Man Title Music: Vietnam 1967 Battle Composition\" \u2013 1:06\n\"Lucky Man: Teach Me Banhar\" \u2013 1:09\n\"Traditional Quan Ho\" \u2013 5:47\n\"Lucky Man: Billy Reflecting on America, Music and Being Left Alone\" \u2013 1:05\n\"Moments for the KIAMIA (Solo in a Hotel Interior Courtyard)\" \u2013 2:30\n\"Lucky Man: Quynh Anh Pham Lullaby\" \u2013 0:44\n\"New Saigon Phunk\" \u2013 5:51\nPersonnel\nBilly Bang \u2013 violin, voice\nBanhar Gong Group (track 2)\nHanoi Symphony Orchestra conducted by Tuan Phuong (track 4)\nDuc Dau \u2013 dan da (tracks 6, 8, 13, 22)\nPhu Dong Family Band (tracks 6, 8, 9, 22)\nTr\u1ea7n M\u1ea1nh Tu\u1ea5n \u2013 saxophone (track 11)\nQuynh Anh Pham \u2013 voice (track 12)\nCau River Singers  \u2013 vocals (track 18)\n",

    "\nEM Gardner OBE was the name used by Emilie Montgomery Gardner (30 September 1882 \u2013 8 April 1959). She was an American-born British photographer and a British suffragist. In later life she took to photographing notable buildings. About 1,800 of her photographs are kept by Historic England until 2029 when they will be unprotected and freely available.\nLife\nGardner was born in New Haven in Connecticut in 1882. About ten years later her family moved to the Black Country. It was intended to be a temporary move so that her father could establish a factory in Birmingham, but their plans changed and they stayed in England. Her younger sister, Elinor Wight Gardner, as a leading British geologist.\nShe was a member of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) from 1900. Gardner attended Newnham College from 1904 and she became the President of the joint NUWSS society that involved students from Newnham and from its sister college, Girton. Newnham was one of the few women's colleges that were part of Cambridge University. The students were allowed to take classes and identical exams to male students but they were denied a Cambridge degree irrespective of their success. She completed her time in Newnham in 1907, but she was involved in the 1908 suffrage tour.\nGardner on the left during the Caravan Tour at Bridlington in 1908\nIn 1908 a caravan tour was organised that began in Scotland. The caravan was pulled by a horse and driven by a man. The caravan travelled from place to place and the caravan would be redirected to good places to stay by some outriders who used their own bicycles. The caravan had campbeds and a tent that allowed five or six to sleep. They toured into Keswick, Bridlington and the north of England and they would give talks about women's suffrage. The caravan visited Oxford, Stratford and Warwick. They argued the case for women to get the vote, but they avoided ambitions of getting women to be members of parliament as this was too radical. The women on the caravan included Ray Strachey and Gardner. The tour finished in the East Midlands at Derby where they attracted a crowd of 1,000 people.\nIn 1912 she became a British citizen.\nAfter the first world war, some British women were allowed to vote, subject to both age and property ownership, and in 1928 all women over the age of 21 were allowed to vote.\nIn the 1942 Birthday Honours Gardner was awarded an OBE for her work in the civil service.\nGardner was keen on buildings and she was particularly keen on water mills. She persuaded the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings to take more interest and as a result the Wind and Watermill Section in 1946. Throughout most of the 1950s she was on that section's committee.\nDeath and legacy\nGardner died in Chichester on 8 April 1959 after a minor operation at the local hospital. About 1,800 of her photographs are held by Historic England. They will be out of copyright in 2029.\n",

    "Incident involving the Ohio State Buckeyes football team\nOhio Stadium is the home of Ohio State Buckeyes football.\nThe Ohio State University football scandal concerned NCAA rules violations and other incidents committed by the Ohio State Buckeyes football team during the tenure of former head coach Jim Tressel from 2001 to 2011. An investigation of the program was joined by the NCAA, the FBI, and the U.S. Department of Justice. As a result of the investigation, Ohio State's football program was punished with sanctions.\nThe sanctions were announced on July 8, 2011, and affected the Ohio State football program from 2011 to 2015. The punishment involved Ohio State vacating all wins from the 2010 season (including the 2011 Sugar Bowl win), a postseason ban in 2012, two years of NCAA probation, a five-year show cause for head coach Jim Tressel, and a reduction of five scholarships over three years. Tressel would resign from Ohio State as a result of the scandal.\nBackground\nThe origins of the scandal date back to when Maurice Clarett, a member of Ohio State's 2002 national championship team, accused the university of major NCAA violations. The New York Times in July 2003 received information from a teaching assistant that Clarett had received preferential treatment from professors, claiming he never attended any classes during his time at Ohio State. Clarett was suspended for the 2003 season on September 10, 2003, by athletic director Andy Geiger. Geiger claimed that Clarett received special benefits worth thousands of dollars from a family friend and repeatedly misled investigators. However, the investigation did not find sufficient evidence of academic misconduct, and Clarett was not ruled ineligible. Clarett claims that head coach Jim Tressel asked him to \"take the fall\" for Ohio State during the investigation, naming five other former players in his official story including Sammy Maldonado and Marco Cooper, and that he received substantial benefits from Tressel and his brother, including access to cars.\nThe scandal\nThe scandal then took off when five players - Terrelle Pryor, Devier Posey, Mike Adams, Solomon Thomas, and Boom Herron were suspended by the NCAA for the first five games of the 2011 season for receiving improper benefits on December 22, 2010. However, the players were allowed to participate in the upcoming Sugar Bowl game against Arkansas. The suspensions resulted from an incident where the players received tattoos for autographs. The players also sold several items given to them by the university, including Big Ten championship rings, jerseys, and other football-related awards for tattoos. Head coach Jim Tressel denied any involvement and knowledge of the players committing these violations.\nThe scandal originated from Fine Line Tattoos and Piercings in Columbus. The owner of the parlor, Edward Rife, was being investigated by the FBI for felony drug trafficking. Tressel was first notified of the arrangement in April 2010 when he received several e-mails from Chris Cicero, a local attorney and former Ohio State football player. It was later revealed that Tressel never forwarded the e-mails, nor the information contained in them about potential violations, to his school's compliance office or the NCAA. In December 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice notified Ohio State that that at least six current players, including Pryor, had traded team memorabilia for tattoos or cash at the parlor. A report from Sports Illustrated revealed that they had found evidence that the cash for memorabilia scandal dated back to Ohio State's 2002 national championship team, and that as many as 28 players were involved. Sports Illustrated also discovered allegations that Ohio State players had traded memorabilia for marijuana.\nRecords of roughly 50 cars owned by current and former Ohio State football players, including Pryor, were also investigated. Former Ohio State wide receiver Ray Small revealed that players were selling memorabilia and getting deals on cars that cost more than they could afford, stating that \u201cThey have a lot (of dirt) on everybody, cause everybody was doing it.\u201d Multiple media outlets including ESPN reported that Pryor was driving with a suspended license. Pryor was seen driving a Nissan 350Z to team meetings and workouts. Former Ohio State basketball player Mark Titus claimed that students at the university knew that Buckeye football players were driving cars they could not afford, stating \"you'd have to be blind to not notice it.\"\nNo, are you kidding? ... I'm just hoping the coach doesn't dismiss me.\nOhio State President Gordon Gee, when asked whether he would fire Tressel\nOn January 3, 2011, Tressel's email exchanges with Cicero were leaked to the university. On January 16, Tressel confessed that he had covered up the violations committed by the players. On March 8, Ohio State suspended Tressel for the first two games of the 2011 season and fined him $250,000 for not informing the university of",

    "\nThe Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to studying and denouncing initiatives of extremism and hate worldwide. Founded in 2020 by Heidi Beirich and Wendy Via, GPAHE utilizes research, advocacy, and education to expose extremist movements, their tactics, and their impacts.\nHistory and mission statement\nGPAHE was established in response to a growing international threat of extremism and hate speech. Recognizing the transnational nature of these movements, its stated goal is to create a global network to monitor, analyze, and counter extremist activities.\nThe organization's mission is to strengthen and educate a diverse global community committed to exposing and countering racism, bigotry, and hate, and associated violence; and to promote the human rights values that support flourishing, inclusive societies and democracies.\nActivities\nGPAHE's work focuses on several key areas:\nResearch: GPAHE conducts in-depth research on extremist groups, their ideologies, and their online activities.\nAdvocacy: The organization advocates for policy changes to address the root causes of extremism and to protect vulnerable communities.\nEducation: GPAHE provides educational resources and training to raise awareness about the dangers of extremism and to promote tolerance and understanding.\nReports\nExtremist groups in social media in Brazil\nThe GPAHE issued, in 2024, a report identifying over 20 active extremist groups in Brazil, many of which utilize social media platforms to spread hate speech. The report highlighted the lack of regulation and moderation on these platforms as a contributing factor to the growth of these groups. It specifically named groups like the Instituto Conservador-Liberal and the Liberal Party (PL) for promoting harmful content. It also detailed how these groups target vulnerable communities, particularly the LGBTQIA+ community, with hate speech and disinformation. The report further identified various extremist groups across different states in Brazil, detailing their online activities, ideologies, and the platforms they use to spread their messages. Additionally, it questioned the moderation policies of platforms like Meta, Google, and YouTube, raising concerns about their lack of action against these extremist groups.\nFar-eight extremism in Portugal\nA 2023 report by GPAHE identifies the Chega party as a central force in radical far-right movements in Portugal. The report compares Chega to groups like the Proud Boys and Hammerskins, highlighting its role in fostering a rhetoric of racism, anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments, anti-immigration, anti-Islam and anti-Roma discrimination. Chega, under the leadership of Andr\u00e9 Ventura, has increasingly dominated the far-right landscape, drawing comparisons to other European populist parties while aligning with nationalist, identitarian, and conspiratorial movements.\nThe report notes a rise in conspiracy and anti-government movements during the pandemic, which later aligned with Chega and similar groups. It highlights a significant increase in hate speech and far-right street mobilization accompanying Chega's rise, with a concerning level of racially motivated hate crimes and violence against women in Portugal. Additionally, the report points to the internationalization of Portuguese far-right extremism, influenced by neofascist and supremacist ideologies from other countries.\nChega's structure is described as highly centralized around Ventura, with the party's youth wing being even more radical, supporting white supremacy, misogyny, and fascism. The GPAHE emphasizes that Chega's rapid growth serves as a warning of the potential for far-right parties to quickly expand their influence.\nReport on Antisemitism and Extremism on X\nA 2023 report from GPAHE highlights the role of major figures like Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson in mainstreaming antisemitic conspiracy theories, particularly the \"great replacement\" theory, on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). This theory falsely claims a covert effort to replace white populations, often attributing this to Jewish people.\nDespite Musk's aggressive responses to critics, including suspending and reinstating extremist accounts, white nationalists and other far-right extremists have celebrated Musk's role in shifting the Overton Window on antisemitism. The GPAHE report underscores the significant increase in hate content and the alignment of prominent personalities with extremist views, further demonstrating the platform's growing role in fostering such narratives.\nThe GPAHE, co-founded by extremism expert Heidi Beirich, emphasizes the failure of X's moderation policies under Musk's ownership, noting that the platform has become one of the largest sites for hate content globally. This trend reflects the broader rise of rightwing extremism in the US, facilitated by influential social media platforms.\n",
    "2022 studio album by OGJB Quartet\nOde to O is the second album by the OGJB Quartet, a collaborative ensemble named after the first letters of the musicians' first names, featuring saxophonist Oliver Lake, cornetist Graham Haynes, double bassist Joe Fonda, and drummer Barry Altschul. Named after the title track, a tribute to Ornette Coleman, it was recorded on June 7 and 8, 2019, at Sear Sound Studios in New York City, and was released in 2022 by TUM Records.\nReception\nIn a review for All About Jazz, John Sharpe wrote: \"one of the most striking traits is how much they sound like a band... This is an outfit which merits a longer run than it may get given the difficulty of getting the four principals together.\"\nWill Layman of PopMatters stated: \"If 'vintage' sometimes means seeming old-fashioned or left behind, then these gentlemen demonstrate that fresh thinking is possible at any age. They play here with an exquisite connection to each other and to music history.\"\nWriting for Burning Ambulance, Phil Freeman commented: \"The mere fact that there's a second album by this group makes me happy. They've got a unique sound, based entirely on the interplay between the four members' personalities... there's a significant distance between what each of them does in other contexts. So listening to them cross those spaces to find somewhere to meet is what makes this music interesting.\"\nThe Big Takeover's Michael Toland remarked: \"These veteran heavy hitters bring all of their talents to bear on Ode to O... It would be extremely difficult for these players to create bad music in the first place, but it's clear on Ode to O the extra inspiration they take from each other's presence.\"\nIn an article for The Quietus, Peter Margasak noted that the musicians have found \"a bracing freebop sweet spot together,\" and wrote: \"there's an abiding equanimity to the proceedings, imbuing the performances with grace regardless of how fiery things might get... The themes are elegant and memorable, elastic enough to support some fiery blowing and rhythmic dissection.\"\nDaniel Spicer of Jazzwise praised the title track, calling it \"a deceptively conventional hard-bop swinger with a big-grinned joie de vivre,\" as well as \"Da Bang\" (dedicated to Billy Bang), which \"bursts out of an extended solo drum intro with an irresistible bass vamp heavy enough to establish its own gravitational field. Serious fun.\"\nThe New York City Jazz Record's George Kanzler also singled out the title track, on which Altschul and Fonda \"mesh, expanding and contracting rhythms like images in a kaleidoscope, Lake and Haynes trading and jamming lines, cornet floating long notes, alto bobbing and weaving, pinching a note, arpeggiating a string of them.\"\nA writer for Glide Magazine stated: \"OGJB take in both a wide swath of sound and emotion as they journey into startling, ever-unpredictable territory.... the spirit of Coleman's free expression prevails throughout, as if to form a more contemporary but less direct version of the acclaimed quartet Old and New Dreams... who directly channeled Coleman's music.\"\nGary Chapin of The Free Jazz Collective commented: \"I'm not going to call it effortless, but there's an ease to the group that comes from their decades of experience and the naturalness of their musical relationships. To me, OGJB represents a great time in the past, and a great time in the present.\"\nJon Garelick of The Arts Fuse selected the album as one of the ten best jazz releases of 2022.\nTrack listing\n\"Ode to O\" (Barry Altschul) \u2013 6:52\n\"Justice\" (Oliver Lake) \u2013 5:22\n\"Me without Bela\" (Joe Fonda) \u2013 12:24\n\"Da Bang\" (Barry Altschul) \u2013 9:06\n\"The Other Side\" (Graham Haynes) \u2013 6:55\n\"Caring\" (Barry Altschul) \u2013 4:56\n\"OGJB #3\" (Barry Altschul / Joe Fonda / Graham Haynes / Oliver Lake) \u2013 3:53\n\"Bass Bottom\" (Oliver Lake) \u2013 2:37\n\"OGJB #4\" (Barry Altschul / Joe Fonda / Graham Haynes / Oliver Lake) \u2013 5:10\n\"Apaixonado\" (Graham Haynes) \u2013 5:10\nPersonnel\nOliver Lake \u2013 alto saxophone\nGraham Haynes \u2013 cornet, electronics\nJoe Fonda \u2013 double bass\nBarry Altschul \u2013 drums, percussion\n",

He is professor at the Universit\u00e9 de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\nCareer\nYon entered the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Fontenay-Saint-Cloud in 1987, obtaining a master's degree in contemporary history with his study Les notaires parisiens sous le Second Empire (Parisian notaries during the Second Empire) which went on to win the Prix Favard de Langlade offered by the Institut international d\u2019histoire du notariat in 1993. His doctoral thesis examined Eug\u00e8ne Scribe, la fortune et la libert\u00e9 (Eug\u00e8ne Scribe, destiny and freedom) and was defended in January 1994 at the universit\u00e9 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne. Along with Jean-Christophe Keck, Robert Pourvoyer, Peter Hawig and Alain Fraison he was involved in the creation of the Offenbach Edition Keck, a new Offenbach critical edition to be published by Boosey & Hawkes and Bote & Bock. Yon, in his 2000 study, notably advanced understanding of Offenbach's place within the sociological history of his times. Yon took part in the 2004 documentary directed by G\u00e9rald Caillat The Missing Manuscript, about the textual history of Les Contes d'Hoffmann.\nPr\u00e9sident of the scientific committee of the 'Unit\u00e9 de formation et de recherche' (training and research unit) in Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universit\u00e9 de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (November 2006 to June 2010), he was elected in June 2009 to the council of UFR, then in October 2010 to the council of the Institut d\u2019\u00e9tudes culturelles (IEC) then the council of the Institut d\u2019\u00e9tudes culturelles et internationales (IECI).\nProfessor of contemporary history at the Universit\u00e9 de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (2012), in 2014 he became the Director of its Centre d\u2019histoire culturelle des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s contemporaines (Centre for cultural history of contemporary society). He was also responsible for projects with the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay from 1992 to 2006 and co-ordinator of twelve exhibition brochures from 1993 to 2000.\nAs 'Historien sp\u00e9cialiste de l'op\u00e9ra, \u00e9crivain, professeur des universit\u00e9s' Yon was awarded Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in the summer of 2021.\nPublications\nYon's preference is to work in collaboration with other fields \"in a multidisciplinary approach and to work with literature, musicology, language and theatrical studies specialists\". He believes that approaches can complement and enrich each other and at the heart of such a collaboration the historian must \"op\u00e9rer la mise en contexte des \u0153uvres\" (contextualize the works). In relation to Offenbach or Scribe he believes it preferable to confront them through history, literature, performing arts, musicology and law, in connection, for example, with censorship, or the right to whistle in theatres in the 19th century\u201d.\nJean-Claude Yon has organized many symposia and study-days as well as participating in radio broadcasts.

    "Agency for Chinese military law enforcement\nThe Political and Legal Affairs Commission of the Central Military Commission\" (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u4e2d\u592e\u519b\u4e8b\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u653f\u6cd5\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a) is a first-level functional agency of the Central Military Commission and a deputy theater-grade military unit. It is the main coordination and control organ for all matters related to military justice and law enforcement. It is based in Beijing.\nHistory\nIn 2007, the Central Military Commission ordered the establishment of Political and Legal Affairs Committees (\u653f\u6cd5\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a) in every PLA unit above the Corps grade, headed usually by the Secretary of Discipline Inspection Commission of the unit, as part of the accelerating campaign against corruption in the military. The CMC established a PLAC at the central level as well, and ordered intensive training on the management of legal affairs to all the involved officers. This generalization of party committee participation in legal enforcement in the PLA was the precursor of the later reforms.\nPost-2015 reforms\nMain article: 2015 People's Republic of China military reform\nAfter the 2015 military reforms, the committee was reorganized into the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Central Military Commission in January 2016. The commission was organized as a coordinating body, with a secretary and deputy secretary, and members appointed from the Chinese People's Liberation Army Military Court, Chinese People's Liberation Army Military Procuratorate, and the various bureaus of Political and Legal Commission itself.

    "Genus of parasitic worms\nParalongicollum is a genus in Acanthocephala, the thorny-headed worms, also known as spiny-headed worms.\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was described by Amin, Bauer & Sidorov, 1991. The National Center for Biotechnology Information does not indicate that any phylogenetic analysis has been published on any Paralongicollum species that would confirm its position as a unique order in the family Pomphorhynchidae.\nDescription\nParalongicollum species consist of a proboscis covered in hooks and a trunk. \nSpecies\nThe genus Paralongicollum contains three species.\nParalongicollum edmondsi (Golvan, 1969)\nParalongicollum nemacheili Amin, Bauer & Sidorov, 1991\nParalongicollum sergenti (Choquette & Gayot, 1952)\nDistribution\nThe distribution of Paralongicollum is determined by that of its hosts.\nHosts\nLife cycle of Acanthocephala.\nThe life cycle of an acanthocephalan consists of three stages beginning when an infective acanthor (development of an egg) is released from the intestines of the definitive host and then ingested by an arthropod, the intermediate host. Although the intermediate hosts of Paralongicollum are arthropods. When the acanthor molts, the second stage called the acanthella begins. This stage involves penetrating the wall of the mesenteron or the intestine of the intermediate host and growing. The final stage is the infective cystacanth which is the larval or juvenile state of an Acanthocephalan, differing from the adult only in size and stage of sexual development. The cystacanths within the intermediate hosts are consumed by the definitive host, usually attaching to the walls of the intestines, and as adults they reproduce sexually in the intestines. The acanthor is passed in the feces of the definitive host and the cycle repeats. There may be paratenic hosts (hosts where parasites infest but do not undergo larval development or sexual reproduction) for Paralongicollum.\nParalongicollum parasitizes animals. There are no reported cases of Paralongicollum infesting humans in the English language medical literature. P. sergenti might be a vector for another parasite in humans.\nHosts for Paralongicollum species\nThe Rainbow trout is a host for P. nemacheili.\nThe Tibetan stone loach is a host for P. nemacheili.\nNotes\n^ A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than Paralongicollum . It was originally described as Longicollum edmondsi by Golvan in 1969 before taking its current name in 2022 by Smales.\n^ A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than Paralongicollum . It was originally described as Tenuiproboscis sergenti by Choquette and Gayot in 1952 and then renamed to Longicollum sergenti by Golvan in 1969 before taking its current name in 1991 by Amin, Bauer & Sidorov, 1991\n^ There are no known aberrant human infections for Paralongicollum species.\n",
    "English-South African diplomat\nJohn Noel Reedman (24 December 1905 \u2013 20 May 1994) was an English-South African diplomat who was the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in Palestine. He had previously served as Senior Economic Advisor both to UNSCOP and the Palestine Commission. Reedman was a professor of economics at Witwatersrand University in South Africa.\nLife\nJohn Noel Reedman was born on 24 December 1905 in Kirkburton, Yorkshire, England. He gained a PhD in economics from Sheffield University. Reedman moved to South Africa and became a lecturer of economics in the Department of Commerce at the University of Witwatersrand in 1936. He was described as an \"outstanding teacher and scholar\" who had \"carried much of the lecturing burden of the department\"  He gave up his professorial functions in Johannesburg in January 1947 in order to join the staff of the United Nations.\nCareer\nAt the outset of his career with the United Nations, Reedman began his work on the issue of Palestine. Before the foundation of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), the UN Secretariat began accumulating knowledge and expertise on Palestine in early 1947 after the British government announced that it was referring the Palestine problem to the United Nations. Reedman was part of a five-member team assembled at the direction of Secretary-General Trygve Lie to collect this information. The team published five thick volumes containing a wealth of statistical information and various proposed solutions to the Palestine problem intended to support the members of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), which would later study the problem in the summer of 1947. Other prominent members of the team included Ralph Bunche, Constantin Stavropoulos, Alfonso Garcia Robles and Henri Vigier.\nReedman served as an economic advisor to UNSCOP. UNSCOP's members disagreed significantly on the issue of the proposed partition of Palestine, resulting in it submitting a majority and a minority report. The majority report recommended a partitioning which became the subject of General Assembly Resolution 181, while the minority report had argued for a federal state, in which an Arab majority would be maintained. Reedman, Bunche and Vigier, who had served in an advisory capacity to UNSCOP, unsuccessfully campaigned against the partition plan.\nFollowing the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 181, Reedman was recruited by Ralph Bunche to advise the ill-fated Palestine Commission, which was to implement the partition plan. The General Assembly relieved the Palestine Commission of its mandate on 14 May 1948 and appointed Count Folke Bernadotte as UN mediator under Resolution 186. He was appointed to broker a peace settlement and find a solution to the Palestine question after the Commission proved unable to quell the civil war that had broken out following the adoption of the partition plan on 29 November 1947. Reedman was appointed by the Secretary General as his Special Representative in Palestine in 1948. During this time he and his staff were based in Tel Aviv and he acted as one of Folke Bernadotte's closest advisors.\nAfter Bernadotte's assassination in 1948, the UN General Assembly decided to set up the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine (UNCCP)  with the aim of mediating the Arab-Israeli conflict. Reedman continued his involvement on the issue of the disposition of movable and immovable property belonging to Arab refugees who could not return to their homes.\nReedman became Principal Secretary of the Clapp Mission  of the UN's Economic Survey Mission for the Middle East, which became known as the \"Clapp Mission\", named after its chairman, Gordan R. Clapp. It's report was issued on 28 December 1949.\nIn 1953 the UNCCP sent Reedman to visit the capitals of various Arab countries to negotiate the issue of blocked Arab accounts in Israel. He spent nearly two months attempting to reconcile Israel and Jordan. One of the commission's major accomplishments was the release of about 6000 Arab refugee accounts in Israeli banks. The accounts had been blocked in 1948 by the Israeli government which provided for the freezing of absentee property.\nIn 1959, Reedman was appointed the Director of the United Nations Information Centre in London. Reedman published the article \"The United Nations and Economic Development\" in 1961 in the journal International Relations while still in his capacity as Director of the UN Information Centre in London.\nDeath\nReedman died on 20 May 1994 in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England.\n",
    "Example of a form of transport on the Main\nChain boat navigation on the Main was a special type of ship transport on the Main from 1886 to 1936. Along a chain laid in the river, chain boats pulled themselves upstream with several barges attached. The technology of chain shipping replaced the previous practice of towed shipping, in which the ships were pulled by horses.\nModel of the Bavarian chain boat K.B.K.S. Nr. V\nAs the canalisation project progressed upstream, the barrages required for this made chain towage more challenging, particularly due to the extended waiting times at the locks. This led to the emergence of a new competitor in the form of the propeller, which was made possible by the greater depth of the navigation channel. The use of diesel engines made the propeller a profitable option. The use of steam engines for the labour-intensive chain navigation became unprofitable, and this method was completely discontinued in 1936.\nHistory\nMain article: Chain boat navigation\nBefore chain boat navigation\nThe Main River has a relatively gentle gradient. Until the mean water level correction in the middle of the 19th century, the river was a slow-flowing shallow watercourse with numerous loops, bends, islands and, on occasion, several shallow river arms in close proximity to one another. In contrast, the occurrence of strong floods, particularly during the autumn and spring months, resulted in the flooding of areas, the erosion of riverbanks and sedimentation. Conversely, during the summer months, the water level in the channels, which were typically only half a metre deep, decreased to a few centimetres, resulting in the formation of shallows and sandbanks.\nUpstream, the ship trains were towed by line riders. A typical train consisted of a chain of wooden vessels, each with a carrying capacity of 15 to 30 tonnes. They usually began with a Frankensau or a market boat and continued via Schelche, Schlumper and Nachen to the smallest vessel, the Ankernachen. The towpath often changed banks before the mouths of the tributaries or before steep slopes. At these points, horses and riders had to cross the navigation channel or be ferried across. Downstream, the ships drifted in the water current. Sails were set when the wind was favourable. The cost of towing the mostly empty or lightly loaded ships was high. Therefore, profit could usually only be made when the fairway was sufficiently deep and with fully loaded ships travelling downstream.\nIn 1828, the Stadt Frankfurt was the inaugural paddle steamer to traverse the Main between Mainz and Frankfurt. However, the venture was unsuccessful due to design flaws in the steam engine and the challenging navigation conditions in the heavily silted Main estuary. The trials were terminated as early as 1832. It was not until 1841, following the Free City of Frankfurt's accession to the German Customs Union and the completion of the Taunus Railway line from Frankfurt to Wiesbaden, that steam navigation on the Main resumed. However, it was unable to establish itself for several reasons. Firstly, the unfavourable fairways of the Main at low water levels during the summer months presented a challenge for steamboats with their relatively large draught, particularly given that the promised fairway improvements from the Bavarian state were not implemented to the desired extent. Secondly, the railway, which was constructed at the same time, was more efficient than steamships. It was able to travel at faster speeds and had shorter routes. The waterway from Mainz to Schweinfurt was 88 per cent longer. Furthermore, the railway was able to bypass customs offices, eliminating the need for lengthy waiting periods. It was also exempt from customs duties and tariffs, reducing its financial burden. As early as 1858, the unprofitability of steam navigation with paddle steamers led to the discontinuation of this mode of transport.\nThe time of chain boats on the Main\nChain boat tow on the Main (ca. 1896)\nChain boat of the Mainkette-AG in front of the \"Mainkai\" in Frankfurt\nAfter navigation on the Main had lost more and more of its transport capacity to the railway and the use of wheeled steam tugs had failed due to the shallow navigation channel of the Main, Heino Held, owner of the Mainz-based forwarding and coal trading company C.J.H. Held & Cie., had the idea of saving navigation by introducing chain tug navigation. On 15 February 1871, he applied to the authorities in Prussia, Bavaria and Hesse for a corresponding licence, encouraged by the companies that had just started up on the Elbe. In 1872, the various states and towns along the Main then established a committee in Aschaffenburg. The committee was supported by Ewald Bellingrath, who had already played a leading role in the introduction of chain navigation on the Elbe and Neckar rivers. The committee discussed the merits of chain shipping and the canalisation of the Main. Mainz, which was part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, was in fav",
    "\n2024 EP by Nayeon\nNa is the upcoming second extended play by South Korean singer Nayeon of the girl group Twice, set to be released through JYP Entertainment and Republic Records on June 14, 2024. The EP contains seven tracks, including the lead single \"ABCD\" and collaborations with singers Sam Kim and Julie from Kiss of Life. It aims to showcase a stronger and more mature side of the singer, incorporating hip hop, dance, and sporty elements.\nBackground and release\nNayeon launched her solo career with her first EP, Im Nayeon, in June 2022. The EP peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200. Its lead single, \"Pop!\", became \"a summer hit\" on domestic streaming charts, including the Circle Digital Chart, where it peaked at number two. On April 9, 2024, South Korean news outlet Xsports News reported that Nayeon was preparing for a new release in June. JYP Entertainment responded that no release date had been decided yet. Subsequently, on May 13, it was announced that her new release would be released on June 14, 2024, with the release of a logo motion at midnight alongside a poster containing the phrase \"How to Fall in Love with Na\". Following the announcement, the company released a series of concept images from May 20 to 30, 2024.\nOn May 24, JYP released a teaser for her upcoming solo lead single \"ABCD\", set to be simultaneously released with the EP Na. The teaser featured a spoiler of the track, which is a hip hop-influenced pop dance track with the opening line, \"Hey listen to me now\". The lyrics, written by Rick Bridges and Park Jin-young, use the alphabet creatively to convey a message about teaching and tempting a love interest. The song was composed and arranged by Pdogg.\nConception and title\nOn May 24, 2024, as her magazine feature, Nayeon appeared in a Cosmopolitan pictorial with a \"fresh summer vibe.\" In her interview, she highlighted her second record, Na, noting it shows a stronger and more mature side, with hip-hop and sporty elements. She explained, \"If the first album contained the image that many people think of me when they see me, I wanted to show a different side of me in the second album. You can expect a strong and mature appearance, whether in performance or vocals. It has a hip-hop feel, and also a sporty yet sexy feel. It was another challenge because it was a dance style that Twice had never done before.\" The album title represents Nayeon's 'I' and conveys the message \"Me! Only me!\", in contrast to her first mini album, 'Im Nayeon,' which highlighted \"I am Nayeon\" with a near-identical spelling of the artist's last name. This album boldly emphasizes Nayeon's determination to reveal only her authentic self.\nTrack listing\nRelease history\n",
    "\nDemtel International (commonly shortened to Demtel) was an Australian home shopping and marketing company best known for television informercials during the 1990s. The name Demtel was a portmanteau of \"demonstration television\". As well as launching the media career of presenter Tim Shaw, Demtel's ubiquitous presence on commercial television during its peak saw the name as well as various marketing tactics and slogans used by the company being adopted as tropes in Australian vernacular.\nHistory\nDemtel International was first registered as an Australian company in 1985, founded by Warwick Doughty and David Hammer, who had formerly worked with the local subsidiary of international marketing company K-tel. During the early 1980s, the Demtel name had been used to market a catalogue of compilation albums, working with artists including Gene Pierson and minor record companies. Pierson was encouraged by David Hammer to come up with \"something really crazy\", resulting in the 1983 album Beatle Barkers. On the back of Demtel's television marketing campaign the novelty album, consisting of tracks by The Beatles performed by an ensemble of dogs, sold 860,000 copies.\nIn 1988, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs took Demtel International to court over misleading advertisements that misrepresented plastic costume jewellery as genuine, valuable items. The company, which sold more than 70,000 units of the stock was fined $12,000. Despite this, the company recorded sales of $6.9 million in 1989\u201390, a figure which grew to $19.6 million in 1992-93 even as the nation endured an economic recession.\nBetween 1992 and 1995, Tim Shaw presented Demtel's infomercials, which received as much as 23 minutes of air-time per day. Demtel had seen the success of Ron Popeil's infomercials in the United States that used phrases like \"But wait, there's more!\" to great effect. In Shaw, they had an Australian to become the face of the company and deliver the same lines. This proved to be highly effective, driving sales of over 1,000,000 steak knives and 600,000 compact discs during his time with the company, while Shaw himself gained national fame and recognition as \"the Demtel man\". In 1994 it was reported the company spent around $10 million per year on TV advertising.\nIn July 1993, Demtel was sold by Hammer and Doughty to International Media Management (IMM), an ASX listed company with intentions of developing it into a stand-alone cable TV home shopping network. Within a year of sale, reports emerged of late payments to creditors by Demtel and legal disputes with the previous owners, causing IMM's share price to plummet. Amid ongoing legal disputes between IMM and the former owners relating to royalties and commissions, Shaw parted ways with Demtel in 1995. He was replaced by veteran talk-show host Don Lane. Shaw revealed in 2019 that despite the company's success during his time as their spokesman, he received only $200 from Demtel for each informercial he appeared in.\nIn November 1995, IMM launched The Value Channel on the Galaxy subscription television service, with Lane signed to host some of the programming. With IMM now focussing on this venture, Demtel's popularity waned in the late 1990s, competing with the rise of online services and emergence of dedicated home shopping networks. The company was wound down and liquidated in 2001.\nAn investigation by the Australian Federal Police into IMM's Chief Executive Officer Michael Milne would result in his conviction for tax fraud and money laundering in 2008. These charges related to a 13-year period, including falsifying his personal tax returns while in charge of Demtel. In November 2010, he was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison.\nProducts and marketing\nDemtel's business model involved purchasing bulk quantities of products, which it marketed by a telephone-order home shopping service, directly handling distribution from a central warehouse via regular post. Products were sold with a \"no questions asked, money back guarantee\", and were often bundled to create extra value and urgency. A common offer involved the inclusion of six free steak knives if the customer called within 15 minutes of the infomercial airing on television.\nProducts marketed by Demtel included kitchen knives, compact disc collections, pocket cameras, run-free pantyhose and other kitchen utensils. The infomercials themselves were usually between one and two minutes and included demonstrations of the product. Demtel's model was effective at creating consumer demand, but this left it vulnerable to competition from discount retailers who could stock the same products. This allowed discount retailers to quickly respond by undercutting Demtel's prices in store and making products immediately available to customers.\nCultural impact\nPolitics\nUse of \"Demtel\", often in a disparaging way became a popular trope in Australian politics. Usually, this is a reference to empty spin or election sweeteners. Demte",
    "Spanish footballer and referee\nFrancisco Campos Sant\u00edn (8 August 1912 \u2013 Unknown) was a Spanish footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Real Madrid and Sevilla FC. He later became a referee, overseeing several matches in the first and second divisions between 1949 and 1957.\nPlaying career\nBorn on 8 August 1912 in Madrid, Campos began his football career in 1931, at the age of 19, in his hometown club Imperio CF, which was a team made up of students and civil guards, but it also served as a subsidiary and youth team of Real Madrid. In his first season at the club, he stood out among his teammates, which included Avelino \u00c1lvarez, and helped Imperio become champions of Spain in its category, so he was signed in 1932 by Real Madrid, where he had few chances, mostly due to the presence of the great Ricardo Zamora. He appears as a reserve for the squad between 1932 and 1936, and only played 2 official matches in the first team as a goalkeeper, one of which in the 1934\u201335 La Liga, an away fixture against Valencia CF on 27 January, conceding only once in a 4\u20131 win. Despite having little to no playing time, Campos remained loyal to Madrid for four years until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1939, Campos returned to Imperio CF, where he played one season under coach Jos\u00e9 Quirante, featuring alongside Ram\u00f3n Col\u00f3n and Cuestita, but they were not able to avoid relegation to the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. Campos then played one season in both Sporting de Gij\u00f3n and Sevilla FC before retiring in the latter in 1942, at the age of 30.\nRefereeing career\nIn 1949, seven years after hanging up his boots, Campos became an official football referee, and between 1949 and 1957, he oversaw several matches in the first and second divisions, occasionally in the Spanish Cup, and even one promotion match to 1st division in 1953. Notably, he refereed two matches between Valencia and Real Sociedad, one in 1952 and the other in 1954, and Valencia netted four goals in both of them. In the only match with Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a that he refereed, the club suffered resounding defeat of 2\u20138 to Athletic Bilbao.\nThe date of his death is unknown.\nSee also\nList of Real Madrid CF players\n",

After Mishustin's consultations with the parliamentary factions, the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party, A Just Russia \u2013 For Truth and New People also expressed support for Mishustin.\nThe Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, after meeting with Mishustin, said that his faction would abstain from voting. According to Zyuganov, the communists have prepared proposals for the work of the future government, and the party will be ready to support Mishustin only if he confirms his readiness to implement them.\nIn accordance with the current version of the Constitution, the State Duma, in addition to the Prime Minister, will have to approve all deputy Prime ministers and most federal ministers. Their candidacies must be nominated by the Prime Minister after his appointment and approval of the Cabinet structure. At the same time, the Ministers of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Justice and Emergency Situations are nominated and appointed by the President after consultations with the Federation Council.\nState Duma confirmation\nPrime Minister\nMishustin at his confirmation hearing on 10 May 2024\nMikhail Mishustin was confirmed as Prime Minister on 10 May 2024.\nDeputy Prime Ministers\nState Duma held hearings on candidates for the positions of Deputy Prime Ministers and confirmed them on 13 May 2024.\nFederal Ministers\nState Duma held hearings for the positions of Federal Ministers and confirmed them on 14 May 2024.\nFederation Council consultations\nOn May 14, 2024, the Federation Council held hearings on the proposed candidates for the posts of Ministers of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Justice and Emergency Situations.

    "German politician (born 1952)\nAxel Viehweger (born 27 November 1952) is a German housing cooperative functionary and former politician.\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as Minister for Construction, Urban Development and Housing of the GDR in the cabinet of Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re.\nLife and career\nEarly career\nViehweger attended the Extended Secondary School (EOS) and completed his high school diploma.\nFrom 1973 to 1978, he studied Energy Engineering and Nuclear Physics at the Dresden University of Technology, which he completed a with a degree in physics (Dipl.-Phys.). He then worked at the university's Institute of Energetics, from 1984 to 1985 as a research associate. He obtained his doctorate (Dr.-Ing.) in 1985 on the topic \"A Contribution to Determining 'Favorable' Hydraulic Operating Regimes for Hot Water District Heating Networks in Emergency Conditions or Planned Shutdowns\".\nBloc party politician\nViehweger joined the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD), an East German bloc party beholden to the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED), in 1970.\nParallel to his academic career, Viehweger became active in local politics. From 1979 to 1985, he was a member of the District Assembly of Dresden-West. From 1981 to 1985, he additionally was chairman of the Dresden-West LDPD and from 1986 to 1990, chairman of the Dresden LDPD.\nIn 1985, he was made full-time city councilor (member of the municipal government) for energy of Dresden, a position he held until 1990. He later described his work there as \"Saving electricity, distributing coal\".\nde Maizi\u00e8re Government\nAfter the Wende, the LDP, its new name after being renamed in February 1990, joined forces with the other liberal parties in the GDR to form the Association of Free Democrats (BFD). Viehweger became a member of the executive committee of the BFD.\nFrom April to September 1990, Viehweger served as the last Minister for Construction, Urban Development and Housing in the cabinet of Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re. Despite the BFD leaving the government coalition in July 1990, Viehweger remained minister.\nAs Minister, Viehweger was mainly tasked with renovating the crumbling cities and introducing market economy principles in this sector, including liberalizing the construction industry and creating a free housing market. Of the approximately 4,500 employees, almost 90% were laid off or outsourced to other institutions. The numerous research institutes assigned to the ministry, such as the GDR Construction Academy, were either be dissolved or transferred to other legal entities by 3 October 1990. The housing construction combines, which were also under the responsibility of the ministry, were taken over by the Treuhandanstalt.\nHe resigned from his position on 28 September 1990, following the disclosure of allegations of now disproven collaboration with the Stasi under the pseudonym \"Jens Grabowski,\" as well as the recommendation for immediate resignation. As a city councilor in Dresden, he is said to have maintained contacts with the Stasi. Viehweger admitted this, but denied having signed an IM declaration and passing on documents.\nReunified Germany\nDespite the allegations, he remained the lead candidate of the Saxon FDP for the inaugural state election on 14 October 1990.\nDuring the first legislative period, he was a member of the Saxon State Parliament from 1990, elected from the state list of the FDP. According to a report in the S\u00e4chsische Zeitung on 13 November 1990, Viehweger was on leave from his parliamentary mandate until March 1991 \"at the request of the FDP parliamentary group and after a conversation with the FDP federal chairman Graf Lambsdorff\" until the Stasi allegations against him were clarified.\nOn 4 November 1991, Viehweger was expelled from the parliamentary group. Subsequently, he resigned from the FDP and remained a member of the state parliament as an independent member for the rest of the legislative period ending in 1994.\nAlready during the legislative period, Viehweger began working in various positions in the housing industry. From 2000 to 2002 he was head of the Central and Eastern Europe working group of CECODHAS (Association of the European Social Housing Industry). From 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2019, Viehweger was director and board member of the Association of Saxon Housing Cooperatives.\nOn 11 October 2022, Viehweger was elected chairman of the Volkssolidarit\u00e4t Dresden e.V. He currently lives in Berlin-Wilhelmsruh.\n",
    "Former lifeboat station in Anglesey, Wales\nLlanddwyn Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station, located on Ynys Llanddwyn, a small tidal island near the village of Newborough, Anglesey, on the south west coast of Anglesey, Wales.\nA lifeboat was first placed here by the Caernarvon Harbour Trust from 1826 to 1836. A lifeboat station (Station No.5) was formally created here by the Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (AAPLS) in 1840.\nLlanddwyn Lifeboat Station was closed in 1907.\nHistory\nA row of cottages sit on Landdwyn island, once the home of the shipping Pilots, who would guide vessels up the Menai Strait. A lifeboat was placed there by the Caernafon Harbour Trust in 1826, the intention being that the Pilots could man the lifeboat if required. In practice, there were usually too few of them available to launch the boat, although there is some indication that one or two rescues took place. The boat was removed to Caernarfon sometime around 1835 or 1836, where there were more crew available.\nThe AAPLS was founded by the Rev. James and Mrs Frances Williams in 1828. They had witnessed the loss of 140 lives from the wreck of the vessel Alert in 1823, and spent the following five years raising funds and gaining support.\nIn 1840, a 26-foot lifeboat costing \u00a365, built by Taylor of Limehouse, London, was purchased by the AAPLS and stationed at Llanddwyn. A 32-foot long boathouse was constructed, and four extra men from nearby Newborough village were enrolled.\nOnly one year later, on 18 October 1841, the lifeboat was called to the Mountaineer, on passage from Rio de la Hache to Caernarfon, ashore on the North Bank, 2 miles from Llanddwyn. One boy was lost, but the lifeboat rescued the Master, his wife, three children and 12 crew. Coxswain Griffith Griffiths was awarded the Silver Medal.\nThe Heywood, on passage from Africa to Liverpool, was wrecked on North Bank on the 7 February 1846. The Llanddwyn lifeboat rescued all 22 crew.\nIn rough seas on 16 September 1847, the lifeboat was capsized and washed ashore, whilst on call to the Soane of Boston. Crew member William Owen was drowned. The lifeboat crew righted the boat, set out again, and rescued all the crew of the Soane.\nThe AAPLS handed over the management of all their stations to the RNLI in 1855.In 1861, the RNLI ordered the construction of a new boathouse, costing \u00a3130, and provided an unnamed 30-foot 6-oared self-righting \"pulling and sailing\" (P&S) lifeboat (one with oars and sails), costing \u00a3154. The boat was launched just three times in a 5-year period, but would rescue 29 lives. In an unusual service on 27 November 1864, the lifeboat went to the aid of the Devonshire of Liverpool. She was unable to progress, with 17 crew members ill. Five lifeboatmen went aboard, and helped take the vessel to Liverpool, arriving there the following day.\nLLanddwyn would get another new boat in 1866. Built by Woolfe of Shadwell, it was a 32-foot self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, which cost \u00a3258-10s-0d, but was transported to Caernarfon free of charge by the London and North Western Railway company. The boat was paraded through the town to the harbour, where it was named John Gray Bell, before being launched and rowed to her station across the Menai Strait.\nOn 14 February 1867, the John Gray Bell went to the aid of the barque James Campbell, on passage from Demerara, British Guiana to Liverpool, which had run aground on the North Bank. 11 crew were rescued. On station for 19 years, John Gray Bell would be launched 18 times, and rescued 37 lives.\nThe last boat to serve at LLanddwyn was the Richard Henry Gould (ON 66). A 34-foot 10-oared self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, built by Forrestt of Limehouse, London, and costing \u00a3327. The boat arrived in Llanddwyn on 29 October 1885.\nThe Richard Henry Gould would serve at Llanddwyn for 22 years. Launched just  10 times on service in that time, and with only two lives saved, the end was in sight for Llanddwyn. Ultimately though, the Llanddwyn station would be closed, but for the same reason as it was in 1836 - it was becoming increasingly difficult to find crew for this remote location. Llanddwyn Lifeboat Station was formally closed in 1907.\nRichard Henry Gould (ON 66) was retired from service and broken up in 1907. The 1861 boathouse is still standing.\nRoll of honour\nIn memory of those lost whilst serving Llanddwyn lifeboat.\nOn service to the fully-rigged vessel Soane on 16 September 1847\nWilliam Owen, crew member\nLlanddwyn lifeboats\n^ ON is the RNLI's Official Number of the boat.\nSee also\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\nNotes\n^ Non-self-righting lifeboat, built by Skelton of Scarborough, North Yorkshire\n^ 27-foot 6-oared non-self-righting Palmer-type lifeboat, built by Taylor of Limehouse\n^ 30-foot 6-oared Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat\n^ 32-foot 10-oared Self-righting (P",

    "Shanghai-based fashion label\nShushu/Tong, also stylized as SHUSHU/TONG, is a Shanghai-based fashion label founded in 2015 by designers Liushu Lei and Yutong Jiang. Its design sensibility is inspired by girlhood, nostalgia, and retro anime and films.\nHistory\nFounders Liushu Lei and Yutong Jiang were both born in Chengdu and attended the same high school. Both Lei and Jiang were inspired by the anime Nana to become designers, although Jiang was briefly interested in becoming a cartoonist before realizing she preferred fashion. The two met at Shanghai's Donghua University when studying fashion in 2014. The two went on to acquire MA degrees at London College of Fashion, where the two were flatmates and first conceived of the brand. Lei spent time interning with Simone Rocha, and Jiang with Gareth Pugh. After a failing to acquire a visa to stay in London, Shushu/Tong was officially founded in 2015 in Shanghai. The label's name is a combination of Lei's nickname, Shushu, and Jiang's given name, Yutong. The first physical Shushu/Tong store opened in July 2022 in Shanghai JC Plaza.\nLei is the creative director of the brand, while Jiang is more involved on the marketing and client side, although she also has input on the design process. Their first sales were made on Chinese social media platform WeChat, before the brand was picked up by other stockists; social media has been an avenue which allowed their brand to grow despite not being located in a traditional fashion capital like Paris. The brand has collaborated with Asics and Charles & Keith, for footwear, local brand Yvmin for a line of jewelry, and Est\u00e9e Lauder for holiday cosmetic gift sets. The brand's collaboration with Est\u00e9e Lauder was noted as the first time a global brand had collaborated with a Chinese fashion brand.\nDesign and influences\nShushu/Tong is noted for its hyper-feminine style, having been compared to the coquette aesthetic trend, soft girl subculture and Lolita fashion. The brand was noted for predating the trend of hyper-girly clothing after 2020. Their designs often incorporate girly elements like frills, bows, ribbons, and pearls, as well as gingham and pastel fabric. Works that have inspired collections include the Aim for the Ace!, The Virgin Suicides, Gigi, and the protagonists of magical girl anime such as Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Cardcaptor Sakura. The founders named Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Tina Chow as muses, and Faye Wong as a perennial inspiration as well as celebrity they would like to dress someday.\nShushu/Tong is one of some rising Chinese fashion brands associated with guochao (Chinese: \u56fd\u6f6e; pinyin: Gu\u00f3 ch\u00e1o), a fashion trend among younger Chinese shoppers to prefer homegrown designers which incorporate aspects of Chinese history and culture.\nJiang also serves as a muse for Lei, as she models items and provides early feedback, giving a woman's perspective to Lei's designs. This may have contributed to criticism against the brand for its limited range of body shapes.\n",
    "\nPolitician and mayor of Bamban, Tarlac since 2022\nIn this Philippine name, the middle name or maternal  family name is Leal and the surname or paternal family name is Guo.\nAlice Leal Guo (Chinese: \u90ed\u83ef\u840d) is a businesswoman and politician in the Philippines serving as the current mayor of the municipality of Bamban, Tarlac, since June 30, 2022.\nIn a Senate Committee inquiry, Guo was alleged by Senators Risa Hontiveros and Win Gatchalian to have links to illegal activities by Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs) following raids in Bamban in 2023 and 2024. Her Filipino citizenship has also been questioned and is now being investigated due to inconsistencies in her documents and testimony.\nPersonal life\nBirth and ancestry\nDetails of Guo's early life and educational background are disputed. Guo states that she was born at her home, whose location she does not recall, or, according to her birth certificate, in Barangay Matatalaib in the then-municipality of Tarlac, on July 12, 1986. She asserts that her father is an ethnic Chinese and was 70 years old as of 2024, but discrepancies regarding his citizenship was indicated by differing documents. While his birth certificate identifies him as Filipino under the name Angelito Guo, his business records list him as a Chinese citizen named Jian Zhong Guo, born in 1958. Guo's mother's identity is also under question, with her identity as a Filipino housemaid named Amelia Leal Guo, based on Guo's claim and birth certificate, or a Chinese businesswoman named Lin Wen Yi (born 1971), based on sources in Valenzuela. Guo claimed to be her father's illegitimate child with the former, resulting in her being raised by her father in seclusion on a pig farm in Tarlac City. However, discrepancies arose when the birth certificates of Guo, Shiela Leal Guo (born 1984), and Siemen Leal Guo (born 1988 or 1990) revealed inconsistent ages of Angelito and Amelia Guo at the time of their children's birth, along with their marriage in the then-municipality of Tarlac on two different dates: October 14, 1982, and January 21, 1987. Furthermore, the couple was found to have no existing birth and marriage records in the Philippine Statistics Authority. Guo initially denied knowing Shiela and Siemen Guo, but Bureau of Immigration records suggest they had traveled abroad together. She later confirmed that both are her siblings, albeit paternal half, despite their birth certificates suggesting they are full siblings. Meanwhile, Jian Zhong Guo and Lin Wen Yi are co-incorporators of multiple businesses alongside Guo and claimed a similar address in Balintawak, Quezon City, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission and Bureau of Internal Revenue, respectively.\nAdditionally, an archived post on Bamban's official website showed Guo referring to Patrizia Josephine Nuguid Santos, a public relations expert working for her since 2022, as her mother in a greeting. However, observers noted a lack of resemblance between them, suggesting a non-familial relationship.\nEarly life and education\nSome residents of Bamban, including those from barangay Virgen de los Remedios, said that Guo lived and grew up there, adding that she also has a sibling. Guo has stated that her family raised pigs for a living and that she grew up on a farm. She also claimed to have spent her teenage life in Concepcion, Tarlac. Furthermore, registration records of her companies showed that she had residency in Marilao, Bulacan, and Valenzuela, Metro Manila, citing her parents' embroidery business in the latter. However, it was revealed that no such business existed, and her listed home address in Valenzuela belonged to a certain Bayle family, according to Senator Win Gatchalian.\nGuo stated during a testimony at a joint Philippine Senate Committee investigation that she was homeschooled. However, her birth was only registered when she was 17 or 19 years old, casting doubts on her early life due to the absence of hospital birth records and her inability to identify her homeschool provider. The lack of traditional educational records prompted inquiries into the nature of her education, including whether she pursued college. Her failure to recall details of her birth and early life during the Senate inquiry led to online ridicule, with her being dubbed My Amnesia Girl (a locally-produced film from 2010) in a popular meme.\nResidency\nAccording to Guo's Certificate of Candidacy for Mayor filed before the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) in 2021, she declared herself unmarried and claimed lifelong residency in the Philippines, residing at her registered address in Bamban for 18 years by that time. It was revealed that she registered as a voter of Bamban in April 2021, just 13 months before the 2022 general elections, while COMELEC spokesperson John Rex Laudiangco said that she had registered in 2018. She also claimed to have held a Philippine passport, the only one she possesses, since when she was between 17 and 19 years old.\nMiscel",

    "Migrant labour originating from North Korea\nEthnic group\nNorth Korean migrant workers are a significant source of finances for the North Korean state. Often working in hard labour fields such as construction, logging, textile production, or mining, migrant workers' conditions have been frequently described by human rights activists as a modern-day form of slavery. North Korean labourers are frequently found in China, Russia, and the Gulf states, although they are also located in other countries.\nOverview\nNorth Korea began formally sending migrant workers abroad in 1967, following the signing of an agreement between the North Korean government and the Soviet Union which allowed North Koreans to work at logging camps in the Russian Far East. North Korean labour exports increased during the 2000s and peaked during the early 2010s, as part of an effort by the North Korean government to acquire foreign hard currencies. With the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, most migrant labourers were left stranded in their home countries as a result of stringent anti-pandemic protocols instituted by the North Korean government. Three-year contracts, typical for migrant labourers, were extended to as long as seven years.\nMigrant workers have reportedly rioted on multiple instances, in contrast to tightly controlled North Korea. Of particular note was a January 2024 protest against non-payment of wages and working conditions in China, which allegedly involved as many as 3,000 factory labourers. Labourers are governed by the External Construction Guidance Bureau, part of the Ministry of Social Security.\nConditions\nAnti-slavery non-governmental organisation Walk Free has criticised the overseas labour programme as being part of \"state-imposed forced labour on a mass scale\". Workers' payment is frequently withheld or collected by the North Korean government, and injuries or fatalities caused by work accidents are frequent. Aidan McQuade, director of human rights group Anti-Slavery International, further said that descriptions of working conditions indicate \"state-sponsored trafficking for forced labour\". According to defector Kim Joo-il, 70% of salary is taken by the government directly, with an additional 20% being paid to the government, obstenstibly as fees for food and housing. Other defectors have argued against this, stating that labourers will receive 10% of their pay only in \"very extreme\" circumstances.\nMigrant workers by country or region\nBelarus\nAn unknown number of North Korean migrant workers are present in Belarus. According to the pro-government BelNovosti portal, North Korean migrant labourers have participated in construction or reconstruction of several buildings in Belarusian capital of Minsk, such as the Independence Palace, the Belarus Hotel\u00a0. A high-level agreement between the North Korean and Belarusian governments in 2014 established greater opportunities for migrant labourers to work in Belarus.\nChina\nChina hosts the largest amount of North Korean migrant workers, estimated at 80,000 by the East\u2013West Center and National Committee on North Korea in 2019. Most North Korean migrant labourers in China work in textiles and garments, though many also work in the food processing industry, particularly in seafood processing. Several of their products are exported to United States retailers such as Walmart and ShopRite.\nGulf states\nAside from Russia and China, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf are among the largest employers of North Korean migrant labour; Kuwait had 5,000 North Korean workers in the country in 2019. Labourers from North Korea participated in a 2017 construction project on Al Dhafra Air Base, a joint United Arab Emirates air base hosting the 380th Air Expeditionary Wing of the United States Air Force, and multiple restaurants run by the North Korean government also operate in the country.\nNorth Korean migrant labourers were heavily involved in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The Qatari government reported in 2014 that 2,800 North Koreans were involved in the construction of facilities for the World Cup, though it denied media reports that North Koreans were working in conditions of slavery.\nOman expelled 300 of 380 North Korean migrant workers in December 2016.\nMongolia\nMongolia has historically been one of the top employers of North Korean migrant labour and among the few democracies to use labourers, drawing criticism from human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch. In response to increased pressure from the United Nations, Mongolia began refusing to renew visas for workers in 2017, vowing to send the remainder home by the end of 2018. Prior to being expelled, many North Koreans worked in construction, and made roughly \u20ae400,000 monthly in comparison to the \u20ae600,000 average monthly wage of Mongolian workers.\nPoland\nNorth Korean migrant labour in Poland has been a source of continued controversy, and a small group of workers remained in the country by mid-2017, despite several att",
    "1999 crime novel by Australian author Barry Maitland\nThe Chalon Heads is a 1999 crime novel by the Australian author Barry Maitland.\nIt was the fourth novel in the author's Brock and Kola series of novels.\nSynopsis\nThe young wife of ex-criminal Sammy Startling has been kidnapped and the ransom note was decorated with Chalon Head stamps of the young Queen Victoria. These stamps are both rare and valuable and detectives Kathy Killa and David Brock go to Cabot's philately store to meet Startling and investigate the crime.\nPublishing history\nAfter its initial publication in Australia by Allen and Unwin in 1999, it was reprinted as follows:\n1999, UK, Orion\n2000, Australia, Allen and Unwin\n2000, UK, Orion\n2001, USA, Arcade\n2002, USA, Penguin\n2007, Australia, Allen and Unwin\n2010, USA, Felony & Mayhem Press\nThe novel was also translated into Russian in 2008.\nEpigraph\nEpigraph: \"Philately: The term was coined in 1864 by a Frenchman, Georges Herpin, who invented it from the Greek philos, 'love', and ateleia, 'that which is tax-free'. Britannica Online, 1997.\"\nCritical reception\nA reviewer in The Canberra Tmes noted: \"This is a very carefully crafted crime novel that is rich in detail and interesting minor characters. The plotting is suitably serpentine and Maitland keeps us on our toes with some very unexpected turns. The plot unfolds at a good pace, helped along by a couple of well-staged chase scenes and a particularly grisly discovery...Stamp collectors will also probably find the philatelic detail interesting and there is even an Australian angle in the form of the three Chalon Head stamps from Van Diemen's Land which are central to the plot...Overall The Chalon Heads is very good, although Brock lacks the distinctive edge to make him, and the series, stand out from the rest of the very good British police novels that are around.\"\nStuart Coupe in The Sydney Morning Herald was very enthusiastic about the novel: \"The Chalon heads is significantly better than almost all the police procedural novels I've read in recent years, with Maitland displaying an impressive and convincing grasp of the machinations and motivations of working police officers, their strengths, weaknesses and foibles. This novel is right up there with the best contemporary crime fiction and, with Allen & Unwin in Australia and Orion Books in Britain as Mailtand's new publishers, one can but hope the author gains the increased international recognition he so clearly deserves.\"\nAwards\n2000 Barry Award - Best British Crime Novel finalist\nSee also\n1999 in Australian literature\n",
    "The Ural Gold Rush, which preceded the California Gold Rush, peaked at about the same time, in the middle of the CE.19th century.\nHistory\nHistorians believe that the world's first gold rush began when prospectors discovered gold and emeralds on the outskirts of the city of Yekaterinburg, in the Urals range, at the end of the 18th century. To the northeast of the city, in the foothills of the Urals, on both banks of the Berezovka River, are the most exploited gold ore veins of the 1840s, buried at a modest depth.\nIron and copper mines had been exploited for a very long time on a large scale in the Urals. As early as 1774, repairs to a machine in one of these mines, belonging to Klutchefsk, brought to light a deposit of gold-bearing sand, which was subjected to washing the following year. \"A strange, fantastic gold rush was organized during the first 50 years of the 19th century,\" says the historian Fernand Braudel in Material Civilization, Economy and Capitalism - 15th century - 13th century (page 577). This gold had found its first outlets in France in the previous century]. Russia is gradually becoming an exporter, whereas it had previously imported precious metals. The Ural Gold Rush was contemporaneous with the 1828 Georgia Gold Rush but grew larger and lasted longer. As early as 1824, 15 mines in the Urals produced 206 gold poods (one pood is equal to 16 kilos) or more than 3.3 tons of gold, a quantity that had already increased by 40% in 1827.\nIn 1842, a block of gold of 36 kilos of gold was found near Miass, a city in the Urals created in 1773, for the extraction of copper\". Gold production in this locality reached 640 kg per year before decreasing. The Altai Gold Rush, even further east, in Siberia, took over. The year 1847 was the peak of gold production in Russia. The mining administration shows a figure of 28.5 tons of gold for the Ural and Altai combined. In both cases, the alluvium is much richer in gold on the eastern slope.\nThe main architect of the extraction, which was carried to an industrial level, was Ivan Dmitrievich Astashev (1796-1869).\nSecondly, the degrowth is entirely about the wealth of Siberia, both eastern and western. Not only has mining activity not decreased in the Urals, but it has even increased slightly. The mines of the Urals actually reached their peak in the time of Stalin. It was the reading of \"L'Or\", by Blaise Cendrars, that determined Stalin to try to reindustrialize the Urals. The Urals then retained a significant production of gold, which however decreased from 1989 to 1991, from 285 tons to 250 tons and then fell to about a hundred tons of gold per year after 2010.\nSee also\nRussia portal\nGold mining\n",
    "American botanist and author (1889\u20131965)\nMarie Catherine Neal (December 7, 1889 \u2013 June 6, 1965) was an American botanist and author known for her contributions to the study of Hawaiian flora and her efforts to popularize botanical knowledge.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nMarie Catherine Neal was born on December 7, 1889, in Southington, Connecticut, to Linus B. Neal, a banker, and Eva W. Chedney. Her interest in nature was sparked during childhood hunting and fishing excursions with her father, leading to a lifelong passion for botany.\nNeal pursued her education at Smith College, graduating in 1912 with a B.A. degree. Her studies included a course in botany. During her college years, she gained administrative experience working as a secretary for various organizations. She received an MS degree from Yale University in 1925.\nCareer\nFollowing her graduation, Neal began her career in botany as a secretary in the geology department at Yale under Herbert E. Gregory. In 1920, she moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, to continue her work for Gregory at the Bishop Museum. Initially placed in the conchology department, she collaborated on research projects, including cataloging terrestrial mollusks and coauthoring a monograph on land snails. Later on, Neal's botanical interests led her to focus on Hawaiian flora instead. During her tenure at the Bishop Museum from 1920 to 1930, Neal made notable contributions to the study of Hawaiian plants.\nNeal's expertise in botany extended beyond academia. She contributed articles to the Paradise of the Pacific magazine, popularizing her knowledge of Hawaii's cultivated plants. In 1928, Neal coauthored her first major book, \"In Honolulu Gardens,\" which provided scientific descriptions and illustrations of Hawaiian plants. The book received acclaim for its blend of botanical information with Hawaiian legends and folklore.\nContributions to botany\nIn 1930, Neal was appointed botanist at the Bishop Museum, where she expanded the herbarium collections and earned international recognition for her scholarship. She assisted scholars and the public in identifying Hawaiian plants and contributed to the museum's educational initiatives. Neal's botanical research extended to the outer islands of Hawaii, where she conducted extensive fieldwork, discovering new plant species and conducting research for her publications.\nLater life and legacy\nMarie Catherine Neal's significant work, In Gardens of Hawaii, published in 1948 and revised in 1965, described over 2,000 botanic species with detailed scientific information and illustrations. Neal's contributions to botany were recognized, and she received honors for her scientific achievements. She died on June 6, 1965.\nThe standard author abbreviation M.Neal is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.\n",

    "American ornithologist and prolific bird bander\nStephen LeRoy Wilcox (October 9, 1899 \u2013 August 13, 1978) was an American ornithologist and prolific bird bander.\nEarly life and education\nLeRoy Wilcox with ducks on his duck farm\nLeRoy Wilcox was born in Speonk, a village in Southampton township, Suffolk County, New York. He attended Tanners Neck School, Westhampton, Westhampton Beach High School, and Cornell University, where, during the winter of 1919, he took a one-term poultry and game breeding course, studying under Arthur A. Allen, who had in 1916 established the first courses in ornithology and wildlife conservation in the United States.\nCareer\nLeRoy Wilcox with a small bird caught in a mist net\nLeRoy Wilcox tending to a mist net\nAfter an interval as proprietor of The Brushy Neck Pheasantry, where he bred ring neck pheasants and trap-nested single comb white leghorns, LeRoy Wilcox took over operations of the oldest commercial duck farm in the United States, the Oceanic Duck Farm, which had been founded in 1883 by his father Eugene O. Wilcox.\nWilcox became a bird bander in 1927 and spent more than 25 years studying piping plover (Charadrius melodus), producing the first detailed study of the bird and having more returns \"than the combined total of all other banders.\" He was also specially interested in Osprey, Common Tern, Oystercatcher, and Willet, banding thousands of birds each year (with more than 132,000 in his lifetime), carrying out bird censuses, and regularly publishing observations in The Auk, the Kingbird, The Wilson Bulletin, and other bird club and ornithological publications. He was responsible for a number of \"firsts,\" sightings of rare birds in New York and the United States, and at least one \"oldest.\" LeRoy Wilcox gave illustrated lectures on bird banding at the American Museum of Natural History, in New York City, at the Academy of Sciences, in Philadelphia, and at the United States National Museum, in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere and led the Moriches Bay Audubon Society's monthly birding trips. His work with birds led to his being frequently profiled in New York newspapers.\nWilcox was a member of several scientific societies (the American Ornithological Union, the National Audubon Society, the Linnaean Society, the Eastern Bird Banding Association, the Wilson Ornithological Club, Yale's Lepidopterists\u2019 Society, and the American Malacological Union, whose members appreciate mollusks) and collaborated widely with researchers attached to the Cornell Duck Research Laboratory in Eastport, Long Island, and with other ornithologists and members of the Linnaean Society. He banded nestlings on Gardiners Island, New York, for more than 20 years, and worked with other ornithologists to help to understand how DDT contributed to the decline of Ospreys in southern New England and on Long Island.\nWilcox's interests were not confined to birds; he studied botany, insects, fish, reptiles, and mammals. He was also a keen local historian and genealogist.\nPersonal life\nLeRoy Wilcox married Georgianna Robinson in 1922. They had two daughters, Janice and Jean, and a son, David.\nNotes\n^ A \"return\" is a bird which, having been banded, is recaptured at the same location after having returned from an annual migration (or migrations) for the first time.\n",
    "Not to be confused with Earlestown F.C. (1945).\nFootball club\nEarlestown F.C., 1884\u201385, with the Liverpool Senior Cup and Wellington Cup, Liverpool Football Echo, 12 October 1912\nEarlestown Football Club was an association football club from St Helens in Lancashire.\nHistory\nThe club was founded in 1880 and it made its senior football bow in the Lancashire Senior Cup in 1881.\nThe club's greatest successes came in the era before the game turned professional.  It was a strong power in the west Lancashire area, and reached the Liverpool Senior Cup final in 1883\u201384, 1884\u201385, and 1888\u201389.  Its first two finals were both against Everton, and a 1\u20130 win at Hawthorne Road in 1885 in front of over 4,000  (with 700 fans travelling on a special train), the goal coming from a scrimmage which bundled goalkeeper Lindsay over the line, saw the Cup go to Earlestown for the only time.  The power of the resources available to clubs in the new Football League however was quickly demonstrated - in 1889\u201390, Earlestown met Everton in the semi-final, and was hammered 13\u20132.\nEarlestown was one of the founder members of the Lancashire League in 1889, having turned professional in 1888, and having its expenditure increase to \u00a3200. The club lost its first four matches, before picking up a win by beating the similarly pointless Rossendale 5\u20133 at home in October.  Earlestown won four matches - the others being a double over West Manchester, which was top of the table when Earlestown won the home fixture, and a breathless 6\u20135 win in the return at Rossendale - and one more win, against Hyde, was stricken from the record because of crowd violence.  The match was never re-played; Earlestown was expelled before season end for not fulfilling its fixtures, with the club only ahead of Rossendale at the time.\nThe club did re-join the competition in 1899, staying in mid-table until the competition was absorbed into the Lancashire Combination in 1903.  Earlestown started off in the second division, and was promoted in its first season.  It yo-yoed between the two divisions over the next decade, its best finish being 14th (out of 18) in the first division in 1904\u201305.\nDespite its early prominence, Earlestown did not enter the FA Cup until 1900\u201301, and in its first entry it reached the fourth qualifying round, the penultimate stage; the match at home to Nantwich was considered to be a foregone conclusion, but the visitors won 3\u20132.  That run proved to be Earlestown's best, which it matched in 1905\u201306, when it lost 2\u20130 at Barnsley.\nBefore the start of the 1911\u201312 season, the reserve sides of Football League clubs, which had been the backbone of the Combination, withdrew for a new competition.  Denuded of clubs, the Combination \"promoted\" 11 of its division two sides - including Earlestown - into the first division.  However the costs and standard proved too much for the club, and Earlestown disbanded in October due to lack of support, with a debt of \u00a3200, albeit that was eventually cleared.  Earlestown's record of 1 win in its 5 fixtures (in which it had conceded 21 goals) was taken over by second division side Heywood United, and Barnoldswick was elected to the second to fill the second division vacancy.\nColours\nThe club's original colours were blue and white, changing in 1886 to white jerseys with what was described as a red Maltese cross on the right breast, although photographic evidence shows it to have been a cross patt\u00e9e.\nThe club retained the design until at least 1902, and by 1905 had changed to light blue shirts.\nGround\nThe club played at The Mesnes, originally using the Sunbeam Inn for facilities.\nNotable players\nTom Bradshaw\nAndrew Gara\nArthur Gee\nOwen Jones\nFred Valentine\nHonours\nLiverpool Senior Cup\nWinner: 1884\u201385\nRunner-up: 1883\u201384, 1888\u201389\nExternal links\nLancashire Combination until 1909\nLancashire Combination 1909\u201325\n",

    "2019 PSA by Sandy Hook Promise\n\"Back-To-School Essentials\" is a 2019 public service announcement (PSA) by American 501(c)(3) non-profit organization Sandy Hook Promise. Created as a shock piece, the PSA presents American students showing various back-to-school items, with the PSA becoming progressively disturbing to the viewer as the events of a school shooting unfolds. It received the 2020 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial.\nProduction\nBackground\nSandy Hook Promise (SHP) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization formed in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting by family members of the shooting victims. Prior to the release of \"Back-To-School Essentials\", SHP previously released the public service announcement (PSA) video \"Evan\" in 2016, which begins with a high-school boy named Evan looking for a \"mystery girl\" with whom he had written back and forth in the days leading up to summer break. As soon as the two students meet each other while signing yearbooks in the gymnasium, a classmate emerges in the background holding an assault rifle. The message is revealed by SHP as the video goes on to explain that \u201cwhile you were watching Evan, another student was showing signs of planning a shooting. But no one noticed.\u201d The video plays again while highlighting multiple indications of a student showing concerning signs of being bullied and displaying an interest in guns. It ends with the message, \u201cgun violence is preventable when you know the signs.\u201d SHP additionally released \"Point of View\" in 2018, six months after the Sandy Hook school shooting, which presented a series of events at a high school, up to the moment that a shooting is about to begin, in the point-of-view of a school shooter. The PSA was directed by Rupert Sanders.\nDevelopment and release\n\"Back-To-School Essentials\" was created by SHP through advertising agency network BBDO New York, with a media budget of US$37 thousand directly, with media otherwise being donated. The PSA was had an intentional launch time set for the \"back-to-school period\" in order to \"remind people of the new normal, that kids are being taught how to survive shootings.\" The 66-second long PSA was directed by Henry-Alex Rubin and produced by SMUGGLER.\nIt was released on the morning of September 18, 2019. The PSA starts off with American students showing off items in such a way that initially presents the PSA as a back-to-school advertisement, while taking a more disturbing approach as a school shooting unfolds. It ends with an girl emotionally showing her smartphone which she uses to send a text message reading \"I love you mom,\" and closes her eyes upon hearing the sounds of a door being opened as the video ends with the sounds of footsteps. At the end of the PSA, a message reads \"It's back to school time, and you know what that means. School shootings are preventable when you know the signs.\"\nAccording to SHP co-founder Mark Barden, the PSA's shocking nature was intentional and \"designed to spark conversations about prioritizing the prevention of violent acts in school and aims to promote a more hands-on approach to ending violence.\"\nReception\n\"Back-To-School Essentials\" was viewed 26 million times within 24 hours of its release, during which SHP generated US$100 thousand in donations. It further generated 3.9 billion total impressions through 4,400 media stories. In total, US$7.6 million was generated from the PSA's media coverage. The PSA was further shared on Twitter by politicians including Kamala Harris and Bill de Blasio.\nWill Burns of Forbes viewed the PSA as one that, in contrast to SHP's previous PSA's, prioritizes fear over its message, describing it as being \"about generating fear that gun violence will take place in your school.\" Heidi Stevens of the Chicago Tribune initially expressed feelings of resentment towards the PSA, though later acknowledges it as her own \"short-sightedness\" upon further reflection regarding the grim reality of American children facing the \"trauma of a school shooting  a possibility they wake up to and walk into every single weekday, from preschool through college.\"\nAwards and nominations\nFollowing its release, \"Back-To-School Essentials\" received the 2020 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial during the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards. During the 2020 Webby Awards, it was nominated under the \"Public Service & Activism (Branded)\" category, of which they won the Webby People's Voice Award, while receiving a Webby Award under the \"Best Viral PR Campaign\" category. It received \"Silver Honor\" in the \"Call To Action\" category during the Shorty Awards, as well as the first \"Storytelling for Good Award\" during the Clio Awards.

She was a niece of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and thus a first cousin of King Charles III.\nBiography\nBeatrix was born on 10 July 1936 in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall to Gottfried, Hereditary Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and Princess Margarita of Greece and Denmark, the eldest sister of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The family was not invited to Philip's wedding to Princess Elizabeth of the United Kingdom in 1947, due to her parent's membership in the Nazi Party. Six years later, however, Beatrix and her family were seated in the royal box at  her aunt's coronation in Westminster Abbey.\nIn January 1956, Beatrix and her cousin, Princess Christina of Hesse, moved to London into a flat arranged by their uncle, Prince Philip, in Dolphin Square. The two princesses attracted the attention of the British press as they went about the London season. Beatrix took dressmaking classes at the Royal College of Art. While Princess Christina eventually settled in the United Kingdom, marrying Prince Andrew of Yugoslavia whom the princesses were close friends with during their stay, Beatrix returned to Germany that same year.\nIn 1961, Beatrix became engaged to her first cousin, Maximilian, Hereditary Prince of Baden. The couple broke off their engagement in September of that year. Maximilian later married Archduchess Valerie of Austria in 1966 and Beatrix never married.\nIn her later years, she served as secretary to Margaret, Princess of Hesse and by Rhine, the sister-in-law of her aunt, Princess Cecilie. She lived in Langenburg, Germany, for most of her life. She continued to attend family events in Britain, such as the weddings of her cousins Prince Charles (later King Charles III) and Prince Andrew in 1981 and 1986, respectively.\nBeatrix died on 15 November 1997, aged 61, in the town where she was born.\nAncestry\n",
    "Flemish drawer\nChrist and the centurion, Prentenkabinet University of Leiden\nThe Master of the Egmont Albums (f 1575\u20131620) is the notname given to an unknown draughtsman of the Renaissance active at the end of the 16th century and early 17th century. Today, between 30 and 50 drawings in total are attributed to the master by comparison of styles. Some of these attributions are disputed by scholars. The themes of the drawings range from biblical scenes, mostly from the life of Jesus, mythological stories and battle scenes.\nIdentification\nThe notname was given as five or six anonymous drawings attributed to the master were collected in six albums of drawings that were formerly in the collection of John Perceval, 1st Earl of Egmont who had acquired them at the beginning of the 18th century. Since 1957 the albums are in the possession of the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven in the United States.\nBattle of the Tritons, Yale University Art Gallery\nThe master's links with the Habsburg Netherlands are attested by the Dutch-language inscriptions on two drawings: a sheet kept at Loppem Castle in Belgium and a drawing in the Prentenkabinet of Leiden University in the Netherlands. The works show Italian and Nordic influences. This seems to indicate an initial training in the Southern Netherlands and a trip to southern Europe, as the works show knowledge of Venetian and Roman art as well as the works of Albrecht D\u00fcrer. The artist may also have had links with Cologne as the paper on which one of the drawings is produced bears a watermark that was in use in Cologne at the time. In a print of c. 1600 engraved by Crispijn van de Passe, who was active in Cologne, after a drawing attributed to the master, the (abbreviated) name of the inventor is 'Quiten d M'.  This may be a reference to the Flemish Renaissance painter Quentin Metsys the Younger who was active in Germany. It has, however, not been possible to conclusively identify the artist behind this monogram. It is likely that the Master of the Egmont Albums was active in Italy in the late 16th century but had a career situated mostly in Northern Europe.\nIn 1990 Nicole Dacos tentatively identified the artist with the Amsterdam-based artist Dirck Hendricksz Centen (better known as Teodoro d'Errico), who was active in Naples from 1574. This hypothesis was definitively rejected after the discovery of an autograph drawing by Dirck Hendricksz Centen (auctioned at Sotheby's in London on 15 July 2012 as lot number 14), because that drawing was stylistically very different from the drawing styles of the drawings attributed to the master.  On the basis of stylistic comparison, Anthonie Blocklandt van Montfoort, Claudius Cock, Frans Francken the Elder, Jacob de Gheyn I, Hendrick Goltzius, Hans von Aachen, Giovanni Antonio da Pordenone, Giulio Romano, Giovanni della Rovere, Domenico Puligo, Tintoretto a Northern follower of Francesco Salviati and Giovanni Battista Naldini and even Rubens have previously been proposed as possible creators of some of the drawings attributed to the Master.  The broad range of attributions reflects the eclectic style of the artist.\nWork\nThe Good Samaritan\nBetween 30 and 50 drawings are attributed to the master. Art historians including Philip Pouncey started from the 5 or 6 drawings given to the artist in the Egmont albums to attribute additional works.  Initially only pen-and-ink drawings were included in the corpus of the master. In 1964, three black-chalk drawings were added to the oeuvre.  The latter attributions are not uncontested. Further attributions of works in the Louvre, Paris, and the Kupferstich-Kabinett of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden raised the number of attributions to about 50 drawings in various media.\nThe subjects of the drawings include Bible stories, mythological subjects and battle scenes.\nThe master's artistic style is close to the Mannerism prevalent in central Italy at the time. The drawings are also reminiscent of the works of the Flemish artist Bartholomew Spranger, the most famous of the Northern Mannerists who worked at the imperial court in Prague. The master's graphic stroke is very light in the details. The use of the pen is very varied and spontaneous. The complex compositions are worked out in black chalk over which strong pen lines are drawn often in two different shades of brown ink and juxtapose dark hatched shadows next to areas of white paper.\n",
    "Russian-American anarchist (1876\u20131947)\nNathan Navro (August 1, 1876 \u2013 October 23, 1947) was a Russian American anarchist, musician and caregiver. Navro immigrated to the United States in the 1890s, settling in Philadelphia, where he was educated in the English language by Voltairine de Cleyre. He soon became proficient enough in the language that he wrote English poems for Free Society and, influenced by his teacher, became a musician. He later became de Cleyre's primary caregiver, nursing her through years of ill health. He was a close friend of hers until her death and his manuscript about her has become a key primary source on her life.\nBiography\nNathan Navro was born in 1876, into a Jewish family in the Russian Empire. By the 1890s, he had immigrated to the United States and settled in the city of Philadelphia.\nAs de Cleyre's student\nWhile working as a cigar maker, in 1896, Navro approached the anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre for tutoring in the English language. Navro was among hundreds of Jewish students that de Cleyre tutored in Philadelphia. She once told him that Jewish people were \"the most liberal minded and active comrades in the movement, as well as the most transcendental dreamers.\" Under her tutelage, his grip on the language improved rapidly, resulting in him being able to contribute poems to the American anarchist newspaper Free Society. Within a few years, he had quite his job at the cigar factory to study music.\nIn letters to Joseph Ishill, de Cleyre's sister Adelaide D. Thayer described him as \"a fine man and a good friend\"; her son Harry de Cleyre depicted him as a man of \"unquestioned integrity\", remarking that he was \"free of petty jealousies\", unlike a number of de Cleyre's other students. He was also well liked by her mother Harriet De Claire, who disliked most of her daughter's other friends. Voltairine de Cleyre herself called him \"the best character I have ever known in all this world\".\nHe soon joined his teacher in anarchist activism, remarking that she had \"practically created the protest movement in Philadelphia.\" He joined her reading group, the Social Science Club, which met each Sunday and discussed the works of different anarchist thinkers. By 1901, it had become Philadelphia's foremost anarchist group. To Navro, de Cleyre's commitment to anarchism remained as solid as \"a rock\", even as many other Philadelphia anarchists dropped out of the movement. According to Navro \"every word\" of de Cleyre's lectures and speeches were \"calculated to express the strongest possible idea.\"\nAs de Cleyre's carer\nDespite her constant work, de Cleyre's tutoring only earned her a meager wage, which, according to Navro, meant that she often went without food. Navro wrote that her poor diet and overwork had caused her chronic condition \"to make terrible inroads on her constitution\", ultimately shortening her life. In December 1902, de Cleyre was shot by a disruntled former pupil, Herman Helcher. Navro reported that Helcher had been obsessed with de Cleyre and her partner Samuel H. Gordon, and had tried to get them back together \"for the good of the cause\". Navro initially thought him \"a little foolish, but very sincere in his anarchism\", but after de Cleyre's split with Gordon, he had begun exhibiting \"abnormal behavior\". According to Navro, after the assassination attempt, medical examiners concluded that Helcher had suffered from an accumulation of uric acid in his system, which had caused him \"paraonia\" and \"insanity\".\nThe assassination exacerbated her already precarious physical condition. By 1904, Navro reported that de Cleyre's health had seen a \"terrible decline\", as her chronic catarrh which she had had since childhood spread from her sinuses to the rest of her head, briefly causing her to go deaf. After regaining her senses, de Cleyre told Navro that her ear infection had caused a pounding sensation that was \"louder than the noise of the locomotives stationed within a few yards from her house\". According to Navro, de Cleyre spent the rest of her life in \"continuous torture\". Navro, who lived together with her, gave her bedside care and attempted to nurse de Cleyre back to health. One night, she attempted to commit suicide with a morphine overdose, but according to Navro, it \"failed to bring the desired result\". He continued to care for her as she gradually recovered, although she would live in pain for the rest of her life, which he said to have \"cast a gloom over her spirit\".\nUnder Navro's care, by 1906, de Cleyre had regained her strength and was able to return to her anarchist organizing work. That year, she was visited by Alexander Berkman, whose acquaintance Navro remarked was a \"memorable and vivid\" moment for her. When de Cleyre was arrested and tried for incitement in June 1908, Navro claimed that the Philadelphia Police Department had bribed witnesses to present false testimony against the defendants, while de Cleyre herself had been unable to any \"quiet-looking, respectable-app",
    "8th episode of the 1st season of Sh\u014dgun\n\"The Abyss of Life\" (Japanese: \u5948\u843d\u306e\u5e95, Hepburn: Naraku no Soko) is the eighth episode of the American historical drama television series Sh\u014dgun, based on the novel by James Clavell.

It was released on Hulu on April 9, 2024, and it also aired on FX on the same day.\nThe series is set in 1600, and follows three characters. John Blackthorne, a risk-taking English sailor who ends up shipwrecked in Japan, a land whose unfamiliar culture will ultimately redefine him; Lord Toranaga, a shrewd, powerful daimyo, at odds with his own dangerous, political rivals; and Lady Mariko, a woman with invaluable skills but dishonorable family ties, who must prove her value and allegiance. In the episode, Toranaga grieves the death of his son, while Ishido and Ochiba plan to take advantage of this. \nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.436 million household viewers and gained a 0.08 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349. The episode received critical acclaim, with Hiroyuki Sanada receiving universal acclaim for his performance in the episode. \nPlot\nAfter Nagakado's death, Toranaga leads his army to Edo for his funeral, intending to spend 49 days of mourning. His army attends the funeral, but Toranaga cannot bring himself to attend. At Osaka Castle, Ishido proposes marriage to Ochiba to strengthen their alliance, hoping to capitalize on Toranaga's grief. \nWhile Alvito suggests an alliance with Ochiba, Toranaga tells the priest to inform Ishido that he will formally surrender, believing that Ochiba will never accept his terms and also blaming the Church for not supporting his cause. Buntaro and Mariko have a tea ceremony, where he proposes that they commit suicide to protest Toranaga's surrender, but Mariko refuses, explaining that she simply wants to be away from him. Blackthorne visits his former shipmates. One of them, Salamon, confronts him about his piloting decisions that brought them to Japan, and Blackthorne realizes his old life with the crew is over. Blackthorne offers his services to Yabushige, who initially refuses. Daiyoin, the wife of the late Taik\u014d, suffers a stroke and begs Ochiba to end her hostilities and release the hostages before dying. \nToranaga's vassals sign their names to a formal letter of surrender, but Hiromatsu refuses to sign. When Toranaga refuses to fight, Hiromatsu commits seppuku as he feels he can no longer serve him, with Buntaro reluctantly acting as his second. That night, Toranaga reveals to Mariko that Hiromatsu committed suicide to make his enemies believe his defeat was real. Yabushige is thus convinced and accepts Blackthorne's services. Toranaga asks Mariko to travel on his behalf to Osaka. The next morning, at the resting place of his son, Toranaga thanks Nagakado and Hiromatsu and vows not to waste the time they bought.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn March 2024, Hulu confirmed that the eighth episode of the series would be titled \"The Abyss of Life\", and was to be written by co-executive producer Shannon Goss, and directed by Emmanuel Osei-Kuffour. It was Goss' second writing credit, and Osei-Kuffour's first directing credit.\nWriting\nFor Hiromatsu's death, Hiroyuki Sanada commented, \"Yeah, it was hard to shoot mentally, physically. You know, our mind is like almost breaking and it's harder to try to  cry in the scene. It was  to cry almost, but they both know what is going to happen if he doesn't commit seppuku.\" Justin Marks explained that Tokuma Nishioka wanted to play Hiromatsu as an \"asertion of himself\" during the scene, with Marks remarking that it could make the episode \"truly a tragedy on a level that is more than what it even appears to be.\":\u200a6:33\u20138:25\u200a\nCosmo Jarvis said that Blackthorne's encounter with Salamon wanted to show how \"opportunist\" his character was, \"You know, at the core of Blackthorne's motivation, there's something that people may or may not pick up on. He's an opportunist and that was in the book. In the book, he's always comparing himself to the respect that Sir Francis Drake got from Queen Elizabeth.\"\nCasting\nSeries co-creator Rachel Kondo has a cameo in the episode as a prostitute during the confrontation between Blackthorne and Salamon.\nReception\nViewers\nIn its original FX broadcast, \"The Abyss of Life\" was seen by an estimated 0.436 million household viewers and gained a 0.08 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349, according to Nielsen Media Research.

Blackthorne finds the Erasmus and attempts to sail in a boat, only to be stopped by Mariko, who informs him that his ship has been confiscated and now belongs to Toranaga, and his men have been sent to an unspecified location. Toranaga converses with the villagers, before leaving for Edo. \nBlackthorne is given a home and is also provided with a good salary. He starts training Yabushige's army, although he struggles due to his lack of wartime experience. Eventually, he decides to use his martime knowledge to teach them how to use cannons, impressing Yabushige.

He later became a lawyer while contributing to several literary and philosophical collections. \nIn 1827, he published a pamphlet on the death penalty that drew attention to him and brought him back to philosophy. After passing the agr\u00e9gation in philosophy in 1827, he taught in Versailles, then in the Parisian colleges of Saint Louis (from 1833), Louis-le-Grand (from 1835 to 1838), and Henri-IV (1840\u20131841) as well as at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (1834\u20131835).\nOn May 25, 1840, Garnier defended his two theses for the Doctorate of Letters at the University of Paris. The first, in French, is a critique of the philosophy of Thomas Reid. The second, in Latin, is a reflection on poetry.\nHe was appointed assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Paris Faculty of Letters in 1842, then succeeded Jouffroy in the chair of dogmatic philosophy in 1845 in this university. He was elected a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques in 1860.\nHis work on Social Morality was awarded a Montyon Prize in 1850.

    "2012 EP by Mark Murphy\nA Beautiful Friendship: Remembering Shirley Horn is an EP by Mark Murphy.\nA Beautiful Friendship: Remembering Shirley Horn is the 47th recording (EP) by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 80 years old in 2012 and released by the Gearbox label in the United States and the UK in 2013. This album is collection of standards associated with Shirley Horn. The recording is dedicated to Shirley Horn and pianist George Mesterhazy, Murphy's accompanist. This was Mark Murphy's final recording.\nBackground\nIn the liner notes Christopher Loudon attributes the initial idea of a Shirley Horn tribute album to George Mesterhazy. Pianist and arranger Mesterhazy had worked with vocalists Rebecca Parris (Spring, My Foolish Heart), Paula West (Live at the Jazz Standard), Shirley Horn (May the Music Never End, Loving You) and Murphy. Speaking about Horn Murphy said, \"I never knew her well but our paths would cross at festivals and clubs and it was always a pleasure to see and hear her. We liked each other, and I know she liked what I did. She even said to me once after a show, 'I thought I was good, and then I heard you.' Which is crazy, as I would never think that. It was her way of winking at me, the way like-minded artists communicate with each other, a way to let the other know one was a secret fan\".\nMeterhazy unexpectedly died before the recording began. Murphy and his manager Jean-Pierre Leduc were determined to record the project, now envisioned to be a tribute to Mesterhazy as well as Horn. The recording took place at the Merion Inn, Cape May, New Jersey, Mesterhazy's hometown. Mesterhazy had performed regularly at the inn which was owned by his long time companion Vicki Watson.\nThe chosen songs were all associated with Horn. Horn recorded Jimmy Van Heusen's \"But Beautiful\", from the film Road to Rio, Cole Porter's \"Get Out of Town\", from the musical Leave It to Me!, and \"A Beautiful Friendship\" on her album Close Enough for Love (Verve, 1988). Horn's recording of \"Here's to Life\" from Here's to Life (Verve, 1991) became her signature tune. She was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance for \"Here's to Life\" at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards but lost to Bobby McFerrin for \"Round Midnight\" in the album Play. Her album reached number one on the Billboard jazz chart.\nRecording\nThe album was produced by Jean-Pierre Leduc, Murphy's manager, and Darrel Sheinman, from Gearbox Records. The recording took place near the time of the Cape May Exit Zero Jazz Festival during which Steve Williams, Shirley Horn's drummer of 25 years, and bassist Curtis Lundy were available. Murphy had also just performed at the festival. Curtis Lundy was Betty Carter's longtime bassist and a close friend of Horn. To replace Mesterhazy, Leduc hired pianist Alex Minasian. Till Br\u00f6nner, who worked with Murphy on Once to Every Heart and Love Is What Stays accompanies on trumpet on two tunes, \"But Beautiful\" and \"Get Out of Town\". Murphy performs \"Here's to Life\" as a duet with pianist Alex Minasian.\nReception\nBruce Lindsay, writing for All About Jazz, calls the recording a \"superb tribute\" and finds \"Here's to Life\" to be \"extraordinarily affecting\".\nJeanie Barton gives the release a positive review in The London Jazz News writing, \"This EP is a warming tribute to two influential musicians with personal contributions from all involved...this record perfectly honors their Beautiful Friendship\".\nTrack listing\n\"A Beautiful Friendship\" (Donald Kahn, Stanley Styne) \u2013 5:22\n\"But Beautiful\" (Jimmy Van Heusen, Johnny Burke) \u2013 5:20\n\"Get Out of Town\" (Cole Porter) \u2013 4:32\n\"Here\u2019s to Life\" (Artie Butler, Phyllis Molinary) \u2013 4:12\nPersonnel\nPerformance\nMark Murphy \u2013 vocals\nAlex Minasian \u2013 piano\nCurtis Lundy \u2013 bass (tracks 1, 2, 3)\nSteve Williams \u2013 drums (tracks 1, 2, 3)\nTill Br\u00f6nner \u2013 trumpet (tracks 2 and 3)\nProduction\nBob Fowler \u2013 engineer\nStephan Branca\u2013 assistant engineer\nGeorge Mesterhazy \u2013 concept\nJean-Pierre Leduc \u2013 producer, cover photography\nDarrel Sheinman\u2013 producer\nAlan Foulkes \u2013 album design\nChristopher Loudon \u2013 liner notes\n",

    "Dimitris Horn Award  is a Greek  annual, honorary award and is given for the best performance by a young male actor in the past theatre season. The award, which bears the name of Dimitris Horn, an actor recognised as the best contemporary Greek theatre actor, was established in 2000 by Stamatis Fasoulis and Theodosis Isaakidis, with the financial support of Yannis Horn, the actor's brother.  \nThe prize of the award is the  gold cross worn by the actor, which is passed from one awardee to another every year, accompanied by a cash prize of 3000 euro. \nCandidates must be graduates of a drama school or have performed professionally for the first time no more than five years before the theatre period for which they are honoured.\n...these awards are not a simple process. We follow the actors' progress over time and their attitude towards things, towards the theatre, an art form that is primarily handmade. There are many good actors out there, but in order not to be unfair to anyone, the awards are not given for the hit of the moment, but because there has been struggle and dedication. Then the award makes sense.\nThe award ceremony takes place every year at the \"Dimitris Horn Theatre\" (formerly \"Dionysia Theatre\"). The \"Committee of the Dimitris Horn Award\" is currently composed of: Stamatis Fassoulis (chairman),  Lydia Koniordou, theatrologist Irini Moudraki and the journalists Myrto Loverdou and Antigoni Karali as members. \nMembers of the committee have been the theatrologist Kostas Georgousopoulos (chairman), Eleni Chatziargyri and Xenia Kalogeropoulou. \nThe future of the award is unknown as the initial fund from which the prize money was given is running out. The organiser of the awards, Stamatis Fassoulis, have sought the support of the Ministry of Culture to take over the funding of the award (3,000 euros per year) but nothing has been decided yet.\nRecipients\nNote\n^a  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece the award ceremony was postponed The awards were given at the 2024 award ceremony\n",
    "Head of the Polish Orthodox Church from 1965 to 1969\nStefan, secular name Stepan Rudyk (born 27 December 1891 in Majdan Lipowiecki, died 26 March 1969 in Warsaw) was the fourth Metropolitan of Warsaw and all Poland, the head of the Polish Orthodox Church from 1965 to 1969 of Ukrainian descent.\nHe was a graduate of the seminary in Oryol. From 1922 to 1939, he served as the pastor of various Orthodox parishes designated for Polish soldiers of this denomination. After the September Campaign, he withdrew with the Polish forces to Romania and was interned there. In 1941, he became a chaplain of the prisoner-of-war camp in Dorsten. Thanks to the intervention of the International Red Cross, he was allowed to live in Berlin, and after two years, he arrived in occupied \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. In this city, he served in the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral for ten years. In 1953, he was consecrated as the Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw and Szczecin, a position he held for eight years. Then, from 1961 to 1965, he was the Bishop of Bia\u0142ystok and Gda\u0144sk, after which the council of bishops of the Polish Orthodox Church elected him as its head.\nAs the leader of the church, Metropolitan Stefan continued his efforts to convert the Greek Catholic population to Orthodoxy. He also re-established contacts with other autocephalous churches and served as the vice-chairman of the Polish Ecumenical Council.\nEarly life\nBefore World War II\nHe was born in Majdan Lipowiecki in the Jawor\u00f3w uezd to a Ukrainian peasant family of Greek Catholic faith, the son of Piotr Rudyk and Anna Troper. His father was a Russophile and was interned by the Austrian authorities during World War I in the Thalerhof camp near Graz, where he died.\nIn 1911, Stepan Rudyk graduated from high school in Lviv, after which he went to Russia, where he began his studies at the Orthodox Volhynian Theological Seminary in Zhytomyr. He then transferred to the seminary in Oryol, which he completed in 1915. He married Julianna Czornij. On 3 May 1915, he was ordained a priest by Bishop Dionysius Waledy\u0144ski of Kremenets and was appointed vicar of the parish of St. Nicholas in Kremenets. In the same month, he also became the parson in Ponykovytsia in the Brody uezd, as one of the Orthodox missionaries of Bishop Eulogius of Che\u0142m. After the evacuation of Russian troops in October 1915, he served as a priest among refugees in the Nowiny colony in the Novograd-Volynsky Uyezd. In August 1918, he was appointed parson in Moskal\u00f3wka in the Proskurov uezd, from where he moved to Podzamcze in the Kremenets Raion in October 1921.\nOn 25 August 1922, he was accepted into the Polish Armed Forces as a military official of the ninth rank. On 8 January 1924, he was confirmed in the rank of chaplain of the reserve in the military chaplaincy of the Orthodox faith and remained in active service. His first parish was the military parish of St. Nicholas in Toru\u0144. Father Stepan Rudyk became involved in its creation, as well as in the life of the local Russian community. His activities on behalf of the Russians raised objections from the Polish military authorities and led in 1927 to his transfer to Grudzi\u0105dz. He then served in Orthodox military parishes in Katowice (1927\u20131936) and Krak\u00f3w (1936\u20131939). He was promoted to senior chaplain with seniority from 19 March 1938, and ranked first in the military chaplaincy of the Orthodox faith. In March 1939, he was the head of the Orthodox pastoral care in Military District No. 1.\nWorld War II and post-war years\nAfter the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, as a result of a bombing raid on a military hospital in Warsaw, his wife was killed. Father Rudyk withdrew with the Polish forces to Romania and was interned there. He stayed in the camps at C\u0103lim\u0103ne\u0219ti and T\u00e2rgu Jiu. Then, in 1941, he was handed over to the Germans and transferred to Oflag VI E in Dorsten, Westphalia, as a chaplain. Thanks to the intervention of Father Rudyk's orphaned sons, supported by the International Red Cross, he was granted permission in February 1942 to leave the camp and was allowed to reside in Berlin as a vicar of the parish at the Resurrection of Christ Cathedral, belonging to the Berlin and German Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. He could not return to Warsaw, to the territory of the General Government, as a former chaplain in the Polish Armed Forces.\nFrom 1943 to 1953, Father Rudyk lived in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, where he served as the parson of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. In 1943, he saved the cathedral bells from confiscation by bricking them up in the church tower. These bells were restored to liturgical use after the liberation of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. As a widowed priest, he took perpetual vows in 1948 and was raised to the rank of archimandrite. He actively participated in the life of the Russian community in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. According to preserved records, on 27 October 1948, he signed an agreement to cooperate with the Security Office as a secret collaborator under the code name Fidelis. He was also supposed",
    "Norwegian footballer (born 1971)\nErik Stock (born 10 May 1971) is a retired Norwegian football defender.\nFollowing a youth career in Western Oslo clubs Fagerborg from age 8 and Frigg from age 15, he received help from Hallvar Thoresen to land a trial with PSV Eindhoven. Stock was accepted into their academy of PSV. He was team captain of Norwegian youth international teams, winning 16 youth caps in total.\nStock eventually saw that a chance in PSV's first team was not likely, and went from an apprenticeship contract to a senior team contract with NEC. In NEC, Stock was among the half of the squad who were fully professional, but nonetheless he chose to supplement this with an education in business administration and marketing. In 1993\u201394, NEC were promoted to the Eredivisie and lost the 1993\u201394 KNVB Cup final to Feyenoord. Stock was the only Norwegian player in the Eredivisie when making his debut in 1994. From 1994 to 1996 he played 51 Eredivisie games for NEC. From 1997 to 2004 he played 186 Eerste Divisie games for three clubs; TOP Oss, Helmond Sport and VVV.\nFrom 1996 to 1997, Erik Stock had his only stay in Norwegian senior football, with Eliteserien club Viking FK. Stock came out of NEC's successful 1996\u201397 Eredivisie relegation playoff, but wanted to try a new football milieu. He came to Viking in early June 1996, but was immediately injured. He recovered to make his debut for Viking 2 in late June, without impressing. Having barely played during the 1996 Eliteserien campaign, he was declared surplus by Viking manager Poul Erik Andreasen as the season concluded in October.\nIn the winter of 1997\u201397, Stock was on trial with FC Eindhoven and later Fortuna K\u00f6ln. In April 1997 Stock went on trial in Germany again, with clubs such as Greuther F\u00fcrth and SG Wattenscheid 09 reportedly watching him. He finally left Viking in June 1997, returning to the Netherlands, where he was signed by TOP Oss without trial.\nHe settled in the Netherlands, working in real estate in Helmond. He was used as a Dutch\u2013Norwegian interpreter in UEFA competitions.\n\n",

In 1965, he became professor at the University of Salerno, and in 1969 he was named director of its institute of art history. In 1979, he became ordinary professor at the Sapienza University of Rome.\nMajor interest of Menna's studies were abstractism, artistic avant-gardes and new forms of art. Among his major works, Industrial design. Inchiesta\u2026 (1962), in which he theorized the potential integration of industrial production with art, Profezia di una societ\u00e0 estetica ('Prophecy of an Aesthetic Society', 1968), a research about the roots of avant-gardes and modern art, La linea analitica dell\u2019arte moderna ('The Analytical Strain in Modern Art', 1975), a history of art from a structuralist and analytical perspective which investigated the connections between art, mathematic and logic, Critica della critica  ('Critique of Criticism', 1980), and Progetto moderno dell\u2019arte ('Modern Project of Art', 1988). He also authored monographies on Piet Mondrian, Enrico Prampolini, and William Hogarth.\nMenna collaborated with numerous publications, including the newspapers Il Mattino and Paese Sera. He founded the art journal Figure. As an art curator, he collaborated with the Venice Biennale and the Rome Quadriennale. He also served as a Campania regional councilor, elected in 1975 as an independent with the Italian Communist Party.

    "Election\nThe 2024 Kaliningrad Oblast gubernatorial election will take place on 6\u20138 September 2024, on common election day. Acting Governor Aleksey Besprozvannykh is running for a full term in office.\nBackground\nAnton Alikhanov was appointed acting Governor of Kaliningrad Oblast in October 2016 after Yevgeny Zinichev resigned form the post due to family reasons. Alikhanov won the election for a full with 81.06% of the vote and easily won reelection for a second term in 2022 with 80.21%.\nIn late April 2024 several media outlets reported that Governor Anton Alikhanov could receive a position in the Government of Russia, however, Alikhanov himself later denied those rumours and reaffirmed his intention to remain in Kaliningrad Oblast. Nevertheless, less than a week later it was reported that Governor Alikhanov is being considered for Minister of Industry and Trade or Minister of Economic Development. On May 11, 2024, re-appointed Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin nominated Governor Anton Alikhanov to serve in his second cabinet as Minister of Trade and Industry, replacing Denis Manturov, who was elevated as First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia. State Duma Committee on Industry and Trade supported Alikhanov nomination on May 12, while the full chamber voted 430\u20130\u20130 to approve Alikhanov as new Minister of Industry and Trade two days later.\nAfter his nomination, Governor Alikhanov left Kaliningrad on May 12, 2024, leaving First Deputy Governor Sergey Yeliseyev as acting Governor until the temporary replacement be appointed by the President. Initially Vice Governor of Saint Petersburg Vasily Pikalyov was considered the frontrunner to replace Alikhanov as Governor of Kaliningrad Oblast, however, Pikalyov was appointed Head of the Federal Customs Service of Russia on May 14. Other mentioned candidate included Yeliseyev and Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Aleksey Besprozvannykh. On May 15 President Vladimir Putin appointed Aleksey Besprozvannykh as acting Governor of Kaliningrad Oblast.\nCandidates\nIn Kaliningrad Oblast candidates for Governor can be nominated only by registered political parties. Candidate for Governor of Kaliningrad Oblast should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 8% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities.

    "\nThe 2005 Togolese coup d'\u00e9tat was the unconstitutional seizure of power by the military in Togo through the appointment of Faure Gnassingbe, son of long-time President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who had ruled the country for 38 years after leading a coup d'\u00e9tat of his own in 1967. On February 5, 2005, President Eyadema suddenly died of a heart attack. Rather than adhering to the Togolese constitution which mandates the Speaker of Parliament act as interim leader until elections are held within 60 days, the Togolese military instead capitalized on the speaker's brief absence during a trip to announce that Eyadema's son Faure Gnassingbe would be sworn in as the new president in order to prevent a \"power vacuum\" from taking place within the country. In a special session of the National Assembly dominated by the Eyadema clan's ruling party - the Rally of the Togolese People (RTP) - Faure Gnassingbe was overwhelmingly approved as the Speaker of Parliament by a wide margin of 67 to 14. A constitutional amendment was also later passed allowing Faure Gnassingbe to serve his father's term that lasts until 2008.\nThe seizure of power sparked mass protests domestically and international condemnation abroad. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) suspended Togo's membership and imposed arms embargoes while the African Union threatened sanctions. Togo was also suspended from the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF).\nIn spite of a two-month ban on protesting to mourn the late leader's death, mass protests were still held in the nation's capital of Lom\u00e9 where thousands of people demanded Faure Gnassingbe step down. The protests turned violent, resulting in clashes with the military and at least three deaths. Tear gas, stun grenades, and allegedly live ammunition was used by soldiers to disperse the protests.\nFollowing international pressure, Faure Gnassingbe pledged he would hold elections within 60 days but still remained firm on retaining his position beforehand. He then backtracked and resigned on 25 February, being replaced by Bonfoh Abass.\nOn 24 April, the 2005 Togo Presidential Election was hastily held. Faure Gnassingbe won a resounding victory with 60% of the total votes compared to the main opposition candidate Bob Akitani who only won 38% of the vote. Allegations of vote tampering, ballot box stuffing, and uncounted votes were levied against the government. After Faure Gnassingbe was declared the winner of the election, violence erupted as the opposition called upon its supporters to resist Gnassingbe's presidency. The electoral violence, from 28 March until 5 May, resulted in 790 killed and 4,345 injured. Responses from the international community were mixed: France and ECOWAS deemed the vote as largely fair barring minor irregularities while the European Union (EU) criticized the elections for not meeting democratic standards.\n",
    "Badminton tournament\nThe knockout stage for the 1958 Thomas Cup began on 5 June 1958 with the first-round knockout and ended on 15 June with the final tie.\nQualified teams\nThe teams that won their zonal tie qualified for the final knockout stage.\nBracket\nFirst round\nThe results of the inter-zone ties in Singapore gave ample evidence of both the growing popularity of the sport in the Far East and the advantage these nations enjoyed competing against \"outsiders\" in a tropical climate. Showing strength and balance in singles and doubles, Thailand sent the USA home with a 7\u20132 defeat. A curiously revealing match in this tie was the victory of Thailand's Sunthorn Subabandhu and Kamal Sudthivanich over the strong U.S. veterans Alston and Rogers, 18\u201314 in the third game after dropping the first game at zero. \nMore stunning, and ominous for Malaya, was newcomer Indonesia's 6\u20133 victory over a highly rated Danish contingent. Erland Kops was beaten by both the internationally experienced Ferry Sonneville and by young sensation Tan Joe Hok. Even the powerful Danish doubles pairing of Finn Kobbero and Jorgen Hammergaard Hansen could earn only a split in two matches.\nUnited States vs Thailand\nDenmark vs Indonesia\nSecond round\nIndonesia vs Thailand\nIndonesia went on to comfortably defeat Thailand in the inter-zone final 8\u20131. In another bad sign for Malaya, Thailand 's top two singles players, Charoen Wattanasin and Thanoo Khajadbhye, respected internationals who had dropped only one singles match between them in the campaign prior to playing Indonesia, were each decisively beaten by both Sonneville and Tan Joe Hok. Thailand won one doubles, though all four of these matches went to three games.\nChallenge round\nMalaya vs Indonesia\nThe challenge round played in the middle of June brought Malaya's nine year Thomas Cup reign to an end. With Wong Peng Soon and Ong Poh Lim retired, Eddie Choong's game showing recent vulnerability, and some controversy over the selection of team members still percolating, Malayan confidence might have been low from the start. The three-time defending champions were unable to win any of the singles matches against Indonesia and eventually lost the tie 3\u20136.  \nChoong was twice beaten routinely in straight games and was booed off the court by his countrymen. Malaya's other top singles player, Teh Kew San, nearly broke through against Sonneville but finally went down 16\u201318 in the third. At least one of Malaya's doubles wins appeared to be a gift after the outcome had been determined. Indonesia's Tan Joe Hok went through the entire Thomas Cup campaign undefeated in singles (Sonneville had dropped a match to Finn Kobbero). Tan would win the All-England singles title the following year and for a time would be regarded as the best player in the world. For a much longer time Indonesia would be the country to beat in international team badminton. \n",
    "\nGeorge Thornley (1614 \u2013 after 1657) was an English writer, known for his oft-reprinted translation of the Greek novel Daphnis and Chloe.\nLife\nGeorge Thornley was born in 1614. He was the son of a certain Thomas Thornley described as \"of Cheshire\", and was at Repton School under Thomas Whitehead, the first master appointed on the re-founding of the school in 1621. Whitehead's usher at the time, John Lightfoot, was afterwards master of St. Catherine's, and was elected Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1655. Whitehead sent many of his scholars to his old college, Christ's, and it was here that Thornley was admitted sizar\u2014sizarships were given to poor students\u2014under Mr. King in 1631. This King is the Edward King who is the subject of Milton\u2019s Lycidas, and Milton resided at Christ's from 1625 to 1632. In 1635 Thornley proceeded Bachelor in Arts, and we hear no more of him, save that in his forty-fourth year he is described upon the title-page of his Daphnis and Chloe as \"Gentleman\".\nDaphnis and Chloe\nThornley's only known work is his Daphnis and Chloe (1657). In making his translation Thornley had before him the parallel Latin and Greek edition of Jungermann, published in 1605. According to J. M. Edmonds, who revised Thornley's translation for the Loeb Classical Library, \"His  English is often suggested by Jungermann's Latin; in one or two places he has made mistakes through paying more attention to the Latin than to the Greek; and he sometimes prefers a reading only to be found in Jungermann's notes.\" Edmonds gives the following, glowing assessment of Thornley's sole achievement: \"There is nothing on Thornley\u2019s title-page to tell us that his book is a translation, and if his 'most sweet and pleasant pastoral romance' ever came into the hands of the 'young ladies' for whom he wrote it, they may well have supposed it to be his original work. For although his rendering is generally close enough to the Greek to satisfy the most fastidious modern scholar, it has all the graces of idiom, rhythm, and vocabulary characteristic of the best English prose of the day.  He always shows you that he has a complete grasp of the situation he is describing. He not only sees and hears, but he thinks and feels. He knows what it was like to be there.\"\n",
    "\nThe church, in 2012\nSt Botolph's Church is the parish church of Bossall, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe current church, dedicated to St Botolph, dates from around 1180, though as many as three earlier churches may have occupied the site. One of these is thought to have been built by the Bosa of York. The church is cruciform and approximately 94 feet (29\u00a0m) in length. The transepts, nave and part of the tower are original, but the chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century and alterations were later made to the upper part of the tower.  The Borthwick Institute holds copies of the parish records which date to the early 17th century.\nThe Church of England records include this background information about the parish: A vicarage was ordained at Bossall in 1229. The rectory and advowson of the church initially descended with the manor of Bossall but by 1378 it had passed to the Nevill family. At some point between 1378 and 1386 it was alienated to Durham Priory by John Nevill for the maintenance of Durham College, Oxford. The advowson was fully appropriated to the college c.1404, and the college retained it until the Dissolution of the Monasteries when it was granted by the King to the Dean and Chapter of Durham.\nA report published in 1839 states that the church was suffering from neglect at that time, although the interior walls had been recently cleaned. The vicarage, a white Elizabethan house built in 1838 and the home of Rev. Bolton Simpson at that time, was located nearby.  It was restored in 1859, during which process the west gable was rebuilt, and a south porch was added.  The church was Grade I listed in 1953.\nThe south door\nThe church is built of limestone and sandstone and has a Welsh slate roof.  It has a cruciform plan, consisting of a nave with a south porch, north and south transepts, a chancel, and a tower at the crossing.  The tower, nave and transepts have a string course and a corbel table.  The south porch has a moulded round-headed arch with four orders of shafts with dogtooth and stylised flower decoration, and waterleaf capitals.  The doorway in the north porch is similar, but with only one order.  Many of the windows are lancets, while others are Perpendicular, and there are a couple of round-headed windows.\nInside the church is a 14th-century font with a 17th-century cover, and a painting of the Royal Arms from 1710.  Monuments include a brass figure commemorating Robert Constable, a former chancellor of Dunelm, who died in the 1540s, and several memorials to members of the Belt family.\nSee also\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Buttercrambe with Bossall\n",

    "Scottish nurse and politician\nShona Morrison is a Scottish former nurse who is a politician in Moray. She has led the Moray Council and she is the President of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.\nLife\nMorrison was born in Kintyre and she went to an Inverness school. She did not go to university and she became a psychiatric nurse. After she left nursing she studied to take the degree that she had missed. Both of her daughters went to Aberdeen university. She had initially gained an interest in politics serving on her daughters' school council. In the 2017 Moray Council election she was elected as a councillor. She was a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP) and she represented the Fochabers Lhanbryde ward. She was elected to Moray Council and the following year the conservation-Independents coalition collapsed and her party came to power and she was responsible for Health and Social care. The SNP did not have a majority but Morrison found that she was the council's deputy leader.\nShe was re-elected in 2021. She was the council's chair of Equalities and she supported Moray Schools when they decided to fly the rainbow flag that year during Pride month. The flag was also flown at the council's offices in Elgin.\nFirst Minister John Swinney with Shona Morrison in 2024\nIn June 2022 she began to lead the 32 councils of Scotland as the 16th President of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA). She was the fourth woman to take that position and the first from the SNP. She took the position at a challenging time when there was a strike by refuse workers over pay. The dispute was settled.\nIn 2023 the Scottish Council for Development and Industry (SCDI) decided to relaunch itself under the new name of \"Prosper\" and as COSLA President she was invited to its launch.

    "Burmese army officer (c. before 1368 \u2013 c. 1413)\nSithu of Yamethin (Burmese: \u101b\u1019\u100a\u103a\u1038\u101e\u1004\u103a\u1038 \u1005\u100a\u103a\u101e\u1030, pronounced ; c.\u2009before 1368 \u2013 c.\u20091413), also known by his birth name Pauk Hla (), was governor of Yamethin from 1400 to c.\u20091413. He was eldest child of Chief Minister Min Yaza, and also served as a senior commander in the Royal Ava armed forces. He fought in all the major campaigns of the Forty Years' War between 1408 and 1412.\nEarly life\nProbably born before 1368, Pauk Hla was the eldest child of an athi commoner family of Nga Nyo and Me Chit from Wun Zin, a rural village in the Kingdom of Ava. He had at least two siblings: one full younger sister Saw Myat Lay, and a half younger brother, Saw Yin; he may have also had another younger brother.\nHe grew up in the royal capital of Ava (Inwa) from 1368 onwards. His father had entered the service of King Swa Saw Ke, and the entire family had moved to Ava since 1368. His father went on to become the chief minister of the court with the title of Min Yaza.\nCareer\nPauk Hla's career rose alongside his father's. His career defining appointment came in 1400 when the new king of Ava, Minkhaung I, appointed him governor of Yamethin, a major irrigated district traditionally held by the most senior royals, and gave him the command of a 50-strong royal war elephant company. The appointments came alongside Minkhaung's other appointments which included Yaza's son-in-law Thado Theinkhathu being made governor of Badon and Tabayin. The appointments were designed to retain Min Yaza's support by the new king, who had come to power only after a contentious succession crisis. Indeed, the Yamethin governorship previously belonged to Maha Pyauk of Yamethin, who had tried to seize the Ava throne from Minkhaung.\nPauk Hla, now known by the title of Sithu, loyally served as governor for the next dozen plus years. As governor of a major fief, Sithu served in the Royal Ava Armed Forces, and fought in various campaigns\u2014from Hanthawaddy in the south (1408\u20131410), to Arakan in the west (1411\u20131412) to Hsenwi in the northeast (1412). He led entire armies in the 1408, and 1409\u20131410 campaigns, and later served as one of the deputy commanders in Crown Prince Minye Kyawswa's armies from 1410 onwards.\nHe is not mentioned in the royal chronicles again after 1412. The Yazawin Thit chronicle cursorily mentions that King Minkhaung appointed Sithu Thihapate governor of Yamethin in late 1413 but does not say what had ever happened to the previous governor. While it is not clear if Sithu Pauk Hla had fallen in action or had died by natural causes, he did not lose the governorship because his father had lost power. Min Yaza remained the chief minister of the Ava court until his death in 1421.\nMilitary service\nThe following is a list of military campaigns in which Sithu of Yamethin is explicitly mentioned in the royal chronicles as a commander.\nNotes\n^ Per Khin Maung Nyunt, Pauk Hla's father Nga Nyo (b. 1347/48) married Me Chit when Nyo was in his late teens, meaning (c. 1365 or 1366). Nyunt continues that Nyo, Chit and their \"household\" moved to Ava in 1368, meaning at least the eldest child may have been born by then.\n^ The athi (\u1021\u101e\u100a\u103a) did not live on royal land and paid substantial taxes but owed no regular military service.\n^ The main chronicles mention only Saw Myat Lay as Pauk Hla's full sibling; and Gov. Saw Yin of Badon as his half-sibling. The Mani Yadanabon says Min Yaza had another son, governor of Yenantha without specifying the mother.\n^ Yamethin was one of the \"Five Irrigated Districts\" of Ava: (1) Yamethin, (2) Petpaing, (3) Pyakaung, (4) Taung Nyo and (5) Tamyinhsan\u2014all part of the modern Yamethin District. Previous governors of Yamethin include Swa Saw Ke later king of Ava; Thilawa of Yamethin and Maha Pyauk of Yamethin.\n^ The Yazawin Thit says King Minkhaung appointed Thihapate governor of Yamethin after the rainy season of 775 ME had ended (c. October/November 1413), citing a stone inscription about King Tabinshwehti's genealogy that lists Thihapate as governor of Yamethin.\n^ Chronicle reported troop levels reduced by an order of magnitude per (Harvey 1925: 333\u2013336)\n",

    "Former territorial unit of the Latin Church\nCathedral in Minsk\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Minsk was a territorial unit of the Latin Church, with its seat in the city of Minsk. It was established by imperial ukase on 28 April 1798, and approved by the Apostolic See by decree on 29 July 1798. It was abolished by imperial ukase in 1869.\nThe Diocese of Minsk was established in the territories of present-day Belarus, which in the 19th century belonged to the Russian Empire as part of the Russian Partition. Its boundaries were delineated by a triangle, with the northern (upper) vertex being the mouth of the Drissa river into the Daugava, and the base being a line to the south of the Pripyat river. It encompassed the area of the Minsk Governorate and bordered the dioceses of Vilnius, Lutsk, Zhytomyr, and Mogilev. Ecclesiastically, the Minsk diocese was part of the Mogilev diocese. Its area at the beginning of its existence was over 90,000\u00a0km2.\nThe period after the January Uprising was the decline of the diocese. It was abolished in 1869. The areas under its care were re-incorporated into the Vilnius diocese.\nCatholics in the Russian Empire in the second half of the 18th century\nCatholics in Russia before the First Partition of Poland\nCatherine the Great\nParts of the diocese of Vilnius and Inflanty, incorporated into Russia in 1772\nIn the middle of the 18th century, there were about 10,000 Latin Catholics living in the Orthodox Russian Empire. They were exclusively foreigners \u2013 Germans, French, Italians, and Poles. They gathered around churches in Moscow and St. Petersburg, as well as in the colonies of foreign evoys, workers, factories, and merchants.\nCatholic mission stations operating in various parts of the Russian Empire were subject to the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. By the decree of Catherine the Great on 6 November 1766, Catholic missions and communities were subordinated to the Inflanck-Estonian-Finnish Justiz College. On 12 February 1769, the empress signed the Dannyj Sanktpetersburgsoj Rimsko-Katoli\u010deskoj Cerkvi regulation, specifying the conditions for the activities of Catholic communities in Russia.\nAs a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Russia expanded its territory by about 92,000\u00a0km2, inhabited by about 1.3 million people, including about 100,000 Roman Catholics and about 800,000 Greek Catholics. In terms of the administrative structures of the Roman Catholic Church, Russia received the Diocese of Smolensk and parts of the Vilnius and Inflanty provinces belonging to the Archdiocese of Gniezno.\nCatherine the Great's policy toward Catholics\nAs a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Russia acquired eastern territories with a significant Catholic population. This posed a challenge for organizing the Catholic Church. Anticipating demands from the Roman Curia and having a negative attitude towards the papacy, Catherine the Great decided to address this issue independently. Not recognizing the papal authority over the Catholic Church in the Russian Empire and desiring to eliminate any external influence over it in Russia, Catherine the Great established, by decree on 22 November 1773, the Belarusian Diocese with its seat in Mogilev on the Dnieper river. She appointed Stanis\u0142aw Bohusz Siestrze\u0144cewicz, a suffragan bishop of Vilnius, who was to implement her policies towards the Catholic Church and its followers. On the empress' orders, the bishop, among other things, did not announce the papal brief of Clement XIV on the suppression of the Jesuits, as Catherine the Great believed that the order would positively contribute to the development of education in Russia. With authority over the orders in Russia, Siestrze\u0144cewicz opened a novitiate for the Jesuits in Polotsk. The Belarusian Diocese did not receive canonical approval from the Apostolic See because it was established in violation of canon law principles.\nIn the 1770s, Catherine the Great introduced restrictions on the contacts of the Catholic clergy in Russia with the Apostolic See, subjected the monastic clergy to the Belarusian bishop, and prohibited the Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, who remained in the Commonwealth, from assuming jurisdiction over the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Polotsk. There was a real threat to the Greek Catholic faithful, as there were discussions in St. Petersburg about appointing an Orthodox bishop to the Uniate diocese. The decree of 13 July 1780 defined Catherine the Great's policy towards the Greek Catholic Church in Russia, condemning it to gradual absorption by the Orthodox Church. As a result of such activities, the Pope, fearing the abolition of the Union and the loss of about 1.2 million faithful, was forced to seek ways of agreement with Catherine the Great. Diplomatic relations between Russia and the Apostolic See were established after 17 January 1782, when the empress unilaterally established the archbishopric of Mogilev headed by Siestrz",

    "The corps headquarters, the LSU Military Science building,\nThe Louisiana State University Corps of Cadets is a student military organization at Louisiana State University, being one of the oldest student organization on campus. Students who elect to join the Corps must participate in mandatory Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) courses, and receive commissions as officers in the United States armed forces upon graduation. Current membership exceeds 300 cadets in LSU's Army and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps, to include those who participate in the Naval ROTC program at Southern University (LSU itself lacks a Naval ROTC program, with numerous cadets cross affiliating with the program at SU).\nHistory\nThe program's roots trace back to LSU's founding in 1860 under General William T. Sherman, when the campus functioned as a former military post of the Union Army adjacent to present-day Baton Rouge. In 1884, the General Assembly of Louisiana passed a resolution allocating the full usage of the buildings and grounds of the Pentagon Barracks to LSU, where they were used as dormitories for cadets. Cadets were housed there until 1932. \u00a0During World War II, LSU was in the top five schools producing officers for the military, after Texas A&M University, the United States Military Academy, and the United States Naval Academy. Amidst the backdrop of the Vietnam War in the 1960s, the LSU Board of Supervisors converted the ROTC program to voluntary status due to escalating tensions on campus. In 1969, mandatory ROTC for freshmen and sophomores at LSU at large was abolished. The Corps at the time consisted of over 3,000 members, a number which experienced a decline post-1969.\nConstituent ROTC units\nTiger Battalion (Army ROTC)\nDetachment 310 (Air Force ROTC)\nSouthern University Redstick Battalion (Naval ROTC)\nCommandant of Cadets\nMajor General Sanderford Jarman (1916\u201317)\nTroy Middleton (1930\u20131936)\nColonel Wade Pertuit (2013\u20132016)\nColonel Lisa O\u2019Neil (since 2023)\nSee also\nTexas A&M University Corps of Cadets\nExternal links\nOfficial Website\n",
    "Theorem in probability theory\nThe Yamada\u2013Watanabe theorem is a result from probability theory saying that for a large class of stochastic differential equations a weak solution with pathwise uniqueness implies a strong solution and uniqueness in distribution. In its original form, the theorem was stated for -dimensional It\u00f4 equations and was proven by the Japanese mathematicians Toshio Yamada and Shinz\u014d Watanabe in 1971. Since then, many generalizations appeared particularly one for general semimartingales by Jean Jacod from 1980.\nYamada\u2013Watanabe theorem\nHistory, generalizations and related results\nJean Jacod generalized the result to SDEs of the form\nwhere  is a semimartingale and the coefficient  can depend on the path of .\nFurther generalisations were done by Hans-J\u00fcrgen Engelbert (1991) and Thomas G. Kurtz (2007). For SDEs in Banach spaces there is a result from Martin Ondrejat (2004), one by Michael R\u00f6ckner, Byron Schmuland and Xicheng Zhang (2008) and one by Stefan Tappe (2013).\nThe converse of the theorem is also true and called the dual Yamada\u2013Watanabe theorem. The first version of this theorem was proven by Engelbert (1991) and a more general version by Alexander Cherny (2002).\nSetting\nLet  and  be the space of continuous functions. Consider the -dimensional It\u00f4 equation\nwhere\n and  are predictable processes,\n is an -dimensional Brownian Motion,\n is deterministic.\nBasic terminology\nWe say uniqueness in distribution (or weak uniqueness), if for two arbitrary solutions  and  defined on (possibly different) filtered probability spaces   and , we have for their distributions , where .\nWe say pathwise uniqueness  (or strong uniqueness) if any two solutions  and , defined on the same filtered probability spaces  with the same -Brownian motion, are indistinguishable processes, i.e. we have -almost surely that \nTheorem\nAssume the described setting above is valid, then the theorem is:\nIf there is pathwise uniqueness, then there is also uniqueness in distribution. And if for every initial distribution, there exists a weak solution, then for every initial distribution, also a pathwise unique strong solution exists.\nJacod's result improved the statement with the additional statement that\nIf a weak solutions exists and pathwise uniqueness holds, then this solution is also a strong solution.\n",

    "Michael O'Connor (1801 \u2013 25 June 1867) was an Irish stained-glass artist based successively in Dublin, Bristol and London.  A pupil of Thomas Willement, he developed a Gothic Revival style under the influence of Augustus Pugin, with whom he worked.  He acquired a high reputation, and was commissioned to create windows for several cathedrals in England, Wales and Ireland.  He is now seen as one of the leading stained-glass artists of his generation working in Britain.  His stained-glass firm survived his death, initially under the management of his sons, and lasted until 1915.\nCareer\nMichael O'Connor, born in Dublin, began his professional life as a heraldic artist, but along with many other early 19th-century practitioners of that art he decided to move into the renascent field of stained-glass design.  Going to London in 1823, he studied this art under Thomas Willement, one of the leaders of the revival of stained-glass manufacture in Britain, and then returned to Dublin to establish his own business.  In an 1839 trade directory he is listed as a \"professor of heraldry, stained glass enameller, and ornamental painter, print & bookseller, and fancy stationer\".  He exhibited stained-glass designs at this time at the Royal Hibernian Academy.  He moved his business to Bristol in 1842, and there began to work with Augustus Pugin, under whose influence he adopted a neo-medieval style later to be praised by Pevsner for its avoidance of \"Victorian dimness and fussiness of small detail\".  One of their notable collaborations was on the glass for St Saviour's Church, Leeds.  In 1845 he made his final move, to London, where he set up business premises at 4 Berners Street.  O'Connor's collaborators included not just Pugin but William Butterfield, William Warrington, and his own son, Arthur O'Connor, with whom he went into partnership by 1852.  By the 1850s he had acquired a high reputation, and was selected for inclusion in the Great Exhibition of 1851.  He nevertheless, as a Catholic, suffered from religious prejudice which hindered his efforts to get commissions from the Church of England authorities for prestigious projects, and resulted in 1862 in the firm's newly installed windows for the Anglican church in Enniskerry, St Patrick's, being smashed by Protestant demonstrators.  The firm  did, however, make windows during and after Michael O'Connor's lifetime for the Royal Chapel of All Saints, Christchurch Priory, Peterborough Cathedral, Salisbury Cathedral, Llandaff Cathedral (the glass was destroyed by enemy action in 1941), Tuam Cathedral, Chichester Cathedral, Clontarf Castle, and the chapels of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Balliol College, Oxford, and Eton College.  In 1856 O'Connor developed problems with his eyesight which increasingly necessitated his assigning work to his sons Arthur and William Henry.  The style of the firm's glass can be seen to have changed at about this time, losing much of Michael O'Connor's simplicity.  Forced to retire by failing health, O'Connor died on 25 June 1867.\nLater history of the company\nO'Connor's sons William Henry and Arthur continued the firm successfully after his death, expanding their activities into the field of painting as well as continuing the design of stained-glass windows.  By 1873, the year Arthur died, the company had changed its name from O'Connor and Sons to O'Connor and Taylor.  The new partner, William George Taylor, was perhaps brought in more for his business expertise than for artistic talent.  In 1877 the name changed again to Taylor and O'Connor.  It adopted its final name, Taylor and Clifton, in 1902, and continued in business until 1915.\nCitations\n^ a b c d Banerjee 2021.\n^ Cowen, Painton (1985). A Guide to Stained Glass in Britain.

    "International football competition\nThe 1957 Tournoi de Paris was the first edition of Tournoi de Paris, a association football intercontinental competition between European and South American clubs. In particular, the inaugural edition is considered the precursor of the Intercontinental Cup by FIFA, as it had the only continental champion clubs at the time (Vasco da Gama in 1948 South American Championship and Real Madrid in 1955\u201356 European Cup) competing in the final.\nVasco da Gama defeated Real Madrid 4\u20133 in the final in front of more than 65,000 spectators.\nBackground\nThe competition was organized by the Racing Club de Paris in celebration of its 25th anniversary. Real Madrid were invited to participate in the competition as 1955\u201356 European Cup champions, and accepted a few days before winning the 1956\u201357 edition. Vasco da Gama's participation took place in the midst of the club's tour of the US and Europe, with several European newspapers citing Vasco as \"Brazilian champion of 1956\" for having won the 1956 Campeonato Carioca (there was no national competition at the time). Furthermore, Vasco held the title of South American champion after winning the 1948 South American Championship of Champions and no other South American tournament of the same proportion had taken place until the 1960 Copa Libertadores. Finally, Rot-Weiss Essen, the German champions at the time were invited, as Germany was the current champion of the FIFA World Cup.\nTeams\nSquads\nRacing Paris\nSource: \nManager:  Auguste Jordan\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Would it be the pale red shirts or the sad blue shorts that weakened the superb Spanish team? No. Rather, the wonderful bodies suddenly appeared on the other side, wrapped tightly in white shirts with a black stripe, of 11 football athletes, of 11 black devils who took control of the ball and never let go. During the next half hour the incredible, prodigious impression one had was that the great Real Madrid champion of Europe, the untouchable Real winner of all European constellations was learning to play football\". The newspaper France Soir stated after the tournament: \"Real Madrid is not the greatest team in the world. Talk to Vasco da Gama about that\", and the Jornal dos Sports cited Vasco as \"world champions\". The Spanish newspaper ABC de Madrid wrote that \"Real Madrid were no longer invincible\".\nAccording to the Brazilian newspaper Tribuna de Imprensa, the tournament inspired FIFA president Jo\u00e3o Havelange and European Cup co-founder Jacques Ferran to create the Intercontinental Cup. In 2023, FIFA recognized as \"the most notable meeting between teams from two continents meeting before 1960\".\n",
    "Health of rabbits\nEngraving of a wild rabbit and its skeleton by Johann Daniel Meyer (1752)\nThe health of rabbits is well studied in veterinary medicine, owing to the importance of rabbits as laboratory animals and centuries of domestication for fur and meat.\nDisease in pet rabbits is rare when they are raised in sanitary conditions and provided with adequate care, but the wider population of wild and feral rabbits is susceptible to various diseases and disorders, which has been taken advantage of in research and population control. Rabbits have fragile bones, especially in their spines, and need support on the bottom when they are picked up.\nSpaying and neutering\nNeutering is possible for both female and male rabbits; however, spaying females can pose significant risks. This is because spaying female rabbits requires a far bigger surgery with a higher mortality rate (during or in relation to the procedure) compared to males, as their lower abdomen needs to be opened up in order to remove ovaries and uterus. In addition, spaying is known to have severe negative effects on a female rabbit's health. One particularly dangerous consequence is the development of osteoporosis due to the lack of estrogen caused by the removal of the ovaries, which, among other things, greatly increases the risk of dental problems and bone fractures. Other negative health outcomes that have been reported include colonic obstruction, urinary incontinence, ureteral stenosis, increased ageing of ligaments, and alterations of the rabbit's cornea. In general, due to the wide range and severity of possible negative health effects and the high risk for complications from anesthesia and the surgery itself, spaying female rabbits should only be considered in case of acute medical reasons (e.g., ovarian or uterine cancer), if they show signs of hormonal problems, like overly frequent phases of heat or pseudopregnancies, or unusually aggressive behavior, which cannot be attributed to environmental factors, e.g., a lack of exercise. As of today, assertions of female rabbits near inevitably developing cancer if left unneutered, as well as neutered females living longer, have no scientific foundation.\nHowever, castration of male pet rabbits is necessary, if they are to be kept species-appropriate (together with at least one other rabbit), which wouldn't otherwise be possible. Uncastrated male rabbits will engage in severe and often bloody fights with each other upon reaching adulthood, which can even end fatally. To prevent uncontrolled reproduction, it is advised to castrate males instead of females, as the necessary procedure, which requires only a small incision, has proven to be relatively safe and to have far less adverse effects on the rabbit's overall health.\nVaccinations\nIn most jurisdictions, including the United States (except where required by local animal control ordinances), rabbits do not require vaccination. Vaccinations exist for both rabbit hemorrhagic disease and myxomatosis. These vaccinations are usually given annually, two weeks apart. If there is an outbreak of myxomatosis locally, this vaccine can be administered every six months for extra protection. Myxomatosis immunizations are not available in all countries, including Australia, due to fears that immunity will pass on to feral rabbits. However, they are recommended by some veterinarians as prophylactics, where they are legally available.:\u200a182\u200a\nDeclawing\nA rabbit cannot be declawed. Lacking pads on the bottoms of its feet, a rabbit requires its claws for traction. Removing its claws would render it unable to stand.\nTonic immobility\nCoping with stress is a key aspect of rabbit behavior, and this can be traced to part of the brain known as ventral tegmental area (VTA). Dopaminergic neurons in this part of the brain release the hormone dopamine. In rabbits, it is released as part of a coping mechanism while in a heightened state of fear or stress, and has a calming effect. Dopamine has also been found in the rabbit's medial prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the amygdala.\nTonic immobility (TI) is sometimes called \"trancing\" or \"playing dead\". Physiological and behavioral responses to human-induced TI have been found to indicate a fear-motivated stress state in rabbits. Accordingly, even though people think the rabbits enjoy it, the promotion of TI to try to increase a bond between rabbits and their owners is misplaced. However, some researchers conclude that inducing TI in rabbits is appropriate for certain medical procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia.\nSore hocks\nThe formation of open sores on the rabbit's hocks, commonly called sore hocks, is a problem that commonly afflicts mostly heavy-weight rabbits kept in cages with wire flooring or soiled solid flooring.  The problem is most prevalent in rex-furred rabbits and heavy-weight rabbits (over 4\u00a0kg (9\u00a0lb)), as well as those with thin foot bristles.\nThe condition results when, over the course of time",

The episode was written by co-executive producer Shannon Goss, and directed by Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m. It was released on Hulu on March 5, 2024, and it also aired on FX on the same day.\nThe series is set in 1600, and follows three characters. John Blackthorne, a risk-taking English sailor who ends up shipwrecked in Japan, a land whose unfamiliar culture will ultimately redefine him; Lord Toranaga, a shrewd, powerful daimyo, at odds with his own dangerous, political rivals; and Lady Mariko, a woman with invaluable skills but dishonorable family ties, who must prove her value and allegiance. In the episode, Blackthorne and Toranaga set out to leave Osaka Castle, while evading assassins. \nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.492 million household viewers and gained a 0.09 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349. The episode received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised the battle sequences and directing. \nPlot\nYabushige meets with Toranaga, right after writing his will. Toranaga reveals the assassination attempt on Blackthorne, and suspects that Yabushige acted on Ishido's orders, which he denies. Worried about their safety, Toranaga decides to leave Osaka with Blackthorne and his wife Kiri, planning to move to the more secure Ajiro. After passing Ishido's suspicions, Toranaga secretly switches places with Kiri's litter, which is witnessed by Blackthorne and Mariko. When Ishido's men insist on checking the litter, Blackthorne provokes an argument to distract them until they are permitted to leave.\nFerreira, captain-general of the Black Ship, is annoyed by the constant delays in shipping and decides to sail without receiving permission from Toranaga. That night, Kiyama's men attack the caravan, forcing Toranaga to expose himself to help organize a defense. They are forced to race towards a ship to take them to Anjiro, but Mariko's husband, Toda \"Buntaro\" Hirokatsu, chooses to stay behind to distract their pursuers and give them time to reach the harbor. Realizing that Kiyama has sent additional men to intercept his vessel, Toranaga makes a deal with the Portuguese to let his entourage board the Black Ship. Ferreira allows him to board but prohibits Blackthorne from joining them.\nUsing his connection to the Black Ship, Blackthorne, with Rodrigues' assistance, breaks through the blockade and persuades Toranaga to rejoin him aboard his own ship. Back in Osaka, Iron Fist Hiromatsu informs the Council of Regents on Toranaga's behalf that he has officially resigned from his position. At sea, Toranaga confronts Blackthorne over the Portuguese allegations that he is a pirate, but states that he will not be charged as it will take a great deal of time to \"translate\" any evidence of such crimes. He grants him the rank of hatamoto so that he may assist Yabushige with training a new regiment in Western-style tactics. Despite initially hesitating, Blackthorne agrees. He then shows Toranaga how to dive into the water, and they decide to compete in a race towards the nearest shore.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn February 2024, Hulu confirmed that the third episode of the series would be titled \"Tomorrow Is Tomorrow\", and was to be written by co-executive producer Shannon Goss and directed by Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m. It was Goss' first writing credit, and Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m's first directing credit.\nWriting\nJustin Marks considered the boat race as the hardest scene to film in the series. He explained that Toranaga's stare at Blackthorne when he is left behind could be interpreted as \"is this a guy who just destiny swallows up or is this the guy who's going to make his own fate in some way.\" He hoped that the episode would test the loyalty that the characters would convey during these sequences, raising the question if they can trust each other.:\u200a1:30\u20133:48\u200a\nSet design\nProduction designer Helen Jarvis worked on the design of the two ships shown in the episode. The Black Ship was entrusted with showing the character with \"a certain kind of not sinister aspect to them\" and the ship \"just seemed to echo that.\" In contrast, the Japanese galley used by Toranaga is depicted with much lighter, unfinished wood:\u200a14:25\u201315:22\u200a\nReception\nViewers\nIn its original FX broadcast, \"Tomorrow Is Tomorrow\" was seen by an estimated 0.492 million household viewers and gained a 0.09 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349, according to Nielsen Media Research. This means that 0.09 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a 36% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was seen by an estimated 0.764 million household viewers and gained a 0.14 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349.\nCritical reviews\n\"Tomorrow Is Tomorrow\" received highly positive reviews from c",
    "Italian architectural historian (1929\u20132024)\nRenato De Fusco (14 July 1929 \u2013 30 April 2024) was an Italian architectural historian, art theorist and academic. He was professor emeritus of the University of Naples Federico II.\nLife and career\nBorn in Naples, De Fusco studied architecture at the University of Naples Federico II, graduating in 1959. Initially interested in painting, he was part of the art movements \"Gruppo Sud\" and \"MAC (Movimento Arte Concreta)\".\nAfter working as a designer and as an architect for a series of projects, notably a complex of public housing buildings in the Montedonzelli neighborhood in his hometown,  and after collaborating with the Institute of Architectural History directed by Roberto Pane and with the magazine Casabella, in 1961 he started his academic journey in his alma mater, first as a lecturer and starting from 1972 as an ordinary professor.

    "Welsh shadow cabinet\nDafydd Wigley became Leader of the Opposition and Shadow First Secretary of Wales after the creation of the National Assembly for Wales on 12 May 1999, following the first assembly election held on 6 May. Members of his shadow cabinet were elected by Plaid Cymru's assembly members and announced on 18 May.\nIn December 1999, Wigley temporarily delegated his responsibilities to Ieuan Wyn Jones due to ill health, who became acting leader of the opposition and Plaid Cymru. He resumed his responsibilities in February 2000 but later announced his resignation in May 2000 to focus on his health. In August 2000, Jones was elected to succeed him as Plaid Cymru's leader, becoming the new Leader of the Opposition and forming a new shadow cabinet.\nBackground\nDafydd Wigley was elected unopposed as President of Plaid Cymru in the 1991 Plaid Cymru presidential election, having previously served as the president of the party from 1981 to 1984. Plaid Cymru, a party traditionally supportive of Welsh independence, campaigned for the establishment of a devolved Welsh legislature in the 1990s with the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. After UK Labour formed a government following the 1997 UK general election, it held a referendum in Wales on establishing a devolved Welsh assembly, which returned a narrow majority in favour of establishing an assembly. The first election to the National Assembly for Wales was held on 6 May 1999, and it met for the first time on 12 May 1999.\nAt the election in May 1999, Plaid Cymru made gains against Labour, which had traditionally dominated Welsh politics, winning 17 seats and causing Labour to unexpectedly fall short of an overall majority. Labour became the largest party in the assembly with 28 assembly members (AMs) and formed a minority administration with its leader Alun Michael elected as the inaugural First Secretary of Wales at the first plenary session of the National Assembly on 12 May. Michael announced his cabinet at the same session, appointing nine Labour AMs to serve as ministers, officially known as assembly secretaries, in the devolved government of Wales.\nAs the second largest party in the assembly with 17 AMs, Plaid Cymru formed the official opposition to the Labour administration, enabling it to act as a government-in-waiting in accordance with the Westminster system of government traditionally practiced across the United Kingdom. Wigley was elected as AM for Caernarfon and became the first Leader of the Opposition of Wales as the leader of Plaid Cymru in the assembly.  As the official opposition in the assembly, Plaid Cymru was expected to scrutinise the policies and governance of the devolved administration, propose alternative policies and lead assembly debates. To fulfill these duties, Wigley was expected to form and lead a shadow cabinet made up of shadow ministers who would mirror the roles of devolved ministers in the Welsh Cabinet and lead the party in scrutinising the Labour administration and its ministers. The two other opposition parties, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, announced their frontbench teams on 13 May 1999. Wigley said he would announce his shadow cabinet on 18 May, at the second plenary session of the National Assembly. He did not personally appoint the members of the shadow cabinet like other party leaders; members were instead elected to their positions by Plaid Cymru's seventeen AMs.\nHistory\nOn 18 May, the members of the Shadow Cabinet were announced. Wigley was elected as Shadow First Secretary and Shadow Assembly Secretary for Finance. Other elections to the Shadow Cabinet included Ynys M\u00f4n AM Ieuan Wyn Jones as Shadow Trefnydd/Business Manager and Opposition Chief Whip, Llanelli AM Helen Mary Jones as Shadow Assembly Secretary for Social Inclusion and Equal Opportunity, Mid and West Wales AM Cynog Dafis as Plaid Cymru Policy Co-ordinator in the Welsh Assembly, South Wales East AM Phil Williams as Shadow Assembly Secretary for Economic Development, Conwy AM Gareth Jones as Shadow Assembly Secretary for Education and Childcare, Ceredigion AM Elin Jones as Shadow Assembly Secretary for Education and Training, Carmarthen East and Dinefwr AM Rhodri Glyn Thomas as Shadow Assembly Secretary for Agriculture and Rural Development, North Wales AM Janet Ryder as Shadow Assembly Secretary for the Environment, Local Government and Planning, and South Wales West AM Dai Lloyd as Shadow Assembly Secretary for Health and Social Services. Unlike the nine-member Labour cabinet led by First Secretary Alun Michael, the Shadow Cabinet had ten members; Helen Mary Jones took on a shadow portfolio for social inclusion and equal opportunity, which did not have an equivalent in Michael's administration.\nIn December 1999, Wigley had to undergo a minor heart surgery operation due to a heart condition and ill health. In response, he introduced a new deputy leadership role, although an officeholder was never appointed to actually fill the posi",
    "\n1998 studio album by Richie Jen\nLove Like Pacific Ocean (Chinese: \u611b\u50cf\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b; pinyin: Ai Xiang Tai Ping Yang), is the seventh studio album by Taiwanese recording artist Richie Jen. It was released via Rock Records on August 28, 1998. The album spawned the singles \"The Sad Pacific\" and \"Hey Girl Look Over Here\". The album sold over 1,200,000 copies in Taiwan, becoming one of the country's best-selling albums of all time.\nBackground and release\nLove Like Pacific Ocean was released through Rock Records on August 28, 1998. It spawned two singles that were promoted by Jen: \"The Sad Pacific\" and \"Hey Girl Look Over Here\". The latter track is a cover of Malaysian singer Ah Niu's song of the same name. \"Hey Girl Look Over Here\" was released as a CD single on October 16, 1998.\nSongs\n\"The Sad Pacific\" is a rendition of the song \"Sachi\", originally penned by musician Miyuki Nakajima for Japanese recording artist Sachiko Kobayashi. Jen's upbringing in a military community became the lyrical inspiration for the song, which aimed to capture the virtues of brotherhood, loyalty, and selflessness. \"Hey Girl Look Over Here\", originally recorded and composed by Ah Niu, was inspired by a girl who attended an English school across from his own. The song boosted Ah Niu's popularity across Asia following its release in 1997. \"Hey Girl Look Over Here\" was later covered by Jen and included on Love Like Pacific Ocean.\nThe album also features \"I Am Free\", the opening theme for the historical martial arts drama The Return of the Condor Heroes (1998), which Jen himself starred in. Prior to recording the song, composer and musician Johnny Chen invited Jen for a card game. In the aftermath of Jen's defeat, Chen asked him to record the song, channeling a sense of chivalrous yet tender melancholy.\nCommercial performance\nLove Like Pacific Ocean experienced commercial success upon its release. The album reached number one on the weekly International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) Taiwan album chart during the week of September 14, 1998, becoming his first and only number one studio album on the chart, which shut down in 1999. It remained at the top position for two consecutive weeks. The album garnered sales of over 1,200,000 copies in Taiwan and is one of the best-selling albums of all time in the country.\nElsewhere in Asia, Love Like Pacific Ocean reached number seven on the IFPI Hong Kong album chart during the week of October 4, 1998. In Malaysia, the album reached number ten on the RIM album chart during the week of October 13.\nAccolades\nIn 1998, Jen won the Best Male Singer Award in the 5th Global Chinese Music Awards while \"Hey Girl Look Over Here\" was named one the Top 20 Most Popular Songs of the year.\nTrack listing\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nSales\n",

    "Kingdom in Central India\nThe Kingdom of Malwa was a monarchy in central India that was established by Jayavarman of the House of Aulikara in 350 AD. It was ruled by multiple royal houses discontinuously until it was finally conquered in 1562 by Akbar the Great, the Shahenshah of Hindustan, and annexed as the Malwa Province.\nThe Kingdom of Avanti of ancient India had been based in the region where the Kingdom of Malwa later came up. The Kingdom of Avanti was conquered by Indo-Scythia in 61 BC. Following this, the region was ruled by the Malava republic. During the period, the region's name gradually changed to Malava or Malwa. In 350 AD, Jayavarman established the Kingdom of Malwa in region and founded the House of Aulikara. Yashodharman, the King of Malwa between 515 and 545 AD significantly expanded the kingdom and conquered the territories of Huns. Following his death, Krishnaraja became the King of Malwa and founded the House of Kalachuri in 550 AD.\nThe Kingdom of Malwa was conquered and ruled by Harsha, the Emperor of Kannauj between 625 and 647 AD after which regained it's independence until being conquered by the Gurjara Empire in 755 AD. Hereafter it formed a part of the Gurjara Empire until it regained its independence in 948 under the House of Paramara until it was conquered by the Delhi Sultanate in 1305. In 1401, the governor of Malwa declared his independence and established the Sultanate of Malwa under the House of Khalji which reigned till its conquest by Akbar, the Shahenshah of Hindustan in 1562.\nHistory\nHouse of Aulikara (350\u2013530)\nThe region where the Kingdom of Malwa was established had earlier been part of the Malava republic. The Malavas had been a tribe from northwestern India who conquered and established their rule over the Malwa region sometime after the fall of the Kingdom of Avanti (61 BC). They formed an oligarchic republic and maintained their rule over Malwa until 350 AD. Jayavarman, a Malava chief, deposed the republican government and established the Kingdom of Malwa and the House of Aulikara. Taking advantage of the confusion created during the reign of Rudrasena III, the Saka Satrap of Gujarat for thirteen years, from 351 to 364 AD, Jayavarman seized the territory near Mandsor from the Sakas. In 423 AD, Viswavarman accepted the suzerainty of Kumaragupta I, the Emperor of Magadha. In 467 AD, following the succession crisis after the death of Emperor Skandagupta of Magadha, Prabhakara became an independent monarch.\nFurther north, the First Hunnic War began in 496 between the Hunnic Empire and the Magadha Empire and the Huns conquered parts of Central and Northwest India by 510. However, in 515 during the reign of Yashodharman, the Kingdom of Malwa joined the War in aid of Magadha and managed to defeat the Huns. The Hunnic King Toramana died from war injuries after a battle with the Magadhan Emperor Narasimhagupta.\nIn 520, the Second Hunnic War began after the son of Tomara, Mihirakula, King of the Huns invaded the Magadhan Empire once more and occupied and sacked Patliputra, the Magadhan capital. Following this, Malwa formed an alliance with the Kingdom of Thanesar and in 528, defeated the Hunnic Empire.\nHouse of Kalachuri (530\u2013625)\nIn 530 AD, Yashodharman died without any heirs. Seeing this Krishnaraja seized power and became the King of Malwa and established the House of Kalachuri. His son, Shankaragana (r. 575\u2013600) conquered parts of the Magadhan Empire. Shankaragana' son, Buddharaja (r. 600\u2013625) was defeated by Chalukyas and lost southern territories and was ultimately defeated and conquered by the Kannauj Empire under Harsha.\nKannauj Interregnum to Rashtrakuta feudatory\nHarsha of the Kannauj Empire conquered Malwa around 625 of which it remained a part until his death 647. Following this the history of Malwa is mostly unknown. In 756 AD, the Gurjara Empire conquered Malwa. In 786, the Rashtrakuta Empire conquered the region from the Gurjaras. During this period, Malwa was made a vassal kingdom under the House of Paramara.\nHouse of Paramara (947\u20131305)\nIn 947 AD, Siyaka, the ruler of Malwa and vassal of the Rashtrakuta Empire declared his independence. His son Munja defeated Sambhar, Mewar, Tripuri, Nadol and Gurjaratra. However, in 998, the Chalukya Kingdom of Kalyani defeated and conquered the southern territories of Malwa. His brother succeeded him and defeated Kalyani kingdom and took back the lost territories. His grandson Bhoja (r. 1010\u20131055) made extensive conquests. He made an alliance between the Kingdom of Tripuri, the Chola empire and the Kingdom of Malwa and defeated the Kingdom of Kalyani. In 1048, the Kingdom of Kalyani invaded and sacked the capital of Malwa, and forced to cede territories up till the Narmada.\nAfter his death, he was succeeded by his son. Jayasimha I was defeated by an alliance of Gujarat and Tripuri. Jayasimha's successor and Bhoja's brother Udayaditya was defeated by Chamundaraja, his vassal at Vagada. He repulsed an invasion by the King of",

    "Spanish footballer\nGuillermo Galiardo Armijo (1876 \u2013 16 August 1950) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for RCD Espanyol. He also played a few unofficial matches for FC Barcelona.\nPlaying career\nGuillermo Galiardo was born in 1876 in Granada, but it was in Barcelona where he began to play football, being one of the pioneers of RCD Espanyol, since he was always present in the entity's squads from its foundation until 1911. He was one of the main strongholds of the club during Espanyol's first decade of existence, being thus named into the club's best starting eleven of the 1900s. He was a player respected by his teammates, a basic part of the team and, according to the testimony of Juli\u00e0 Clapera, he was a midfielder who charged with remarkable toughness, and who amused himself by practicing aiming with a ball kicked against the steam train that was circulating along the d'Aribau street. His brother Arturo also played in the team, but with much less prominence.\nTogether with \u00c1ngel Ponz, Joaquim Carril, Emilio Sampere, and Gustavo Green, he was part of the team that won the third edition of the Copa Macaya in 1902\u201303, the club's first-ever piece of silverware, playing 5 matches, and which then won the first edition of the Catalan championship in 1903\u201304, playing 8 matches.\nGaliardo remained loyal to the club until 1905, when Espa\u00f1ol had to suspend its activities, and most of the remaining players, including him, Sampere, Ponz, and goalkeeper Pedro Gibert, joined X Sporting Club, and together with them, plus the Massana brothers (Santiago and Alfredo) and Jos\u00e9 Ir\u00edzar, he helped X win the 1905\u201306 Catalan championship. He then decided to return to Barcelona, where he played two unofficial matches for FC Barcelona]] in April 1906, the first against Athletic Club (1\u20130) and the second against San Sebasti\u00e1n Recreation Club (1\u20133). In 1909, following a 3-year hiatus, Espanyol was finally and effectively relaunched, so Galiardo then played with Espanyol for two more years until 1911.\nInternational career\nOn 24 September 1903, Galiardo participated in a test match between a white and a red team made up of players who were playing in Barcelona, which was meant to decide who would integrate the first team of the Catalonia national team the following year.\nDeath\nGaliardo died in Malaga on 16 August 1950, at the age of either 73 or 74.\nHonours\nRCD Espanyol\nCopa Macaya:\nChampions: 1902\u201303\nCopa Barcelona:\nRunner-up: 1902\u201303\nCatalan Championships:\nChampions: 1903\u201304\n",
    "Players added to a team's roster during playoffsIn ice hockey, particularly the National Hockey League (NHL), Black Aces are players that are added to a team's roster during the Stanley Cup playoffs. They often consist of minor league players in the team's organization, and practice with the team during the playoffs in case of any injury or otherwise to players in the lineup.\nOrigin\nThe term \"Black Ace\" refers to the poker hand known as the dead man's hand, which includes the two black ace cards. The term was first applied in a hockey sense by Hockey Hall of Famer Eddie Shore, who, when he owned the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League (AHL), would use the term \"Black Ace\" to refer to extra players on his roster who were returning from injury. Don Cherry, who was one of Shore's \"Black Aces\", wrote in his book Grapes: A Vintage View of Hockey, that Black Aces, in addition to practicing with the team, would also have to do extra maintenance around the arena, such as painting seats and selling popcorn.\nBackground\nAfter the NHL trade deadline, the league's 23-man roster limit ends. In addition, the salary cap does not exist in the NHL postseason, allowing teams in the playoff picture to have as many Black Aces as they want on their roster. However, it is important to note that often, Black Aces come from the AHL, so oftentimes they are not called up to the NHL squad until after their season has finished, whether that be after the regular season, or once their team is eliminated from the Calder Cup Playoffs.\nOnce they are called up, Black Aces practice and train with the NHL team, just as any other player would. Although they often do not play in any games, Black Aces are always expected to be prepared in the event that a player gets injured.\nThe NHL rules for a player to get their name engraved on the Stanley Cup states that they must appear in at least 40 regular season games, or at least one Stanley Cup Finals game. As such, many Black Aces are not automatically eligible for this honor. However, there have been cases where Black Aces have contributed to the championship run, and their team petitions for their name to be engraved (See the 1994 New York Rangers below).\nBlack Aces celebrate with the team if they win the Stanley Cup. Occasionally the Black Aces might dress in full during the final game, despite not playing the deciding game.\nNotable Black Aces\nThe Black Aces of the 1994 New York Rangers played an integral role in the team's Stanley Cup championship. Notable names include Eddie Olczyk, Doug Lidster, and Nick Kypreos, all of whom saw action during the playoff run. Although some of the Black Aces, like Lidster and Kypreos, automatically qualified to have their name engraved, others, such as Olczyk, Mike Hartman, and Mike Hudson, needed the Rangers to petition for them. The organization did, and successfully got their name engraved on the Cup.\nDuring the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, Dallas Stars forward Joel Kiviranta was a Black Ace, and was inserted into the lineup in Game 7 of the team's second round matchup against the Colorado Avalanche. Kiviranta scored a hat-trick, including the overtime winner, to advance the Stars.\nAfter multiple injuries to the Carolina Hurricanes lineup, Black Ace Mackenzie MacEachern was inserted into the playoff lineup in Game 4 of the team's first round matchup against the New York Islanders, making his debut for the Hurricanes, as well as playing his first NHL game of the 2022-23 season. MacEachern would score two points in the game, including his first NHL playoff goal, as well as assisting on Sebastian Aho's goal that saw Aho break the Hurricanes all-time playoff scoring record. The Hurricanes would win the game 5-2, and MacEachern had a solid presence in the Hurricanes lineup before they were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals by the Florida Panthers.\nArt\u016brs \u0160ilovs was called up to the NHL as a Black Ace as the third goaltender for the Vancouver Canucks during the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs. After injuries to both of the Canucks primary goaltenders, Thatcher Demko and Casey DeSmith, \u0160ilovs was unexpectedly inserted as the starting goaltender for the Canucks in Game 4 of the first round against the Nashville Predators. \u0160ilovs immediately impressed, helping the Canucks win Game 4, and then recorded a shutout in the clinching Game 6, his first career NHL shutout. Due to his impressive play, \u0160ilovs would continue as the starter for the Canucks even after DeSmith was healed from injury, and would lead the Canucks all the way to Game 7 in their second round matchup against the Edmonton Oilers, where they would fall 3-2.\n",
    "9th episode of the 1st season of Sh\u014dgun\n\"Crimson Sky\" (Japanese: \u7d05\u5929, Hepburn: K\u014dten) is the ninth episode of the American historical drama television series Sh\u014dgun, based on the novel by James Clavell. The episode was written by series co-creator Rachel Kondo and Caillin Puente, and directed by Frederick E. O. Toye. It was released on Hulu on April 16, 2024, and it also aired on FX on the same day.\nThe series is set in 1600, and follows three characters. John Blackthorne, a risk-taking English sailor who ends up shipwrecked in Japan, a land whose unfamiliar culture will ultimately redefine him; Lord Toranaga, a shrewd, powerful daimyo, at odds with his own dangerous, political rivals; and Lady Mariko, a woman with invaluable skills but dishonorable family ties, who must prove her value and allegiance. In the episode, Toranaga, Blackthorne and Mariko return to Osaka to meet with Ishido. \nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.538 million household viewers and gained a 0.09 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349. The episode received universal acclaim, with critics praising Anna Sawai's performance, tone, writing and ending. \nPlot\nBlackthorne, Toranaga and Mariko sail in Yabushige's ship to Osaka, although Blackthorne is confused over why Mariko is accompanying him. Reuniting with Yabushige, they meet with Ishido to surrender. Yabushige offers Blackthorne's services to spare their lives, but Ishido is not interested. \nMariko demands to leave the city with Toranaga's family at his request, but during her attempt to leave, the guards overpower her, so she announces that she will take her own life at sunset. This prompts Blackthorne to plead her to \"live for him\", but she does not confirm anything. Ochiba meets with Mariko in secret and recounts their childhood together in an attempt to make her surrender peacefully, but she refuses. Mariko soon prepares to commit jigai, with Blackthorne agreeing to be her second, but Ishido stops her and grants her permission to leave. \nLater that night, Blackthorne and Mariko profess their love for each other. Ishido agrees to spare Yabushige, who in exchange allows an army of shinobi to infiltrate the castle, but Blackthorne prevents them from kidnapping Mariko, fighting several off using his pistol. Despite this, there are too many shinobi, and amid the chaos, Blackthorne, Mariko, Yabushige, and Toranaga's consorts lock themselves in a storehouse. After the shinobi set up explosives to blow open the door, Mariko willingly stands in front of it to defy Ishido, referring to herself by her birth surname Akechi. Despite Blackthorne's pleas, Mariko accepts her fate, and she is subsequently killed by the explosion.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn March 2024, Hulu confirmed that the ninth episode of the series would be titled \"Crimson Sky\", and was to be written by series co-creator Rachel Kondo and Caillin Puente, and directed by Frederick E. O. Toye. It was Kondo's third writing credit, Puente's first writing credit, and Toye's third directing credit.\nWriting\nWhen asked over the scene where Blackthorne stands up for Mariko, Sawai explained, \"He's allowing her to die a loyal Catholic and a samurai. So I think it's the biggest gesture of love that she feels from him. It's a very romantic thing for her and she's in a way kind of seeing him in different eyes because of what this means.\"\nMariko's death is adapted from the novel, but the writers originally planned to end the episode with the shinobi infiltrating the castle, with Mariko's death moved for the next episode. Justin Marks then suggested moving the scene to the end of the ninth episode, explaining that her death would get the episode \"to feel complete.\" The scene is very similar to Mariko's death in the novel, with a small difference; in the series, Mariko refers to herself as her birth surname of Akechi, while in the novel, she uses her married Toda name. Sawai explained, \"She's not a Toda. She is an Akechi and she is also avenging her family at the same time. It was very intentional and it felt very powerful and I hope that people remember her as an Akechi rather than a Toda.\" Coincidentally, the scene was filmed in Sawai's birthday, June 11.:\u200a31:35\u201333:00\u200a\nReception\nViewers\nIn its original FX broadcast, \"Crimson Sky\" was seen by an estimated 0.538 million household viewers and gained a 0.09 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349, according to Nielsen Media Research. This means that 0.09 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a 23% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was seen by an estimated 0.436 million household viewers and gained a 0.08 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349.\nCritical reviews\n\"Crimson Sky\" received universal acclaim.

    "\nItalian high-speed trainset\nThe ETR 600 (Elettro Treno Rapido 600) is a class of high-speed trains with tilting technology built by Alstom Ferroviaria, which belong to the fourth generation of the Pendolino family. Due to the active tilting technology, the car bodies can be tilted by up to 8 degrees for higher speeds over curves. The design of the ETR 600 comes from Giorgetto Giugiaro.\nHistory\nTrenitalia ordered 28 new trainsets, which were delivered in mid-2008. In December 2008, the design was used for the first time in the regular service between Rome and Bari.\nFrom December 2008, Trenitalia introduced new brand names for categorising trains according to their maximum speed. The second fastest train category - after Frecciarossa (Red Arrow) - is Frecciargento (Silver Arrow), for trains with maximum speeds between 250 and 285\u00a0km/h. With this, the trains operate as \"ETR 600 Frecciargento\" and \"ETR 610 Frecciargento\". With the brand names, new color schemes were also introduced, which the FS presented on 13 November 2008.\nThe car bodies developed by Alstom were built by the Alstom plants in Savigliano near Turin, and the electrical equipment in Sesto San Giovanni near Milan.\nTechnical data\nA multiple unit consists of seven coaches. Two sets of wheels at the end and neighbouring middle wagons are driven. A total of 430 seats and two wheelchair spaces are offered. With a carriage length of 26.2 m of the vehicle bodies built with aluminium extruded profiles, the train length of 187.4 m with 2.83 m carriage width results. The maximum axle load (loaded) is 16.5 t, so that the pulling mass of an empty train is 387 t and an occupied (all seats occupied) is 421 t.\nThe units are approved for a speed of 250\u00a0km/h, although 280\u00a0km/h was reached during test drives. The continuous electrical power is 5500\u00a0kW. The tilt system is electro-hydraulic and is controlled by a redundantly constructed HVAC control system. The ETR 600 intended for Italian domestic traffic are designed for dual-system capability for the 3 kV DC voltage and 25 kV AC voltage with a frequency of 50\u00a0Hz in the existing network, the ETR 610 additionally for an AC voltage of 15 kV at 16.7\u00a0Hz.\nSee also\nEurostar Italia\nChina Railway CRH5\n",

    "Spanish diplomat\nLuis Polo de Bernab\u00e9 y Pil\u00f3n (14 October 1854 \u2013 18 March 1929) was a Spanish diplomat.\nEarly life\nPolo de Bernab\u00e9 was born on 14 October 1854 in London. He was a son of Carolina Pil\u00f3n y Sterling and Rear Admiral Jos\u00e9 Polo de Bernab\u00e9 y Mordella (1821\u20131895). His paternal grandparents were Luis Polo de Bernab\u00e9 y Mundina and Mar\u00eda Mordella.\nCareer\nPolo de Bernab\u00e9 began his diplomatic career in Washington, D.C. as an attach\u00e9 to the Embassy, which was led at the time by his father. Upon his father's retirement in 1875, he was promoted to Third Secretary, in which he served for six years. In 1882, he was appointed Second Secretary to the legation in The Hague. After three years, he went to the Foreign Office in Madrid shortly before being made Minister Plenipotentiary. His first station in that capacity was in Cairo, after which he went to Rio de Janeiro until 1893. In Madrid, he served as Chief of the Commercial Bureau in the Spanish Foreign Department, dealing with commercial matters and Consulates.\nMinister to the United States\nPolo de Bernab\u00e9 was appointed Minister to the United States on 16 February 1898, three days after the blowing up of the Maine battleship in Havana Harbor. He arrived in the United States on 9 March 1898 aboard the Kaiser Wilhelm II, taking charge of the embassy. Polo was unable to make up for the actions of his predecessor, Enrique Dupuy de L\u00f4me, before the declaration of war against Spain's Sagasta administration by President William McKinley. After receiving the declaration of war from U.S. Secretary of State John Sherman, he \"immediately replied that the resolution was of such a nature that his continuance in Washington became impossible. He asked for his passports and stated that the protection of Spanish interests would be intrusted to the French Ambassador and the Austro-Hungarian Minister. His passports were sent to him; and he was at the same time informed that arrangements had been made for a guard to attend him during his presence in the territory of the United States.\"\nAmbassador to Portugal and Italy\nAfter a mission in Lisbon in 1899, he was sent by the Maura government to the Quirinal Palace as the Spanish Ambassador to Italy on 21 July 1904. He stayed in Rome until 20 March 1905 when he left his post to return to Portugal as the Ambassador in Lisbon. His return to Lisbon was, however, short-lived.\nAmbassador to the United Kingdom\nIn 1905, he was transferred to London as the Ambassador to the United Kingdom. While Ambassador, he involved in the treaty around the marriage of King Alfonso XIII and Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg (a granddaughter of Queen Victoria), which he executed in London on 7 May 1906 as the Spanish Ambassador to the Court of St James's, along with the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey. He also attended the wedding on 31 May 1906 at the Church of Saint Jerome the Royal in Madrid.\nAmbassador to the German Empire\nIn 1906, he was again transferred, this time to what was considered the most important position for any diplomat, as Ambassador to the German Empire. On 7 September 1906, Polo de Bernab\u00e9 presented his credentials to Emperor Wilhelm II. His command of the German language and the social standing of his wife, Ana Mar\u00eda M\u00e9ndez de Vigo (daughter of the former Ambassador to Germany), opened the doors to members of the Hohenzollern family. His anti-Americanism and Francophobia then emerged as a response to the growing hostility that the governments in Washington, D.C. and London showed towards the expansionary policy of the Holy Roman Empire.\nAt the beginning of World War I, Polo de Bernab\u00e9 watched Germany's initial triumphs and recognized the thousands of Allied captives interned on German soil. In November 1914, he visited the prison camps in Brandenburg and Saxony, and harshly criticized the lack of assistance of the Imperial authorities. Due to his friendship with Wilhelm II, together with his well-known pan-Germanism, most of his objections were addressed. There was a noted lack of conflict with the Bethmann Hollweg government and those of his successors, Michaelis and Hertling. His efforts resulted in French prisoners being allowed to write to their families two letters a month, plus three postcards per week, upon which the French Government implemented a similar position for German captives.\nKnown for his authoritarian nature, Polo de Bernab\u00e9 was considered a fearsome diplomat for Madrid. Not only did he discuss the orders of successive Foreign Ministers, the Marquis of Lema, Miguel Villanueva, Amalio Gimeno, Juan Alvarado, Eduardo Dato, the Count of Romanones, but he even questioned the appointment of new delegates in Germany by King Alfonso XIII himself.\nThe defeat of Erich Ludendorff's armies in August 1918 convinced Polo de Bernab\u00e9 that Imperial Germany was coming to an end. When German's last chancellor, Prince Maximilian of Baden, forced Wilhelm II's abdication, Polo de Bernab\u00e9 remained in Berlin for a few mo",

    "Lifeboat station in Troon, United Kingdom\nTroon Lifeboat Station is the base for Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboats at Troon in South Ayrshire, Scotland. It opened in 1871 and operates both all-weather and inshore lifeboats.\nHistory\nLifeboat stations had been established at Irvine and Ayr by 1859. The people of Troon  asked the RNLI to provide one for their town, which they agreed to in 1871. \u00a3250 was paid to build a boathouse at the harbour on land donated by the Duke of Portland.\nA larger boat was stationed at Troon from 1905 so the boathouse was sold to the county council and the lifeboat since that time has been kept afloat in the harbour. The present crew accommodation and workshop was built in 1987 and extended in 1996. An Inshore lifeboat (ILB) was stationed at Troon for the first time in January 2004. A boathouse was built for it and a davit erected to lower it into the water.\nService awards\nThree RNLI Medals have been awarded to members of Troon lifeboat crews. The first were the result of 7 people being rescued from the Belfast steamer Moyallen on 6 December 1940. It was a difficult rescue amid a gale and rain. Coxswain William McAuslane was given a silver medal and Albert J Ferguson received a bronze medal. The other medal was presented to coxswain/mechanic Ian Johnson who took the lifeboat to rescue 5 people from a dredger that was in danger of breaking its moorings outside the harbour in a Force 10 storm on 12 September 1980.\nThe 'Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum' was presented to Thomas Devenny who led a mission to rescue the crew of a small fishing boat during a storm on 18 October 1984. The same award was given to David Seaward and Paul Aspin who used the all-weather lifeboat's (ALB's) dinghy to rescue 10 people from the TS Mountbatten which ran aground at Ayr on  14 July 1988. Ian Johnson, the ALB's coxswain on the day, received a  'Framed Letter of Thanks' from the chairman. Another 'Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum' was given to Colin Millar and Gary McGarvie after leading the lifeboat in a difficult rescue of a trawler on 14 January 2015.\nOn 8 December 1979 Roy Trewern used the lifeboat's inflatable dinghy to help two people cut off by a rising tide, for which he received a  'Framed Letter of Thanks' from the chairman.

    "Insurrection\nMalakand revolt refers to an insurrection by Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi under the command of Sufi Muhammadin Malakand Division on the basis of a demand for Sharia law. Multiple areas were captured by the militants. The uprising was quashed by the Pakistan army, captured areas were liberated and a peace deal was  negotiated. It was the first Salafi jihadist uprising in Pakistan.\nBackground\nIn northwest Pakistan, three princely states Dir, Swat and Chitral were abolished and reorganised to form the Malakand Division in 1970. This also abolished the laws of princely state especially the Sharia implementation in Swat. During the Soviet Afghan war, many militants from this area went to Afghanistan for Jihad. Upon returning they started campaigning for Sharia law and established an organisation named as Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi.\nRebellion\nNovember 1994 insurrection\nIn November 1994, Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi under Sufi Muhammad led a revolt for the implementation of Sharia law in the Malakand Division. A large number of Afghan Mujahideen from the nearby areas also came to aid the rebellion. Timergara, the headquarters of Lower Dir, was besieged by government, artillery Shelling was carried out and fighting erupted in Swat. The Saidu Sharif Airport, roads multiple police stations and judicial courts in the area were occupied by the militants. The Sharia law was implemented in the occupied areas. They imposed driving on the right side of the road as a symbol of discontinuing British traditions. The militants established check points on mountain peaks to prevent military from entering. Approximately 40 persons, including 12 security force personnel, were killed in a week of combat before the Government quelled the rebellion. Pakistan army deployed combat and reconnaissance helicopters to the area. The Frontier Corps was deployed to regain control of the area.\nDecember 1994 clashes\nOn December 4, 1994, 10,000 members of the TNSM started rally for the release of 85 captured militants but security forces responded with tear gas shelling.\nJune 1995 clashes\nOn June 19, 1995, the TNSM Chief Sufi Muhammad and 20 senior militants  were arrested following an attack on security forces. In response hundreds of TNSM cadres attacked and occupied Government offices in the Swat district wounding 26 people.\nAftermath\nAfter the introduction of the \nPATA Regulation, the provincial government recommended the introduction of the Shariah law. Nizam E Adl Ordinance was passed by Pakistani government which  made it compulsory for the civil courts to seek advice  of a Muawin Qazi, who was a religious cleric learned in Islamic law. But militant presence in the area led to the First Battle of Swat.\n",
    "\nIn May 2024, protests and riots broke out in New Caledonia, a sui generis collectivity of overseas France in the Pacific Ocean. The violent protests have led to seven deaths, the declaration of a state of emergency on 16 May, deployment of the French army and the block of the social network TikTok.\nViolence broke out following a controversial voting reform aiming to change existing restrictions which prevent up to one-fifth of the population from voting in provincial elections. Following the Noum\u00e9a Accord, the electorate for local elections was restricted to pre-1998 residents of the islands and their descendants who have maintained continuous residence on the territory for at least 10 years. The system, which excludes migrants from European and Polynesian parts of France, including their adult children, had been judged acceptable in 2005 as part of a decolonization process by the European Court of Human Rights given that it was a provisional measure.\nVoters in all three referenda were in favor of remaining part of France, though the 2021 referendum was boycotted by most independence supporters. For the French government, the referenda fulfilled the Noum\u00e9a Accord process, but independence advocates, who rejected the legitimacy of the boycotted 2021 referendum, considered the process defined by the Noum\u00e9a Accord to be still ongoing.\nThe French government is seeking to grant voting rights in local elections to people who have resided in the territory for over 10 years, which would allow roughly 60% of those prevented from voting to join the electorate. The reform allowing more people of European and Polynesian descent to vote has been decried by independence advocates as a dilution of the indigenous Melanesian Kanak people's political voice. President Emmanuel Macron visited the island on 22 May and asked local actors to reach a comprehensive agreement within a month, mentioning the possibility of a referendum concerning Paris' desired changes in voter eligibility rules.\nThe emergency was ended on 28 May.\nBackground\nLocation of New Caledonia in Oceania\nNew Caledonia is a French overseas territory in the southwest Pacific. It has a population of about 270,000; with the indigenous Kanak people constituting, according to the 2019 census, 41% of the population, the Europeans (Caldoche and metropolitan French) 28%, those of mixed blood 11%, with other ethnic minorities (including Wallisians, Tahitians, Polynesians Ni-Vanuatu, Indonesians, Vietnamese and Chinese) constituting the remainder. New Caledonia became a French overseas territory in 1946 and has representatives in both houses of the French Parliament, while the President of France serves as the territory's head of state. France maintains jurisdiction over New Caledonia's justice system, defense, and internal security.\nIn 1988, following widespread political violence between Caldoches and indigenous Kanaks \u2014 a period referred to as \"the Events\" (French: Les \u00c9v\u00e9nements) \u2014 the Matignon Agreements were signed, establishing a transition to its current large autonomy as a sui generis collectivity within the French state. This was followed in 1998 by the Noum\u00e9a Accord. As part of the Accord, New Caledonia was allowed to hold three referendums to decide on the future status of the territory, with voting rights restricted to indigenous Kanak and other inhabitants living in New Caledonia before 1998.\n\"Frozen\" electorate\nAs part of the Noum\u00e9a Accord of 1998, the population of New Caledonia continued to vote in national elections\u2014for the French president and National Assembly\u2014but the number of people who can vote in provincial elections and independence referendums was restricted. This so-called \"frozen electorate\" consists only of those who were already living in New Caledonia in 1998 as well as their children, provided they maintained uninterrupted residence for ten years prior to each election. This deprived later immigrants, whether European or Polynesian, of voting rights.  The number of excluded voters increased from 8,000 in 1999 to 18,000 in 2009 and to 42,000 in 2023, by which time almost one national voter out of five was excluded from participating in provincial elections (of 220,000 national voters only 178,000 were eligible). This restriction aimed at preventing the disempowerment of the native Kanak community that would result from the arrival in large number of people from metropolitan France.\nFollowing a ruling by the French Constitutional Council in 1999 which limited the restriction to a simple ten-year residency requirement (a so-called \"rolling electorate\"), French president Jacques Chirac promised to have the French constitution amended on the request of independence groups in 2003. His parliamentary majority voted for the revision in 2007, thereby reverting to the \"frozen electorate\" rule. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2005 that the restriction did not infringe the right to free elections and did not give rise to discrimination on ",

    "Taiwanese diplomat and politician\nHuang Chaoqin (Taiwanese Hokkien: N\u0302g Ti\u00e2u-kh\u00eem, October 25, 1897 \u2013 July 5, 1972), known by the courtesy name Lanting and pen name Chao Jin, Nian Tai, was a diplomatic and political figure of the Republic of China. Born in Yanshui Port, Chiayi County, Taiwan under Japanese rule (now Tainan Yanshuei District, Beijing), he pursued his early education in Japan and later studied public international law in the United States. Upon completion of his studies, he returned to the Republic of China to serve in the Ministry of foreign affairs of the Nanjing National Government. He held various positions including Provincial Speaker and member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and presided over the Taiwan Provincial Assembly for nearly two decades.\nEarly life and education\nHuang Chaoqin was born on October 25, 1897, in Yanshui Port, Chiayi County, in Japanese-controlled Taiwan. After the death of his grandfather and father when he was ten years old, his mother, Cai, raised him and his younger siblings.:\u200a1\u200a In 1914, he graduated from a public school in Yanshui Port (today's Tainan Yanshui Elementary School).:\u200a131\u200a He later studied business at Changhua Public School, but dropped out in the second grade to manage the family property and his father's business.:\u200a6\u200a:\u200a131\u200a:\u200a5\u200a\nIn 1917, Huang Chaoqin moved to Tokyo, Japan, where he lived in a \"lower dormitory\" and pursued his studies. He was admitted to the third grade of Nihon Junior High School (today's Nihon Gakuen Junior High School and High School), and his younger brother transferred to the second grade of the school.:\u200a8\u200a:\u200a132\u200a\nIn 1920, he studied economics at Waseda University in Japan. During this period, he co-founded the \"Taiwan Minbao\" with his friends. In 1923, he published \"On the Reform of Chinese Language,\" advocating the popularization of Written vernacular Chinese. Huang Chaoqin then went to the United States to study at the University of Illinois.\nCareer\nIn 1925, he joined the Chinese Kuomintang and obtained a master's degree in political science the following year. Later, he went to the Republic of China.\nIn 1928, he joined the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China. He served successively as a staff member, section chief of the Asia Department, and consul general in San Francisco and Calcutta.\nIn 1938, while serving as the Consul General in San Francisco, he handled the \"Guangyuan Ship Case.\" It was verified that more than 2,000 tons of scrap iron were on the ship to Japan. Huang Chaoqin suspected it was used to make arms for the Second Sino-Japanese War, so he refused to issue a certificate. Later, the ship's owner planned to withdraw the application for a nationality certificate, change the hands of the boat, and try to find another nationality. Huang Nai issued the certificate but has not delivered it yet, so the ship can still not leave the port.\nIn 1945, he served as mayor of Taipei and as a special foreign affairs commissioner.

He then used his position in the Office of the President of Taiwan to repurpose the iron bars used in renovating the presidential palace to construct a dormitory for William C. Chase, the head of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group. After the dormitory was completed, part of the remaining building materials were sold to repay the loan from the Taiwan Bank.

    "Imperial Japanese Navy Urakaze-class destroyer\nFor other ships with the same name, see Japanese destroyer Urakaze.\nUrakaze (\u6d66\u98a8, \"Bay Wind\") was the lead ship of the Imperial Japanese Navy\u2032s Urakaze-class destroyers. Completed in 1915, she served during World War I, followed by service on the Yangtze in China during the 1920s and 1930s. She was the only unit of her class to enter Japanese service, the Japanese having sold her only sister ship, Kawakaze, to Italy while Kawakaze was under construction. Urakaze also was the last Japanese destroyer built in a foreign shipyard to enter service in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Stricken in 1936, she thereafter was used for training until she was sunk during World War II in an Allied air raid in 1945. She was refloated and scrapped in 1948.\nConstruction and commissioning\nThe Government of Japan authorized the construction of Urakaze in its fiscal year 1911 budget and signed a construction contract with the British firm Yarrow Shipbuilders on 27\u00a0December\u00a01912. She was laid down at Yarrow's shipyard in Scotstoun, Scotland, on 1\u00a0October\u00a01913 as Destroyer No. 35, received the name Urakaze on 12\u00a0September\u00a01914, and was registered as a first-class destroyer on 6\u00a0December\u00a01914. She was launched on 16\u00a0February\u00a01915 and completed on 14\u00a0September\u00a01915. Her guns were shipped from Japan and installed at the Yarrow yard and the Japanese negotiated the purchase of ammunition for them from the British firm Armstrong Whitworth, but she was completed without her torpedo tubes.\nService history\nUrakaze left the Yarrow shipyard's mooring pond on 15\u00a0September\u00a01915 and moored at Greenock, Scotland, the same day. There she filled her fuel tanks with 248 tons of fuel oil and took aboard 50 tons of canned goods, which were loaded on her upper deck.\nDelivery voyage\nUrakaze began her delivery voyage to Japan on the afternoon of 16\u00a0September\u00a01915, departing Greenock bound for Gibraltar, with an itinerary calling for her to make calls at ports in the British Empire along the way. With World War I raging and Japan an active belligerent on the Allied side, she maintained a speed of 20 knots (37\u00a0km/h; 23\u00a0mph) to reduce the danger of attack by Imperial German Navy submarines. She arrived at Gibraltar on the afternoon of 19\u00a0September\u00a01915 and refueled.\nUrakaze\u2032s fuel consumption was lower than expected, and even after she had left the German submarine threat behind her she maintained 20 knots (37\u00a0km/h; 23\u00a0mph) \u2014 with occasional exceptions \u2014 throughout her voyage to Japan as an experiment in the range and endurance of oil-fired ships, refueling as necessary along the way. She resumed her voyage on 21\u00a0September\u00a01915, departing Gibraltar to cross the Mediterranean Sea and calling at Valletta, Malta, from 23 to 24 September before arriving at Port Said, Egypt, on 26\u00a0September. She immediately entered the Suez Canal, completing her transit of the canal with her arrival at Suez Port on 27\u00a0September. She departed Suez Port on 29\u00a0September and proceeded southward through the Red Sea, calling at Aden on the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula from 1 to 4 October 1915. She then began her crossing of the Indian Ocean. On 7\u00a0October she had to drift for about an hour because of a clogged oil filter, but she soon got back underway and arrived at Bombay, India, later that day.\nUrakaze departed Bombay on 11\u00a0October\u00a01915 and called briefly at Colombo, Ceylon, on 13\u00a0October, and at Singapore from 17 to 18 October. She then set out across the South China Sea, conducting fuel consumption tests along the way. She encountered strong winds on 22\u00a0October and rolled 30 degrees, causing her aft mast to collapse. She arrived at Hong Kong later that day and made emergency repairs to her mast before departing on 23\u00a0October for the last leg of her voyage. She completed it on 27\u00a0October\u00a01915 with her arrival at Yokosuka, Japan, which became her home port.\nAt Yokosuka, Urakaze\u2032s torpedo tubes were installed and additional work was carried out, temporarily interrupted by a naval review on 4\u00a0November\u00a01915.\nWorld War I\nOn 1\u00a0December\u00a01915, Urakaze was assigned to the 16th Destroyer Squadron, a component of the 2nd Torpedo Squadron in the 1st Fleet, an element of the Combined Fleet. The squadron also included the destroyers Umikaze and Yamakaze. On 13\u00a0December\u00a01915, the Combined Fleet was dissolved, and on that date the 16th Destroyer Squadron was transferred to the 2nd Torpedo Squadron in the  2nd Fleet.\nOn 26\u00a0September\u00a01916, the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal was ordered to equip Urakaze with cruise turbines, although this work did not take place until 1918. Meanwhile, the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal carried out other work on Urakaze between 5\u00a0December\u00a01916 and 5\u00a0June\u00a01917, installing a new engine room ventilation system and other equipment. During this work, Urakaze left the 16th\u00a0Destroyer\u00a0Squadron on 1\u00a0April\u00a01917.\nThe Yokosuka Naval Arsenal finally installed Urakaze\u2032s new cruise turbines in 1918. In February\u00a01919, just after the end of World ",
    "\nTelevision station in Imperatriz, Brazil\nTV Difusora Sul is a Brazilian television station based in Imperatriz, a city in the state of Maranh\u00e3o. It operates on channel 7 (UHF digital 38) and is affiliated to SBT. It is part of the Sistema Difusora de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o and integrates Rede Difusora, generating its programming for the city of Imperatriz and nearby areas, also reaching parts of the far north of Tocantins.\nHistory\nThe station was founded in 1983 as TV Curim\u00e3, by businessmen Gilberto Bomtempo and Raimundo Cabeludo (the latter also a partner in TV Karaj\u00e1s and TV Tropical). At the time, the station broadcast the programming of the recently launched Rede Manchete on VHF channel 7. Its headquarters were located in the same building as Cultura FM (today Difusora FM), on Rua Simpl\u00edcio Moreira, in the city center. On August 23, 1988, President Jos\u00e9 Sarney granted a generator concession to TV Curim\u00e3, which is now managed by the politician and former mayor of Imperatriz Ribamar Ficane, in partnership with his wife, Zenira Ficane, as well as Lia Evangelista de Souza and Marcelo Rodrigues.\nIn 1989, the station left Manchete and became an affiliate of SBT, changing affiliation with TV Karaj\u00e1s. On August 15, 1990, the station changed its name to TV Alvorada, and in the same year, it moved to its current headquarters at Rua Monte Castelo, 207, modernized its equipment and hired new professionals. In 1992, TV Alvorada was renamed TV Difusora Imperatriz, starting to operate jointly with TV Difusora S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds.\nIn 2006, Ribamar Ficane sold TV Difusora Imperatriz to Sistema Difusora de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o. The new owner, Edinho Lob\u00e3o, leases the station to businessman Ernani Ferraz, who renamed it TV Difusora Sul, at the same time making much of the programming independent of the headquarters in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, and adopting a visual identity separate from the state capital's affiliate. In August 2007, Edinho regained control of the station, and the following year he was investigated by the Federal Public Ministry due to the illegal leasing of TV Difusora Sul.\nIn March 2016, like TV Difusora S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, TV Difusora Sul was leased by then federal deputy Weverton Rocha, represented by lawyer and businessman Willer Tomaz de Sousa, together with Difusora Sul FM. The station would come under definitive control of the new owners four years later, after the sale of Sistema Difusora de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o in March 2020.\nTechnical information\nThe station began its digital transmissions on February 21, 2017, through UHF channel 38.\nBased on the federal decree transitioning Brazilian TV stations from analogue to digital signals, TV Difusora Sul, as well as the other stations in Imperatriz, ceased broadcasting on VHF channel 7 on December 17, 2018, following the official schedule from ANATEL.

    "Australian author and policy entrepreneur\nMichael Sheldrick (born 1988) is an Australian author and policy entrepreneur who seeks to address global challenges such as extreme poverty, global health and climate change. He is the co-founder and Chief Policy, Impact and Government Affairs Officer at Global Citizen.\nLife and career\nEducation\nSheldrick was born in Perth, Australia and is said to have struggled academically growing up. He was once enrolled in special education classes and was told by a teacher that he probably wouldn't make it to university. In 2012, he was named \"human tornado\" by PerthNow due to his dedication to turn ideas into action. Sheldrick graduated from The University of Western Australia in 2013, with a combined degree in law and arts, majoring in political science and international relations. He became the young Western Australian of the Year in 2013 for his work as a community activist and social justice campaigner.\nPolio eradication\nSheldrick's role in the efforts of polio eradication advocacy in Australia was recognized by Melissa Parke in the Australian Parliament in 2012. While still a student at the University of Western Australia, Sheldrick co-founded Global Poverty Project, now known as Global Citizen, in 2008 along with Hugh Evans and Simon Moss. In 2011, he had written a letter to then-Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, which prompted her to meet him and then agree to put The End of Polio campaign on the agenda of the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. He had been informed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that it was unlikely that aid would be available from the Australian government; however, he managed to secure a $50 million contribution towards the campaign from the Australian government and nearly $70 million from other world leaders.\nIn 2013, Sheldrick was named Young West Australian of the Year. In 2015, Sheldrick said he contacted the then-Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat which led to Malta's initiative to boost awareness needed for the international community to take further action against Polio.\nWriting\nSheldrick is the author of From Ideas to Impact: A Playbook for Influencing and Implementing Change in a Divided World (2024), which features a foreword by United Nations Goodwill Ambassadors Idris Elba and Sabrina Dhowre Elba. The book has also received other endorsements including from British rock band and philanthropists Coldplay.\nCollaboration with the WHO\nAs the Chief Policy, impact and government affairs officer at Global Citizen, Sheldrick leads the policy efforts at the organization including its partnership with the World Health Organization. In June 2013, the two parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the main objectives to support global efforts to overcome inequities in public health. This follows WHO\u2019s collaboration with Global Citizen on multiple campaigns including One World: Together At Home, which raised almost US$128 million.\nWork in Africa\nSheldrick's work has garnered international attention and recognition, particularly in the African continent. In 2018, Global Citizen launched \u201cGlobal Citizen Festival - Mandela 100\u201d to celebrate the centennial birthday of Nelson Mandela, which galvanized 16 governments, eight international organizations, and 12 corporations to make financial and political commitments to work in a collaborative manner to tackle poverty. During the same year, he also traveled to Senegal with Rhianna to petition for US$2.3 billion to support education in developing countries. In 2019, Sheldrick participated in the Global Goal Live: Nigeria Policy Forum in Lagos which focused on working with private sector philanthropy and government to achieve the SDGs and end poverty. In 2022, the Global Citizen Festival in Ghana\u2019s Black Star Square spurred the establishment of an \"Africa Prosperity Fund\", a $1 billion development funding pledge compiled solely by African governments and launched jointly by the governments of Ghana and South Africa. Sheldrick believes Ghana\u2019s success symbolizes what is achievable,  as the country has seen great success in reducing poverty, building institutions, providing healthcare and education.\nClimate action\nSheldrick believes that addressing climate change and ending extreme poverty are two sides of one coin. He argues that the current hunger crisis is a result of poor governance and decades of poor choices that has left farmers ill-equipped, and that the climate and food crises are intertwined and that global governmental leaders must proactively intervene. In 2021, Sheldrick through Global Citizen partnered with Google, FCB and 360i to create a video of a burning photograph to tap into viewer emotions to protect the planet. In 2023, Global Citizen launched a climate action campaign known as Power Our Planet.\n",
    "1977 United States Supreme Court case\nWainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72 (1977), was a United States Supreme Court case decided on June 23, 1977. In a 7\u20132 decision by Associate Justice William Rehnquist, the Court held that, if a state prisoner fails to raise a federal constitutional claim at trial or on appeal in a manner in keeping with the state's requirements, and cause and prejudice for this failure cannot be shown, that claim cannot be subsequently raised in federal habeas corpus proceedings. The majority adopted the \"cause\" and \"prejudice\" requirement that had been laid out in the 1976 Supreme Court decision, Francis v. Henderson, rejecting the broader standard the Court had outlined in the 1963 case Fay v. Noia. Sykes has since been recognized as one of multiple Supreme Court cases that limited the scope of its prior decision in Fay v. Noia, which the Court eventually overruled completely in the 1991 case Coleman v. Thompson. However, Sykes did not completely overrule Fay, though some scholars have argued that Sykes narrowed the scope of Fay so much as to effectively overrule it.\nBackground\nOn June 5, 1972, John Sykes was convicted of third-degree murder by a jury in the Circuit Court of DeSoto County, Florida. At trial, inculpatory statements made by Sykes to police while in custody after receiving a Miranda warning were admitted into evidence. Sykes' conviction was upheld on appeal, and his attempts to obtain habeas relief in state court were unsuccessful. Neither Sykes nor his lawyer objected to the admissibility of his statements at trial or on appeal on the grounds that Sykes did not understand the Miranda warning he had received. He subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, specifically the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, arguing that he had not understood the Miranda warning he had been given prior to making the admitted statements. \nThe District Court held that under the Supreme Court's decision in Jackson v. Denno, Sykes was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether he had understood the Miranda warning he had received, and thus, whether he had deliberately waived his Miranda rights when he made the incriminating statements to police. When the state of Florida appealed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, and the state then appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.\nOpinion\nOn June 23, 1977, the Supreme Court voted 7\u20132 to reverse the Fifth Circuit. Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the court, which adopted the requirement of \"cause\" and \"prejudice\" for excusing failure to comply with procedural rules. The Court had outlined this test in its opinion in Francis v. Henderson, which it had decided in 1976. In embracing this test in Sykes, the court also explicitly rejected the test it had outlined in its decision in Fay v. Noia, a case it had decided in 1963. In the latter decision, the Court had stated that \"an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\" was required before a federal court could bar a defendant from raising a claim they previously failed to raise in state court.\nChief Justice Warren Burger filed a concurring opinion, arguing that the standard outlined in Fay v. Noia \"...was never designed for, and is inapplicable to, errors -- even of constitutional dimension -- alleged to have been committed during trial.\"\nJustice John Paul Stevens filed a separate concurring opinion, arguing that, despite the inconsistency between the \"cause and prejudice\" standard endorsed by the majority in Sykes and the \"deliberate bypass\" standard outlined in Fay, that the former standard is nevertheless \"consistent with the way other federal courts have actually been applying Fay.\"\nJustice Byron White filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, arguing that while the majority was correct in reversing the Fifth Circuit's granting of habeas relief to Sykes, that this was so because the admission of his inculpatory statements at trial represented a \"harmless error\", as the Supreme Court had previously outlined in Harrington v. California.\nJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. filed the only dissenting opinion, in which only Justice Thurgood Marshall joined. Brennan criticized the majority for failing to elaborate on the meaning of \"cause\" and \"prejudice\", and for neglecting to elaborate on the proper course of action for federal habeas courts faced with procedural defaults due to ineffective assistance of counsel.\n",

    "Spanish footballer\nJos\u00e9 Juli\u00e0 Ribas (6 October 1895 \u2013 15 October 1973), also known as Bertini, was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward who played for FC Barcelona, Espanyol, and CE Europa.\nPlaying career\nJos\u00e9 Juli\u00e0 was born on 6 October 1895 in Barcelona, and he began his footballing career at Catal\u00e0 FC in 1911, at the age of 16. There, he stood out as a great forward, so he eventually caught the attention of FC Barcelona, who signed him in 1913, where he mostly played for the second team and had few chances in the first, featuring in only 3 competitive matches between 1913 and 1918, one of which in the 1915\u201316 Catalan championship, and by simply playing in this match, he was part of the squad that won that title. Such was his insignificance that Bar\u00e7a loaned him in back-to-back seasons in 1917 and 1918, first to CE Sants and then to CF Badalona. In 1918, he moved to RCD Espanyol during the 1918\u201319 season, playing 8 official games, but then returned to FC Barcelona for two more seasons under Jack Greenwell, winning the Catalan championship in both of them and scoring twice in 9 appearances.\nJuli\u00e0 then joined CE Europe in the 1922\u201323 season, and together with Juan Pellicer, Manuel Cros, and Antonio Alc\u00e1zar, he helped the club win the 1922\u201323 Catalan Championship after beating his former club Barcelona 1\u20130 in a play-off title-decider on 21 March 1923, thanks to a lonely goal from Alc\u00e1zar. Juli\u00e0 then helped CE Europa reach their first-ever Copa del Rey final in 1923, which they lost 0\u20131 to Athletic Bilbao, courtesy of a goal from Travieso.\nOn 10 February 1924, a match against FC Barcelona had to be suspended in the 38th minute when Europa's Juli\u00e0 was sent off and refused to leave the rural area. Juli\u00e0 decided to retire from football out of the blue after being punished with a one-year suspension, and the club was fined 1000 pesetas. This incident resulted in CE Europa making a general assembly in which it was agreed to separate from the Catalan Football Federation. In total, he scored 20 goals in 34 matches with the club, all of which in the Catalan championship.\nDeath\nJuli\u00e0 died in Barcelona on 15 October 1973, at the age of 78.\nHonours\nFC Barcelona\nCatalan championship:\nChampions (3): 1915\u201316, 1919\u201320, and 1920\u201321\nCE Europa\nCatalan championship:\nChampions (1): 1922\u201323\nCopa del Rey:\nRunner-up (1): 1923\n",

    "\n2023 studio album by The Necks\nTravel is a 2024 studio album by Australian jazz trio The Necks. It has received positive reviews by critics.\nReception\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Travel received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 from 5 critic scores. Editors at AllMusic rated this album 4.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Thom Jurek writing that the music is \"impeccably recorded and mixed by longtime collaborator Tim Whitten\" and the album \"blossoms with new ideas, fluid spontaneity, and fresh ideas\", with a recommendation to new listeners to start here in the band's discography. The site also included this on their list of the best jazz albums of 2023. Online retailer Bandcamp included this among the best jazz albums of the year, with critic Dave Sumner writing that it \"captures a facet of  growth by recording extended sections of studio improvisations that mark the start of each day, a glimpse into the process that has led to so many of past albums\". In The Big Takeover, Michael Toland summed up his review, \"every song on Travel is intriguing and compelling, as this band\u2019s music always is, and it\u2019s heartening to see that putting the tunes in bite-sized nuggets (even if the bites are Tyrannosaurus-sized) doesn\u2019t make it any less so\". Kevin Whitlock of Jazzwise gave this album 5 out of 5 stars, calling this the band's best since Unfold in 2017 and \"each track constitues a musical journey\" with an uncertain endpoint. A short review in The New Yorker by Michaelangelo Matos praised the musicianship of the bandmembers and stated that this work \"showcases their singular style as effectively as any of their past work, with four songs of around twenty minutes apiece\". Richard Williams of Uncut rated Travel 4.5 out of 5 stars, noting elements of blues music and part of the band's multi-decade evolution.

    "British hard dance disc jockey and record producer\nMusical artist\nEddie Halliwell (born  1979 or 1980) is an electronic dance music disc jockey from Wigan, England, who plays techno, house and trance music. Known for his live performances he has regularly featured in the DJ Mag top 100 DJ list, and has performed several times on the BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix show.\nCareer\nHalliwell grew up in Wigan, England. He learnt the DJ trade as a \"bedroom\" DJ, then coming onto the scene with not only \"flawless\" mixing skills but also the reported scratching ability of a turntablist.  His first residency in Ibiza started in 2001 at Judgement Sundays.  He also went on to have a residency at Cream in the Amnesia club.  Halliwell rose to prominence mainly due to his \"lightning-wristed deck trickery\" and an ability to make \"the dance floor erupt\".\nIn January 2002 the music magazine Mixmag featured a cover CD mixed by Halliwell. The album, Bosh!, had Halliwell's high energy and \"scratchtastic\" approach and featured tracks by artists such as Marco V, Signum and Tony De Vit. In 2015 Mixmag reported it had achieved the rare level of popularity sufficient to justify a sequel.\nHalliwell has been featured several times in the DJ Mag annual top 100 DJ ranking, including being voted into the top 20 for 4 years running. In both 2005 and 2006 he was ranked #17, followed by #16 in 2007, and #19 in 2008. Mixmag magazine also rated him at #9 in its' world top DJ poll in 2009.\nHalliwell hosted regular dance music shows on BBC Radio 1 from 2005 to 2008, including co-fronting the Residency series. He has also performed DJ mixes on seven occasions for the Pete Tong Essential Mix show, including a live set from Creamfields in 2011.\nIn 2008 Halliwell released a mix album, Fire It Up, named after the club night he started. It was considered \"too hard for some\", but did showcase his talent. In 2011 he recorded the cover CD for the August issue of DJ Mag.  That same year he started the record label FIUR, and also moved into production with his debut single, \"Neon\". This was reported as a significant move as, until this point, DJing rather than production had been his \"No.1 passion\". In 2012 Halliwell released the album Toolroom Knights under Mark Knight's Toolroom record label.  The album charted at number 28 in the UK Dance Album chart and received positive critical reception with journalist Gregory Paratore stating \"it's filled with hip-hop style cuts and scratches, showing exactly why Halliwell is able to thrill fans around the world with his quick mix style\".\nDiscography\n",
    "Spanish lawyer and sports leader\nJuan Touz\u00f3n Jurjo (7 May 1898 \u2013 13 August 1972) was a Spanish lawyer and sports leader who served as the 16th president of both Atl\u00e9tico Madrid between 1946 and 1947, and of the Spanish Football Federation between 1954 and 1956, during which period he even managed an international match as a coach.\nProfessional career\nBorn in Madrid, Touz\u00f3n was a lawyer, deputy director of the Banco de Vizcaya, and an honorary member of the Madrid Press Association\u00a0.\nSporting career\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid\nLinked to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid since he was a child, Touz\u00f3n was part of several boards of the club as a director, carrying out various efforts, such as the merger with the Club Aviaci\u00f3n Nacional, and the purchase of the Metropolitan Stadium, which made the club's rehabilitation possible after being badly damaged in the Spanish Civil War.\nOn 15 January 1946, Touz\u00f3n was elected the 16th president of the club, then called Club Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n, and under his brief mandate he eliminated military symbols from the entity, when on 14 December, the club decided to drop the military association from its name, erasing the term \"aviaci\u00f3n\" to became Atl\u00e9tico again before settling on its current name, Club Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid, as it is known today. During his mandate, the club's handball section, which went on to achieve many sporting successes, was also founded. He held the presidency for 18 months until July 1947, when he was replaced by Ces\u00e1reo Gal\u00edndez.\nSpanish Football Federation\nAfter leaving the presidency of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Touz\u00f3n continued to be linked to the world of football, occupying various positions within the Spanish Federation until becoming its president in March 1954. Being vice president of this organization in April 1952, he made a trip to Galicia to materialize Federation aid to the modest football of Vigo, and Touz\u00f3n declared that he feels very proud of the initiative as a Galician that he is, stating \"Well, I was born in Lugo\"; however, the statement remains in the air, without modifying his condition as a Madrid native.\nIn his functions as president, Touz\u00f3n had the task of heading the Selection Committee of the Spanish national team, a quadrumvir made up of himself, Jos\u00e9 Luis del Valle, Emilio Jim\u00e9nez, and Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez, so in the absence of a permanent national coach, he provisionally served as such in a match against Switzerland in Geneva on 19 June 1955, which ended in a 3\u20130 victory, which means that he boasts a 100 percent victory record as the national coach. At the end of the meeting, the Spanish delegation receives a tribute from the Swiss delegation at the Beau Rivage Hotel, and at that event, the Spanish president is awarded the gold sash, a Swiss decoration that recognizes the greatest men of international football.\nIn 1956, Touz\u00f3n appointed Jos\u00e9 P\u00e1ramo Fern\u00e1ndez, treasurer of the Galician Football Federation. He held the presidency for two years until 1956, when he was replaced by Alfonso de la Fuente, although he continued to be its director.\nPersonal life\nTouz\u00f3n goes very frequently to Lugo, for health reasons, and to Monforte de Lemos, where his relatives, the Rodr\u00edguez Otero Touz\u00f3n, have a house on the banks of the Cabe. Touz\u00f3n had three children Emilia, Mar\u00eda, and Juan Antonio.\nDeath\nJuanito Touz\u00f3n, as he was affectionately known in all the sports media in the country died at his home in Madrid on 13 August 1972, at the age of 74. His death has caused deep regret, because during his life he knew how to gain the friendship and affection of all who knew and treated him. His funeral was held on the following day and telegrams of condolence from some federations and clubs in Spain arrived at his home. In November, a special religious ceremony in his honor was held two days later, in the parish church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Paloma.\n",
    "\n2019 studio album by Mdou Moctar\n\u201cFor 48 years France has exploited the uranium in our country, and yet we still don\u2019t have roads, medicines and in many places there is no water or electricity. France says we are independent now but we have no independence, we are modern slaves. They say this is an Africa problem, but we have had enough of what France is doing to us; it\u2019s as if we\u2019re still in the 15th century.\u201d\n\u2014Vocalist Mdou Moctar on the political themes on Ilana (The Creator)\nIlana (The Creator) is a 2019 studio album by Nigerien desert blues band Mdou Moctar. The album was the first where the guitarist Mdou Moctar converted his solo musical project into a full band and has received positive reviews by critics.\nReception\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Ilana (The Creator) received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 from 5 critic scores. J.\u00a0D. of The Economist wrote that this album \"mastery of Moctar's craft\" as a guitarist as this album \"makes use of brilliant and dense fingerpicking as well as the power chords favoured in hard rock\" Reef Younis of Loud and Quiet scored this album a 7 out of 10, summing up his review \"few have stories as compelling as Mdou Moctar but, as \u2018Ilana (The Creator)\u2019 testifies, he also has the Saharan sounds to back it up\". NPR's Bob Boilen called this \"the most insane psychedelic guitar album of the 21st century\" and recommended that listeners come at it \"with the volume cranked\". Editors at Pitchfork Media scored this release 8.0 out of 10 and critic Andy Beta praised this release as \"an incandescent set of guitar music with a spontaneous, celebratory air\u2014and a latent urgency reflecting the region\u2019s very real difficulties\". At PopMatters, Adriane Pontecorvo rated this album a 9 out of 10, writing that the album builds on the desert blues tradition and yet \"still sounds fresh and different from anything Moctar\u2019s contemporaries do, but it is wholly based on his considerable skill as a rock guitarist and songwriter rather than on trying to get in on current trends\".\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Mahamadou \"Mdou Moctar\" Souleymane.\n\"Kamane Tarhanin\"\u00a0\u2013 5:08\n\"Asshet Akal\"\u00a0\u2013 4:51\n\"Inizgam\"\u00a0\u2013 1:24\n\"Anna\"\u00a0\u2013 4:33\n\"Takamba\"\u00a0\u2013 2:50\n\"Tarhatazed\"\u00a0\u2013 7:27\n\"Wiwasharnine\"\u00a0\u2013 3:38\n\"Ilana\"\u00a0\u2013 4:46\n\"Tumastin\"\u00a0\u2013 4:21\nPersonnel\nMdou Moctar\nMikey Coltun\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar, recording, production\nMazawadje Aboubacar Ibrahim\u00a0\u2013 drums\nAhmoudou Madassane\u00a0\u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nMdou Moctar\u00a0\u2013 lead guitar, vocals\nAdditional personnel\nRobert Beatty\u00a0\u2013 artwork\nAroudaini Daniel\u00a0\u2013 djembe\nHeba Kadry\u00a0\u2013 audio mastering\nChristopher Kirkley\u00a0\u2013 production\nChris Koltay\u00a0\u2013 recording\nRigo Luis\u00a0\u2013 photography\nSeth Manchester\u00a0\u2013 mixing\nCem M\u0131s\u0131rl\u0131o\u011flu\u00a0\u2013 drum programming\nAnna Viotti\u00a0\u2013 photography\nSee also\nList of 2019 albums\n",
    "New Zealand writers' centre\nThe Michael King Writers Centre is a writing centre on the slope of Takarunga / Mount Victoria in Devonport, Auckland, New Zealand, which offers residencies to early career and experienced writers. It was established in 2005 in honour of New Zealand historian Michael King.\nAbout the centre\nThe centre is based at the Signalman's House, a historic house built in 1898, on Takarunga / Mount Victoria in Devonport, Auckland.\nAs of November 2022 the centre had hosted around 140 writers-in-residence. Residencies are of short length to encourage applicants of diverse backgrounds. As of 2024 residencies are offered for between two and three weeks, although in the past they have been offered for as long as six months. The centre also offers short-term accommodation for visiting writers on a paying basis.\nHistory\nAt the memorial service for historian and writer Michael King in 2004, Gordon McLauchlan suggested that a writers' centre in King's name should be set up. The centre was established through a charitable trust; together with McLauchlan, founding trustees included Christine Cole Catley, Witi Ihimaera and Geoff Chapple.\nThe centre officially opened in July 2005. The first writer-in-residence was Geoff Chapple.\nBetween 2007 and 2020, University of Auckland residencies were offered at the centre, supported by Creative New Zealand, which required the writer to spend time at the university's English department. In 2010 the centre began offering M\u0101ori writers' residencies, developed with the assistance of Witi Ihimaera. In July 2011 the centre offered a free week's residency for four writers affected by the Christchurch earthquake.\nIn 2014, in partnership with several organisations including the Shanghai Writers' Association, the centre began running an exchange whereby Chinese writers could undertake a residency at the centre and New Zealand writers could undertake a residency in Shanghai. In 2021 the centre announced a new exchange programme with Varuna, The Writers' House in the Blue Mountains, Sydney.\nFrom 2008 to 2019 the centre offered a programme of workshops for young writers, and since 2012 has published a literary journal of students' work titled Signals. The programme was put on hold in 2020, and the centre has instead run the Signals Awards for writers aged 16 to 21.\nNotable residents\nNotable recipients of Michael King Writers Centre residencies have included:\nRachel Barrowman (worked on biography of Maurice Gee, 2010)\nAnn Beaglehole (2009)\nEleanor Catton (wrote the final draft of The Luminaries, 2012)\nGeoff Chapple (first resident, 2005)\nGina Cole (established Pasifika writer-in-residence, 2021)\nDick Corballis (worked on biography of Bruce Mason, 2008)\nBill Direen (University of Auckland residency, 2010)\nDavid Eggleton (wrote Time of the Icebergs poetry collection, 2009)\nChris Else (2012)\nTracy Farr (2009, 2018, 2021)\nKaryn Hay (2018)\nWhiti Hereaka (worked on play Rewena, 2012; finished draft of novel Kurangaituku, 2017)\nRoger Horrocks (2015)\nAnna Jackson (2017)\nJade Kake (emerging M\u0101ori writer-in-residence, 2019)\nAnne Kennedy (University of Auckland residency, 2014)\nSarah Laing (worked on graphic novel about Katherine Mansfield, 2013; also 2008)\nColleen Maria Lenihan (emerging M\u0101ori writer-in-residence, worked on short story collection K\u014dhine, 2019)\nKirsten McDougall (2019)\nFiona McGregor (through New Zealand-Australia writers' residency exchange, 2023)\nFrankie McMillan (University of Auckland residency, 2017)\nArthur Meek (wrote play about Mary Martin, 2011)\nKyle Mewburn (2021)\nKelly Ana Morey (M\u0101ori writer-in-residence, completed novel Daylight Second, 2014)\nVincent O'Sullivan (worked on biography of Ralph Hotere, 2009)\nLawrence Patchett (emerging writer-in-residence, 2018)\nJoan Rosier-Jones (2008, 2010)\nMaria Samuela (emerging Pasifika writer-in-residence, 2020)\nElspeth Sandys (2016)\nIan Wedde (wrote novel The Catastrophe, 2009)\nPhilippa Werry (2019)\nMere Whaanga (M\u0101ori writer-in-residence, 2015)\n",
    "British administrator in India\nEdward Parry Thornton (7 October 1811 \u2013 10 December 1893) was a British administrator in India.\nBiography\nThornton was born on 7 October 1811. He was the second son of John Thornton of Clapham by his wife Eliza, daughter of Edward Parry. Samuel Thornton was his grandfather. Edward was educated at Haileybury and Charterhouse, and obtained a writership in the Bengal civil service on 30 April 1830. On 2 August 1831 he was appointed assistant under the commissioner of revenue in the Goruckpore division, and on 6 October 1836 he became assistant to the magistrate and collector at Goruckpore. He returned to England on furlough early in 1842, and on proceeding again to India in 1845 was appointed joint magistrate and deputy collector at Muttra, and later in the same year chief magistrate and collector. In 1848 he was transferred in the same capacity to Serampore. In 1849, when Dalhousie was choosing the ablest Indian officials for the task of organising the Punjaub, Thornton was appointed a commissioner and placed at Rawul Pindi in the Jhelum division. In 1852 he distinguished himself by his promptitude and courage in arresting Nadir Khan, a discontented son of the raja of Mandla, who was endeavouring to promote a rising of the hill tribes. He received a bullet wound in the throat while executing his perilous mission, but had the satisfaction of preventing the rising. In May 1857, at the time of the mutiny, Lord Lawrence made Rawul Pindi his headquarters. Thornton was constantly with him, ably seconding his measures, and he afterwards gave interesting details of Lawrence's conduct at that anxious time, which have been preserved in Bosworth Smith's \u2018Life of Lord Lawrence.\u2019 After Lawrence had denuded the Punjaub of troops to assist in the operations against Delhi, Thornton was called on to exercise more independent authority. In the beginning of September 1857 the intelligence reached Lady Lawrence at Murri that the tribes in the lower Hazarah country contemplated revolt. She communicated the intelligence to Thornton, who succeeded in arresting the leaders of the conspiracy within a few hours, and by this prompt action prevented any attempt at rebellion. On the conclusion of the mutiny Thornton was appointed judicial commissioner for the Punjaub, and on 18 May 1860 he was made a companion of the Bath in recognition of his services. He retired from the Indian service in 1862.\nHe wrote \u2018Illustrations of the History and Practices of the Thugs\u2019 (1837, London, 8vo), ll. Thornton also contributed to the eighth edition of the \u2018Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\u2019 the articles on Bombay, Bengal, Ganges, Nepaul, and, in conjunction with David Buchanan, those on Afghanistan and Burmah.\nThornton died in London at Warwick Square on 10 December 1893. In 1840 he married Louisa Chicheliana, the daughter of R. Chichely Plowden, by whom he had four sons and two daughters. One of his sons, Alfred Thornton, was a footballer.\nSeveral works, commonly attributed to Thornton, are by others of the same name. A Captain Thornton, R.N., was author of 'A Summary of the History of the East India Company' (London, 1833, 8vo). Edward Thornton (1799\u20131875), probably a cousin of Edward Parry Thornton, who was in the East India House from 1814 to 1857, and was head of the maritime department from 1847, wrote\u00a0: 1. 'India: its State and Prospects,' London, 1835, 8vo; 2. 'Chapters of the Modern History of British India,' London, 1840, 8vo; 3. 'History of the British Empire in India,' London, 1841\u20135, 6 vols. 8vo (second edition, 1 vol., 1858); 4. 'Gazetteer of the Countries adjacent to India on the North-West,' London, 1844, 2 vols. 8vo; 5. 'Gazetteer of the Territories under the Government of the East India Company,' London, 1854, 4 vols. 8vo (other editions followed, the last, revised by Sir Roper Lethbridge and Mr. Arthur Naylor Wollaston, appearing in 1886).\n",

    "Software library for LLM infrence\nllama.cpp is an open source software library written in C++, that performs inference on various Large Language Models such as Llama. It is co-developed alongside the ggml library, a general-purpose tensor library.\nHistory\nllama.cpp began development by Georgi Gerganov to implement Llama in pure C++ with no dependencies. The advantage of this method was that it could run on more hardware compared to other inference libraries that depended on hardware dependent closed source libraries like CUDA. It is written in C++. As of June 2024 it has 59 thousand stars on GitHub. Before llama.cpp, Gerganov worked on a similar library called whisper.cpp which implemented Whisper a speech to text model by OpenAI. llama.cpp gained traction from users who did not have specialized hardware as it could run on just a CPU including on Android devices.\nArchitecture\nllama.cpp initially could only run on CPUs but now can run on GPUs using multiple different back-ends including Vulkan and SYCL. These back-ends make up the GGML tensor library which is used by the front-end model-specific llama.cpp code. llama.cpp has its own model format called GGUF (previously referred to as GGML format). llama.cpp supports ahead of time model quantization as opposed to on-the-fly quantization.\nSupported models\nLLaMA\nLlama 2\nLlama 3\nMistral 7B\nMixtral 8x7B\nMixtral 8x22B\nDBRX\nGPT-2\nGrok-1\nGGUF file format\nThe GGUF file format is a binary format that stores both tensors and metadata. GGUF files are typically created by converting models developed in another file format from a different machine learning library such as PyTorch. It is the intention of GGUF's to make model files easy and fast to load within llama.cpp and other ggml projects.\nGGUF was created to replace previous file formats used by the project, which didn't include architecture metadata, and therefore made it difficult to extend the software without breaking backwards compatibility.\nThe format focuses on supporting different quantization types, which can reduce memory usage, and increase speed at the expense of lower model precision.\nSupported data types\nGGUF supports common floating-point data formats float32, and float16, in addition to supporting bfloat16.\nGGUF also supports various quantized integer types:\n1.5-bit\n2-bit\n3-bit\n4-bit\n5-bit\n6-bit\n8-bit\n",
    "Zuni artist and activist\nGomeo Bobelu (December 25, 1964\u2013November 16, 2022), was a Zuni (Zuni: Shiwi) (Badger Clan and Child of the Corn Clan) lapidary jeweler and silversmith who was known for his gemstone-inlayed silver jewelry. He was also a social justice advocate.\nEarly life\nBobelu was born at Zuni Pueblo into a family of artists and farmers. He was educated at the Riverside Indian School in Anadarko, Oklahoma. Bobelu served in the audiovisual services and graphic design division of the U.S. Air Force.\nWork\nBobelu was known for his silversmithing and lapidary jewelry. He considered his work to be a \"tribute to the victims and survivors of suicide and domestic abuse on our Indian reservations.\" His work as an artist was associated with the Santa Fe Indian Market and the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts. His inlaid pieces included turquoise and other stones, fossilized ivory, ironwood, and shell. He worked in a color palette reminiscent of the early 1900s. His work was exhibited in 2010, 2011 and 2012 at the Heard Museum.\nBobelu was a collaborator on the 2018 film, Veiled Lightning, along with Natachee Momaday Gray, Ashley Browning, Tezbah Gaussoin, and others. The film used archival footage, along with interviews and news footage to explore the ways protest movements in the Southwest can support environmental justice and fight oppression and genocide.\nIn 2006, the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian awarded Bobelu with the Goodman Fellowship Award\nHe lived and worked in Santa Fe, New Mexico and at Zuni Pueblo. He was a Zuni tribal elder, and the father of two daughters, and grandfather to 5 grandchildren.\nAdvocacy\nIn addition to his work as a silversmith and jeweler, Bobelu was also a social justice advocate and human rights. He worked as the cultural liaison, environmental advocate and performance coordinator of The Way of the Rain, Inc. (TWOTR), an organization that advocated for environmental issues, and ecosystems, as well as battling against racism, colonialism and missing and murdered Indigenous women and relatives (MMIWR).\nDeath\nBobelu was murdered in 2022. He was given a traditional Zuni wake, and received full U.S. Airforce military honors.\nLegacy\nA 2023 documentary film was made about Bobelu's life and his work fighting against discrimination and adversity. The film was directed by Jaima Chevalier, and was produced by AJ Goldman (Din\u00e9, Taos and Jemez Pueblos) It screened at numerous venues including the New Mexico History Museum and the Santa Fe Film Festival.\n",
    "Manor House in Lohja, Finland\nOjamo Manor (Finnish: Ojamon kartano, Swedish: Ojamo herrg\u00e5rd) is a manor house in Lohja in Uusimaa, Finland. The site is known for housing the remains of the oldest iron mine in Finland. The manor house is owned by a private foundation, Vanha Lohja-s\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6.\nHistory\nOjamo Manor is named in the written sources for the first time in 1384. The significance of the manor house grew during the 16th century when iron ore was found from its grounds. The first findings are dated between 1528 and 1540.\nIron mine\nThe King of Sweden, Gustav Vasa, gave Erik Fleming, the owner of Suitia Manor in Siuntio, a permission to mine iron ore from the grounds of Ojamo Manor in 1542. From Ojamo the iron was transported to Siuntio to be refined in Suitia Ironworks. The iron mine in Ojamo is the oldest known iron mine in Finland. Attempts to mine iron ore from the grounds of Ojamo were done even during the 19th century. However, the mining operations ceased for the last time in 1862.\nMain building\nThe current main building of Ojamo Manor was built using timber in 1850 by lieutenant colonel Dimitri Swertschkoff. Ojamo Manor represents richly decorated Russian empire style. The building has one floor and a centrally positioned tower, which is a later addition.

    "English judge and politician\nNot to be confused with John Blencowe.\nSir John Blencowe (1642 \u2013 May 1726) was an English judge and politician.\nBiography\nBlencowe was born in 1642 at the manor of Marston St. Lawrence, on the Oxfordshire border of Northamptonshire. The family came originally from Greystock, in Cumberland, but this estate was granted to one Thomas Blencowe in the time of Henry VI. Fifth in descent from him was Thomas, father of John Blencowe, who married as his second wife Anne, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Francis Savage of Ripple in Worcestershire. John was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, with which his family was connected. A Blencowe was an early benefactor of the college, and Anthony Blencowe, D.C.L., was provost from 1572 to 1617. He was entered a student of the Inner Temple in 1663, called to the bar 1673, elected a master of the bench in 1687, received the degree of serjeant-at-law 11 April 1689, and represented Brackley in Northamptonshire for five years in the parliament of 1690, being a firm adherent of the government. He married Anne, eldest daughter of Dr. John Wallis, Savilian professor of geometry in Oxford. To this marriage Blencowe in part owed his advancement\u00a0; for when the deanery (or bishopric, according to Granger) of Hereford was offered to Dr. Wallis he declined it, and asked a favour for his son-in-law, saying, 'I have a son-in-law, Mr. Serjeant Blencowe, of the Inner Temple, a member of parliament, an able lawyer, and not inferior to many of those on the bench, of a good life and great integrity, cordial to the government, and serviceable to it.' Accordingly, on 17 September 1696, Blencowe was raised to the bench as a baron of the exchequer, in the room of Sir John Turton. He was removed to the king's bench on 18 January 1697, and knighted and transferred to the common pleas 20 November 1714. Although Baker, Noble, and others speak of him as in the queen's bench from 1702 to 1714, and Luttrell (v. 183) says it was intended to remove him at the beginning of Queen Anne's reign, still Lord Raymond's law reports never speak of him as sitting in the queen's bench, but speak of him as in the common pleas, both at Anne's accession and George I's (Ld. Raymond, 769, 1317). He may then have passed directly from the exchequer to the common pleas. In 1718 he is concurring with other judges in favour of the king's prerogative to control the marriage and education of the royal family. He retired on a pension on 22 June 1722 at the age of eighty, and died May 1726, and was buried at Brackley. Before his death his faculties had decayed; he conceived he had discovered the longitude, and employed his son William in copying his writings to lay before parliament. He is described as being an honest, blunt, and kindly man, but of no great qualifications. He had a large family: John, his heir; Thomas, afterwards a bencher of the Inner Temple, from whom springs the family of Blencowe of Bincham, near Lewes: William; Mary, who married Alexander Prescott, of Tlioby Priory, in Essex; Anne, who married in 1720 Sir E. Probyn, of Newlands, chief baron of the exchequer; Elizabeth; and Susannah, who married R. Jennens, of Princethorp. His third son William, born Jan. 1682\u20133, was the decipherer.\n",

He later became a monarchist, dynastic, sincere Catholic, and Liberal Conservative was a member of the Senate for Ja\u00e9n in 1876 and, for life, from 1877 to 1880.\nIn 1849, he was a founder of the Liberal evening newspaper La \u00c9poca in Madrid, and served as a director from 1849 to 1866. While he was abroad, he collaborated with La \u00c9poca, La Illustration Espa\u00f1ola y Americana, New York News, El Diario de Barcelona and El Diario de la Marina de La Habana.\nDiplomatic career\nFrom 1858 to 1860, he served as Spanish ambassador in Turin (the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia), then as the ambassador in Brussels (the capital of the Kingdom of Belgium) from 1860 to 1862, then as the ambassador in Switzerland between 8 September 1862 and 1 February 1864, followed by the ambassador to Portugal in 1864. In 1868, he requested that he be dismissed as ambassador to Portugal, transferred the direction of La \u00c9poca to Emilio Castelar and accompanied Queen Isabella II into exile in France. On 17 May 1875, he was granted the title Count of Coello de Portugal.\nFrom 30 May 1875 until 4 March 1881, he was the ambassador in Rome (the capital of the Kingdom of Italy). In 1884, he became the diplomatic representative of Spain in the Ottoman Empire, succeeding his friend the Count of Rasc\u00f3n.\nLater life\nDeath notice, 1897\nIn 1873, he founded the Spanish Academy of Fine Arts in Rome which was concerned with the restoration of other buildings belonging to the Spanish State. After his retirement in 1890, he remained in Rome as the head of the Commission of the Pious Places of Jerusalem.\nPersonal life\nCoelle died in Rome on 5 April 1897. His title was inherited by his nephew, Gen. Rafael Coello y Oliv\u00e1n, in 1899.\n",
    "American philosopher and academic\nJohn Martin Gillroy is an American philosopher, author, and academic. He is Professor of philosophy, law, and public policy emeritus at Lehigh University, and the Founding Director of its Environmental Policy Design Programs. He has also been founding Director of three other graduate programs and has held endowed faculty positions at Trinity College, Vermont Law School and Bucknell University, where he was John D. MacArthur Chair of Environmental law and Policy. He has also been a Visiting Fellow at Exeter College, Oxford, and a Visiting Professor of International Relations Simon Fraser University in Vancouver and at the Law Faculty of Queen's University at Kingston. Gillroy is known for his work in applying Enlightenment arguments about practical reason and moral agency to analyze contemporary law and policy, especially environmental risk policy and the evolution of the modern International legal system. He is the executive editor of Philosophy, Public Policy, and Transnational Law, a Palgrave-Macmillan book series.\nIn his 2013 book An Evolutionary Paradigm for International Law Philosophical Method, David Hume, and the Essence of Sovereignty, Gillroy presented the latest refinement of his methodology of Philosophical-Policy And Legal Design (PPLD), which he has been teaching for over thirty years. His core course in PPLD has been featured on the American Philosophical Association\u2019s Blog. PPLD emphasizes the use of Enlightenment Argument to integrate philosophy, public policy, and law into paradigms for application to the full range of contemporary public issues. Through this interdisciplinary approach, students, citizens, scholars and practitioners alike  learn to analyze primary-source philosophical texts, convert them into a Paradigm Structure, develop persuasive policy-legal arguments, and apply them perspectives to real-world issues in policy and law.\nBibliography\nSelect books\nGillroy, J.

    "1966  film\nNocturne (Latvian: Noktirne) is a 1966 Soviet war drama film. Based on the story of the same name by Jean Griva\u00a0, a former fighter of the International Brigades.\nPlot\nThe last stage of the Spanish Civil War. The Republican army retreated beyond the Pyrenees. By chance, the paths of the Latvian Georges, a fighter in one of the detachments, and the French woman, nurse Yvette, cross. They fell in love, but got lost in the chaos of war. Yvette managed to cross the border and hide in her homeland, and Georges ended up in a concentration camp.\nSeveral years passed, France was occupied by Nazi troops. In a small Marseilles restaurant, Georges, who escaped from the camp, meets his beloved. Both join the partisans at one of the secret mountain bases. When the main part of the detachment went on a mission, the camp was attacked by punitive forces. In a fierce battle, Yvette dies, not long after waiting for her comrades to return.\nCast\nPola Raksa as Yvette\nGun\u0101rs Cilinskis as Georges\nJuris Plavins as Leingren\nVladimir Vasiliev as lanky soldier\nJ\u0101nis Zenne as Denis\nProduction\nTo make the film more authentic, director Rostislav Goryaev traveled to Moscow to consult with Ilya Ehrenburg.\nFilming took place on the streets of Riga, in the pavilions of the Riga Film Studio, in Armenia (where the \u201cSpanish\u201d scenes were filmed). Mountain France was reproduced in the Tien Shan.\nTo enhance the artistic image, it was decided to conditionally divide the script into three short stories, each of which begins with a quote from a literary classic. The first is a dialogue from William Shakespeare's play \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d, the second is an excerpt from a poem by the French poet Paul Eluard, and in the finale is a line from Garcia Lorca: \u201cBe quiet... when I'm dead!\u201d\nCritical response\nM. Lesovoy (Soviet Screen): The fight against fascism and love are intertwined in the destinies of the heroes Latvian Georges and frenchwoman Yvette, who left their distant homes to stop fascism. But the fight against fascism did not end in Spain; it only began there. And when the Nazis captured France, Georges, who had escaped from a concentration camp, made his way to the town where Yvette lived. Here, with his French friends, as before with his Spanish friends, he continues his battle with Nazism until his last breath, until victory.\nMikhail Trofimenkov\u00a0, in his 2016 review, noted that the film is not so much about war, but about the simplest of the simplest things on earth   about the meeting of a man and a woman in war. \"Nocturne\" is nakedly simple. The agony of the republic brought together the Latvian Georges and the frenchwoman Yvette for one night. The Second World War reunited them in the French Resistance and separated them forever: there was no death in Soviet cinema more terrible than the death of Yvette. He was played by Gun\u0101rs Cilinskis, she by the Polish star, shyly sexy woman-girl Pola Raksa. But the nationality of the heroes and actors is purely arbitrary. In the international brigades everyone had one nationality: anti-fascist.\n",

    "Manor house in Herefordshire, England\nRudhall Manor is a manor house in Rudhall, Herefordshire, England. It dates from the late 14th century and is a Grade I listed building.\nHistory\nThe hamlet of Rudhall sits at the junction of three parishes, Brampton Abbotts, Ross-on-Wye and Weston under Penyard, about 2 miles to the east of Ross. Rudhall Manor dates from the 14th century, although the house underwent extensive remodelling in each subsequent century and was restored in the 20th. In the Tudor era the manor came into the possession of Herbert Westfaling II, son of the Bishop of Hereford, who married the Rudhall heriess. In the early 19th century, the house was reputedly used as a point of assignation by Lord Nelson and his lover, Emma Hamilton, during their tours of the Wye Valley. In 1830 the manor was bought by Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton of Barings Bank. Later owners included the ornithologist Peter Scott and the businessman John Harvey-Jones. As at May 2024, the manor is for sale.\nArchitecture and description\nPevsner and Brooks describe the complex building history of the manor, which was begun in the 14th century, and developed by William Rudhall in the 16th. Later Georgian and Victorian developments saw the house extended with wings to the south and east. The interior has much wood panelling, some original and some introduced to the house, and decorative wood and stone carving. Above the entrance porch, the Rudhall badge, a Catherine Wheel, is displayed. Rudhall Manor is a Grade I listed building. Unusually, due to its location at the junction of three parishes, it has two Grade I listings, for the house in the Ross parish, and for those parts in the parish of Brampton Abbotts.\nThe grounds include a stream, lakes, and the base of a medieval church cross.\nNotes\n^ The antiquarian Samuel Meyrick purchased a number of items from the house in the 1830 sale, for display at his nearby home, Goodrich Court. These included the menu for a New Year's Eve feast hosted by Westfaling in 1598, at which he offered veal, mutton, beef, pigeon and goose, followed by mince pies.\n^ Catherine of Alexandria, who was martyred on a breaking wheel, had been venerated in nearby Ledbury since the Early Middle Ages.\n",

    "The California School of economic history is a label that as been applied to a particular approach to the economic history of the early modern world. The chief elements of their analysis is that over the period from 1400 to 1800 the most advanced economies of Eurasia formed a world of surprising resemblances. They argue that the Great Divergence,  a divergence between the West (Western Europe) and the Rest (China, India and Japan) only really began with industrialisation in the 19th century. This Great Divergence should be interpreted as a more contingent and more recent phenomenon than the proponents of the Great Divergence have argued for.  The basic cause of the divergence being framed in terms of the availability of the resources in the context of global interconnections and comparisons. The most noted proponents of the approach include:  Kenneth Pomeranz, Roy Bin Wong, Jack Goldstone, James Z. Lee,  Feng Wang, Dennis Flynn, Robert B. Marks,  Andre Gunder Frank and Jack Goody and John M. Hobson.  The name of the approach is due to most of these scholars working at Californian universities. In comparing the Rest with the West, Vries critically reviewing their approach notes some differences in the emphasis of different scholars. Some argue that Europe was more backward, some that Asia was more advanced, some that Europe climbed on top of Asia via various forms of exploitation and some that the West and the Rest were really not that different. This later he refers to as the Eurasian similarity-thesis.  Of importance in their analysis, according to Jack Goldstone (Grinin, L., & Korotayev, A. (2015, pp. v-vii)), is the continuing high productivity of both agricultural and manufacturing technology in India and China with them remaining world-dominant powers up to the end of the 17th Century. This, and the relatively high living standards, and competitive nature of their merchants,  who were at least the equal of European trading companies in terms of power until the end of the 17th century. Pomeranz, who is perhaps the dominant figure in the approach,  emphasises the access to natural resources (domestic coal and external colonies), rather than the alleged specialness of European capitalism, with its cultures of enlightenment and bourgeois virtues.\nSelected Key readings\nPomeranz, K., The Great Divergence.

    "German poet (1820\u20131858)\nSchults' picture in a biographical article commemorating his death, published in 1858 in the magazine Die Gartenlaube\nAdolf Schults (5 June 1820 \u2013 2 April 1858) was a German poet.\nLife\nSchults was born in Elberfeld, Germany on 5 June 1820 to parents of \"little financial means\". His father was a foreman in a silk goods factory, while his more-educated mother came from a French family. After leaving school before reaching the secondary level, he entered his father's business. After marrying in 1843, he left this business six months after his father was forced to resign.\nHe was a deputy editor of the Barmer Zeitung newspaper for a time, but left it sometime before 1848.\nHe mainly worked as an accountant while writing poetry in his free time, in a situation similar to his childhood friend Friedrich Roeber.\nSchults became known primarily for his lyrical works. Among his most famous poems, some of which also contained sociopolitical themes, is the satirical parody Ein neues Lied von den Webern (A New Song of the Weavers), written in response to Heinrich Heine's 1844 poem The Silesian Weavers. Also frequently cited today is his Mother's Day poem Das Mutterauge (Mother's Eye).\nHe was a member of the Wuppertal poets' circle (Wuppertaler Dichterkreis) in the early 1850s. In Schults' estate, the historian Michael Knieriem found the fragment of a drama by Friedrich Engels, entitled Cola di Rienzi. Schults also wrote a poem about Engels in 1848/49.\nHe died on 2 April 1858 in Elberfeld\u2014reportedly \"excessive work, especially at night time, increased his nervousness and ultimately led to the uncanny chest pain  to which he succumbed\".\nWorks\n\u2014 (1843).

    "Unsolved series of murders\nThe Nassau County serial murders were a series of murders of young women committed between 1984 and 1989 in Nassau County, New York. All the victims had been involved in prostitution or had drug addictions, and the perpetrator, a possible serial killer, was never apprehended.\nThese murders were the first possible instance of a serial killer operating in the Long Island area, as in the following decades, at least four unrelated serial killers were apprehended, collectively victimizing at least 32 girls and women.\nMurders\nThe official list of victims includes five women. There was no consistent manner in how they were murdered, as two had been bludgeoned to death, one victim was stabbed, another was strangled, and yet another was shot.\nDeborah Lee Smith, 20: originally from Quincy, California. Murdered in August 1984. Her corpse was found wrapped up in a blanket on August 21 near a curb on Hunters Avenue in Valley Stream. She had been shot twice in the head and chest area from close range, apparently with a large-caliber weapon.\nJonie Jackson, 27: murdered in early 1985. Her corpse, showing signs of moderate decomposition, was found in a parking lot on Franklin Avenue in Hempstead on February 18, 1985. A forensic examination concluded that the cause of death was a head injury sustained in a beating. Jackson's body was covered in a plastic bag by the perpetrator after committing the murder.\nGwendolyn \"Gwen\" Lukes, 26: found strangled in a cemetery in Upper Brookville on September 13, 1985. At the time of her death, Lukes was known to have prostituted herself in the Hempstead area for about three years.\nGenise Wilder, 22: originally from Roosevelt. Murdered in June 1989. Her body, bearing multiple stab wounds, was found on June 27 of that year in a factory area on Kellum Place in Hempstead.\nChristine Warner, 23: originally from Manhattan, also known by the name \"Tina Clark.\" Found beaten to death on December 13, 1989, in a wooded area near the Meadowbrook Polo Club in Old Westbury.\nSuspect\nDuring the investigation, one person was considered the prime suspect\u2014a resident of Long Beach named Allen Gormely Jr. He was born on September 18, 1953, in Brooklyn, New York City, as the only son of Allen Gormely Sr. and Phyllis Capone, who had multiple daughters. Gormely Jr. spent his childhood and early life in Oceanside, where they moved after his parents divorced. After dropping out of West Hempstead High School upon completing the 10th grade, he trained to be a carpenter but was unable to find work in this field; instead, he started working in various strip clubs, nightclubs, sex stores, and pornographic film sales stores in New York City's various suburbs. At some point, he also worked as a trucker for a company based in Brooklyn. Gormely was unmarried and spent most of his time in red-light districts, but had no criminal record and had never been criminally charged until 1990.\nOn November 8, 1990, Gormely was arrested for the murders of two prostitutes committed in Queens. The victims were named as 19-year-old Stephanie Krut and 25-year-old Mayra Eusebio, who had been murdered on February 10 and October 30, 1990, respectively. After his arrest, Gormely confessed to killing both, telling investigators that he strangled the women inside his apartment in Long Beach on 511 West Walnut Street after they supposedly demanded that he give them money to buy crack cocaine, which he refused. Upon saying so, he alleged that both women threatened to tell their pimps to harm him.\nGormely became a suspect since he had placed both of his victims' bodies in plastic garbage bags and dumped them on the outskirts of town, similar to how the murders of Lukes and Wilder had been carried out. He was investigated for these crimes as well, but was never charged due to a lack of evidence. In 1992, he was tried for both of his confirmed murders, with his defense being that he had accidentally killed both women during \"rough sex.\" However, this did not convince the jury, and Gormely was convicted of the murders of Krut and Eusebio, subsequently being given a 50-year sentence.\nGormely died in the Wende Correctional Facility on September 28, 2014. He was never charged with any other murders, and all the cases associated with the Nassau County serial murders remain cold cases.\nSee also\nGilgo Beach serial killings\nList of serial killers in the United States\n",
    "Primary capital city of the Liao dynasty of China\nArchaeological site of Linhuangfu\nLinhuangfu (simplified Chinese: \u4e34\u6f62\u5e9c; traditional Chinese: \u81e8\u6f62\u5e9c; lit. 'Linhuang Prefecture') was the primary capital city of the Liao dynasty of China, during which it was also known as Shangjing (Chinese: \u4e0a\u4eac; lit. 'Upper/Supreme Capital'). The city was founded in 918 by the Liao emperor Yel\u00fc Abaoji, and was named Shangjing Linhuangfu in 938. Its ruins are located in present-day Baarin Left Banner, Inner Mongolia, China.\nHistory\nIn 918, the Liao founder Yel\u00fc Abaoji established the city as huangdu (imperial capital) in the Liaoxi steppe, the homeland of the nomadic Khitan people that established the empire. According to the History of Liao, the construction of the new city was overseen by Kang Moji (\u5eb7\u9ed8\u8a18), and completed within 100 days. Shangjing was modeled after the Tang capital Chang'an. The Liao took in large groups of Han Chinese refugees, many of whom were resettled in the capital as well as neighboring towns in the steppe, together with captured soldiers and civilians from northern China. The capital saw large-scale expansion and rebuilding in 926, after the Liao conquest of Bohai, including the addition of a southern \"Han City\" and the completion of imperial palaces. Despite Linhuangfu being the Supreme Capital, the Khitan court maintained their mobile lifestyle, constantly traveling across the empire.\nJurchens of the Jin dynasty conquered Linhuangfu in 1120, destroying much of the city. It was redesignated as the Northern Capital in 1138, and ceased to be one of the Jin capitals in 1150. The city was destroyed by the Mongol armies in 1214 and left abandoned afterwards.\nLayout\nRemains of Dashun Gate, the southern gate of the Imperial City\nShangjing was located at the southern end of the Greater Khingan Range, along the Shali River. The city consisted of an Imperial City in the north and a Han City in the south, now separated by the Shali. The former housed the imperial family and the ruling elite, while the latter was the residence of Han Chinese and other non-Khitan populations. The Imperial City had an irregular square plan, and measured 1.8 kilometres (1.1\u00a0mi) by 1.6 kilometres (0.99\u00a0mi). The Han city was 1.2 kilometres (0.75\u00a0mi) by 1.6 kilometres (0.99\u00a0mi) in size. The walls of the Imperial City was up to 9 metres (30\u00a0ft) high and 15 metres (49\u00a0ft) thick, whereas the Han city had walls as high as 4 metres (13\u00a0ft) and up to 12 metres (39\u00a0ft) in thickness.\nThe palatial district was located in the central-eastern part of the Imperial City, with a perimeter of 2.7 kilometres (1.7\u00a0mi). A large Buddhist monastery has been confirmed on the heights near the western wall of the Imperial City.\n",
    "Railway station in Eudunda, South Australia\nEudunda railway station was located at the junction of the Morgan railway line and the Robertstown railway line. Situated in the town of Eudunda, South Australia, it was located 111 kilometres from Adelaide by rail.\nHistory\nOpening\nEudunda railway station opened on 23 September 1878 as part of the final extension of the Northern Railway from the existing terminus at Kapunda. The extension helped to provide a connection to the Murray River. The station facilities included a stone station building on a passenger platform and a goods shed. Infrastructure to provide water to steam locomotives was also provided, including a water column and water tank at the southern end of the station, and a large dam that held nearly 4 million gallons of water. The dam burst on 3 separate occasions in 1903, 1913, and 1915 due to heavy weather events. The most serious of these was in 1913 as a large thunderstorm caused the town to flood and significant damage to the dam, as the dam burst was unable to be stopped early.\nGoods trains often hauled grain and livestock from the station, and grain would become the sole commodity transported in later years.\nEudunda became a junction station on 9 December 1914, with the opening of the railway line to Robertstown. The junction was located east of the town. During the 1950s-1960s, grain silos were provided at the station yard, allowing bulk handing of grain for goods trains without the need for bagging.\nClosure\nThe station closed for regular passenger use on 15 December 1968, but some special train tours used the station afterwards. It ceased to be a junction station on 2 November 1969, with the closure of the line between Eudunda and Morgan. In 1978, the station and all associated infrastructure were included in the transfer of South Australian Railways non-metropolitan assets to Australian National. The last passenger train to use the station was a tour run by Train Tour Promotions to Robertstown on 20 May 1989. Eudunda became the terminus of the line with the closure of the Robertstown line on 25 September 1990. On 11 March 1994, the Kapunda-Eudunda section of the line was closed after the last grain train was run from Eudunda. This section was pulled up the following year. In 2003, the railway yard land was transferred to the Regional Council of Goyder.\nPresent Day\nThe ganger's shed was relocated to the National Railway Museum, Port Adelaide around 1990, where it has since been on display. A scaled down 2D replica of the first locomotive to pass the town, the Pioneer is placed next to the station building, which is privately owned and fenced off. The water tower and water column at the southern end of the yard are intact. Most of the non-grain goods infrastructure has been demolished, except for the base of the goods crane. The grain silos were painted in 2022 by artist Sam Brooks, becoming a part of the Australian Silo Art Trail. The project, known as 'Eudunda: The Storytime Silos features art based on local author Colin Thiele's book 'The Sun on the Stubble,' and the Ngadjuri story book made in collaboration with local Ngadjuri elder Quentin Aeguis. In 2024, the section car placed on the weighbridge was cosmetically restored. It was originally donated to the Eudunda community in 1997.\n",
    "A Russian Orthodox Saint and Hymnographer, canonized in 2000.\nAthanasius Sakharov was a Russian Orthodox saint and hymnographer, canonized in 2000.\nEarly life\nSaint Athanasius Sakharov, birth name: Sergei Sakharov,was born on 2 July 1887, he was born in the Tsarevka Village in the Tambov Governorship. Throughout his early life Saint Athanasius and his family lived in the Russian city of Vladimir. Athanasius\u2019 father,  Gregory Zakharov, was a civil-ranking Court Councillor, whilst Athanasius\u2019 mother, Matrona, was from a peasant family.\nAn image of a young, Saint Athanasius Sakharov, holding a Bishop's Crozier. The image was taken in 1889, when Athanasius was 2 years old.Unfortunately when Athanasius was 1+1\u20442 years old, his father, Gregory Zakhorov died. After Athanasius\u2019 father's death, Matrona's piety increased and she took on the monastic lifestyle, which greatly influenced Athanasius\u2019 spiritual life. During this period, the boy was very keen on attending lengthy Church Services and Liturgies. Even though he was young Saint Athanasius considered himself a servant of the church and told all his friends and classmates his dreams to achieve priesthood. Impressively at a young age, Athanasius learned how to sew, which he used his skill to sew many Church vestments and he embroider many icon coverings.\nEducation\nAthanasius Sakharov found his education difficult, he didn't slacken his efforts, but unexpectedly at the end of the school year he graduated at the top of the class. Impressively, at the age of 12 he wrote his first troparion to the Shuisk-Smolensk icon of the Mother of God.\nIcon of the Shuisk-Smolensk Mother of God.After finishing his Primary Education, Athanasius entered a religious seminary in his hometown Vladimir. As a religious seminary student, Athanasius displayed a talent at ignoring temptations. A clandestine chapter of the seminary ended, when one of its leaders died due to mishandling explosives. In the summer of 1901, revolutionary seminary students held a secret meeting later resulting in a riot amongst the students in December, when they went on strike refusing to attend the seminary. During this period, Athanasius was not interested in boycotting the seminary due to his refusal in taking part in Politics. Eventually after graduating the Vladimir Seminary, he transferred to the Moscow Religious Academy. During his stay at the Moscow Academy, he took on a monastic tonsure taking the name Athanasius after the famous Saint Athanasius of Alexandria. In 1912, Athanasius graduated the Moscow Academy with a degree in theology.\n",
    "American physician and naturalist (~1837\u20131888)\nCharles Austin Stivers (c.\u20091837\u00a0\u2013 November 4, 1887) was an American physician and naturalist. He made a collection of annual harlequin lupine on the Mariposa Trail to Yosemite, and the plant was given the binomial name Lupinus stiversii.\nBiography\nStivers born in New York State around 1837 to parents born in New York and Connecticut. At the time of the 1850 census he was living with his family in New York City and attending school. The family was in San Francisco by 1861 according to city directories, with Stivers and his father working as clerks at the same business.\nYo-Semite Valley, from the Mariposa Trail by Charles L Weed, 1864\nHarlequin lupine at Ventana Wilderness, 2022\nAccording to Willis Linn Jepson, Stivers was in the U.S. Army at the time he first collected harlequin lupine. Jepson wrote, \"With yellow banner and rose-pink wings it is a most beautiful species which is never mistaken by even the novice, nor confused with any other member of the genus. It was discovered by Lieutenant Charles Austin Stivers, U. S. A., at Summit Meadow on the Mariposa trail to Yosemite in or about the year 1862, and was named in his honor by Dr. Albert Kellogg (Proc. Cal. Acad. 2:192,\u20141862). Of Lieutenant Stivers little is known. He held the degree of Doctor of Medicine, and was at one time especially interested in the study of the marine algae. His name is mentioned occasionally in the pages of early proceedings of the Cal. Acad. Sci.\"\nStivers was part of the first graduating class of what is now the medical school at UCSF. In 1871 he was on the board of the Gillis Gold Mining Co. According to his obituary, \"He was Dr. Blach's assistant when the latter was first appointed City Physician and was also the first Police Surgeon of the city. During his realm be established the city receiving hospital.\" In 1880, Stivers was deputy health officer for the city of San Francisco. In 1880 he published an article about the \"hard and ornamental woods of the Pacific Coast.\" At the time of the 1880 census he lived with his wife and three children in San Francisco. Stivers died suddenly at his San Francisco home in 1888, at age 51.\n",
    "\nVincent Bordot (born 9 April 1975) is a French football manager and former player. A midfielder, he played eight games in Ligue 2 for Le Mans at the start of his career before representing clubs in lower divisions. \nAs a manager, he led Entente to promotion to the Championnat National in an eight-year spell, eliminating Montpellier of Ligue 1 from the Coupe de France in 2019 before being relegated and leaving. With Red Star, he eliminated top-flight Nantes in a run to the last 16 of the cup in 2021 before being sacked that September.\nPlaying career\nBorn in Coulaines, near Le Mans in Sarthe, Bordot got his break in football when Marc Westerloppe saw him play in a Division d'Honneur match for his local team and gave him a trial for Le Mans FC's reserve team in the fifth-tier CFA 2. Bordot frustrated the club for his lack of commitment, but Westerloppe gave him one last chance, and gave him his professional debut on 29 April 1998 in a Ligue 2 game against OGC Nice.\nBordot left Le Mans in 1999 for Thouars Foot 79 of the third-tier Championnat National, followed by Tours FC, then Paris FC in the CFA, AS Beauvais in the National and Saint-Pryv\u00e9 Saint-Hilaire FC in CFA 2. He moved to Paris because of his wife's work, and was signed by Paris FC in 2001 after sending them a curriculum vitae; in his first season there he was made captain by manager Robert Buigues.\nManagerial career\nEntente\nBordot began managing at age 32 in 2007, at Saint-Pryv\u00e9, followed by joining Entente SSG in 2011. His team were promoted to the Championnat National in 2017. On 2 December 2018, his team won 3\u20132 at home to Paris FC \u2013 ranked 4th in Ligue 2 \u2013 in the 8th round of the Coupe de France.\nOn 5 January 2019, Bordot's Entente won 1\u20130 at home to Montpellier HSC \u2013 4th in Ligue 1 \u2013 in the last 64 of the cup. A month later they fell in the next round by a single goal at home to FC Nantes, also of the top flight. The 2018\u201319 Championnat National season ended with relegation; his last home game was a 4\u20131 loss to Pau FC.\nRed Star\nRemaining in the third tier, Bordot signed a two-year contract at Red Star F.C. in June 2019. On 6 March 2021, he led them to a 3\u20132 win at home to top-flight RC Lens in the last 32 of the cup. In the next round on 8 April against Olympique Lyonnais at the Stade Bauer, his team overcame a 2\u20130 half-time deficit to take the game to extra time, then lost 5\u20134 on penalties.\nAfter a 6\u20130 loss at FC Annecy on 10 September 2021, Bordot was removed from his post at Red Star six games into the season.\nParis 13 Atletico\nIn October 2022, Bordot was hired at Paris 13 Atletico, who had won once in their first nine games of the 2022\u201323 Championnat National. He won two and lost five of his 11 league matches before his dismissal in February 2023; the team slipped one league place to 17th in his tenure.\nPersonal life\nBordot said in 2022 that he was tired of being incorrectly referred to as a Parisian manager, having spent all of his managerial career in the capital city's region. He indicated that he was born far from the city and had spent most of his playing career away from it, having moved there only because of his ex-wife. He also said that he was approached by Annecy and US Orl\u00e9ans  in 2021.\n",
    "\nPierre Goldberg (born 25 August 1938) is a French politician. Elected as a deputy in 1978, 1988, and 1997, he was re-elected on 16 June 2002, after the 2001 municipal elections won by Daniel Dugl\u00e9ry (UMP), for the legislature 2002\u20132007, representing the second constituency of Allier. He remained in office until his resignation on March\u00a02007,\u00a016\u00a0(16-March-2007Ten France), and was a member of the Communist group. He was among the few representatives of the working class in the National Assembly.\nBiography\nBorn to a postal worker, Pierre Goldberg began his professional career after his primary studies in Saint-Sornin, working as a farm laborer until the age of twenty. He was the second of three children (Ren\u00e9, Pierre, and Marinette) whose parents were from public assistance.\nHe became involved in activism during the Algerian War. He came into contact with the Union of Republican Youth of France just before the organization took on the name of Young Communist Movement of France. In 1956, he participated in a national congress, where the conclusion of the proceedings was greeted by a veteran of French communism, Marcel Cachin.\nAfter twenty-eight months of military service, he joined the PTT (Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone Services) as an auxiliary in Montlu\u00e7on, following in his father's footsteps. Between 1961 and 1977, he progressed within the postal administration, becoming a telecommunications sector leader and a manager. Joining the French Communist Party in 1961, he engaged in activism within the PTT's General Confederation of Labour (CGT), simultaneously pursuing union work at the PTT and political beginnings within the PCF federation of Allier, where he served on the board from 1964 onwards.\nEntering the Montlu\u00e7on city council in 1972 with his friend Roger Loury, he was elected to the new Montlu\u00e7on-West canton in the Allier General Council in 1973, becoming its First Vice President in 1976, and a regional councilor for Auvergne in 1977. In the same year, he was elected mayor of Montlu\u00e7on and the following year, a deputy for Allier, and was chosen as secretary of the National Assembly.\nIn the 1981 legislative elections, he was defeated by the Socialist Albert Chaubard, causing a crisis within the municipal majority between communists and socialists. The socialists presented an independent list in the 1983 municipal elections, but the leadership of the municipality remained unchanged.\nIn November 1991, the former PTT unionist hosted the 28th Congress of the National Federation of PTT-CGT in Montlu\u00e7on.\nIn 1998, he resigned as mayor in favor of his friend and first deputy, Jean-Claude Micouraud. This decision was strongly criticized by his left-wing detractors, rightly or wrongly; the fact is that in 2001, the left-wing union list led by Jean-Claude Micouraud was heavily defeated following a very violent campaign by the right-wing list of Daniel Dugl\u00e9ry.\nConvicted with Jean-Claude Micouraud and Denis Planchet, to one year of ineligibility, six months of imprisonment, and the payment of \u20ac800,900 in damages to the city of Montlu\u00e7on for seven fictitious jobs (three municipal employees working at the headquarters of the local section of the Communist Party and four at the local radio station Radio Montlu\u00e7on Bourbonnais), Pierre Goldberg resigned from his parliamentary mandate on March\u00a02007,\u00a016\u00a0(16-March-2007). Then, reinstated in his civil rights, he led a communist and various left-wing list in Montlu\u00e7on in April\u00a0March\u00a0(March-2008), but came in third behind the outgoing UMP mayor Daniel Dugl\u00e9ry and the list of Socialist deputy Bernard Lesterlin.\nHis administration was responsible for several Montlu\u00e7on infrastructures, such as Athanor, the Boris Vian space and its Ilets park, the installation of a National Dramatic Center, \"Les F\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s\", the development of the Saint-Jacques district, the Boulevard de Courtais, the upper town (laying of cobblestones, pedestrian streets); in 1983, he obtained the installation of an MRI at the hospital.\nHe was also the initiator of an active social and cultural policy.\nIn June 2010, after fifty years of activism, he left the PCF and joined the FASE.\nOffices\nMarch\u00a01977,\u00a013\u00a0(13-March-1977)\u2013March\u00a01983,\u00a06\u00a0(6-March-1983): Mayor of Montlu\u00e7on (Allier)\n1977\u20131986: Member of the Auvergne Regional Council\n1973\u20131979: Member of the Allier General Council\n1976\u20131979: First Vice President of the Allier General Council\nApril\u00a01978,\u00a03\u00a0(3-April-1978)\u2013May\u00a01981,\u00a022\u00a0(22-May-1981): Member of the National Assembly\nMarch\u00a01982,\u00a022\u00a0(22-March-1982)\u2013June\u00a01988,\u00a027\u00a0(27-June-1988): Member of the Allier General Council\nMarch\u00a01983,\u00a014\u00a0(14-March-1983)\u2013March\u00a01989,\u00a012\u00a0(12-March-1989): Mayor of Montlu\u00e7on (Allier)\nMarch\u00a01986,\u00a017\u00a0(17-March-1986)\u2013June\u00a01988,\u00a027\u00a0(27-June-1988): Member of the Auvergne Regional Council\nJune\u00a01988,\u00a013\u00a0(13-June-1988)\u2013April\u00a01993,\u00a01\u00a0(1-April-1993): Member of the National Assembly\nMarch\u00a01989,\u00a024\u00a0(24-March-1989)\u2013June\u00a01995,\u00a018\u00a0(18-June-1995): Mayor of Montlu\u00e7on (Allier)\nJune\u00a01995,\u00a025\u00a0(25-June-1995)\u2013",

    "13th-century  French rabbi and encyclopedist\nRabbi Levi ben Abraham ben Hayyim (Hebrew: \u05dc\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd \u05d1\u05df \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05dc\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e0\u05e9) was a French encyclopedist; champion of the liberal party in Provence in the struggle for the study of secular sciences; born at Villefranche-de-Conflent, Roussillon, between 1240 and 1250; died at or near Arles soon after 1315.\nBiography\nHe was descended from a scholarly family. His father, Abraham ben \u1e24ayyim, was a Synagogue poet, and rabbi in Narbonne ,but he left about 1240 to settle finally in Villefranche. Levi's uncle Reuben ben \u1e24ayyim, also, like his grandfather, was a scholar. A son of this Reuben ben \u1e24ayyim was, probably, Samuel ben Reuben of B\u00e9ziers, who took Levi's part, although in vain, in his conflict with the orthodox party in Provence. Levi himself was the maternal grandfather of the philosopher Levi ben Gershon of Bagnols.\nLife\nLevi ben Abraham was instructed in Bible and Talmud, and in secular sciences as well, and was soon drawn into the rationalistic current of the time. One of his teachers was a certain Rabbi Jacob, whom he cites as his authority for an astronomical explanation, and who may have been Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon. It is probable, also, that Levi was instructed by his uncle Reuben ben \u1e24ayyim, from whom he quotes an explanation of Gen. i. 3.\nLevi left his native city (probably on account of poverty, which oppressed him almost throughout his life), remained for a short time in Perpignan, and then went to Montpellier, where, in 1276, he was engaged in literary pursuits, and earned a scanty living by teaching languages and lecturing. During the heat of the controversy over the study of secular sciences he was at Narbonne, in the house of the wealthy Samuel of Escaleta, who was prominent both as a poet and a scholar. Levi enjoyed his hospitality until, yielding to the pressure of the opposing party, represented especially by Shlomo ibn Aderet, Samuel of Escaleta asked his guest to leave. The latter then sought shelter with his cousin Samuel ben Reuben in B\u00e9ziers, but was persecuted, apparently, even there. He was excommunicated by the orthodox party, yet, after the conflict was over, in 1315, he found rest and quiet at Arles, where he remained until his death. He has been identified by some with Levi of Perpignan, whom Judah Mosconi, in his super-commentary to Abraham ibn Ezra, characterizes as one of the most prominent of scholars.\nWorks\nSteinschneider points out that a large portion of the scientific works written in Arabic were made accessible in Hebrew translations in the first half of the thirteenth century, and that the entire realm of knowledge began to be treated in encyclopedias in the second half of the same century. Levi ben Abraham wrote two such encyclopedic works, which show the range of knowledge of an educated rationalistic Proven\u00e7al Jew of that period. The first of these is the \"Batte ha-Nefesh weha-Le\u1e25ashim,\" the title of which is taken from Isa. iii. 20. It is a rimed compendium, didactic in tone, of the various sciences, in ten chapters and 1,846 lines, with a few explanatory notes and a preface, also in rimed prose. In the preface to this work, which is frequently found in manuscripts, Levi demonstrates the usefulness of his compendium by pointing out the difficulties which those who are not well acquainted with general literature must surmount in order to acquire a knowledge of the sciences, which are scattered through all sorts of books. He had long cherished the thought of compiling an encyclopedia, but had always been deterred by the fear that the task would prove beyond his power; at last, in 1276, strength was promised him in a vision, whereupon he began the work at Montpellier.\nEncyclopedia.\nLevi was compelled, by the nature of the work, to limit himself to giving the conclusions of the chief authorities, particularly of Maimonides, whom he follows step by step. Ch. i. treats of ethics. In the paragraphs treating of the history of the diffusion of learning, the author expresses the view that the Greeks and Arabs derived almost their entire scientific culture from the ancient Hebrews, a theory which justified the reading of Greco-Arabic ideas into the Bible (Steinschneider). The following chapters treat of logic (ii.), the Creation (iii.), the soul (iv.), prophecy and the Messianic period (v.; the coming of the Messiah will occur in the year 1345), the mystic theme of the \"Merkabah,\" the divine throne-chariot (vi.), numbers (vii.), astronomy and astrology (viii.), physics (ix.), and metaphysics (x.). After the author himself had found it necessary to provide the difficult verses with explanatory notes (which are not found in all the manuscripts), Solomon de Lunas, probably identical with Solomon ben Menahem Prat (or Porat), wrote, about 1400, a commentary to the \"Batte ha-Nefesh weha-Le\u1e25ashim.\"\n\"Liviat Chen\"\nThe second work of Levi was the \"Liviat Chen\" or \"Sefer ha-Kolel,\" a \"comprehensive book\" (encyclopedia).

    "2022 single by Rauw Alejandro\n\"De Carolina\" (transl.\u2009\"From Carolina\") is a song recorded by Puerto Rican singer Rauw Alejandro and Puerto Rican producer DJ Playero for Alejandro's third studio album, Saturno (2022). It was written by Alejandro, while the production was handled by Caleb Calloway, Kenobi, Alejandro, and DJ Playero. The song was released by Sony Music on December 8, 2022, as the fourth single from the album. A homage to Alejandro's hometown, Carolina, Puerto Rico, where reggaeton thrived in the 1990s, the track merges the singer's modern reggaeton vision with Playero's classic style, incorporating rave-ready beats and a sped-up sample of \"La Gente Sabe\" to pay tribute to the city and the Puerto Rican duo Maicol & Manuel.\n\"De Carolina\" received highly positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its lyrics and fusion of genres. It was awarded Best New Track by Pitchfork. The song reached number one in Central America, and peaked within the top 10 in Honduras, and on Billboard's Latin Digital Song Sales in the United States. It was certified gold in Spain. An accompanying music video, released simultaneously with the song, was directed by Martin Seipel. It depicts Alejandro celebrating his roots with a dynamic tour of his childhood streets, showcasing the local culture and daily life. The song was included on the set list for Alejandro's the Saturno World Tour.\nBackground and release\nRauw Alejandro released his second studio album, Vice Versa on June 25, 2021. The album debuted at number one on Billboard Top Latin Albums, giving Alejandro his first number one on the chart, and was ranked as the third-best album of 2021 and the best Spanish-language album of the year by Rolling Stone. In September 2022, he announced that he was going to release his third album in November and it would be titled Saturno. On November 10, 2022, he revealed the album's track list, mentioning it being set for release the following day. The album was released for digital download and streaming by Sony Music Latin and Duars Entertainment on the specified date, and \"De Carolina\" was included as the 17th track on the album. On December 8, 2022, the track was released as the fourth single from the album.\nMusic and lyrics\n\"De Carolina\", which translates to \"From Carolina\" in English, is a heartfelt homage to Alejandro's hometown, Carolina, Puerto Rico, where reggaeton thrived in the 1990s. He merges his modern reggaeton vision with Playero's classic style, incorporating rave-ready beats and a sped-up sample of \"La Gente Sabe\" to pay tribute to the city and the Puerto Rican duo Maicol & Manuel. The track is a fusion of old and new, with Playero's signature dembow beats enhanced by Alejandro's contemporary electronic flair, including bubbling synths, a pulsating bassline, and static blasts. The song was written by Alejandro, while the production was handled by Caleb Calloway, Kenobi, Alejandro, and DJ Playero. It runs for a total of three minutes and one second. The lyrics include, \"Somos de Carolina y venimos virao\" (\"We are from Carolina, and we are coming to party\").\nCritical reception\nUpon release, \"De Carolina\" was met with widely positive reviews from music critics. Named Best New Track by Pitchfork, reviewer Lucas Villa described it as \"a swaggering celebration of reggaeton's roots\" that also \"cements Alejandro's own legacy in the evolving sound of Puerto Rico\". Writing for Remezcla, Villa called it \"the most meaningful\" song on Saturno, praising the track's fusion of Alejandro's \"futuristic vision of reggaeton with the classic mixtape style of DJ Playero\". Rolling Stone's Julyssa Lopez gave \"De Carolina\" a positive review, calling it \"dynamic\" and complimenting its lyrics for \"stretching beyond his standard fare and paying homage to his home\". She also celebrated its \"thrilling, bass-heavy mash-up of influences\" and wrote: \"It would serve as a worthy introduction to any extraterrestrial beings ready to party on Saturn.\" In their review of the song, Happy FM staff applauded Alejandro's \"innate talent when it comes to composing authentic hits\", saying he \"left his followers completely speechless\" with the release of \"De Carolina\".\nCommercial performance\n\"De Carolina\" debuted and peaked at number 7 on the US Billboard Latin Digital Song Sales chart on December 24, 2022, becoming Alejandro's 14th top-10 hit on the chart.

    "1989 book by Jean-Pierre Adam\nThis article is about the book. For the topic of Roman building, see ancient Roman architecture.\nRoman Building: Materials and Techniques (French: La Construction Romaine: mat\u00e9riaux et techniques) is a treatise on Roman construction by French architect and archaeologist Jean-Pierre Adam, first published in 1984. A second edition was published in 1989, and an English translation by Anthony Mathews was published in 1994. The book comprehensively studies architecture across the Roman empire throughout its history, focusing on technique rather than design.\nContents\nThe book has 11 chapters:\nSurveying\nMaterials\nConstruction using Large Stone Blocks\nStructures of Mixed Construction\nMasonry Construction\nArches and Vaults\nCarpentry\nWall Covering\nFloors\nCivil Engineering\nDomestic and Commercial Architecture\nReception\nWhen the translation was released, several reviewers of Roman Building such as classicist Nigel Spivey commended it for its thorough, accurate coverage. These English-speaking academics noted its ambitious scope beyond almost all previous scholarly works: it treated all areas of construction technique throughout ancient Rome's history across all of Roman territory. While classicist Roger Ulrich was among them, he noticed that the French author emphasized Italy, Gaul and North Africa in his choice of examples, and within Italy the well-preserved cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. He also faulted the treatise's sometimes inaccurate handling of Latin technical terminology.\nCitations\n^ a b c d Ulrich 1995, p.\u00a0499.\n^ Adam 1994, p.\u00a05.\n^ Spivey 1995, p.\u00a0244.\n^ Ulrich 1995, p.\u00a0500.\nBibliography\nAdam, Jean-Pierre (1994).

    "2024 video game\n2024 video game\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is an upcoming action role-playing video game developed by Ubisoft Quebec and published by Ubisoft, set to release in November 2024. The game is the fourteenth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series and the successor to 2023's Assassin's Creed Mirage, as well as the first title to be included in the Assassin's Creed: Infinity platform.\nSet in 16th-century Japan towards the end of the Sengoku period, the game will focus on the millennia-old struggle of the Assassin Brotherhood, who fight for peace and liberty, and the Templar Order, who desire peace through control, from the perspective of two protagonists: Naoe, a female shinobi, and Yasuke, an African samurai inspired by the historical figure of the same name. The two characters control differently and provide a unique gameplay style, allowing quests to be approached in multiple ways.\nShadows is set to be released for PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox Series X/S and macOS on November 15, 2024.\nGameplay\nMain article: Gameplay of the Assassin's Creed series\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is an action-adventure stealth game similar to its predecessors. It is developed on an upgraded version of Anvil, utilizing dynamic lighting and environmental interactions with new enhancements such as breakable props, in addition to allowing players to manipulate shadows and use a grappling hook for parkour. The game's open world, whose size is comparable to that from Assassin's Creed Origins, progresses through seasons, each affecting gameplay, including frozen water and icicles in winter, long grass and blooming plants in spring. Missions are non-linear, encouraging players to track and eliminate targets freely; in a change from previous games, vantage points will exist in the world but only to help the player scan the environment for points of interest, rather than populating the player's map with objectives markers.\nThis installment introduces new gameplay features, including the ability to crawl along the ground in a prone position, providing players with a lower profile and the capability to access small openings. Eagle vision also makes a comeback, but unlike Assassin's Creed Mirage, it would not reveal the NPCs through the walls; as enemies are denoted in red, while allies are highlighted in orange. Moreover, a diverse selection of historically accurate weapons is showcased, ranging from katanas and the kanab\u014d war club to yari spears, shuriken, kunai, and the kusarigama. Each weapon comes with its own skill tree, enabling players to improve their proficiency with specific weapons over time.\nPlayers have the ability to switch between characters as they progress through different missions. Yasuke's combat features destructible environments and realistic weapon impacts, providing a cinematic fighting experience. Meanwhile, Naoe utilizes a kusarigama to fend off attackers, swinging its chain in wide arcs to create distance. In addition, she employs stealth tactics with an agile and lethal playstyle, hiding in the rafters and ambushing enemies through Shoji paper doors. The game map covers central Japan with detailed historical landmarks and castles designed as intricate dungeons.\nSynopsis\nSetting\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is set in feudal Japan, specifically starting in 1579 during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. This era marks the final stage of the Sengoku period, a time of intense civil war in Japan. The game features the historical figure Oda Nobunaga at the height of his power following his victory over the Takeda clan using arquebus firearms. Key historical events include Nobunaga's assault on the Iga province in 1581, a significant battle involving the Iga ikki, known for their ninjutsu arts.\nThe game will explore central Japan, including regions like Kyoto, Kobe, Osaka, and the Iga province, with historically accurate castles such as Takeda Castle. This setting promises a vibrant world of urbanization, bustling ports, samurai districts, and ornate architecture, all significant for parkour and exploration in the game. The influence of Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries, who introduced Christianity and new technologies like cannons and long guns, also plays a role in shaping the game's environment and narrative.\nDevelopment and release\nShadows was announced at Ubisoft Forward in September 2022 under the working title Assassin's Creed: Codename Red along with its planned successor Assassin's Creed: Codename Hexe. There, Ubisoft announced that Assassin's Creed would be entering a third period related to shifts in design philosophy and approaches to future games, all connected by a working concept called Assassin's Creed Infinity. The first major gameplay details were announced on May 15, 2024, along with the final name and release date. It was also later revealed that Ubisoft Quebec who previously developed Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Syndicate would be developing the game. Development bega",
    "Jesuit monastery complex in Minsk, Belarus\nJesuit church and to the right of it Jesuit College in an illustration from the early 19th century\nThe Jesuit College in Minsk (Latin: Collegium Minscense Societatis Jesu, Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0456 \u0435\u0437\u0443\u0456\u0446\u043a\u0456 \u043a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0456\u0443\u043c, Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0435\u0437\u0443\u0438\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0443\u043c) was a Jesuit monastery complex in Minsk. It included a church, a monastery building, a school (operated by the Jesuits from 1656 to 1773), and later consistorial premises. The Jesuit school in Minsk provided education in the humanities.\nThe Jesuits arrived in Minsk in 1654 and were allocated a manor house at the corner of Kojdanowska Street and High Market Street. Over time, the monastery estate was expanded and enlarged until the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, encompassing almost the entire quarter in the southeast part of High Market. The Jesuit college complex was built on the site of wooden buildings between 1733 and 1739. Most of the complex was destroyed during the city's reconstruction after the World War II. However, the Jesuit church has survived to the present day, serving as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Minsk\u2013Mohilev, along with part of one of the buildings, which, after modernization, houses a music high school.\nLocation\nSchool, church and Jesuit College in a painting by Napoleon Orda\nJesuit College on a postcard from the early 20th century\nThe monastery complex was located in the southeast part of the Minsk district known as High Market. It was situated within a block bordered to the northeast by High Market (currently Swabody Square), to the southeast by Zborowa Street (currently Internacjonalna Street), to the southwest by Felicjan Street (currently Komsomolska Street), and to the northwest by Kojdanowska Street (currently Rewolucyjna Street). The Jesuit church, serving as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Minsk\u2013Mohilev, has been located at 9 Swabody Square since 1993. One of the buildings of the former Jesuit college (7 Swabody Square) now houses the Republican Gymnasium-College at the Belarusian State Academy of Music. The palace of Heger, gifted to the Jesuits in 1656, was situated on Kojdanowska Street (currently 1 Rewolucyjna Street).\nHistory\nAccording to the Jesuit historian, Franciszek Rzepnicki, the Jesuits arrived in Minsk in the first half of the 17th century. Duke Pawe\u0142 Sanguszko brought the monks to the city in 1631, endowing them with a church and college. Other sources indicate the year 1654 when Prince Hieronim Sanguszko, the Bishop of Smolensk, granted the Minsk Jesuits a permanent fund. They acquired a brick mansion from Jegor Heger at the corner of Kojdanowska Street and High Martek, which the monks designated as their headquarters. In the early period of their activities in Minsk, their community had the status of a mission dependent on the Jesuit college in Nyasvizh. In 1686, the Jesuits obtained the status of residents, and in 1714, they were granted a college, which marked the high level of education they provided.\nThe residential buildings were systematically modernized until the end of the 18th century. Thanks to donations from the Ogi\u0144ski and Brzostowski families, the Jesuits built a wooden school and a church. The educational institution changed its location during the century of Jesuit activity in Minsk. By 1699, a wooden school was replaced with a brick one. On 24 April 1700, the cornerstone of a new brick church was solemnly dedicated. On 16 April 1710, Bishop Konstanty Kazimierz Brzostowski of Vilnius dedicated the church under the invocation of Jesus, Virgin Mary, and Saint Barbara. In 1716, the old church was adapted for use as a school. In 1723, the then rector Jakub Wo\u0142odkowicz initiated the construction of a brick building, which was built intermittently between 1733 and 1739 and then in 1748.\nIn 1723, the reconstruction of the Heger house began, and a two-story building was erected near the northwest corner of the brick church, housing professors' and masters' rooms. Later, a three-story wing was added parallel to Kojdanowska Street, which included the kitchen and refectory, among other facilities. The final appearance of the complex was formed between 1733 and 1738, and in 1739, the construction of the clock tower was completed. It stood in the middle of the facade facing High Market. In 1749, next to the church, a pharmacy building was erected, along with agricultural and ancillary buildings. In 1746, a three-story building was built on Kojdanowska Street, housing a kitchen, 6 rooms, and an ornate refectory. During this time, rhetoric, poetry, syntax, grammar, theology, Hebrew language, ethics, mathematics, physics, logic, and metaphysics were taught at the Jesuit college. There was also a school theater and the best library in the city. In 1770, the school building was renovated. In 1773, a papal bull abolished the Jesuit order. The church received the status of a parish church. A six-year secular district school was establis",
    "House in Dorset, England\nTyneham House is a ruined Elizabethan detached house, located in Tyneham, Dorset, England. It was built by Henry Williams between 1563 and 1583 and was for over 250 years occupied by the Bond family, who were the landowners of Tyneham. The house, which was once a scheduled monument, became fell into dereliction after Tyneham was requisitioned and evacuated by the War Office in 1943. The Army partially demolished the house in 1968 and some of its stone and features were salvaged for use elsewhere in the county. The remaining ruins are out of bounds to the public.\nHistory\nConstruction of Tyneham House and occupation\nTyneham House in c. 1900.\nTyneham House depicted on an Ordnance Survey map from 1902.\nTyneham House was built by Henry Williams between 1563 and 1583. It incorporated a mediaeval hall and its service rooms, which dates to the 14th century and was built in local stone by the Russell family, possibly as part of an earlier manor house. The hall became the south west wing of the house and was converted in 1567 by dividing it into two floors and adding a new doorway, windows and a chimney. The house's main range was completed in 1583 and a new kitchen wing was added to the north west in circa 1590. The north west wing was extended in the 17th century to provide additional bedrooms and a servants' hall.\nFour generations of the Williams family occupied the house before the Bond family acquired Tyneham in 1683. Tyneham House remained in the ownership of the Bond family into the 1940s. In 1820, alterations and additions were made under Rev. William Bond, including rebuilding the east part of the south west wing and extending the main range westwards. A north porch was added in c. 1861 and the main range was refronted in 1914.\nFollowing the death of William Henry Bond in 1935, Tyneham House was offered for let, furnished, \"for the summer months or by the year\", through Messrs. James Styles and Whitlock of London. The advertisement listed the following accommodation and facilities: a hall, three sitting rooms, 15 bed and dressing rooms, a boudoir, two bathrooms, stabling, a garage, terraced gardens, a walled garden and a grass tennis court. It was let until 1939.\nMilitary requisition\nIn 1941, the Royal Air Force requisitioned Tyneham House for use as both an administrative centre and accommodation site for personnel of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force working at the nearby RAF Brandy Bay. Much of the house's furniture was moved into the cellar and its books were put into storage in the granary. The furniture was damaged or destroyed when the cellar flooded after the surface drains were damaged by RAF lorries.\nIn December 1943, Tyneham was requisitioned and evacuated by the War Office as part of a 7,500 acre expansion of their Lulworth Ranges associated with the Armoured Fighting Vehicles Gunnery School at Lulworth Camp. Although the requisition was originally to be temporary, Tyneham was compulsorily purchased by the War Office in 1948 and, after disputes, they compulsorily acquired the house in 1952.\nDereliction\nAs a scheduled monument, the Army intended to safeguard the now vacant Tyneham House as best possible, although the Ministry of Town and Country Planning said in 1948 that he was unable to guarantee the house would be preserved and spared from being hit by shells.\nBy 1949, the house had suffered from the theft of lead from parts of the roof, resulting in water damage to the interior, and its gardens had become a \"wilderness\". In 1952, John Gale, writing in The Observer, noted how the \"deserted\" house's windows were \"grotesquely blindfolded with sheets of black corrugated iron\" and the garden had \"run wild amid barbed wire\".\nIn 1952, the Ministry of Works gave some of the house's carved oak panelling and overmantel and heraldic glass to Dorset County Museum. These were re-erected in the council chamber and library in memory of William Ralph Garneys Bond, the last of the Bond family to live at Tyneham House and the president of the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society.\nIn 1965, the Elizabethan section of the house had \"collapsed internally, following the loss of its roof\" and three years later the Ancient Monuments Board concluded that salvaging the entire building was an \"impossibility\". It was decided instead that the best option was to \"allow certain features which were capable of being dismantled and erected elsewhere to be removed from the site\".\nPartial demolition and aftermath\nIn 1968, the Army undertook the partial demolition of Tyneham House, after the Ancient Monuments Board advised the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works that the house should be demolished due to its deterioration from weather and vandalism, and its lack of access due to the risk of unexploded shells. The Tyneham Action Group criticised the destruction, which left a roofless ruin, believing the house had been in a \"perfectly restorable condition\" only a year before.\nNumerous parts and",
    "\nThe Russian submarine Kaiman (Russian: \u041a\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u043d, lit.\u2009'caiman') was the lead ship of the Kaiman class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. It was designed by the American engineer Simon Lake and his Lake Torpedo Boat Company before being sold to Russia and built in Saint Petersburg at the Crichton Yard.\nKaiman was laid down in September 1905 and launched in December  1907, though during its sea trials it was found to have many design problems. The boat had to undergo modifications and was finally completed in July 1911 before entering service with the Baltic Fleet. The submarine was considered obsolete when World War I broke out. It saw action in the first two years of the war, during which Kaiman completed 18 patrols. The submarine did not sink any ships, but it did capture and bring back one German freighter of 1,127\u00a0gross register tons\u00a0(GRT) in October 1915. All of the Kaiman class submarines were struck from the navy list in November 1916 and were left docked at the port of Reval.\nThe crew of Kaiman and the other boats of its class were reassigned to the newer and more advanced Bars and AG class submarines that were entering service. Kaiman and the other three boats of its class spent the rest of the war docked at Reval, in the Estonian Governorate, until the city was captured by the Germans in February 1918, at which point all four were taken to Germany for scrapping.\nDesign and construction\nThe Kaiman class was designed by Simon Lake, the head of the Lake Torpedo Boat Company, who previously sold the submarine Protector to the Imperial Russian Navy, which became the Osetr class. After receiving the first submarine, Russia ordered another five boats of the Osetr class on 10 May 1904, which were completed and launched in the following year. On 1 April 1905 Lake was given a contract by the Russian Navy to develop a new class based on the Osetr design but with more powerful weaponry and a longer range. At first the Russian naval command intended for this new class to become part of its Pacific Fleet in case of another war with Japan, expecting them to be capable of reaching the Japanese coast. But by the time they were completed and entered service in 1911, Russian foreign policy had shifted from focusing on Japan back to Europe, where the Bosnian crisis in 1908 set Russia against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Therefore, the Kaiman class boats became part of the Baltic Fleet as the 2nd Squadron of the Submarine Brigade. Emperor Nicholas II wanted to have submarines in the Baltic Sea that could help protect the Gulf of Finland and the maritime entrance to Saint Petersburg.\nKaiman was laid down in September 1905 and became the first boat in its class to be launched in December  1907. But completing it and the other three Kaiman class submarines took longer than expected because they were found to have numerous problems. These included not being able to fully submerge, taking 10 minutes to dive, and having a slower maximum speed than what was promised, 10.5 knots (19.4\u00a0km/h; 12.1\u00a0mph) instead of 15 knots (28\u00a0km/h; 17\u00a0mph). The Lake Torpedo Boat Company could not fix these issues but wanted the Russian Navy to accept them anyway, which it did, but without paying the final portion of the submarines' total cost of three million rubles. Instead of paying the one million rubles that were still owed, the Ministry of the Navy used those funds to work on the design problems, and they authorized the submarine captains to make any changes to their boats that they deemed necessary. In 1910 all four Kaiman class submarines traveled from the Kronstadt naval base for testing in Finland.\nTests that were done by Russian engineers in Finland discovered that the boats were unstable because they were about 12 tons heavier than intended. The submarines were then sent to the shipyards in Reval to undergo changes, where a four-cylinder section from each of their two gasoline engines and the 47\u00a0mm (1.9\u00a0in) deck gun on the conning tower were removed, while new ballast pumps and two external Drzewiecki torpedo-launching collars were added. This increased the underwater speed to 7.5 knots (13.9\u00a0km/h; 8.6\u00a0mph) and reduced the diving time to three minutes. They still continued to have problems even after the improvements and were never seen as very seaworthy. The submarines also had a weak hull that included wood and caused leaks, and the removal of a section from each engine reduced their power from 600\u00a0bhp (450\u00a0kW) to 400\u00a0bhp (300\u00a0kW), which also reduced the top surface speed from 10.5 to 8.5 knots (15.7\u00a0km/h; 9.8\u00a0mph).\nService history\nMap of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911\nKaiman was completed and entered service with the Imperial Baltic Fleet on 24 July  1911. Between then and the outbreak of World War I, the submarine carried out training dives and exercises.  When the war started Kaiman went on its first patrol in July 1914 from Reval, and Lieutenant Ivan Messer was its commanding officer. In the fall of 1914, Kaiman and t",
    "\n2024 studio album by Knocked Loose\nYou Won't Go Before You're Supposed To is the third studio album by the American hardcore punk band Knocked Loose. It was released through Pure Noise Records on May 10, 2024, and produced by Drew Fulk. It is the band's first album to feature rhythm guitarist Nicko Calderon.\nBackground\nGuitarist Nicko Calderon joined the band in 2021. The band released an EP titled, A Tear in the Fabric of Life that same year. According to vocalist Bryan Garris:\n\"A Tear In The Fabric Of Life\u2019 was the first time that we sat down and wrote with strict intention...So coming back around, figuring out what we should be, and then applying that to a full album was very interesting...We knew we wanted to have a bigger album in scale, and with that in mind, we could expect every single type of Knocked Loose song there is.\"\nRelease\nThe band announced the album and its release of May 10, 2024. The lead single, \"Blinding Faith\", was released on February 27, 2024. The second single, \"Don't Reach For Me\" was released on April 3, 2024. The third single, \"Suffocate\" featuring Poppy, was released on April 23, 2024.\nComposition\nYou Won't Go Before You're Supposed To has been described as metalcore and hardcore punk, with elements of nu metal.\nCritical reception\nYou Won't Go Before You're Supposed To received widespread acclaim upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 87 out of 100 based on 7 reviews. AllMusic felt that the album \" the intensity of their relentless metalcore sound\". Ellis Heasley of Distorted Sound Magazine compared it to Slipknot's Iowa \"in its complete disregard for what a band with this much hype is supposed to do in this situation...and ultimately stands as further irrefutable proof of a truly generational talent.\" Manus Hopkins writing for Exclaim! stated that \"at only 10 songs, with the longest still falling short of five minutes, You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To doesn't wear out its welcome.\" But they felt that \"Slaughterhouse 2\", featuring Chris Motionless, was \"slightly underwhelming in the shadow of its predecessor\", from Motionless in White's album, Scoring the End of the World. Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian called it \"an indulgently rich record that keeps revealing more on double-digit listens.\" According to Luke Morton of Kerrang!, \"the heaviness throughout is unrelenting. No acoustic number, no ballad, no concession... this isn\u2019t just their best record yet, it\u2019s one of the best albums of the year.\" Stephen Hill of Metal Hammer of praised Drew Fulk's production stating,  production gives the record perfect definition while making it sound as loud as a jet plane taking off inside your cranium.\"\nAccording to Caitlin McMahon of Metal Injection, \"Knocked Loose has embraced a melodic direction with this record,\" and called the album \"eerie and unsettling.\" Mandy Scythe of MetalSucks wrote, \"From start to finish, this is a solid, heavy record full of memorable and catchy moments that you\u2019ll want to revisit time and time again.\" According, to Ian Cohen of Pitchfork, \" amplified and concentrated their sound into something so potent that it has its own gravitational pull.\" Dylan Tuck writing for The Skinny wrote, \"You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To takes their staunchly savage sound and dashes it with piercing playfulness and crushing confidence; conjuring a profoundly poisonous record containing some of their most deadly moments to date.\" Sputnikmusic wrote that \" album destroys as much as possible while it\u2019s on... it leaves a little to be desired once it\u2019s over.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nKnocked Loose\nBryan Garris \u2013 vocals, lyrics\nIsaac Hale \u2013 lead guitar, vocals\nNicko Calderon \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nKevin Otten \u2013 bass\nKevin \"Pacsun\" Kaine \u2013 drums\nAdditional personnel\nPoppy \u2013 vocals (3)\nChris Motionless \u2013 additional vocals (7)\nTechnical\nDrew Fulk \u2013 production, mixing, mastering\nZach Tuch - additional production, engineering\nJeff Dunne - mixing, mastering\nJesse Field - engineering assistant, editing\nCharts\n",
    "\nMilitary unit\nThe 13th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, (13th RF) was an infantry unit recruited as part of 'Kitchener's Army' in World War I. It served on the Western Front from July 1915 until the Armistice, seeing action at the Somme and the Ancre, at Arras and Ypres, against the German spring offensive, and in the final Hundred Days Offensive.\nRecruitment and training\nAlfred Leete's recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army. The newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. Men flooded into the recruiting offices and the 'first hundred thousand' were enlisted within days. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'. K2 and K3 followed shortly afterwards.\n13th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, was formed as part of K3 at the Royal Fusiliers' regimental depot at Hounslow on 13 September 1914, under the command of Colonel F.P. Hutchinson of the Indian Army. It was designated as 'Army Troops', ie not assigned to a specific formation, but it was attached to 24th Division camped under canvas on the South Downs. By the time the K3 units were formed the shortage of uniforms, equipment and instructors for the Kitchener units had become critical. 24th Division did not receive its first khaki uniforms until March 1915. After the weather broke the troops were moved out of their camps and billeted in the local towns: 13th RF moved into Worthing in December 1914. It remained there until 9 April 1915, when it moved to Ludgershall, Wiltshire, to join 44th (later 37th) Division.\nAs authorised in March 1915, 37th Division consisted of Kitchener battalions that had originally been allocated as Army Troops to the New Armies. 13th Royal Fusiliers was assigned to 111th Brigade in the new division; the brigade also included 10th RF (Stockbrokers), 13th King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), and 13th Rifle Brigade (RB). By April 1915 when the division was formed, all its units had been training for some months, and it was quickly assembled on Salisbury Plain for final battle training.\nOn 17 June Temporary Major Henry J. Des Voeux from the 7th Bn Northamptonshire Regiment (formerly of the Grenadier Guards) was promoted to Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel to command 13th RF. In July orders arrived for the division to move to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. Embarkation began on 28 July and 13th RF landed at Boulogne two days later. By 2 August the division had completed its concentration around Tilques, near Saint-Omer.\nService\nOn arrival the units of 37th Division were attached to those of 12th (Eastern) Division for instruction in trench warfare in the quiet sector near Armenti\u00e8res. At the end of August 37th Division entrained for Doullens and then marched to Foncquevillers in the Somme sector, where the BEF was taking over more of the line from French troops. The battalions took turns in the front line, and there was a steady trickle of casualties. From 23 to 27 September during the Battle of Loos the division was stationed at La Cauchie to act as reserve for the French Tenth Army's attack, but then returned to Foncquevillers and the routine of trench holding alternating with billets in Souastre through the autumn and winter.\n37th Division's 'gold horseshoe' insignia.\nSomme\nBy June 1916 13th RF had been in France almost a year and had still not participated in any major action, but the BEF was now preparing for that summer's 'Big Push' (the Battle of the Somme). The artillery bombardment began on 23 June and the assault was launched on 1 July. Initially, 37th Division was not involved. Then 111th Brigade was attached to 34th Division from 7 July as a temporary replacement for a brigade that had been shattered on the First day on the Somme. The fresh troops were immediately rushed to the front. At 02.00 on 7 July 13 RF was assembled in the old German front line in front of La Boisselle ready to attack between Ovillers and Contalmaison. It was warned not to attack until ordered to do so by brigade HQ, or until the flanking attacks were well ahead. By 08.25 the battalion had lost touch with brigade HQ, but the flanks had advanced so Maj Ardagh led off with Nos 1 and 2 Companies, with bombing sections covering the flanks. Due east of La Boisselle some resistance was encountered that held up No 2 Company, and by the time this was overcome the right flank had lost touch with the neighbouring brigade. Nevertheless, the battalion gained nearly 1,000 yards (910\u00a0m), occupying with little opposition its objective, a German trench running into the north end of Ovillers. During consolidation of this line some casualties were suffered from German artill",
    "The Libellus in Reginensis 213, a 9th-century manuscript\nQuintus Julius Hilarianus (fl.\u2009397), commonly known as Hilarian, was a Roman African chronographer and computist. He is sometimes identified with the bishop Hilarianus who attended the Council of Carthage in 411. This is uncertain and he may have even been a Donatist. His writings point to his having been a monk.\nHilarianus is known for two works in Latin:\nDe ratione Paschae et mensis (or Expositum de die Paschae et mensis) was completed on 5 March 397. It is a treatise about the importance of celebrating Easter. It has been read as a sermon, but this is not certain. It is used in the Carthaginian Computus of 455, which also cites a letter of one Agriustias to Hilarianus on the subject of computus.\nWritten later in 397, the Chronologia siue Libellus de mundi duratione (or De cursu temporum) is a treatise on salvation history. It argues that the Second Coming will occur in 498, when the Earth is 6,000 years old. There will follow the thousand-year reign of Christ and a final battle. Since the end of the world is placed beyond the lifetime of Hilarianus or his initial audience, the Libellus does not seem to be a response to contemporary events but \"a statement about hope for life eternal\". Its brand of millenarianism, however, soon came to be regarded as heresy, making Hilarianus \"one of  last vocal proponents\". Nevertheless, in two groups of manuscripts the Libellus was incoporated into the compilation known as the Chronicle of Fredegar. In one group, it replaces the contribution of the Liber generationis. The 9th-century manuscript Reginensis 213 opens with it.\nSome scholars have suggested Hilarianus as the author of the Liber genealogus.\nNotes\n^ a b c d e Mandouze 1982, pp.\u00a0557\u2013558.\n^ a b c d Palmer 2014, p.\u00a045.\n^ Wallace-Hadrill 1960, pp.\u00a0xxvi, xlvi.\n^ van Hees 2021.\n^ Wallace-Hadrill 1960, p.\u00a0li.\n^ Mandouze 1982, pp.\u00a0557\u2013558, citing German critics.\nBibliography\nCroke, Brian (2018). \"Hilarianus, Q.

    "Reference book\nThe Qatari Almanac (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0648\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0631\u064a, romanized:\u00a0al-Taqw\u012bm al-Qa\u1e6dari) was an annual almanac authored by religious scholar Sheikh Abdullah Ibrahim Al-Ansari that integrated traditional and astronomical knowledge, offering invaluable insights into prayer timings, seasonal weather patterns, and local celestial navigation across the Persian Gulf region. Following his father's legacy, Al-Ansari published the almanac since 1957\u201358, incorporating knowledge from ancient Arabic texts and almanacs, including one from 1906 by Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah Al-Uyuni of Al Hasa, which he republished in 1960 under Emir Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani's sponsorship. It was the most widely disseminated almanac among the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. In 1966, the almanac was formally declared as the official calendar of Qatar by Emir Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani.\nThe Qatari Almanac integrated formal astronomical knowledge with local time-keeping systems. It featured charts detailing the zodiacal months, lunar stations, planets, the lunar Hijri and Christian solar calendars, shadow lengths for calculating prayer times, and the navigational system based on Canopus, among other data. It also offered insights into the distances between Doha and other Qatari towns in kilometers and included poetry and sayings reflecting traditional knowledge of environmental shifts with each season.\nHistory\nSheikh Abdullah Ibrahim Al Ansari\nSheikh Abdullah Ibrahim Al-Ansari was born in Qatar in 1919. After initially making a career of pearl hunting, Al-Ansari received a religious education in Saudi Arabia before returning to his home country and establishing the first religious institute in 1954. He was later given a governmental position, being named the Director of the Office for the Revival of Islamic Heritage. He showed a great interest in the Islamic calendar and time-keeping systems, and in 1957\u201358, took over the publication of the Qatari Almanac from his father Ibrahim Al-Ansari. The almanac would continue being regularly published on an annual basis until Sheikh Al-Ansari died in 1989.\nAccording to researcher Daniel Varisco in 1990, \" the Qatari Almanac has become a standard source for much of the Gulf. Indeed, it is difficult to find an informant in Qatar who is not familiar with the almanac.\" Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Al-Ansari published specialized almanacs for Mecca, Medina and the capital cities of the Persian Gulf countries.\nFollowing Al-Ansari's death in 1989, his son, Mohammed bin Abdullah Al-Ansari, took over the publication of the Qatari Almanac. He also established the Qatari Calendar House in 1990. In more recent times, the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs has assumed control of the Qatari Almanac's publication.\nContents\nAl-Ansari's work not only aligned the Hijri calendar with the zodiac but also preserved a treasure trove of star lore dating back to the pre-Islamic period in the Arabian Peninsula, encapsulated in a genre known as anwa. One of the seminal texts in this tradition was the Kitab al-Anwa' by Ibn Qutayba, who provided extensive descriptions of Arabic star names, traditional meteorological beliefs, and seasonal characteristics.\nMost importantly, the almanac chronicled the practical use of shadow lengths to determine prayer times before the advent of modern clocks, a method still observable in many older mosques. The almanac also described local seasonal terminologies and the significant navigational and pastoral practices dictated by the stars, such as the rising of Canopus marking the onset of autumn rains and pastoral migrations. Al-Ansari notes six separate seasons, each spanning two months in length: wasmi (corresponding to autumn rains), shita (winter), rabi (winter to spring), sayf (spring), hamim (early summer), and khareef (late summer to early autumn). Al-Ansari's method of classifying the seasons soon became commonplace, appearing in Saudi Arabian and other Arab almanacs.\nAs modern methods of timekeeping became more prevalent, the almanac was made redundant.\nLegacy\nThe Sheikh Abdullah Al Ansari Complex for the Holy Quran and Science was opened over a 5,000 square meter area in Hazm Al Markhiya, Doha in 2014. Containing many religious and literary works, the complex hosts the Qatari Calendar House, the Center for Islamic Studies, and the Sheikh Al-Ansari Library.\n",
    "Historic hotel in Canada, 1913 to 1950\nThe Astoria Hotel is a historic hotel turned into single-room occupancy accommodations located at 769 East Hastings Street in the Downtown Eastside neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada. The hotel was opened in 1913 as the Toronto House Apartments before becoming the Astoria Hotel in 1950. The main floor of the hotel serves as a bar and events space. The hotel is currently owned by the Sahota family.\nHistory\nThe Astoria, originally the Toronto House Apartments was built by Robert Aubrey Wallace, a developer from Ontario. The architects of the building were Braunton and Leibert. Upon opening in March 1913, the Toronto House had 87 rooms for rent. After opening, Wallace managed the apartments for a number of years. In June 1933, the apartments came under new management. Wallace remained the owner of the property until his death in 1950. Many of the early occupants of the hotel were working class, such as dock workers at Ballantyne Pier and loggers.\nIn 1950, operations of the apartments were taken over by Alex Bayer and William Sawchuk, who ran the previous incarnation of the Astoria on West Hastings. The apartments were transitioned into a hotel, and the name of the building was changed to the Astoria Hotel. The number of rooms were increased to 88. The newly renovated space featured the newly installed neon sign, two beverage rooms (split into a women's section and a man's section), air conditioning, heating, a walk in cooler, and a 50-car parking lot. The capacity of the main floor totaled to 400.\nIn December 1961, a fire damaged portions of the basement and the back of the ground floor of the hotel. Guests were evacuated but no injuries were reported.\nIn 1977, The Astoria Boxing Club (established 1966) moved operations to the hotel. The club practiced in the basement of the hotel until they moved to the North Burnaby Inn in 1998. The club aimed to help troubled and underprivileged youth from the nearby neighborhood, which was experiencing an economic downturn during the 1970s and 1980s. A number of members found success, such as boxers Dale Walters and Manuel Sobral.\nIn 1984, Nolan Fisher bought the hotel. During Expo 86, Fisher guaranteed that rents of long-term guests would not be raised despite the influx of visitors to the city. At that time, the Astoria had 40 long-term residents who paid $220 monthly (equivalent to $570 in 2023). Many long-term  residents were elderly and disabled.\nBy 1999, the ownership of the hotel was transferred to the Sahota family, which marked a rapid decline in the conditions in the hotel.\nIn 2005, the hotel, along with other single-room occupancy hotels the Lucky Lodge and Gastown Hotels, were subject to an undercover 10 week police sting. The investigation found evidence of drug dealing, welfare fraud, and possession of stolen goods. Living conditions in the rooms were also found to be sub-standard.\nIn February 2022, an accidental explosion occurred in a second story suite of the hotel. No one was harmed in the incident, and minor damage was done to the hotel.\nEvents space\nIn recent years the Astoria Hotel has been home to a number of reoccurring events, such as Coffin Club, The Dark Eighties, and an amateur\nstrip night named Rent Cheque.\nIncidents\nIn March 1953, a 28-year-old woman named Olga Rutkowski committed suicide by jumping off the third floor of the hotel.\nIn 1957, a 51-year-old man named Walter Alexander Mascotte shot himself with a .22 rifle in his room at the Astoria.\nIn March 1968 a man was found hanging from a doorknob in his room at the hotel.\nOn June 2, 1975, a 61-year-old man named Kelso Dickie died from burns he suffered after his mattress caught on fire in his room.\nIn November 1986, two men named John Wilfred Dyck and Matthew William Wilson died after the fire escape they were standing on collapsed. The two fell from the third floor to the alley behind the hotel and were instantly killed. Their deaths were ruled to be accidental as the two were heavily intoxicated on Chinese cooking wine.\nOn September 23, 1993, a 34-year-old man named Stephen Horvath was stabbed to death in the lobby of the hotel. He was taken to Vancouver General Hospital but later died of his wounds. A resident of the hotel named Juan Carlos Gonzales-Mejia, originally from Guatemala was charged with second degree murder.\nDuring the 1990s, Robert Pickton was a regular of several Downtown Eastside bars, including the Astoria. Some reports state that one of his victims, Georgina Papin, was last seen at the hotel with Pickton in March 1999. She was not listed as missing by the Vancouver Police Department until 2001. In 2002, her remains were found on Pickton's farm.\nWhile standing outside of the hotel on August 31, 1998, a 49-year-old man named Raul Melgar was struck twice in the chest by a man wielding a piece of lumber. He was taken to Vancouver General Hospital for treatment but died of his injuries a day later. Melgar was a resident of the hotel and w",
    "Former lifeboat station in Anglesey, Wales\nCemlyn Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station, located on the west side of Cemlyn Bay, near the village of Cemlyn, on the north coast of Anglesey, Wales.\nA lifeboat was stationed here by the Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck in 1828. Management was transferred to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1855.\nCemlyn Lifeboat Station was closed in 1919.\nHistory\nThe Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded by the Rev. James and Mrs Frances Williams in 1828. They had witnessed the loss of 140 lives from the wreck of the vessel Alert in 1823, and spent the following five years raising funds and gaining support.\nWith the help of the Royal National Institute for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, they managed to purchase a lifeboat for Cemlyn. A 25-foot 8in 5-oar non-self-righting lifeboat costing \u00a3160 was constructed by Harton, arriving on 3 November 1828. The Rev. Owen Williams, James' son, was appointed Coxswain.\nWhen the steamship Leeds hit Harry Furlong Rocks, the Cemlyn lifeboat was launched, but another steamship Commerce had come to her aid. The majority of passengers transferred between ship in small boats, but one boat got away, unable to reach land or the Commerce. In dangerous conditions, the Cemlyn lifeboat managed to rescue the three men on board. For this service, Coxswain Owen Lloyd Williams was awarded the Silver Medal.\nOn 18 December 1845, The barque Frankland, on passage from Bahia, Brazilto Liverpool, was driven ashore and wrecked at Cemaes Bay. For their gallantry in rescuing 18 crew, Silver Medals were awarded to crew members Robert Griffiths, Richard Owen and Owen Highland.\nIn 1853, this lifeboat was transferred to Rhoscolyn, and Lifeboat No.4 was brought to Cemlyn from Moelfre, a 26-foot non-self-righting boat built by Harton. This lifeboat would launch nine times, and rescue 18, during her 12-year period on service. In 1855, the Anglesey Association transferred all their lifeboat to the management of the RNLI.\nBy 1872, raising a crew at Cemlyn was getting so difficult, that the RNLI decided to close the station, and open a new one a few miles along the coast at Cemaes. The Cemlyn boat, by now the Sophia, a 30-foot self-righting pulling and sailing (P&S) lifeboat (one with oars and sails), built by Forrestt at a cost of \u00a3133-6s-3d, and on station since 1865, was transferred to Cemaes. However, within just a few years, sufficient experienced men moved to Cemlyn that it was requested that the station be reopened. A new boathouse was constructed, and a 32-foot self-righting (P&S) lifeboat arrived in October 1877. Provided by the Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds (Ashton Unity), the boat was named Good Shepherd.\nFour further lifeboats would serve at Cemlyn, but calls became fewer. Between 1904 and 1919, the lifeboat was called just seven times, and no lives were saved. In 1919, it was decided to close Cemlyn Lifeboat station.\nCemlyn Lifeboat Memorial\nThe last boat on station, Sir John (ON 408) was transferred to the relief fleet, before being sold in 1926.\nVery little evidence remains of any boathouse at Cemlyn, just part of a launchway.\nIn 1978, a memorial was erected near the site of the former lifeboat station, to commemorate both the 150th anniversary of Cemlyn Lifeboat Station, the first one on Anglesey, and the founders, Rev. James and Mrs Frances Williams.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Cemlyn.\nRNLI Silver Medal\nRev.

    "1975 studio album by Yabby You & The Prophets\nConquering Lion is the debut album by Jamaican musician Yabby You (Vivian Jackson) and his backing group The Prophets. It was released in 1975 on Jackson's label Prophets. In the UK the album was released in 1975 under the title Ramadam or Ram-A-Dam, and had a different track listing.\nBackground and release\nYabby You is the moniker of Vivian Jackson, born in Kingston in 1946. He initially formed a vocal trio with Alaric Forbes and Bobby Melody to record the song \"Conquering Lion\", which was released as a single in 1972, attributed to Vivian Jackson & the Ralph Brothers.\nThe song begins with a refrain of \"be you, yabby yabby you\", which Jackson heard sung by angelic voices during a thunderstorm. \nJackson's nickname \"Yabby You\" comes from the song, and was popularised by King Tubby.\nThe track \"Love Thy Neighbour\" was also released a single around the same time, attributed to Vivian Jackson & the Deffenders  . Both singles sold well enough that Jackson was able to start his own label, Prophets, in 1974. The album Conquering Lion is mostly composed of singles that Jackson released on that label. It was released in 1975 on Jackson's label.\nIn 2021 Pressure Sounds reissued the album on CD and LP, with 12 bonus tracks of dub versions.\nCritical reception\nNathan Bush of AllMusic rated Conquering Lion 5/5 stars, indicating their opinion that the album has \"stood the test of time and has become an important and very meaningful recording within its genre.\" Writing for The Guardian, David Katz called the album \"stunningly intense\".\nLegacy\nVersions of title track \"Conquering Lion\" were recorded by Big Youth (\"Yabby Youth\"), Augustus Pablo (\"False Dread\"), Dicky Burton (\"God Is Watching You\"), and Horace Andy (\"Undivided World\").\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Vivian Jackson.\nAll additional tracks from the Expanded Edition are written by Yabby You & King Tubby, except where noted.\nThe first UK release of the album was called Ram-A-Dam and had a different track listing.\nPersonnel\nThe Prophets\nVivian Jackson \u2013 lead vocals, arrangements, writing, production\nAlaric Forbes \u2013 vocals\nBobby Melody \u2013 vocals\nOther credits\nLeroy Wallace (Horse Head) \u2013 drums\nTommy McCook \u2013 flute\nEarl \"Chinna\" Smith, Earl Lindo \u2013 guitar\nAston Barrett \u2013 organ\nBingy Bunny \u2013 percussion\nAugustus Pablo, Pablo Black \u2013 piano\nDirty Harry \u2013 saxophone\nDon D.

    "Naval Base for Chinese Satellite Tracking ShipsMilitary unit\nThe China Maritime Satellite Tracking and Control Department  (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u536b\u661f\u6d77\u4e0a\u6d4b\u63a7\u90e8; pinyin: Zh\u014dngg\u00fao W\u00e8ix\u012bng H\u01ceish\u00e0ng C\u00e8k\u00f2ng B\u00f9)), MUCD 63680, is a corps deputy grade naval base located at Jiangyin City in Jiangsu Province, established in 1978 as the headquarter and home port for the Yuan Wang-class tracking ships, which are used to track rocket and missile launches, in particular the testing of the Dongfeng series ballistic missiles and Long March rockets. Since 1 January 2016, it has been subordinate to the Main Department of Satellite Launches and Orbit Tracking and Control (\u536b\u661f\u53d1\u5c04\u6d4b\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8) of the Strategic Support Force, and then from April 2024, of the Aerospace Force.\nHistory\nThe decision to create a tracking and control fleet started with a suggestion in 1965 by Qian Xuesen that intended to help with the development of the Dongfeng-5 ICBM. On July 18, 1967, the project was officially launched under the umbrella of the then State Commission for Science and Technology and, as was customary in China, named after the date: \"Project 718\" (718\u5de5\u7a0b, pinyin: 718 G\u014dngch\u00e9ng). In April 1975, a command staff was established in Jiangyin on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to prepare for the construction of a military base. At the same time, the Jiangnan shipyard on the island of Changxing near Shanghai began the construction of two tracking ships, the Yuan Wang 1 and the Yuan Wang 2 (\u8fdc\u671b\u4e00\u53f7 and \u8fdc\u671b\u4e8c\u53f7 respectively) </>, which were launched on August 31 and October 1977 respectively. The two ships were identical in construction, with a length of 191 m, a width of 22.6 m, a draft of 9 m and a standard displacement of 21,000 tons.\nJiangyin Naval Base was designated as the \"23rd Base\", and in October 1978, the \"Chinese People's Liberation Army Base for Testing and Training\" officially went into operation. However, the two tracking ships still had to go through a whole series of tests on the high seas, and the direction-finding devices had to be installed. They were not put into service until the beginning of 1980.\nThe delay in construction was partly due to the fact that the ships had been built during the Cultural Revolution, when disruption was generalized. The ships also had some severe defects that needed correction. In addition to the antennas for tracking and controlling the rockets and satellites, the ships also had a powerful transmitter on board for transmitting data to the headquarters of the Chinese space control network in Weinan. It turned out that as soon as this transmitter was put into operation, it interfered with the other devices on the ship so much that they were no longer operational. An attempt to first transmit the data with a weak transmitter to the sister ship a few dozen kilometers away, which then relayed it to the mainland at full power, could not solve the problem. Finally, Chen Fangyun's engineers designed a frequency distribution scheme in which the radio and USB frequencies were chosen so that interference no longer occurred.\nEarly missions\nThe then \"Unit 89001\" had its first major mission in May 1980 during the first long-range flight test of the Dongfeng 5. At the end of April, the two Yuan Wang ships met at the Zhoushan Islands off the coast of Zhejiang, with a total of 16 ships selected from the Eastern Sea Fleet, the Northern Sea Fleet, the Southern Sea Fleet, and the Research Fleet of the State Oceanic Administration, plus 4 helicopters and sailed more than 8000\u00a0km to a sea area northeast of Australia, where they took up a square, 32 \u00d7 32 nautical miles formation. Installed on the Yuan Wang 1 was the \"Computer 151\" developed by the Changsha Polytechnic Academy, China's first MegaFLOP-supercomputer. The ship acquired the missile's bearing signal, and the computer calculated its path relative to the ship's position in real time, allowing radar and laser range finders to precisely track its ballistic route, and allowed the helicopters to be guided to the expected impact site. The intercontinental ballistic missile launched on May 18 at 10:00 local time from Jiuquan Space Launch Center hit exactly in the middle of the target square, and less than two minutes later it had been taken by the helicopters out of the water. The Yuan Wang ships played an important role, as well as on September 15 and 27, 1988, in tests of the medium-range JL-1 missiles fired from the submerged Changzheng 6, the only nuclear submarine of the 09II class.\nOn September 21, 1992, the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved the manned space program, named after the date as \"Project 921\" (921\u5de5\u7a0b, pinyin 921 G\u014dngch\u00e9ng). With the stakes higher, a third tracking ship was laid down, the Yuan Wang 3, which was launched on April 26, 1994, and, after extensive testing, on May 18 was put into service in 1995. From August 1998, the oceanographic research ship Xiang Yang Hong 10 (\u5411\u9633\u7ea210\u53f7) was converted into a tracking ship at the Chengxi repai",

    "1965 memoir by Josef von Sternberg\nFun in a Chinese Laundry is an autobiography by Austrian-American filmmaker Josef von Sternberg first published in 1965 by Macmillan Publishers. The book was reissued in 1988 by Mercury House with a foreword by Gary Cooper.\nVon Sternberg provides details from his childhood in Vienna and youth in America, as well every stage of his film career. The memoir provides numerous character sketches and critiques of film personnel, especially the actors he worked with, among them Marlene Dietrich.\nThe eponymous title of the autobiography is a reference to a 1894 Kinetoscope film by American inventor and film pioneer Thomas Edison\nBackground\nPortions of von Sternberg's autobiography were penned as early as 1960 while he traveling in Europe. Literary critic Ruairi McCann writes:\n  \u201cFun in a Chinese Laundry was published 12 years after Sternberg last embarked on a feature, and despite floating the possibility of working again, in the midst of all the bridges burning, it never came to be, as he passed four years later.\u201d\nSignificance of the book\u2019s title\nFun in a Chinese Laundry is a metaphor for the medium that would dominate von Sternberg's artistic and professional endeavors. The movie appeared when both von Sternberg and the film technology were in their infancy. The title for the autobiography is that of a 1894 Kinetoscope burlesque by Thomas Edison. Released shortly before von Sternberg's birth,  he offers no explicit remark as to its significance or its influence on his filmmaking.\nThe reference to the film in his autobiography follows a sustained reminiscence of the famous amusement park and the childhood in Vienna that von Sternberg recalls idyllically as \u201cparadise.\u201d\n Everything was orderly, there was nothing to confuse me, there were no comic strips, no radio, no motion pictures or moronic succession of television images, though unbeknownst to me, one Thomas Edison had already made a film entitled Fun in a Chinese Laundry.\nReception\nKirkus Reviews, in its March 8, 1965 edition described the memoir as \u201ccorrosively witty, frank and rather outrageous memoir\u2026His story is one of dirty deals, awesome neglect and a few triumphs. It should become a little classic in its field.\u201d\nAuthor and editor Norman Kaplan in the Fall issue of Science and Society wrote: \u201cThat this is so can be corroborated by a reading of Joseph Von Sternberg's new book Fun in a Chinese Laundry\u2014an unabashed and brash boast of a lifetime spent as a purveyor to the most prurient appetites of audiences by a man who prates of his triumph side by side with his expression of contempt for the medium and its audiences.\u201d\nRetrospective assessment\nFun in a Chinese Laundry, 1988 Mercury House paperback edition.\nFilm critic Jean-Paul Chaillet considers Fun in a Chinese Laundry of particular interest for its insights into von Sternberg's long personal and professional relationship with German-American film star Marlene Dietrich:\n The first meeting of those two titans of cinema and their ensuing complex relationship has been dissected, reinvented, manipulated, embellished so many times through the years, that it is fascinating to read the carefully worded first-hand recollection of von Sternberg himself.\nChaillet adds that von Sternberg, \u201cat times sounding quite pompous and arrogant, rants about Dietrich\u2019s self-serving public acknowledgments of his greatness over the years.\u201d\nWriter and filmworker Ruairi McCann notes that the autobiography \u201cis rife with the characteristics of von Sternberg\u2019s personality and cinema; an unflappability, a searing, sardonic wit and a love for spectacle that comes, part and parcel, with a gift for its creation and dissection\u201d and structurally, the memoir \u201cdoes not move to the letter of a strict and straight chronology, nor is its language crystalline. Instead, the details of his life and career are often presented allusively, rather than as a procession of stated facts\u2026\u201d\nMcCann adds that \u201cThe book is often very funny...Moments or recurring events that in other biographies would be singled out and analyzed as sources of future pain or strength, he undercuts with a stone dry sense of humor.\u201d\nSelected excerpts\nOn Marlene Dietrich: \u201cI did not endow her with a personality that was not her own; one sees what one wants to see, and I gave nothing that she did not already have. What I did was to dramatize her attributes and make them visible for all to see, though, as there were perhaps too many, I concealed some.\u201d\nOn Louis B. Mayer: \u201cI was very fond of my superior (Louis B. Mayer), overly persuasive that he was, and had the right to be, as he was the highest-salaried individual in the world. He was, outwardly at least, a charming, simple, and sincere person, who could use his eyes, brimming over with tears, to convince an elephant that it was a kangaroo.\u201d\nOn directing Charles Laughton in I, Claudius (1937): \u201cIt was a not a nightmare, it was a daymare.\u201d\nOn the significance of the movie director: \u201crom the very in",

The band currently consists of lead vocalist Angry Anderson (since 1976), drummer Paul DeMarco (who first joined in 1992), bassist Mark Evans (since 2017) and guitarists Mick Arnold and Ronnie Simmons (both since 2022).\nHistory\nRose Tattoo were formed in Sydney in 1976 with Leigh Johnston on rhythm guitar, Tony Lake on lead vocals and they were led by slide guitarist Peter Wells. Drummer Michael Vandersluys completed the line-up. Ian Rilen from Band of Light soon joined on bass guitar, guitarist Mick Cocks soon replaced Johnston. Lake and Vandersluys were substituted by former Buster Brown members Angry Anderson and Dallas \"Digger\" Royall, respectively.\nin 1977 Rillen departed, Buster Brown bass guitarist Geordie Leach was recruited to record their self-titled debut LP, Rose Tattoo. Leach left the band in May 1979 and was replaced by Neil Smith, before Lobby Loyde joined in October. By September 1980, Loyde had left and Leach returned.\nRobin Riley replaced Cocks in 1982. In 1983, after the US tour, Riley, Royall and Wells all left. The remaining duo of Anderson and Leach recruited guitarists Greg Jordan and John Meyer, and drummer Scott Johnston. After recording 1984's Southern Stars, Leach left and the band went on a brief hiatus while Anderson pursued acting.\nIn 1985, Rose Tattoo returned with the line-up of Anderson, Johnston, Meyer, Andy Cichon (bass, piano) and Tim Gaze (slide guitar), Meyer left in 1986 and the remaining line-up recorded Beats from a Single Drum. Cichon left in late 1986 and was replaced by Jake Lardot (bass) and Rick Melick (keys) before the band disbanded in 1987.\nIn the early 1990s, Anderson tried to reunite Rose Tattoo, but Dallas Royall died in 1991. Rose Tattoo supported Guns N' Roses on the Australian leg of their Use Your Illusion Tour. Anderson, Wells, Cocks, Leach were joined by new drummer, Paul DeMarco, from Wells' solo band reunited for the 1993 tour. The reunion was brief as each returned to solo projects.\nRose Tattoo, with original bassist Ian Rilen replacing Leach, reformed yet again in 1998 for the \"All Hell Breaks Loose!!\" tour, however Rilen remained with the band only for the duration of this tour. By the following year, Leach had returned to the fold once more, although his place was taken by Steve King in 2000, around the same time Cocks departed and was replaced by a returning Riley.\nIn 2002, Wells was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer, but he continued to perform with Rose Tattoo, although he was subbed in 2004 by Dai Pritchard. Wells died on 27 March 2006, Cocks returned in 2005, with Riley moving onto slide guitar in Wells absence. Mick O'Shea briefly replaced DeMarco in 2006. Dai Pritchard returned in 2007, replacing Riley, alongside Leach, replacing King.

    "Kyudo World Cup - International Competition, 2014\nThe All Nippon Kyudo Federation  (ANKF) (Japanese: \u5168\u65e5\u672c\u5f13\u9053\u9023\u76df) (\u5168\u5f13\u9023) is a public interest incorporated foundation and sports governing body that presides over the martial art of Ky\u016bd\u014d in Japan by organising standards seminars and events for the majority of kyudo practitioners in the country.\nUntil 1968, it was a member of the International Archery Federation (FITA), but due to cost issues, at the end of 1968, it transferred its FITA membership rights  to the All Japan Archery Federation.\nHistory\nFollowing the end of World War II, the All Nippon Kyudo Federation formed in 1949. Up until that point, there had been a ban on martial arts under Japan's by the Allied occupation forces, and the ANKF worked to get public kyudo practice restarted. As part of this, one of its initial goals was to produce a manual to establish a standardised style. This manual, The Kyudo Kyohon, includes various forms, techniques, terminology and even details on how to conduct a tournament. The manual itself was first published 1953, and an English translation of the 1971 revised edition was published in 1994. The book covers the basic postures, movements as well as the core shooting form that is referred to as shah\u043e\u0304 hassetsu (the eight stages of shooting).\nThe ANKF standardised the basic etiquette and shooting technique for kyudo after the war, drawing on a number of different styles, including the Ogasawara-ry\u016b, Heki-ry\u016b, and Honda-ry\u016b. The idea was that these standardised shooting forms could be practiced by anyone, so there wouldn't be any more big disputes between the practitioners. There are two options for raising the yumi before drawing, the raising along the centerline of the body (sh\u043e\u0304men uchiokoshi) and raising diagonally off to the side (shamen uchiokoshi).\nOrganisation structure/governance\nThe purpose of the ANKF's founding was to \"promote kyudo and foster the improvement of the physical strength of the Japanese citizenry and cultivate a spirit of sportsmanship, thereby contributing to the development of society and culture.\" Its operations were outlined as the following six items.\nThe establishment of general policies for the popularization and promotion of kyudo.\nThe hosting of national and international competitions.\nTo run assessments for Sh\u043e\u0304g\u043e\u0304 (titles) and examinations for Dan (ranks).\nTo conduct surveys, research, and hold seminars, etc.\nThe publication of an institutional magazine and other materials.\nOther business necessary to achieve the purpose of the preceding articles.\nThe monthly magazine \"Kyudo\" is currently being published as the institutional magazine of the ANKF.\nMembership\nThere are 47 affiliated federations in the prefectures of Japan. Tokyo's federation is split into three parts, known as the Dai-Ichi, Dai-Ni, and Dai-San Districts. Similarly, Hokkaido's federation is split into 6 parts, known as the Ch\u016b\u043e\u0304 (Central), Seibu (Western), Nanbu (Southern), Tobu (Eastern), Chubu (Midland), and Hokubu (Northern) Districts. All other parts of Japan have one regional federation per prefecture.\nAs of March 31, 2021, the number of members is 135,660, of which 67 people hold the title of Hanshi, 1,942 people hold the title of Ky\u043e\u0304shi, and 4,691 people hold the title of Renshi.\nAdditionally, although the ANKF has de facto control of most domestic archery competitions, there are also schools and practitioners who are active without affiliation with the ANKF. Furthermore, there also exists the All Nippon University Kyudo Federation, which is an organization for university student competitions that is independent of the ANKF.\nThe ANKF is also affiliated with the Japanese Martial Arts Council.\nIKYF\nKyudo practitioner\nThe International Kyudo Federation is a body associated with the ANKF, sharing in its role to govern and support Kyudo. While The ANKF governs kyudo within Japan, the IKYF promotes, maintains and educates kyudo internationally.\n",
    "American dance teacher (1894\u20131971)\nMary Ann Wells (June 7, 1894 \u2013 January 8, 1971) was an American dance teacher known for her significant contributions to the field of dance education. Born in Appleton, Wisconsin, Wells began her career as the first ballet teacher at the Cornish School of Music in Seattle. She later established her own studio in c.\u20091922, where she emphasized a philosophy of artistic exploration and expression over technical precision. Throughout her career, Wells mentored numerous talented dancers, many of whom went on to achieve prominence in the dance world.\nShe is considered the most influential ballet teacher of the Pacific Northwest.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nMary Ann Wells was born on June 7, 1894, in Appleton, Wisconsin, to Charles Wells and Nell (last name unknown). Her dance training included studying with the noted ballet teacher Luigi Albertieri, who was associated with the Chicago Opera at the time. Wells's only performing experience was a brief stint with the Minnesota Stock Company.\nCareer\nIn 1916, at the age of 21, Wells relocated to Seattle and took on the role of the inaugural ballet instructor as well was the founder and head of the dancing department at the Cornish School of Music, a position she held until 1922. During her time at the Cornish School, Wells played a key role in establishing the ballet department and overseeing student performances, fostering an environment that nurtured aspiring dancers. It was also in 1916 that Wells married A. Forest King, a Seattle-based businessman, with whom she bore no children.\nWe wouldn't have this company today without her (Ms.\nWells') vision. When we fell into her hands, we fell into her way of thinking.\n\u2013 Gerald Arpino, in an interview with the Observer-Reporter in 1982\nAfter her tenure at the Cornish School, Wells founded her own dance studio in Seattle in c.\u20091922. The studio named \"Mary Ann Wells School of Dance,\" featured a quote from poet Kahlil Gibran on its walls, reflecting Wells' approach to dance instruction. Despite her association with the I AM Temple, known for its strict vegetarian practices, Wells focused on cultivating her students' passion for dance rather than enforcing rigid technical standards. Her teaching style aimed to encourage artistic exploration and self-expression in a supportive setting.\nWells' studio, strategically located above a restaurant owned by the father of one of her most talented students, Robert Joffrey, served as an incubator for emerging dance talent. Under Wells' mentorship, several of her student dancers found success in the dance industry. Among them, Gerald Arpino, Martin Buckner, William Weslow, and Richard Englund gained prominence as choreographers and directors after honing their skills under her guidance.\nThe Town Crier, v.15, no.37, Sep 11, 1920\nLater life and legacy\nShe retired in 1958 due to poor eyesight. Despite minimal direct involvement with the Joffrey Ballet, its style echoed her teachings. The company dedicated its 1971\u20131972 season to her memory, following her death in 1971 in Seattle.\nSee also\nList of dancers\n",
    "Welsh clergyman\nNot to be confused with John Hughes (minister, 1796\u20131860).\nJohn Hughes (1787 \u2013 1 November 1860) was a Welsh clergyman.\nBiography\nHughes was the son and heir of John Hughes, esq., of Llwyn Glas, Llanfihangel Geneu'r Glyn, near Aberystwyth. He was born in 1787. After attending the grammar school of Ystradmeurig, he became classical master at a large school at Putney, London, where he remained about eighteen months. As a lad he aspired to become a preacher. Returning to Wales he was ordained by the Bishop of St. Asaph in 1811. He was curate first for six years at Llandrillo yn Rh\u00f4s, near Conway, and afterwards at Foleshill, near Coventry. At Foleshill he became very popular; but when the vicar died, in 1822, Lord-chancellor Eldon refused the petition of the parishioners to bestow the living on him. Hughes therefore left, and settled at Tiddington, near Oxford. Here again his fame as a preacher soon filled the church, and students from Oxford were often among his hearers. He became in 1837 vicar of Aberystwyth and curate of Llanbadarn Fawr. In 1834 the living of the mother church of Llanbadarn was conferred on him, with a prebendal stall in the collegiate church of Brecon, and in 1859 Bishop Thirlwall gave him the archdeaconry of Cardigan.

    "British colonel in the Royal Engineers\nJohn Thomas Smith FRS (16 April 1805 \u2013 14 May 1882) was a British colonel in the Royal Engineers.\nBiography\nSmith was the second son of George Smith of Edwalton, Nottinghamshire, and afterwards of Fo\u00eblallt, Cardiganshire, by his wife Eliza Margaret, daughter of Welham Davis, elder brother of the Trinity House. He was born at Fo\u00eblallt on 16 April 1805. He was educated at Repton and at the high school, Edinburgh, entered the military college of the East India Company at Addiscombe in 1822, and received a commission as second lieutenant in the Madras engineers on 17 June 1824. He was promoted to be first lieutenant on the following day, and went to Chatham for a course of instruction in professional subjects. Smith left Chatham on 4 February 1825, and arrived at Madras on 2 September of the same year.\nOn 28 April 1826 Smith was appointed acting superintending engineer in the public works department for the northern division of the presidency, and on 2 May 1828 he was confirmed in the appointment. He thereupon began a series of investigations in reference to lighthouse-lanterns, devising a reciprocating light. Smith suggested to government the improvement of the lighthouse at Hope's Island, off Coringa, and at the end of 1833 his services were placed at the disposal of the marine board, with a view to the improvement of the lighthouse at Madras. On 11 February 1834 ill-health compelled Smith to sail for England on leave of absence. Before his departure the governor in council informed him in very complimentary terms that the marine board had adopted his plans for remodelling the lighthouses both at Madras and at Hope's Island. He was promoted to be captain on 5 March 1835.\nSmith remained in England until 28 July 1837, and in the same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was given an extension of furlough to superintend the manufacture of apparatus for the Madras lighthouse. He employed his leisure in the translation of J. L. Vicat's valuable treatise on mortars and cements, to which he added the results of many original experiments, and saw the work through the press before leaving for India. It appeared as \u2018A Practical and Scientific Treatise on Calcareous Mortars and Cements, Artificial and Natural, with Additions,\u2019 8vo, London, 1837. On his return to Madras on 13 December 1837 he was appointed to the command of the Madras sappers and miners, but remained at Madras on special duty. On 20 March 1838 he was appointed to the first division of the public works department, comprising the districts of Ganjam, Rajamandry, and Vizagapatam, and on 24 April he took charge of the office of the chief engineer. He served on a committee to inspect and report upon the state of the Red-hill railroad and canal, and he surveyed the Ennore and Pulicat lakes, to ascertain the practicability and cost of keeping open the bar of the Kuam river by artificially closing that of the Ennore river; thereby the whole of the waters collected in the Pulicat lake would be turned into the Kuam, a measure which he considered would afford peculiar facilities for cleansing the Black Town, besides improving the water communication between Madras and Sulurpet. Meanwhile, he superintended the erection of the Madras lighthouse, which was begun in 1838 and completed in 1839. On 5 April 1839 Smith was appointed to the sixth division of the public works department, and on 7 May to officiate as superintending engineer at Madras.\nOn 24 September 1839 Smith was relieved from all other duties to enable him to inspect and report upon the machinery of the mint at Madras. On 7 February 1840, the date of the re-establishment of the mint, Smith was appointed mint-master, and by a thorough reformation of the whole establishment soon brought the mint into a high state of efficiency. The satisfactory results obtained by Smith's skilful adaptation to steam power of the old and simple mint machinery driven by animal power were referred to in a financial despatch of 16 March 1841 to the court of directors as highly creditable. On 13 January 1846 he visited the Cape of Good Hope on leave of absence, returning to the mint on 28 December 1847. An innovation which Smith introduced of adjusting the weights of the blanks by means of the diameters of the pieces, instead of by their thickness, resulted in his design of a very ingenious and beautiful machine, by which twenty or a hundred blanks could be weighed to half a grain and deposited in a separate cell by a single person with two motions of the hand. After the pieces had been thus sorted they were passed through a set of circular cutters, which removed a certain weight according to the excess of each over the standard. By this means almost the whole of the blanks were obtained of the exact weight without further correction. This machine gained an award at the London International Exhibition of 1851.\nSmith was promoted to be major on 2 March 1852, and lieutenant-co",
    "Railway line in Kent, England\nThe Darent Valley line is a railway line between Swanley and Sevenoaks in Kent, England. It adopted its current name in 2020, by the Kent Rail Partnership.\nIt covers part of what was known as the Maidstone line which continued beyond Otford to Ashford International via Maidstone East. The line diverges from the Chatham Main Line at Swanley Junction and continues to Otford Junction, where it diverges from the Kent Downs line and meets the South Eastern Main Line at Sevenoaks.\nHistory\nThe line was built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway from their first line, the Chatham Main Line and was opened on 2 June 1862. The current stations at Eynsford and Otford opened later in July 1862 and August 1882 respectively. An additional station at Lullingstone was proposed to open in 1939 but work on the station was suspended following the outbreak of World War II and the station was never brought into use.\nThe line was electrified in 1935 (750 V DC third rail) by the Southern Railway prior to World War II.\nIn 2020, the line was adopted by the Kent Rail Partnership and was renamed the Darent Valley line. The section from Otford from Ashford International was renamed to the Kent Downs line at the same time.\nInfrastructure\nTraction current is supplied at 750 volts DC via the Third Rail. The supply for this is overseen by Paddock Wood Electrical Control Room. Signalling is Track Circuit Block with multiple aspect colour light signals throughout, controlled by Ashford IECC. The line is double track throughout.\nServices\nServices on the line are primarily operated by Thameslink. In the off-peak, there are two trains per hour between London Blackfriars and Sevenoaks via Catford which call at all stations. During the peak hours, services are extended beyond London Blackfriars to and from Welwyn Garden City via Finsbury Park. These services are operated using Class 700 EMUs.\nSoutheastern utilises the route for their semi-fast services between London Victoria, London Charing Cross, Maidstone East and Ashford International. These services run non-stop between Swanley and Otford before diverging down the Kent Downs line.\n",

    "Public building in Paris\nFa\u00e7ade of the H\u00f4tel du Timbre\nThe pre-1848 h\u00f4tel du timbre with the inscription \"TIMBRE ROYAL\" (lit.\u2009'Royal Stamp') on rue de la Paix in Paris\nThe H\u00f4tel du Timbre, full name H\u00f4tel du Timbre, de l'Enregistrement et des Domaines (lit.\u2009'Stamp, Registration and Public Lands Building'), is a public building on 9\u201313, rue de la Banque\u00a0 in Paris, France.\nOverview\nThe H\u00f4tel du Timbre was created as part of the larger urban development project associated with the northwards extension of the rue de la Banque, initiated by royal decree of 1844 on land previously used in part by the convent of discalced Augustinians (of which the church survives as Notre-Dame-des-Victoires). The land stood between the Bank of France, from which the street derived its name, and the stock exchange building, in the heart of what was then Paris's financial district. As part of that endeavor, architect Paul Lelong\u00a0 designed three prominent public buildings intended to be erected simultaneously, namely the H\u00f4tel du Timbre on the new street's western side, and on the western side, the mairie du 2e arrondissement de Paris\u00a0 and adjacent barracks for the garde nationale de Paris\u00a0.\nThe H\u00f4tel du Timbre was initially intended as a facility to produce and sell stamped paper which at the time was widely used for a number of administrative and commercial proceedings. As such, it replaced a previous h\u00f4tel du timbre that stood on rue de la Paix on the location of the former Couvent des Capucines. The importance of the stamp (French: timbre) administration was enhanced by the adoption of new legislation on 1850 that established a stamp duty of 0.5 percent on transactions on stocks, bonds, and insurance policy, and 0.05 percent on government debt instruments.\nAfter Lelong died in 1846, Victor Baltard replaced him as project architect and brought the building to completion. The corresponding civil service relocated from the rue de la Paix in 1848, and the complex was eventually completed in 1852.\nThe building complex occupies a length of 114 meters on rue de la Banque, punctuated by several pavilions. The central pavilion, ostensibly inspired by church architecture, displays two allegorical medallions with figures representing, respectively, Security and Law. Between those two, a monumental inscription reading \"TIMBRE IMPERIAL MDCCCL\" (lit.\u2009'Imperial Stamp 1850') which referenced both the applicable legislation (law of 1850) and the imperial regime that was in place by the time of completion in 1852. Because of their political overtones, the lower two lines were later erased, leaving only the word \"TIMBRE\" visible.\nthe H\u00f4tel du Timbre was used by the stamp duty administration until 1973, and subsequently became a local office of the French tax authorities until 2023. It eventually reached a total floor size of about ten thousand square meters.\nIn 2022, the H\u00f4tel du Timbre was auctioned away by the French government. It was purchased in early 2023 by Cov\u00e9a, an insurance company. In late 2023, a project was approved to convert it into mixed-usage including offices, coworking spaces, apartments, restaurant and retail commerce, on a design by architects Perrot & Richard and Asphalt.\nSee also\nStamp duty\n",

    "2009 collection of short science fiction stories by author Greg Egan\nCrystal Nights and Other Stories is a collection of nine science-fiction short stories by Australian writer Greg Egan, published on 30 September 2009 by Subterranean Press. Two of the stories were nominated for the Hugo Award.\nContents\n\"Lost Continent\" (2008)\n\"Crystal Nights\" (2008)\n\"Steve Fever\" (2007)\n\"TAP\" (1995)\n\"Induction\" (2007)\n\"Singleton\" (2002)\n\"Oracle\" (2000)\n\"Border Guards\" (1999)\n\"Hot Rock\" (2009)\nBackground\n\"Singleton\" and \"Oracle\" are set in the same universe as Egan's novel Schild's Ladder from 2002, but 20,000 years earlier. After their release, Egan was active in campaigning for refugee rights, including the end of mandatory detention for asylum seekers in Australia, for a few years. In an interview with David Conyers for Virtual Worlds and Imagined Futures in 2009, Egan called it an \"eye-opening experience to see people mistreated in that way\", revealing that \"Lost Continent\" about a time traveler seeking asylum but facing burocratic incompetence is \"an allegory of the whole thing, just to get some of the anger out of my system and move on.\"\nReception\nReviews\nGreg Johnson, writing on the SF Site, states that the collection \"represent Egan both at his best, and his most accessible\" and that he \"finds a way to balance the complexity of his ideas with enough story and character for the reader to care about them as stories and not just speculative essays on the latest in cosmology, physics or artificial intelligence research.\" This \"shows how good a writer Greg Egan can be.\" In further detail, Johnson describes \"TAP\" as \"a testament to Egan's depth as a science fiction writer\" and writes that \"Hot Rock\" is \"in many ways a throwback to the old style of hard science fiction, a story which presents us with the mystery of a new place, one that on first examination shouldn't exist.\" He adds that the \"appeal of the story lies mainly in solving the mystery, but the main character is portrayed just sympathetically enough that we care at least as much for how the story affects her as we do for solving the mystery of how the planet of the story's title came to be.\"\nPublishers Weekly referred to the collection as \"steadfastly reductionist\", noting that Egan \"makes room for the moral implications of the treatment of refugees in 'Lost Continent,' while 'Crystal Nights' offers a pointed critique of technologists enthused by the idea of enslaved creations.\" They further claimed that \"Egan can be heavy-handed at times, as in 'Oracle,' where the character Jack serves as a straw-man version of C.S. Lewis.\" They concluded, \"More conventional SF puzzle stories like 'Hot Rock' and 'Tap' and a forcefully worded introduction on the ethics of artificial intelligence round out the volume\".\nAwards\n\"Border Guards\" was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 2000. \"Oracle\" was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novella in 2001. \"Crystal Nights\" was nominated in 2008, and \"Singleton\" was nominated in 2002 for the British SF Association Award.\nSee also\n2009 in Australian literature\n",
    "\nFor the Australian campdrafting horse, see Radium (horse).\nRadium (1903 \u2013 4 August 1922) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. A slow maturing racehorse, his most significant wins did not occur until his four and five-year-old seasons. After retiring from racing Radium became a successful stallion, siring 2000 Guineas winner Clarissimus and the sire of Phar Lap.\nBackground\nRadium was foaled in 1903 at Southcourt in Leighton Buzzard, the stud of his breeder and owner Leopold de Rothschild. He was sired by Derby and Champion Stakes winner Bend Or. After retiring from racing Bend Or became a successful stallion. His most successful son was the unbeaten Triple Crown winner, Ormonde. He also sired the champion sire Kendal and Eclipse Stakes winner Orbit. Bend Or was also the leading broodmare sire in Great Britain and Ireland for two years. Radium was foaled in the last crop of Bend Or, the aged stallion dying in January 1903 before Radium's birth.\nHis dam, Taia, was also bred by Rothschild and was a half-sister to the horse Eros (winner of Althorp Stakes). Raced for two seasons and winless in 10 starts, she had a difficult personality that prevented her from being a successful racehorse. Radium was Taia's fourth and last foal before her death in 1905.\nRacing career\nEarly racing career\nRadium began his training as a two-year-old under John Watson in February 1905, with initial training runs being impressive. He started in the Khedive Plate at the Newmarket July meeting and was thoroughly beaten with his run later being described as \"indifferent.\" After a place in a race at the Goodwood meeting, Radium won the Price of Wales's Nursery Stakes at Doncaster. Returning as a three-year-old, he was third to Beppo and Bridge of Canny in the Union Jack Stakes in Liverpool and was unplaced for the Newmarket Biennial. He was second to Sarcelle for the Chippenham Plate at the second spring meeting at Newmarket. Radium's only Classic race start was in the 1906 Derby, which was won by Spearmint, where he battled with Troutbeck for a fourth-place finish.\n1907: four-year-old-season\nLeopold de Rothschild, by Leslie Ward, 1884.\nRadium's form remarkably improved as a four-year-old with the press noting that he seemed to \"show what was in him.\" He won the Biennial Stakes, was second for the Great Yorkshire Handicap, and was unplaced in the Doncaster Cup. Following uncontested wins in the Rous Stakes and Rutland Handicap, Radium defeated the 11-4 favorite The White Knight in the Ascot Gold Cup. The running of the Jockey Club Cup in 1907 was described as, \"one of the most farcical races that has ever been run on Newmarket Heath.\" Radium beat The White Knight at the slow time of 5 minutes and 32 seconds, setting what the crowds remarked was a ridiculously slow pace for the length of the course.\n1908: five-year-old season\nRadium lost the 1908 Ascot Gold Cup and Coronation Cup to The White Knight by a margin of five lengths in a much publicized rematch against the racing rivals. Winning the Dullingham Plate, Radium again raced The White Knight and beat him for the Goodwood Cup. Further wins in the Doncaster Cup, Beaufort Stakes, and a second victory in the Jockey Club Cup cemented Radium as one of the best older horses of the season.\nStud career\nRothschild retained Radium as a breeding stallion at Southcourt Stud for the remainder of the stallion's life. By 1920, Radium's fee had been reduced to \u00a349 due to fertility issues, and he sired no foals after 1920. Radium was euthanised at Southcourt Stud on 4 August 1922 at the age of 19.\nNotable Progeny\nc = colt, f = filly\nPedigree\nRadium is inbred 3x5 to Stockwell.\n",
    "Musical artist\nCongolese musician (born 1984)\nJo\u00e9 Ngoie Mwema (born 9 August 1984), known professionally as RJ Kanierra, is a Congolese singer-songwriter, rapper, and dancer. He is regarded as one of the most significant figures in 21st-century Katangese music. His musical style blends Congolese rhythm and harmony with rap, a synthesis he calls \"Rotatam Style.\"\nBorn and raised in Kolwezi, Ngoie began his recording career in the late 1990s and later released his debut studio album, Les treize lois de la jungle, in 2006. Ngoie's single \"Aina Lawa\", premiered in 2008, gained significant acclaim in Katanga. In March 2011, he issued his second studio album, 99. Ngoie went on to publish his third studio album, titled 622, in 2013, followed by -243 (2016) and 99\u00d79 (2019). In August 2022, Ngoie unveiled his sixth studio album, 13.\nNgoie gained widespread recognition and mainstream attention following the release of his 2023 single \"Tia\", which quickly amassed over two million views within two weeks on YouTube and peaked atop the Congo's most-viewed YouTube videos, garnering 805,000 views in October of that year. It also sparked the \"Tia dance challenge,\" a trend that quickly gained momentum on social media and was embraced by various personalities.\nEarly life and career\n1984\u20132021: Early life, music debut, and releases\nKolwezi, the city where Ngoie grew up, lies in the Lualaba Province.\nJo\u00e9 Ngoie Mwema was born on 9 August 1984, in Kolwezi situated within the Katanga Province (now Lualaba Province), in what was then Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). As a teenager, Ngoie participated in various activities such as football, karate, and athletics. He was a junior champion in the 100-meter event, organized by the Kolwezi athletics league. In the late 1990s, with the emergence of popular music in Kolwezi, Ngoie clandestinely began performing street music and debuted the single titled \"Ch\u00e8re Maman\" to seek his mother's authorization to pursue his musical aspirations. In 1998, he formed his backing band called Casse-T\u00eate and later released the demo C'est-\u00e0-dire, which included tracks such as \"Je Confirme,\" \"Tinss,\" and \"Coliba.\" Despite venturing out for productions, he remained devoted to his city, where his concerts consistently attracted large audiences.\nIn January 2006, Ngoie clinched the accolade for the Best Group alongside Casse-T\u00eate at the Nzenze Ngoma Ya Kwetu festival convened in Lubumbashi. Later that year, he released his debut studio album, Les treize lois de la jungle, which combined hip-hop and R&B. In 2008, he premiered the single \"Aina Lawa,\" which gained significant recognition in Katanga with lyrics exploring themes of success, victory, and the rejection of superstition and fetishism. Following the success of \"Aina Lawa\", Ngoie released his second studio album, titled 99, in March 2011, which included critically acclaimed hits \"Salem\" and \"Bikelele\". In 2013, Ngoie published his third studio album, titled 622, which consisted of six tracks.\nIn 2014, Ngoie made a guest appearance on Mjoe Zuka's album Rien que l'amour. Ngoie debuted his fourth studio album -243 in 2016 which included hits like \"Winner\", \"Djaso\", \"Je Suis B\u00e9ni\". -243 was produced between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which allowed Ngoie to do his debut major concert at the Lupopo stadium. During the same year, Ngoie performed a major concert in Kenya alongside JB Mpiana and Davido. In 2019, he published his fifth studio album, titled 99\u00d79, which included hit singles like \"Bae Bae\" and \"Danza\". Ngoie released the single \"Get Down\" featuring Mink's on 25 March 2019, followed by the single \"Bina Vuya\", which included a guest performance by Kinshasa-born rapper Alesh and amassed over 500,000 streams on all streaming platforms.\nOn 10 October 2020, Ngoie debuted the single \"Vula Vwala\" (alternately known as Longola Lata), which peaked at number-one in Lubumbashi music charts and received praise from artists such as Barbara Kanam, Lokua Kanza and Alesh. Ngoie was subsequently awarded the Honorary Prize at the Tshota Awards in Likasi and received a nomination for Song of the Year at the City Awards. In early February 2021, he launched fellow Congolese singer Eric Flash under his label Shutuka Musique and debuted the single \"Baby Sugar\" on 6 February 2021.

    "Justiciar or Ireland\nGeoffrey de Marisco (died 1245) was the justiciar of Ireland.\nBiography\nMarisco is said to have been the nephew and heir of Hervey de Mount-Maurice, and nephew of Herlewin, bishop of Leighlin (d. 1217?) (Genealogical Memoir of Montmorency, Pedigree, d. ix\u00a0; Gilbert, Viceroys of Ireland, p.\u00a078]), but these assertions seem to lack proof. He is also said to have been the brother of Richard de Marisco, bishop of Durham and chancellor (Gilbert, ut supra), which, though possible (see Sweetman, Documents, No. 745), appears to be a mere assumption (see Foss, Judges of England, ii. 400; Surtees, History of Durham, vol. i. p. xxviii). The arms used by the bishop (see Notes and Queries, 3rd ser. i. 91) are different from those carried by Marisco (see Matt. Paris, Chronica Majora, vi. 475). Another theory makes him the son of a Jordan de Marisco, described as lord of Huntspill-Mareys, Somerset, and other lands, which Marisco is supposed to have in- herited (Genealogical Memoir, ut supra, p. vi\u00a0; Collinson, History of Somerset, ii. 392), but save that Marisco had a brother named Jordan {Documents, No. 2119), and is represented as having a son of that name (Genealogical Memoir, ut supra, p. x), this also seems to be unsupported by evidence, for it is impossible to assume, with the pedigree-makers, that the Marisco FitzJordan mentioned in a charter of Quarr Abbey in the Isle of Wight (Monasticon, v. 317) is the justiciar\u00a0; and though Marisco is said to have possessed large estates in England (Gilbert, ut supra, p.\u00a078), it is certain that he had no land in this country in 1238 (Documents, No. 2445). . His name, which, translated, is simply Marsh, was as common in England in the Middle Ages as the marshes from which it was derived (Monumenta Franciscana, vol. i. Pref. p. lxxvii), and the compilers of the pedigrees of the family of Mountmorres, or Montmorency, have caused much confusion by importing into their schemes the names of all persons of any note who were known by that common appellation, or by one at all like it . Nothing seems certain about Marisco's parentage further than that he was a nephew of John Comyn (d. 1212), archbishop of Dublin (Documents, No. 276), a fact which may account for his rise to wealth and power in Ireland\u00a0; and that his mother was alive in 1220 (Royal Letters, Henry III, i. 128).\nMarisco was powerful in the south of Munster and Leinster, and appears to have received large grants of land in Ireland from King John. He was with the king at Ledbury, Gloucestershire, in 1200 (Documents, No. 137), and received a grant of 'Katherain' in exchange for other lands in Ireland, together with twenty marks, to fortify a house there for himself (ib. No. 139). When war broke out among the English in Leinster, the lords and others who were discontented with the government of the justiciar Hugh de Lacy seem to have looked on Marisco as their leader. He was joined by a number of the natives, seized Limerick (Annals of Worcester, p.\u00a0396), and inflicted a severe defeat on the justiciar at Thurles in Munster (Annals of the Four Masters, iii. 15, 171\u00a0; Annals ap. Chartularies of St. Mary's Abbey, ii. 311). For this he obtained the king's pardon (Gilbert, ut supra, p.\u00a066), and in 1210 made successful war against the Irish of Connaught (Annals of Loch CS, i. 239, 245). When Innocent III was threatening, in or about 1211, to absolve John's subjects from their allegiance, he joined the other magnates of Ireland in making a protestation of loyalty (Documents, No. 448). In the summer of 1215 he was with the king at Marlborough, and on 6 July was appointed justiciar of Ireland, giving two of his sons as pledges for his behaviour (ib. Nos. 604, 608). On the accession of Henry III he advised that Queen Isabella, or her second son, Richard, should reside in Ireland (Gilbert, ut supra, p.\u00a080). He built a castle at Killaloe, co. Clare, in 1217, and forced the people to accept an English bishop, Robert Travers, apparently one of his own relatives (Annals of the Four Masters, iii. 90; Documents, Nos. 1026, 2119). In 1218 he was ordered to raise money to enable the king to pay Louis, the son of the French king, the sum promised to him, and to pay the papal tribute. He was ordered in 1219 to pay the revenues of the crown into the exchequer at Dublin, and to present himself before the king, leaving Ireland in the care of Henry of London, archbishop of Dublin. Having already taken the cross he received a safe-conduct to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land (Calendar of Patent Rolls, 3 Hen. Ill, n. 12), and went to England. There in March 1220 he entered into an agreement with the king at Oxford, in the presence of the council, with reference to the discharge of his office, pledging himself to pay the royal revenues into the exchequer, and to appoint faithful constables for the king's castles, and delivering one of his sons to be kept as a hostage by the king (F\u0153dera, i. 162). On his return to Ireland he was comman",
    "Lithuanian military officer (1898\u20131979)\nKazys Ali\u0161auskas (29 March 1898 \u2013 16 January 1979) was a Lithuanian military officer and historian.\nBiography\nEarly life military career\nKazys Ali\u0161auskas was born on 29 March 1898 in the village of Me\u0161ku\u010diai\u00a0 in Congress Poland of the Russian Empire. He graduated from the local Marijampol\u0117 Gymnasium. When the Lithuanian Wars of Independence broke out, Ali\u0161auskas joined the Lithuanian Army as a volunteer in 1919, graduating from the War School of Kaunas on 6 July 1919.\nAfter receiving the rank of kar\u016b\u017eas (the lowest officer rank; replaced later by lieutenant), Ali\u0161auskas was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Regiment. He fought against the Red Army, Bermontian, and Polish forces. For courage displayed while fighting the Bermontians, he was awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis, 1st degree. On 3 April 1923 he was promoted to senior lieutenant.\nFirst publications\nThe Lithuanian Society for Military Sciences, which was established in 1923, acted as a good intellectual environment for Ali\u0161auskas to publish his first historical texts and to chronicle the history of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. He published two reviews outlining the basic facts of the creation of the regiment. In 1928, he published a review on the Battle of Giedrai\u010diai, a battle in which the regiment fought, and which became one of the most commemorated battles in interwar Lithuania. Stasys Ra\u0161tikis noted that Ali\u0161auskas assisted Kazys Ladiga in writing the official history of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, although the work was not realized in interwar Lithuania. \nAfter completing the Higher Officers' Courses in 1926, Ali\u0161auskas was promoted to captain. He also graduated from the Vytautas Magnus University Faculty of Law. In 1933, he graduated from the Higher Officers' Courses signal unit, and a year later graduated from machine gun courses. On 23 November 1934, he was promoted to major. On 23 November 1939, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.\nImmigration and career in the United States\nAfter the start of the Second World War, Ali\u0161auskas stayed in Lithuania. After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940, Ali\u0161auskas was appointed the commandant of the Raseiniai district, later serving as the officer of special affairs for the General Staff of the Lithuanian Army. On 11 September 1940, Ali\u0161auskas began his service in the Red Army's Military School of Vilnius. In 1944 he and his family moved to Germany.\nFrom 1949 they lived in Chicago. Throughout his publishing career, Ali\u0161auskas worked full-time at a factory during his stay in the United States. In the United States, Ali\u0161auskas was part of the Ramov\u0117 group, a Lithuanian veterans' organization established in 1950 in Chicago. Ali\u0161auskas had prepared a historical overview of the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, which the Kersten Committee had deemed as a crime committed by the Soviet Union in the context of international law in 1953. Ali\u0161auskas's overview became the basis for a similar type of document prepared by the committee. As an \u00e9migr\u00e9, Ali\u0161auskas worked on the Lithuanian Boston Encyclopedia's warfare chapter and wrote a book about the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, the latter being commissioned by Ramov\u0117 to be done by 1968 by a group of veteran officers. However, internal disagreements and deaths within the group prevented any significant progress on the book, with Ali\u0161auskas being the only one who completed a part of the planned book earlier than the deadline and who focused on other fronts while other officers focused exclusively on battles with the Polish. Ali\u0161auskas published the book without permission from Ramov\u0117, which got him into conflict with the group that was later resolved. In 1959 Ali\u0161auskas received an award as the best author of the magazine Karys. From 1959 to 1972, Ali\u0161auskas wrote numerous articles about Lithuanian engagements with the Bermontians, Poles and Bolsheviks. In 1971, he also published an article on the Lithuania National Battalion in Siberia in 1917.\nAli\u0161auskas died on 16 January 1979 in Chicago.\nAwards\nAli\u0161auskas received the following awards:\nOrder of the Cross of Vytis, 1st degree (1920)\nOrder of the Grand Duke Gediminas, 4th degree (1928)\nMedal of Lithuanian Independence (1928)\nLatvian War of Independence 10 Year Anniversary Commemorative Medal (1929)\nBibliography\n2\u2011as p\u0117stinink\u0173 Did\u017eiojo Lietuvos kunigaik\u0161\u010dio Algirdo pulkas kautyn\u0117se ties Giedrai\u010diais , (1928)\nPirmieji nepriklausomyb\u0117s kov\u0173 \u017eygiai , (1939)\nKovos d\u0117l Lietuvos nepriklausomyb\u0117s, 1918\u20131920 , (Vol I; 1972)\n",
    "1994 film by Richard Munchkin\nGuardian Angel is a 1994 American action film directed by Richard W. Munchkin, starring Cynthia Rothrock, Lydie Denier, Daniel McVicar and Marshall R. Teague. Rothrock plays a cop-turned-bodyguard on assignment to protect a rich playboy from an unhinged woman, who is both the client's former mistress and the criminal responsible for the death of the heroine's fianc\u00e9. Although contemporary reviews were mixed, it is better regarded than most of the actress' American output.\nPlot\nCast\nCynthia Rothrock as McKay\nDaniel McVicar as Hobbs\nLydie Denier as Nina\nMarshall R. Teague as Nick\nKen McLeod as Ostendorf\nJohn O'Leary as Clayton\nAnna Dalva as Goddard\nRobert Miano as David\nBrian Brophy as Slick\nMatthew Walker as Lippy\nArt Camacho as Jimmy Lee\nDan Doherty as Issac\nProduction\nDevelopment and filming\nGuardian Angel was Rothrock's first and only collaboration with action specialists PM Entertainment. The company was typically reluctant to hire women in leading roles due to their limited track record in the genre, but gave her a chance based on the performance of some of her movies. Filming took place in the Los Angeles agglomeration between July 26 and September 3, 1993. The fictional \"Dick's Bar\", where Rothrock's character brawls with a group of thugs, was represented by the Yukon Belle in Thousand Oaks, once a legitimate criminal hangout that fell victim to the area's gentrification a few years after filming.\nStunts\nRothrock's frequent screen partner Richard Norton contributed to fight choreography. A Mexican performer, hired by the production despite his limited credentials, was grazed by Rothrock during filming, and tried to extort them $250,000 due to an allegedly broken nose. Rothrock denied causing him any lasting damage, and the man quickly lowered his demands to a fraction of the initial amount. Co-star Lydie Denier was inspired to take kickboxing classes after witnessing Rothrock in action. The film marked the debut of veteran stuntwoman Anita Hart, who was introduced to PM stunt coordinator Cole McKay by a mutual friend. Playing the killer maid, she got her high fall on the first take and went on to become a PM regular herself. Although Rothrock performed her fight scenes, some of PM's trademark setpieces required the use of a stunt double, such as the horse chase. Reflecting the company's hectic shoots, the wig worn by the rider visibly slipped during the scene but it could not be redone, and the mishap had to be worked around in post-production. The character of Goddard, a fellow cop who helps the heroine commandeer the Cigarette Lady speedboat for the final chase, was played by its real-life owner and competitive driver Anna Dalva.\nRelease\nIn the U.S., Guardian Angel was released on VHS by Imperial Entertainment on November 23, 1994. It reached Australia the same month via 21st Century Pictures, under the title Beyond Justice, and the U.K. the previous July through Guild Home Video. The film received a domestic DVD re-issue on May 4, 2004, from Kreative Digital Entertainment via Universal Music & Video Distribution, as part of a slate of PM Entertainment releases.\nReception\nGuardian Angel received mixed reviews from mainstream publications. TV Guide criticized the inclusion of another ill-fated companion for Rothrock, but noted the novelty of the femme fatale antagonist played by Denier, and ultimately deemed that \"it's McVicar's tongue-in-cheek turn as the Robert Wagnerian poor little rich boy that makes Guardian Angel watchable, if hardly a standout.\" Ballantine Books' Video Movie Guide wrote: \"Martial arts expert Cynthia Rothrock is back in this pedestrian effort about an ex-cop out to avenge the deaths of her partner and lover.  Novelty here is the killer is a woman. Anyone for a good cat fight?\"\nBritish reference book Elliot's Guide to Home Entertainment called it \" violent actioner that serves merely as an adequate showcase for Rothrock\u2019s fighting skills.\" Pat Gillespie of Australian newspaper The Age described Rothrock as \"stilted but likeable\". However, he found that the film's humorous brand of feminism was \"short circuited by gratuitous focus on boorish fight scenes\", which amounted to little more than \"cheap thrills\".\n",

    "1969 aviation accident\nMexicana de Aviaci\u00f3n Flight 801 was a scheduled international flight from Chicago-O'Hare International Airport in Illinois bound for Benito Ju\u00e1rez International Airport, Mexico City. On September 21, 1969, the Boeing 727-100 crashed during its final approach to Benito Ju\u00e1rez International Airport. The aircraft broke apart upon impact, killing 27 of the 118 occupants on board. The cause of the crash was never determined.\nAircraft and flight\nThe Boeing 727-100 aircraft which operated Flight 801 was manufactured in 1966 and delivered to Mexicana de Aviaci\u00f3n. It bore the registration XA-SEJ and was powered by three Pratt & Whitney JT8D-7B engines. The ill-fated flight originated from Chicago-O'Hare International Airport in the United States, carrying 111 passengers and 7 flight crew members. There were three pilots, namely Captain Roberto Ur\u00edas and officers Luis Franco Espinosa and Luis Guillot. Flight 801 was scheduled to arrive at Benito Ju\u00e1rez International Airport. Most of the passengers were American tourists heading for Mexico City or Acapulco. The aircraft was deemed not airworthy because the Flight Data Recorder was improperly installed by technicians two days prior to the crash, and the Cockpit Voice Recorder was removed.\nAccident\nFlight 801 was given clearance for an instrument landing on Runway 23L. It was in the landing configuration; undercarriage down, flaps extended 30 degrees, leading-edge slats activated and stabilizer raised nose up by 10.25 units. On its final approach, at 17:45, the three engines lost altitude and impacted the ground about 1,500\u00a0m (4,900\u00a0ft) from the runway threshold. This caused the aircraft to become airborne until the landing gears and front body impacted a railroad embankment. It crashed into a swamp and broke into three pieces. Dozens of passengers were reportedly sucked out of the airframe as it broke apart, scattering them for over 300\u00a0m (980\u00a0ft). One of the engines also detached from the airframe. There was no post-crash fire. The forward section and cockpit came to rest 300\u00a0m (980\u00a0ft) away from the main fuselage wreckage.\nAftermath\nOne flight attendant escaped from the wreckage. Locals began looting passengers' belongings while they were trapped among the wreck. Many were trapped for hours before being rescued. The swamp environment made rescuing people and recovering bodies difficult. All three pilots and five flight attendants were killed; Captain Roberto Ur\u00edas was reportedly still alive in the cockpit after the crash. Fifty-three people were hospitalised while five had serious injuries.\nRescue work was hindered by mud and water hence locals used boats from Lake San Juan de Arag\u00f3n to reach the crash site. A 35-year-old American was airlifted to hospital after 60 people helped moved the plane's wing to free him. President Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz demanded medical assistance for the injured. The Secretariat of National Defense also deployed guards to prevent further looting. The crash site became a local interest point as many residents gathered to watch the ongoing rescue efforts from afar. Some street vendors also appeared along roadsides. An airport catering company provided rescue workers with sustenance. Several workers were injured by wreckage parts.\n",

    "Czech-British aristocrat\nAngelika Campbell, Countess Cawdor (n\u00e9e Countess Angelika Ilona Lazansky von Bukowa; born 17 February 1944), also known as Angelika La\u017eansk\u00e1 z Bukov\u00e9 a Chy\u0161e, is a Czech-British horticulturist, landowner and aristocrat. She is the second wife of the late Hugh John Vaughan Campbell, 6th Earl Cawdor.\nEarly life\nChy\u0161e Castle, Lady Cawdor's birthplace\nLady Cawdor was born Countess Angelika Ilona Lazansky von Bukowa (Czech: La\u017eansk\u00e1 z Bukov\u00e9 a Chy\u0161e) on 17 February 1944 at her family's castle in Chy\u0161e. Her father, Count Prokop La\u017eansk\u00fd z Bukov\u00e9, was a Bohemian landowner and her mother, Countess Ingeborg von K\u00f6nigswald, was a German aviator. She has one sister, Countess Mechtilda.\nFollowing Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, her father accepted German citizenship. In 1945, following the end of World War II, her family was expelled from Czechoslovakia by the Bene\u0161 decrees. They settled in Southern Rhodesia, where her father died in 1969.\nAdult life\nIn the 1960s, Lady Cawdor returned to Czechoslovakia to visit her childhood home. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, she returned again to find the castle in disrepair following forty years of management by the socialist government. In 1996, her distant cousin, Count Vladim\u00edr La\u017eansk\u00fd, purchased the castle and renovated it. Lady Cawdor and her sister visited in 2011 and helped restore the chapel, which was established in 1833 by her great-grandmother, Countess Terezie La\u017eansk\u00e1.\nOn 28 December 1979, she married the divorc\u00e9 Hugh John Vaughan Campbell, 6th Earl Cawdor. She was Lord Cawdor's second wife. Upon her marriage, she took up residence at Cawdor Castle, her husband's Scottish estate in Nairnshire. Lady Cawdor is a proponent of organic farming and managed the gardens and farms on the Cawdor estate. The castle is open to tourists.\nHer husband died in 1993 and left the Cawdor estate to Lady Cawdor instead of to his eldest son, Colin Campbell, 7th Earl Cawdor. In the spring of 2022, she prevented the estate from undertaking agricultural projects involving genetically modified crops. That October, Lady Cawdor resigned from Cawdor Castle Tourism following a family dispute. In November 2002, she tried to have her stepson and his family evicted from the estate after they took up residence in the castle while she was on holiday in the United States. A judge ruled that she could evict her step-grandchildren from the property but not her stepson. Ultimately, her stepson and his family left the castle and settled at Drynachan Lodge on the estate.\nIn 2021, she sold sixty-eight acres of land on the estate.\n",

    "Football club in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany\nFootball club\nFSV Barleben 1911 is a football club from the unified municipality of Barleben in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. The home of the club is the sports field at Barleber Anger. The biggest success in the club's history is the winning of the national championship title 2014/15.\nThe first team has been playing in the Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt since 2018 after the voluntary withdrawal from the southern relay of the Oberliga Nordost and has been trained by Christoph Grabinski since July 2021.\nPrehistory\nThe chronicle of Barleber football goes back to 1911, when the first sports club with a football section was founded. In the early years, however, the association did not appear nationwide. After the end of the Second World War, the club was dissolved in 1945 at the instigation of the Soviet occupying power, but sports activities continued to exist. In the course of the reorganization of company sports on a production basis, the BSG VEM Barleben was created in 1948, a company sports community, which was joined by the sports community formed in 1945. In the following years, the club, renamed BSG Motor Barleben in 1950, achieved some success. For example, they belonged to the Bezirksliga Magdeburg from 1952 to 1954 and 1956/1957. From 1957 until the reunification of both German states, Barleben played continuously in the district class for many years, but in 1987/88 he was relegated to the district league. With the end of the GDR, the BSG Motor Barleben was refounded into SG Motor Barleben.\nAfter the introduction of the DFB league system in East Germany, SG Motor Barleben therefore found itself at district level for the 1990/91 season. In the mid-1990s, Barleber football managed to return to FSA level with the promotion to the state class.\nHistory\nIn 1997, the footballers went their own way and left SG Motor Barleben and founded their own club. In tradition to the first Barleben football team, they called the club FSV Barleben 1911. At the end of the 2003/04 season, the FSV was relegated from the state class after long-standing affiliation. Only the absence of relegated in the Ohrekreisliga prevented the further decline of the club in 2005. It was not until 2008 that the Red-Blacks found they back in national football, whereby with a new promotion they even succeeded in the march into the now seventh-class state league. Although the club had to accept the direct relegation, the immediate re-promotion to the Landesliga Nord followed in the year of the 100th anniversary. After the placements three and four, FSV Barleben rose undefeated to the Verbandsliga Saxony-Anhalt with first place in 2014. In 2015, winning the state championship of Saxony-Anhalt succeeded in the first promotion to the Oberliga, so that the club was active for the first time in the fifth highest division of the DFB league system in the 2015/16 season. In the new league, the team of coach Mario Middendorf with ninth place already managed the safe class preservation with a few match days before the end of the season, which with a 13. Place was also realized in the following season. After the third season in the Oberliga, the first under coach J\u00f6rn Schulz, and the renewed sporting class retention, the club withdrew to the Verbandsliga for economic reasons.\nStadium\nThe club usually plays its home games on the sports field at Barleber Anger, which has a lawn (main square) and an artificial turf field. However, if games are due that require a higher level of security or if more than 1,000 spectators are expected to play at home, they will not take place on the home sports field.\nPlayers and coaches of the men's team\nSaxony-Anhalt Cup\nSuccesses\nHall district master district of B\u00f6rde (2007/08)\nDistrict Master District of B\u00f6rde (2007/08)\nChampion State Class 4 (2008/09)\nChampion State Class 2 (2010/11)\nChampion Landesliga Nord (2013/14)\nNational Champion Saxony-Anhalt (2014/15)\nExternal links\nwww.fsvbarleben.de\nHighlights: Highlights: FSV Barleben - 1.
