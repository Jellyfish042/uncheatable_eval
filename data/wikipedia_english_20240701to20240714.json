    "\nPolitzek.me\u00a0\u2014 is an advocacy platform designed to assist political prisoners in Belarus, featuring an up-to-date database of political prisoners in the country. It was established in November 2020 following the protests triggered by public rejection of the presidential election results by the campaign team of presidential candidate Viktar Babaryka with informational support from the Human Rights Center Viasna. The organization is led by its co-founder Inna Kavalionak.\nOrganization Description\nThe platform was created to make the issue of political prisoners more accessible and to destigmatize them through innovative approaches. The project started as a website containing a database of Belarusian political prisoners and their stories. Visitors to the site can find current information about political prisoners, write letters to them, send postcards, make donations, or send parcels to detention centers. Users can also anonymously indicate that they are assisting a particular political prisoner by adding them as a friend on the site. Friendship involves performing specific supportive actions for the chosen political prisoner without direct contact. The number of friends each political prisoner has is displayed on Politzek.Me.\nPolitzek.Me believes that letters can be a source of encouragement and support for political prisoners, and donations to their families can alleviate financial difficulties faced after their relatives' detention, providing necessary resources to support the imprisoned.\nThe overall idea of the site is to enable people to act and support those fighting for democracy and human rights in Belarus, as well as to raise international awareness of the situation.\nIn February 2023, the Politzek.me team launched their online magazine \"Politzek Times\". The magazine covers the experiences of Belarusian political prisoners both during their imprisonment and after their release.\nIn November 2023, the project's web pages were recognized as \u201cextremist materials\u201d in Belarus, and in April 2024, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Belarus declared Politzek.Me an extremist formation.\nPolitzek.Me continually updates its list of political prisoners as their number changes daily. As of November 2021, Politzek.Me identified 1074 political prisoners in Belarus; in December 2021 \u2013 1104 prisoners; in May 2022 \u2013 1457 prisoners. The number of political prisoners increased rapidly throughout 2021 and 2022, reaching 1651 by October 2022.\nAs of July 2024, Politzek.Me identifies 1,570 political prisoners in Belarus.\nPolitzek.me Partners\nHuman Rights Center Viasna\nPismo.bel\nDissident.by\n",
    "This article is about PlayStation 2 video game. For for chess board-games, see Endgame (chess). For other uses, see Endgame (disambiguation).\n2002 video game\nEndgame is a 2002 light gun shooter game developed by Cunning Developments and published by Empire Interactive, released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 video game console. Built in the RenderWare engine, it features destructable environments and a rudimentary positional audio system. The game was released in the Europe on June 3 and two months later on August 22 in North America. The game's story follows Jade Cornell as she uncovers a plot by the megacorp named EuroDream Technologies who wants to use its own virtual reality technology to control humanity. Cornell is tasked by the Octavian, an Artificial Intelligence, to put a stop to the scheme and save the world.\nThe game requires Namco's proprietary GunCon controller in order to function properly, it is only compatible with both the first and second generation of the peripheral. Reviews were mixed, who considered the game inferior to its contemparies like Time Crisis and House of the Dead, although the interactive environments received some praise.\nGameplay\nThe game is a first-person on-rails shooter using Namco's GunCon light gun controller, in the vein of the Time Crisis series. The player interacts by aiming directly the physical light gun on part of the screen where enemies appear. Like the aforementioned series, the game includes a reload and cover system, which allows the player to avoid enemy fire by ducking behind objects. There are twenty different stages with seven bosses. Between levels there are cutscenes that play. With every level there is a set time limit and if the player is too reckless in their shooting, the game will spawn more enemies in, resulting in the player entering a special mode called, \"Hypermode\", in this mode the player receives an increasingly amount of health regeneration. The enemies will use cover and hide behind bulletproof shields and non-combative non-player characters are intermingled with enemies.\nUnlike its arcade contemporaries it includes destructible environments and a separate mini-game called Mighty Joe Jupiter, that is divorced from the main campaign and is meant for practice. Additional the game offers challenges for the player to complete, alongside  it will track your highscore and offer unlocks. Contrasting to the more realistic levels of the main campaign, these game modes take places on more sci-fi environments like the moon and other planets battling cartoon Martians and other aliens. Upon completion of the main campaign the game unlocks additional difficulty levels, ability to replay levels, three new gun options, a \"mirror mode\" and an option the play whole game in hypermode. Endgame uses a rudimentary positional audio system, the sound will come from the direction the player shoots at.\nSynopsis\nSet on a near future Earth in 2020, in the game you take control of the player character named Jade Cornell, who ends up uncovering a plot by the EuroDream Corporation who wants to use their latest virtual reality technology, called VirtualWorldTomorrow, to control the minds of the general populace. Besides stopping EuroDream, Cornell is also charged with rescueing her friend Tyler, the person who informed her of the plot and who was kidnapped in the opening scene of the game by a EuroDream security team.\nDevelopment and release\nEndgame was developed by British game developer Cunning Developments, who were primarily known for their Pro Pinball series of games. The game was published by Empire Interactive, and distributed by Vivendi Universal in North America and in Australia.\nReception\nEndgame received \"mixed\" reviews, with a 57/100 on review aggregator Metacritic and a 61.08% on GameRankings. Ryan Davis of GameSpot called the game \"very cut-and-dried light-gun game\", that failed to make a strong impression. He only recommends to game to people who are already fan of the genre, describing the gameplay as a \"Time Crisis clone\" with a paper-thin narrative. Douglass C. Perry of IGN described it as a \"stale and uninteresting\" game, that lifts almost all of its ideas from Time Crisis, only to create a worse version of it. His only positives were the graphical effects and the numerous breakable objects in the environment.\nOn the more positive side the reviewer of the Australian website ImpulseGamer, considered a must-own light-gun game for the PlayStation 2. Praising the animations and called the timer feature \"a nail-biter\" that will keep you on the edge of your seat. He also noted that the calibrating of the G-Con2 was straightforward, except for the part device should be plugged in the second USB-slot to avoid problems.\n",

    "\nThe 2024\u201325 UEFA Women's Champions League qualifying rounds will begin on 4 September and end on 26 September 2024.\nA total of 68 teams compete in the group stage qualifying rounds of the 2024\u201325 UEFA Women's Champions League, which includes two rounds, with 46 teams in the Champions Path and 22 teams in the League Path. The 14 winners in the round 2 (nine from Champions Path, five from League Path) advance to the group stage, to join the four teams that entered in that round.\nTimes are CEST (UTC+2), as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nTeams\nChampions Path\nThe Champions Path includes all league champions which do not qualified directly for the group stage, and consists of the following rounds:\nRound 1 (43 teams playing one-legged semi-finals, final and third place match): 43 teams enter in this round.\nRound 2 (14 teams): three teams enter in this round and eleven winners of the round 1 finals.\nBelow are the participating teams of the Champions Path (with their 2024 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by the starting rounds.\nLeague Path\nThe League Path includes all league non-champions and consisted of the following rounds:\nRound 1 (16 teams playing one-legged semi-finals, final and third place match): 16 teams enter in this round.\nRound 2 (10 teams): six teams enter in this round and four winners of the round 1 finals.\nBelow are the participating teams of the League Path (with their 2022 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by the starting rounds.\nFormat\nRound 1 consists of mini-tournaments with two semi-finals, a final and a third-place play-off hosted by one of the participating teams. If the score is level at the end of normal time, extra time will be played, and if the same number of goals is scored by both teams during extra time, the tie will be decided by a penalty shoot-out. Round 2 will be played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advance to the next round. If the aggregate score is level at the end of normal time of the second leg, extra time will be played, and if the same number of goals is scored by both teams at the end of normal time, the tie will be decided by a penalty shoot-out. An additional preliminary round consisting of two-legged home-and-away matches would have been played by the champions from the lowest-ranked associations if more than 50 associations had entered the tournament and the title holders had not qualified through league position. Since only 50 associations entered, this round was skipped.\nIn the draws for each round, teams were seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots containing the same number of teams. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition. Teams from associations with political conflicts as decided by UEFA were not drawn into the same tie.

    "Artillery battery of the Confederate States Army\nMilitary unit\nClark's Missouri Battery (also known as the 2nd Missouri Light Battery and later known as King's Battery and then the Farris' Battery) was an artillery battery that served in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.\nEarly history\nMissouri State Guard\nThe battery was first formed as a unit of the Missouri State Guard in late 1861. In Lexington, Missouri, Samuel Churchill Clark enrolled into the State Guard as a private and was appointed to the 8th Division of the MSG under James S. Rains. Soon, the State Guard artilleryman was leading an iron 6-pounder gun with a dedicated crew. The artillery battery served in the Trans-Mississippi Theater where it had provided artillery support for Gen. Sterling Price's army at the battles of Wilson's Creek and Lexington.\nFirst Battle of Lexington\nAmid the First Battle of Lexington on September 18, 1861, Clark commanded three six-pound artillery pieces and their cannoneers. Clark's Battery, along with Bledsoe's Missouri Battery and Guibor's Battery kept the position of Colonel James A. Mulligan's Union forces under artillery fire.\nClark's Battery\nOn October 23, 1861, Samuel C. Clark was officially appointed captain of the 1st Battery of Artillery in the 4th Division of the Missouri State Guard under Gen. William Y. Slack.\nConfederate States Army\nIn Springfield, Missouri, Gen. Price reorganized the battery for Confederate service as the 2nd Missouri Light Artillery Battery on January 16, 1862. Captain Clark's battery was assigned to the First Missouri Confederate Brigade commanded by Col. Henry Little under Price's division. Clark's battery and Wade's Missouri Battery accompanied Col. Little and his brigade as the army's rearguard. Armed with four field pieces in total, the battery fielded two 6-pounder field guns and two 12-pounder howizters.\nBattle of Dunagin's Farm\nFighting in Arkansas's first Civil War engagement, Clark's Missouri Battery took part in the Battle of Dunagin's Farm, south of Little Sugar Creek. Gen. Sterling Price assigned the artillery battery to Col. Louis H\u00e9bert's infantry brigade in Gen. Benjamin McCulloch's division, which was acting as the rearguard for his army retreating from Springfield, Missouri. On February 17, 1862, near Flat Creek, the artillerymen of Clark's 2nd Missouri Light Battery along with Col. Elijah Gates' 1st Missouri Cavalry encountered the 1st Missouri Cavalry Regiment of Col. Calvin A. Ellis under Brig. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis. The artillery battery opened the engagement with a bombardment down Telegraph Road, leading to a skirmish between the Missouri cannoneers and the 3rd Iowa Independent Battery Light Artillery. Col. H\u00e9bert would shortly withdraw south to Cross Hollow with the rest of Price's Confederate army.\nBattle of Pea Ridge\nOn March 2, 1862, Gen. Price combined his forces with those of Gen. McCulloch and Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn to form Van Dorn's Army of the West. Van Dorn's Confederate forces moved towards the Union Army of the Southwest at Pea Ridge, Arkansas. Engaging in the Battle of Pea Ridge from March 7 to March 8, Samuel Clark led the 2nd Battery of Artillery with Lt. James L. Farris and four 6-pounder guns. On the first day at Pea Ridge, the 2nd Missouri Light battery, along with Wade's Missouri Battery, Guibor's Battery, and the 3rd Missouri Light Battery participated in an artillery duel with the 3rd Iowa Independent Battery Light Artillery. The batteries formed a wall of artillery fire on the Dubuque Battery for the First Missouri Brigade. On the next day, Cpt. Clark was among the State Guard and Confederate forces killed in action. Amid the end of the battle, Union troops then pressed a counterattack, forcing Clark's battery, as well as the rest of Price's division, to retreat. The captain was fatally struck by a Union cannonball while preparing to limber his last piece of artillery under orders to retire.\nKing's Battery\nAfter Cpt. Clark's death at Elkhorn Tavern, Captains William Clark Kennerly, Houston King, and James L. Farris commanded the battery. On March 17, 1862, the 1st Division of Gen. Price's Army of the West was reorganized, temporarily assigning Clark's battery to the Third Missouri Brigade under Brig. Gen. Alexander E. Steen.\nThe battery, in April 1862, accompanied the Army of the West across the Mississippi River to Memphis, Tennessee. While in Memphis, First Lieutenant Houston King was elected captain on April 26, 1862, and the battery was afterwards known as \"King's Battery\". In May, the Army of the West was transferred to Corinth, Mississippi on the state line with Tennessee where the battery mostly served on outpost duty. With Cpt. Houston King assuming command of the battery, he led it through the various campaigns in areas east of the river, including Corinth and Iuka. King's battery engaged with Union forces at the Battle of Iuka on September 19, 1862.\nBattle of Corinth\nOn September 28, Van Dorn's Army of Wes",
    "Classicist (1931-2019)\nWilliam Sims Thurman (March 17, 1931\u2013March 9, 2019) was a classicist whose major contribution to scholarship is his English translation of Justinian's Thirteen Edicts (The Thirteen Edicts of Justinian; Translated and Annotated by William Sims). Thurman was born in Paris, but he lived much of his life in Asheville, North Carolina where he taught at the University of North Carolina at Asheville.\nThurman earned Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a student of noted classicist and translator Clyde Pharr. Pharr focused on Roman law towards the end of his career and is best known for his translation of the Theodosian Code, but he also began an English translation of the Code of Justinian that he never completed. Thurman's thesis and dissertation were related to Pharr's work on Justinian in that the Thirteen Edicts are later Justinian laws attached to Justinian's Novellae Constitutiones.\nAfter obtaining his Ph.D., Thurman held positions at Winthrop University and at Harvard University's Center for Byzantine Studies. From Harvard, Thurman went to the University of North Carolina at Asheville where he began its classics program.

    "\nThe historiography of Australia refers to the publications produced by historians of Australia, and the sources, critical methods, topics and interpretations they have used and examined. Many 19th century histories were written by prominent settlers or commissioned by colonial governments intent on influencing British policy in the colony or promoting British investment and immigration. Professional academic history began in the 1890s, dominated by \"imperial\" interpretations in which Australia was seen as an example of a flourishing British society in a new land.\n20th century historiography up to the 1960s was dominated by competing imperial and nationalist interpretations. Nationalist historians emphasised an independent Australian identity forged in war, and a democratic ethos dating back to the goldfields of the 1850s. From the 1960s, these schools were challenged by historians using a variety of approaches including Marxist analysis of the Australian labour movement, geopolitical analysis of factors such as Australia's physical size and distance from Europe and America, and the role of luck and chance in shaping Australian society. From the 1970s, histories of marginalised groups such as Indigenous Australians, women, migrants and those with minority sexualities became more prominent.\nAt the turn of the 21st century, a series of public controversies dubbed \"the history wars\" sparked heated political and media debate over whether a \"black armband\" historical orthodoxy was overemphasising the importance of racism, violence, inequality and environmental degradation in Australia's history. Meanwhile, historical practice was becoming more diversified and less centred in universities, with the flourishing of oral histories, local histories, family histories, interdisciplinary studies and transnational approaches which analyse Australian history in a global and regional context.\n19th century and imperial histories\nAccording to Stuart MacIntyre, the first Australian histories, such as those by William Wentworth and James Macarthur, were polemical works written to influence public opinion and British government policy in the colony. After the Australian colonies became self-governing in the 1850s, colonial governments commissioned histories aimed at promoting migration and investment from Britain. The beginning of professional academic history in Australian universities from 1891 saw the dominance of an Imperial framework for interpreting Australian history, in which Australia emerged from the successful transfer of people, institutions, and culture from Britain. The apogee of the imperial school of Australian history was the Australian volume of the Cambridge History of the British Empire published in 1933.\n20th century\nMilitary history received government support after the First World War, most prominently with Charles Bean's 12 volume History of Australia in the War of 1914\u20131918 (1921\u201342). Bean's earlier work as Australia's official war correspondent had helped establish the Anzac legend which, according to McKenna: \"immediately supplanted all other narratives of nationhood \u2013 the march of the explorers, the advance of settlement, Eureka, Federation and Australia's record of progressive democratic legislation.\"\nRadical nationalist interpretations of Australian history became more prominent from the 1930s. Brian Fitzpatrick published a series of histories from 1939 to 1941 which sought to demonstrate the exploitative nature of Britain's economic relationship with Australia and the role of the labour movement in a struggle for social justice and economic independence. One of the most influential works of the radical nationalist trend was Russel Ward's The Australian Legend (1958) which sought to trace the origins of a distinctive democratic national ethos from the experiences of the convicts, bushrangers, gold-diggers, drovers and shearers. In the 1960s Marxist historians such as Bob Gollan and Ian Turner explored the relationship of the labour movement to radical nationalist politics.\nThe rapid expansion of university history departments in the 1950s and 1960s saw an increasing diversity of interpretations and specialisations in Australian history. A number of academic historians still worked within the imperial history tradition, while others explored the contribution of liberal, conservative and other traditions to Australia's distinctive political, cultural and economic development. In the first two volumes of his History of Australia (1962, 1968) Manning Clark developed an idiosyncratic interpretation of Australian history telling the story of \"epic tragedy\" in which \"the explorers, Governors, improvers, and perturbators vainly endeavoured to impose their received schemes of redemption on an alien, intractable setting\". According to MacIntyre, Clark  \"had few imitators and the successive volumes had a much greater impact on the public than the profession.\" The 1964 book The Lucky Country by Donald Horne wa",
    "\nFahad Ag Almahmoud is an Imghad Tuareg militant who served as the secretary-general of GATIA from its formation in 2014 until 2023, when he split from the group and formed his own faction of GATIA.\nBiography\nAlmahmoud first began serving in GATIA at the start of the group's foundation in 2014, where he became the secretary-general of the group. Almahmoud is an Imghad Tuareg, the Tuareg clan that predominantly composes GATIA. He often served as the spokesperson for the group as well, conducting numerous interviews with Malian and international media.  In 2019, Almahmoud stated hat he believed that the Algiers Agreement did not resolve insecurity in northern Mali, and that there was no governance coming from the Malian government. Almahmoud also stated he doesn't believe in Azawadian independence.\nBetween March and August 2022, Almahmoud served as the president of the CSP-PSD, a coalition composed of pro-government and former rebel minority militant groups. His predecessor was Coordination of Azawad Movements (CMA) founder and leader Bilal Ag Acherif, making Almahmoud's election as president a major reconciliation between GATIA and the CMA.\nIn July 2023, as tensions escalated between the CSP-PSD and the Malian junta over the latter's growing violations of the Algiers Agreement, Almahmoud was kicked out of the Platform coalition which GATIA is a part of due to his criticism of the Malian government. Almahmoud was also fired from his role as secretary-general of GATIA, and Youssef Ag Mohamed was appointed as his successor. Almahmoud stated that he had been fired unjustly for his criticisms, and that GATIA commander El Hadj Ag Gamou and Malian Minister of National Reconciliation Isma\u00ebl Wagu\u00e9 had planned his firing.\nWhen these tensions escalated into a war between the Malian government and CSP-PSD in September, Almahmoud created his own faction of the group. This faction was recognized as the legitimate faction of GATIA by other members of the CSP-PSD. In December 2023, Almahmoud and other leaders of the CSP were supported by Algeria in holding up the Algiers Accords. In March 2024, Almahmoud was declared a terrorist by the Malian junta along with other members of the CSP-PSD.\n",

    "Spring and Autumn period bronze arrows\nThe military of the Zhou dynasty were the forces fighting under the Zhou dynasty (Chinese: \u5468\u671d; pinyin: Zh\u014du ch\u00e1o), a royal dynasty of China ruling from c.\u20091046 BC until 256 BC. Under the Zhou, these armies were able to expand China's territory and influence to all of the North China plain. Equipped with bronze weapons, bows, and armor, these armies won victories against the sedentary Dongyi to the East and South, which were the main direction of expansion, as well as defending the western border against the nomadic incursions of the Xirong. However, after the collapse of the Zhou dynasty in 771 BC when the Xirong captured its capital Haojing, China collapsed into a plethora of small states, who warred frequently with each other. The competition between these states would eventually produce the professional armies that marked the Imperial Era of China.\nWarrior class\nWestern Zhou Period bronze armour decoration\nSee also: Four occupations, Chariots in ancient China, and Chinese archery\nDuring the Western Zhou and early Eastern Zhou eras, warfare was seen as an aristocratic affair, complete with protocols that may be compared to the chivalry of the European knight. The shi knights had a strict code of chivalry. States would not attack other states while mourning its ruler. Ruling houses would not be completely exterminated so descendants would be left to honor their ancestors. Examples of this code include the battle of Zheqiu, 420 BC, in which the shi Hua Bao shot at and missed another shi Gongzi Cheng, and just as he was about to shoot again, Gongzi Cheng said that it was unchivalrous to shoot twice without allowing him to return a shot. Hua Bao lowered his bow and was subsequently shot dead, or in 624 BC when a disgraced shi from the State of Jin led a suicidal charge of chariots to redeem his reputation, turning the tide of the battle. In the Battle of Bi, 597 BC, the routing chariot forces of Jin were bogged down in mud, but pursuing enemy troops stopped to help them get dislodged and allowed them to escape. During the Spring and Autumn period (771\u2013479 BC), Duke Xiang of Song, when being advised to attack enemy Chu forces while the enemy army was fording a river, refused and waited for the Chu army to form formation. After Xiang lost the battle and was being rebuked by his ministers of war, he responded: \"The gentleman does not inflict a second wound, nor does he capture those with gray hair. On campaigns, the ancients did not obstruct those in a narrow pass. Even though I am but the remnant of a destroyed state, I will not drum an attack when the other side has not yet drawn up its ranks.\" His minister retorted, \"My lord does not know battle. If the mighty enemy is in a defile or with his ranks not drawn up, this is Heaven assisting us\", signifying that by the Spring and Autumn period such attitudes on chivalric honor was dying out.\nAll residents of the guo (a state's capital area) were members of the military aristocracy of shi or artisans; no farmers resided in the capital area. Instead, farmers lived in the surrounding countryside (\u9119). Only the best among the farmers would be chosen to serve in the military by being selected for promotion to the warrior class.\nWestern Zhou\nZhou bronze helmet, 8th century BC\nEarly Chinese armies were relatively small affairs. Composed of peasant levies, usually serfs dependent upon the king or the feudal lord of their home state, these armies were relatively ill-equipped. While organized military forces existed along with the state, few records remain of these early armies. These armies were centered around the chariot-riding nobility, who played a role akin to the European knight as they were the main fighting force of the army. Bronze weapons such as spears and swords were the main equipment of both the infantry and charioteers. Initially, these armies were ill-trained and haphazardly supplied, meaning that they could not campaign for more than a few months and often had to give up their gains due to lack of supplies.\nWhile chariots had been used in battle previously, only in the Western Zhou era were they used in large numbers. The Zhou conquest of the Shang may have been linked to their use of the chariot. Under the Shang, chariots were extremely ornate, used by high ranking elite as command and archery platforms, but under the Zhou chariots were simpler and more common. The ratio of chariots to foot soldiers under the Shang is estimated to be 1 to 30, while under the Zhou it is estimated to be 1 to 10. However this was still limited as compared to the 1 to 5 in Ancient Egypt.\nThe royal army of the Western Zhou consisted of two divisions, the Six Armies of the West (\u897f\u516d\u5e2b), based in the Zhou capital in the Wei River valley, and the Eight armies of Chengzhou (\u6210\u5468\u516b\u5e2b) based in the eastern capital Chengzhou. One special unit mentioned in inscriptions is the wanghang (\u738b\u884c) which may be a force under the King's direct command when person",

    "Peruvian serial killer\nMail Malpartida Ach\u00f3n (born 1974), known as The Cutthroat of Oxapampa (Spanish: El Degollador de Oxapampa), is a Peruvian serial killer, kidnapper and ex-MRTA terrorist who murdered at least ten people in the Oxapampa area from 2006 to 2007, sometimes with accomplices. Convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for his confirmed crimes, Malpartida later confessed responsibility for a total of twenty one murders, which has thus far not been proven.\nEarly life\nLittle is known about Malpartida's early life. Born in 1974, he joined the MRTA sometimes in the 1990s, receiving military and firearms training in order to carry out actions against the government. After the organization was disbanded, Malpartida escaped into the jungles surrounding Oxapampa to avoid arrest.\nMurders\nIn June 2006, Malpartida murdered 23-year-old mining businessman Lenin Francisco Balerio Alc\u00e1ntara by shooting him in the back and then robbing him of 280 grams of gold he had obtained from a gold mine in Hu\u00e1nuco. After the murder, he extracted the man's organs so that the corpse could weigh less, and then forced the victim's cousin to throw the body into the river. He was quickly caught by the police and imprisoned in the local prison in Oxapampa. On December 16, Malpartida, together with Isa\u00edas \u00c1ngeles Tambino and Marcelino Tolentino Guerra, killed the non-commissioned PNP officer Humberto V\u00e1squez P\u00e9rez and inmate Guzm\u00e1n Canerioqui Porras, after which they fled prison. Before doing so, the trio stole two AKM rifles, three pistols, a grenade and a commando-style uniform, injuring another non-commissioned officer, Crist\u00f3bal Choque Flores, in the process.\nAfter escaping from prison, Malpartida kidnapped businessman Roberto Shuller Shaus and his daughter, demanding 50,000 dollars in exchange for their release, which he did after he was paid 10,000 soles. On October 18, 2007, Malpartida kidnapped 55-year-old farmer Liboria Rivera Carhuaricra and demanded a large sum of money for her release, but instead slit her throat after noticing that officers were hiding in the area. Before fleeing, he cut out her tongue so \"her soul would not give him away\". It was alleged that in the time period after his escape from prison, he was involved in the murders of at least seven people and the extortion of more than ten cattle ranchers, with him apparently cutting up his victims with knives for pleasure.\nOn December 27, Malpartida, aided by his brother En\u00edas, kidnapped 45-year-old timber businesswoman Griselda Curi Huayta and demanded a payment of $20,000. The first part of the payment was made, and Curi was released. The second part of the payment was agreed to be delivered in Cueva Blanca in the Jun\u00edn Department. However, before he could receive it, he was cornered by police and caught as part of \"Operation Hunt 2008\". After a nine-hour chase, Malpartida was captured and found in possession of a grenade, portable radios, binoculars, ski masks and military clothing.\nTrial and sentence\nIn 2009, Malpartida was convicted on multiple counts of murder, extortion, kidnapping and possession of illegal weaponry, for which he and Tolentino were sentenced to life imprisonment. During the trial, he claimed to the judge that he was involved in twenty one murders in total. In September of that year, Malpartida was involved in the deposit of a sum of 369 soles in the account of Norma Beatriz Bustamante Yauri, then staff at the Huancayo Prison, by some alleged relatives, an action that led to disciplinary repercussions against Bustamante.\nSee also\nList of serial killers by country\n",
    "Church in Suffolk, United Kingdom\nSt Peter's Church is the parish church of Theberton in Suffolk, England, and in the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich. It is a round-tower church, and parts of the building date from the 12th century. The building is Grade I listed.\nDescription\nThe north doorway\nThere is a nave and chancel, over which there is a continuous thatched roof, and a south aisle. The nave and the round tower are of the 12th century, with 15th-century windows. The chancel, originally of the 12th century, with a surviving stone corbel table below the eaves, was extended eastward about 1300.\nThe octagonal upper section of the tower dates from about 1300, with a crenellated parapet of the 15th century, around the base of which are four projecting gargoyles that throw rainwater clear of the walls. The 12th-century north door, now within the 19th-century vestry, has a chevroned arch in two orders, and two orders of colonettes. The south porch, with flushwork decoration, was built about 1470.\nThe pulpit and octagonal font are of the 15th century; the font has alternating lions and angels around the bowl, and alternationg lions and wodewoses around the stem.\nThe south aisle was added in the 15th century, and was rebuilt in the 1840s by the Doughty family of Theberton Hall. In the south aisle there is a memorial to Frederica Doughty (died 1843), and a memorial to the writer and explorer Charles Montagu Doughty.\n\nThe link with Adelaide\nThere are display cases illustrating the link with Adelaide in Australia. William Light, who surveyed the site for the city in 1836, was educated in Theberton by his father's friend Charles Doughty; Thebarton, a suburb of Adelaide, was originally (as Theberton) the name he gave to his house there.\nAirship\nA glass case in the porch contains part of the structure of German Zeppelin airship L48. 16 crew members died when the airship was shot down near the village by the Royal Flying Corps on 17 June 1917. The dead were buried in the graveyard extension, and were moved sixty years later to Cannock Chase German Military Cemetery. A memorial service was held at the church on 18 June 2017.\n",

    "\nCentrism is a political ideology associated with moderate politics placed between left-wing politics and right-wing politics on the left\u2013right political spectrum. Various centrist movements have developed in different countries, based on the specific country's political environment.\nAustralia\nThere have been centrists on both sides of politics who serve alongside the various factions within the Liberal and Labor parties. Centrism is represented by the moderates in the Liberal Party and Labor Right in the Labor Party.\nThe Australian Democrats are the most prominent centrist party in Australian history. The party had representation in the Senate from 1977 to 2007, frequently holding the balance of power. Formed by Don Chipp on a promise to \"Keep the Bastards Honest\", it was known to have represented the \"middle ground\". The party regained registration in 2019.\nIn addition, many smaller groups have formed in response to the bipartisan system that upholds centrist ideals. South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon launched his centrist political party called the Nick Xenophon Team (NXT) in 2014, which was renamed the Centre Alliance in 2018.\nBangladesh\nIn Bangladeshi politics, the term \"centre\" (as well as centre-left) is often labelled with Bengali nationalism and secularism, in contrast to the right wing, which is labelled with Bangladeshi nationalism and Islamism. The Awami League is the oldest existing centrist political party in Bangladesh. It was originally founded as a centre-left party but moved towards centrism in the late 1970s.\nOther centrist political parties in Bangladesh include the Nationalist Democratic Movement, the Liberal Democratic Party, and Bikalpa Dhara Bangladesh.\nBelgium\nThe traditional centrist party of Flanders was the People's Union, which embraced social liberalism and aimed to represent Dutch-speaking Belgians who felt culturally suppressed by Francophones. The New Flemish Alliance is the largest and, since 2009, the only extant successor of that party. It is, however, primarily composed of the right wing of the former People's Union and has adopted a more liberal-conservative ideology in recent years.\nAmong French-speaking Belgians, the Humanist Democratic Centre is a centre party as it is considerably less conservative than its Flemish counterpart, Christian Democratic and Flemish.\nOther parties in the centre of the political spectrum are the liberal Reformist Movement and the French-speaking minority party D\u00e9FI.\nBrazil\nThere are several centrist parties in Brazil, such as the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), a catch-all party and one of the largest political parties in Brazil.\nThe Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) is another example of a centrist party in Brazilian politics.\nOther centrist parties include the Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 2011) (PSD), the Green Party (Brazil) (PV), Citizenship (Brazil) (CID), and the Republican Party of the Social Order (PROS).\nDue to the high number of centre parties in Brazil, they exert a major position in local politics, and due to that, parties that are not part of major parties of the right-wing or the left-wing are pejoratively called Centr\u00e3o (meaning 'big centre').\nCanada\nFurther information: Politics of Canada \u00a7\u00a0Political culture\nThroughout modern history, Canadian governments at the federal level have governed from a moderate, centrist political position, practicing \"brokerage politics\". Both the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors) rely on attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters. The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the Canadian political scale, being more moderate and centrist than the centre-right Conservative. In the late 1970s, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party of Canada adhered to the \"radical centre\". Far-left and far-right politics have never been prominent forces in Canadian society.\nCroatia\nThe Croatian People's Party \u2013 Liberal Democrats and the People's Party \u2013 Reformists may be considered centrist parties. The agrarian Croatian Peasant Party became moderate and centrist during its last years, having been centre-right in the past.\nCzech Republic\nThe Czech Republic has many prominent centrist parties, including the syncretic populist movement ANO 2011, the civil libertarian Czech Pirate Party, the long-standing Christian and Democratic Union \u2013 Czechoslovak People's Party, and the localist party Mayors and Independents.\nEstonia\nMain article: Centrism in Estonia\nFrance\nMain article: Centrism in France\nFrance has a tradition of parties that call themselves \"centriste\", though the actual parties vary over time. When a new political issue emerges and a new political party breaks into the mainstream, the old centre-left party may be de facto pushed rightwards, but unable to consider itself a party of the right, it will embrace being the new centre.

    "Short story by Jack Finney\n\"Contents of the Dead Man's Pocket\" is a short story by the American writer Jack Finney, first published in 1956. \nPlot summary\n\"Contents of the Dead Man's Pocket\" takes place on a narrow ledge eleven storeys above Lexington Avenue.\nTom Benecke is an ambitious young advertiser working for Wholesale Groceries who lives with his wife Clare in an eleventh-floor apartment above Lexington Avenue in New York City. One autumn night, Tom declines an invitation from Clare to accompany her to the cinema, opting instead to work on a side project that he believes will help mark him out for a promotion. As his wife leaves, a breeze blows a sheet of paper containing weeks of Tom's research out of the window and onto the corner of the ornamental ledge below the window. Tom rashly decides to climb out of the window and edge 15 feet (4.57 metres) along the ledge - which is as wide as his shoe length - to retrieve the sheet of paper.\nAvoiding looking down, Tom makes it to the sheet of paper without issue, but when bending over to pick it up he glimpses the ground far below and panics. After nearly falling, he is paralyzed with fear. He eventually regains his composure and makes his way back to the window, but accidentally knocks it shut, trapping him on the ledge. Realizing that he will fall long before his wife returns home, Tom unsuccessfully attempts to summon help by dropping letters which he sets on fire and coins. Tom imagines people being unable to identify his body, or make any sense of the shorthand text on the sheet of paper in his pocket, and experiences regret about working over spending time with his wife, reflecting on his \"wasted life\".\nTom eventually resolves to attempt to punch through the window, knowing that if the blow rebounds he will undoubtedly fall backwards to his death. The blow succeeds, and he falls to safety into the room. Tom deposits the sheet of paper on a table and leaves the apartment to catch up with his wife. As he leaves the apartment, another breeze blows the sheet of paper out of the window once more. Having had his perspective changed by the experience, Tom merely laughs and pays it no heed.\nPublication\n\"Contents of the Dead Man's Pocket\" was initially published in Good Housekeeping in June 1956 and in Collier's in October 1956. In 1957, it was collected in Finney's book The Third Level. It has since been widely anthologized.\nReception\nThe publisher Gale described \"Contents of the Dead Man's Pocket\" as \"one of Finney's best\". Jack Seabrook described it as an \"outstanding suspense tale\". David Murdock interpreted the story as \"a warning about maintaining what we call today a good 'work-life balance'.\" Writing for CinemaBlend, Jason Wiese described the story as \"an intense, thought-provoking parable about reevaluating life's priorities that  would work great as an episode of an anthology TV show like Black Mirror or Cabinet of Curiosities\".\n\"Contents of the Dead Man's Pocket\" is \"much taught at the secondary school level.\"\nStephen King's 1976 short story \"The Ledge\" is a homage to \"Contents of the Dead Man's Pocket\".\nSee also\n\"The Ledge\"\n",
    "\nEilat Naval Base is a major Israeli naval base situated in the Israeli coastal city of Eilat. It was established in 1949 and serves to be the sole Israeli Navy Base on the coast of Red Sea.\nRoles\nThe main task of the base in Eilat is to maintain the security and peace of Eilat. The main activity in the city of Eilat is based on recreation and tourism, which include, among other things, about two hundred vessels moving in a relatively small maritime region.\nIn the past this area was a meeting area between four conflicting countries: Israel, Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia. However, today all the 4 countries are at peace.\nAt the base operates the Patrol Squadron  915, which operates  the Dvora-class fast patrol boats and Super Dvora Mk III-class patrol boats\nHistory\nEstablishment\nThe base was established in 1949 after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war to serve as a naval base at the point of junction with three hostile states.\nSix Day War\nDuring the Six Day War, the base played a vital role in the capture and occupation of Sharm El Sheikh.On 7 June, Israel began its attack on Sharm el-Sheikh. The Israeli Navy started the operation with a probe of Egyptian naval defences. An aerial reconnaissance flight found that the area was less defended than originally thought. At about 4:30\u00a0am, three Israeli missile boats opened fire on Egyptian shore batteries, while paratroopers and commandos boarded helicopters and Nord Noratlas transport planes for an assault on Al-Tur, as Chief of Staff Rabin was convinced it was too risky to land them directly in Sharm el-Sheikh. However, the city had been largely abandoned the day before, and reports from air and naval forces finally convinced Rabin to divert the aircraft to Sharm el-Sheikh. There, the Israelis engaged in a pitched battle with the Egyptians and took the city, killing 20 Egyptian soldiers and taking eight more prisoners. At 12:15\u00a0pm, Defense Minister Dayan announced that the Straits of Tiran constituted an international waterway open to all ships without restriction. The entire operation was carried out from this base.\nAmmunition Truck Disaster\nOn January 24, 1970, at the Eilat base, a truck loaded with ammunition exploded . As a result of the explosion, 24 people were killed, 17 of them on the spot, and seven died of their wounds in the days after the explosion, and dozens were injured.\nGaesh Rescue mission\nIn 1981, the shipyard repaired the hull of INS Geash, after the unwanted beaching on the Saudi Arabian coast. The activity included salvage and flooding from the Saudi coast, towing to the Eilat Naval Base, shipping and repair to an operational condition.\nEvacuation plans\nFrom the late 1990s, discussions began on the evacuation of the naval base in Eilat, in favor of the establishment of tourist projects and the further development of the Eilat beach strip towards the south. However, the realization of the project did not come to fruition for many years. In 1996, the Ministry of Defense and the Navy Headquarters decided to close the Navy shipyard in Eilat. In the area of the shipyard, planning has begun for the establishment of tourist projects. But in May 1997, the Minister of Defense, Yitzhak Mordechai , decided not to close the base.\nAt the end of 2002, a plan was drafted according to which the Ports Authority will manage a project that includes the expansion of the Eilat port and the relocation of the Eilat base into it. In March 2003, the IDF, the Ports Authority and the Eilat Municipality agreed that the Navy base would be moved to Eilat Port and the area would be available for development. But the project did not go ahead, due to a dispute over the financing of the plan.\nOperation Full Disclosure\nOperation Full Disclosure was a military operation carried out by the Israel Defense Forces on March 5, 2014, in the Red Sea. After days of surveillance far out to sea, Israeli Navy Shayetet 13 commandos seized the Iranian-owned and Panamanian-registered merchant vessel Klos C that had set sail from Iran, heading for Port Sudan via Iraq.  On board, the commandos found long-range missiles suspected to be destined for the Gaza Strip concealed in containers full of Iranian bags marked as Portland cement. The operation was carried out from this base.\nRed Sea crisis\nThe Red Sea crisis began on 17 October 2023. On 27 October 2023 two loitering munitions were fired in a northerly direction from the southern Red Sea. According to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officials, their target was Israel, but they did not cross the border from Egypt. Of the two drones, one fell short and hit a building adjacent to a hospital in Taba, Egypt, injuring six; the other was shot down near an electricity plant close to the town of Nuweiba, Egypt. A Houthi official later made a one-word post on Twitter after the drone crashed in Taba, mentioning Eilat.\nOn 31 October an alert was triggered in Eilat, Eilot kibbutz and the Shahorit industrial park area regarding the penetration of hostile aircraft fro",
    "British barrister\nRichard Simon Hermer KC (born September 1968) is a British barrister who has served as Attorney General for England and Wales and Advocate General for Northern Ireland since July 2024. He is due to be conferred a life peerage.\nEarly life and education\nHermer was born and raised in Wales, and attended Cardiff High School. He is from a \"blue-box\" Jewish family. He studied politics and modern history at the University of Manchester. He is a former sabbatical officer of the Union of Jewish Students.\nCareer\nHermer was called to the bar in October 1993, and was appointed Queen's Counsel (QC) in 2009. He joined Doughty Street Chambers in 1993, three years after it was set up, where he got to know founding member Keir Starmer, who later gave the toast at Hermer's silk ceremony in 2009. Hermer later moved to work for Matrix Chambers.\nIn November 2019, Hermer was appointed a Deputy High Court Judge following an open competition by the Judicial Appointments Commission.\nAttorney General\nOn 5 July 2024, Hermer was appointed Attorney General under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, succeeding Victoria Prentis. His appointment to the position was reported as a surprise, since Labour MP Emily Thornberry had served in Starmer's shadow cabinet as the Shadow Attorney General. In response to the decision, Thornberry said that Hermer was a \"much more accomplished lawyer\" than she could ever hope to be and that she knew Hermer would do an \"outstanding job\" in the position.\nPositions\nOn Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\nFurther information: Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\nIn May 2023, Hermer was amongst many lawyers who signed a Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights letter addressed to Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, which called on the government to constructively participate in the International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the actions of Israel in occupied Palestinian territory including East Jerusalem.\nIn July 2023, Hermer stated that he believed that the \"continued Israeli occupation of the West bank\" was \"unlawful, deeply damaging to the interests of Israel and wholly contrary to the values of tikkun olam\" which Hermer grew up with and continued to be guided by.\nIn October 2023, Hermer was amongst eight prominent Jewish lawyers, which included former Supreme Court President Lord Neuberger, who signed an open letter to call on Israel to follow international law in its response to the 7 October attacks. Later that month, in an interview with LBC whilst speaking to Sangita Myska, he said that it was \"impossible to conceive\" how Israel's siege was \"in compliance with international law.\" He went onto say that \"for a very long time\" Israel has had \"effective control\" over the borders of Gaza, who he said were reliant on the \"need to have electricity, water and food coming in\"; and that the \"cutting of that off\" was \"very, very difficult to reconcile with obligations of international law\" and described that as a \"deliberate understatement\" from him.\nCases\nBegum v Home Secretary\nFurther information: Begum v Home Secretary\nHermer acted for Liberty, a human rights group that argued the Court of Appeal had correctly decided to allow Shamima Begum to return to the UK, which was an intervenor in Begum v Home Secretary. In written submissions, he said that the deprivation of citizenship was an  \"extremely draconian power\" which could expose Begum to rendition and targeted drone strikes\", stating that the consequences could be \"fatal.\"\nTask-force for Ukraine\nIn March 2022, Hermer was appointed to a legal task-force, alongside other leading international human rights lawyers including Lord Neuberger, by the Government of Ukraine on the accountability for crimes committed in Ukraine to deliver for victims of international crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine.\nBDS bill\nIn July 2023, he acted as an advisor to the Labour Party regarding the proposed Economic Activity of Public Bodies bill. In his opinion which was commissioned by David Lammy and Lisa Nandy, Hermer described Clause 1 of the bill as \"appallingly badly drafted\" and said that the bill would \"stifle free speech at home\", and also said that it would have a \"profoundly detrimental impact\" on the ability of the UK to \"protect and promote humans rights overseas.\" Conservative MP, Simon Clarke, whilst addressing Communities Secretary Michael Gove, pointed out in the House of Commons that Hermer had authored a chapter in the book titled \"Corporate Complicity in Israel's Occupation: Evidence from the London session of the Russell Tribunal on Palestine\", which Clarke said was edited by some \"interesting\" people Clarke feared \"in the most negative sense\", and went on to ask if Hermer was really the \"calibre of individual\" who should have been advising the opposition. In response, Gove said that Hermer had a \"record\" in the area and a \"record of political commitments\" which everyone could see \"clearly predisposes him towards a political and particular ",
    "British political stereotype\nWaitrose woman is a stereotypical voter identified in the United Kingdom ahead of the 2024 general election. It profiles a more upper middle class middle-aged woman living in the Home Counties and working in a white-collar industry, who usually voted Conservative, but is more socially liberal and dislikes culture war politics, and more likely voted Remain in the 2016 European Union referendum. The term is taken from the upmarket Waitrose supermarket chain, where she would most likely shop. Ahead of the 2024 election, Waitrose was the only supermarket chain for which shoppers were more likely to identify with the Conservatives.\nCharacteristics\nThe \"Waitrose woman\" is a female voter in her 40s or 50s living in the Home Counties, typically university-educated, employed in a white-collar job in the City of London and has children attending secondary school. She is relatively well off and prefers low taxes, her reliance on the state is low. She is described as a \"small-c conservative\", likely to have voted Conservative in 2010 and 2015, supporting David Cameron, and for Remain in 2016. While she has normally voted Conservative because of family links or professional background, she has started identifying less with the party after the 2016 referendum, when the Conservatives began employing more populist/culture war politics in an attempt to appeal to pro-Brexit voters in The Midlands and Northern England. She also values national institutions, such as National Trust and the BBC, and her local environment, and is angered by the water companies and the pollution of local rivers and lakes. She has identified with the party even less following the Partygate and in the 2024 election, would more likely switch to Liberal Democrats or the Labour.\nOrigins\nThe term \"Waitrose woman\" seems to have been first coined around June 2022, after the Partygate scandal, when Conservatives lost severely in the local elections to Labour. In the Politico's London Playbook, the \"Waitrose woman\" was mentioned as being targeted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as a \"mythical middle-class female voter who may not have been a fan of Brexit or gone in for Johnson's populist red wall appeal, definitely doesn't look kindly upon Partygate, and might usually vote Tory but is now considering the Lib Dems.\", whose votes would be fundamental to keeping him afloat. In addition, former Conservative MP David Gauke wrote in the New Statesman about the 2022 local election defeats that in the 2019 election, Conservative majorities in the \"traditionally Conservative, prosperous, well-educated, generally Remain voting\" Blue Wall areas in the Southern England were much smaller than in 2015. In addition, he noted just a month before the 2024 election, that the Conservative proposal for a national service might not be popular with the \"Waitrose woman\", who would not want her teenagers subjected to that.\n",

    "Television channel\nTPA1 is the main and generalist channel of Televis\u00e3o P\u00fablica de Angola. Until 2017 it was the only state-owned terrestrial television channel in Angola following the period where TPA 2 was outsourced to Semba Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o and the arrival of private channels TV Zimbo and Palanca TV, both channels that later fell under the sphere of influence of the state.\nHistory\nAs RPA, it conducted its first terrestrial broadcasts on October 18, 1975, in Luanda, a few weeks short of Angola's independence. The station was only picked up by a handful of television sets in the capital. Less than a year after the official launch and the country's independence, the company was nationalized and changed its name to Televis\u00e3o Popular de Angola on June 25, 1976, by the new MPLA government.\nIn 1979, TPA began studying expansion thanks to the efforts of the party's ideologies, starting in Benguela that same year, with relays in the cities of Benguela and Lobito, then in 1981 in Huambo. It was in Huambo that the first regional production center was established. The strategic expansion of the network corresponded to the provinces where UNITA had more presence and the civil war of the time had far more destructive power. TPA's reach was still rather limited, in 1988, the country only had 40,500 television sets.\nTPA aired the Brazilian series S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo in early 1979, but was dropped after just six episodes on air, under accusations that black characters were playing inferior roles. Later that same year, TPA aired its first Brazilian telenovela, Gabriela, two years after its premiere in Portugal. Before and after each episode, an announcer gave a Marxist interpretation of the topics seen. Jorge Amado, author of the book that gave way to the adaptation, opted to remain silent upon his visit to Angola in September that year by invitation of president Agostinho Neto.\nBy 1980, TPA was still broadcasting in black and white, at the time, it was airing O Bem-Amado, but without receiving royalties for the broadcast. The channel broadcast in a precarious manner, from 7pm to 11pm, with foreign (German, Japanese and American) equipment. Cameras were positioned erratically, French and Italian productions, subtitled, were predominant. TPA also attended the MIP fair in Cannes. Aside from telenovelas, from Globo it also acquired Carga Pesada and Plant\u00e3o de Pol\u00edcia, but rejected O Casar\u00e3o and Malu Mulher, due to incompatibilities with the cultural norms of the time in Angola. Brazilian imports were converted by a British company due to different systems employed.\nIn 1982, TPA started producing programming in native languages, the first two being Malanje and N'Dalatando. Currently, the so-called \"national mother tongues\" have a special focus on news, of which there is a dedicated block on the main generalist channel.\nColor television arrived in Angola in 1983.\nRoque Santeiro aired on TPA in 1987 with a sponsorship agreement from Petrobr\u00e1s worth US$250,000.\nIn 1992, TPA expanded to the entire country thanks to satellite connections. On December 13, 1994, TPA set up TVC (Televis\u00e3o Comercial de Angola) to administer advertising slots.\nIn the wake of redemocratization efforts following the Bicesse Agreements of 1991, in September 1997, TPA became a public company and the official name changed to Televis\u00e3o P\u00fablica de Angola, per Decree-Law n\u00ba 66/97 of September 5.\nBy the mid-2000s, 60% of TPA's programming was national. The soap opera Reviravolta, lasting 100 episodes, was recorded by a team consisting almost exclusively of Angolans. Brazilian teams sent their know-how to local professionals.\nOn January 31, 2007, TPA 1 began broadcasting 24 hours a day, a decition that was made for both channels.\n",
    "Public broadcaster of Slovakia\nSlovak Television and Radio (Slovak: Slovensk\u00e1 telev\u00edzia a rozhlas ), in short STVR), is a Slovak de jure public law, national, informational, cultural and educational institution that guarantees public broadcasting in Slovakia. De facto it is a state broadcaster. Its headquarters are located in Bratislava and led by acting General Director Igor Slanina.\nRadio and Television of Slovakia (RTVS) transformed into Slovak Television and Radio (STVR) on 1 July, 2024, however, the new organisation will keep RTVS logo and visual layout for a few months.\nHistory\nSTVR TV's headquarters in BratislavaSlovak Radio Building, STVR radio's headquarters in Bratislava\nThe fourth government of Robert Fico in its Government Program Statement approved the division of RTVS back into Slovak Television and Slovak Radio At the end of December 2023, Andrej Danko said that the Government of the Slovak Republic had finally decided to split RTVS into separate public television and radio and informed about the law in preparation, which was expected to be presented in February 2024. In February, Culture Minister Martina \u0160imkovi\u010dov\u00e1 called for the cancellation of the RTVS bill for March due to ongoing events in the National Council of the Slovak Republic.\nFirst draft amendment (STaR)\nOn 11 March 2024, the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic presented a proposal to amend the RTVS, which it included in the interdepartmental comment procedure. According to him, RTVS was supposed to replace Slovak Television and Radio (STaR). The amendment was supposed to change the functioning of the supervisory board, which today has nine members elected by members of parliament with a simple majority, reducing its number to seven members. Three of them were to be appointed and fired directly by the Minister of Culture and one on the proposal of the Minister of Finance. The STaR Council should have had the power to elect the director general of public media, which is currently decided by parliamentarians by majority vote. Also worth highlighting is the new Programming Council, which was supposed to evaluate and control public television and radio programs \"from the point of view of respecting the character of public broadcasting\". According to the amendment, the Program Council should have 11 members, nine of whom would be elected by members of Parliament. The remaining two members of the steering committee should be chosen from among themselves by the employees of the new Slovak Television and Radio. Such an amendment would conflict with European legislation on public media, which was debated by the European Parliament the day after the amendment was published.\nOver 1,200 RTVS employees and external collaborators have signed a declaration in favor of public RTVS, with which they draw attention to the RTVS bill, which threatens the independence of public law broadcasting. They were joined by Slovak and Czech civil society organizations who also reject interference with the independence of RTVS, signing an appeal addressed to the European institutions and other international organizations.  International journalistic organizations also reacted to the amendment, and media freedom groups called for the bill's withdrawal. The statement was signed by the International Press Institute (IPI), the committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the European Center for Press and Media Freedom (ECPMF), by the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ), Free Press Unlimited (FPU), OBC Transeuropa (OBCT) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF).\nRTVS submitted comments to the interdepartmental comment procedure on the draft amendment, which was in fundamental contradiction with the European principles of protection of the independence of public media and in conflict with the approved European law on media freedom. After pressure from the public and experts with 327 comments on the draft law on Slovak television and radio, it was sent back to the Legislative Council of the Government of the Slovak Republic\nSecond draft amendment (STVR)\nOn 24 April, R. Fico's government approved an amended bill on television and radio, proposed by Prime Minister Robert Fico and Minister of Culture Martina \u0160imkovi\u010dov\u00e1 due to the alleged bias of the RTVS, which is \"continuously fighting with the government\". The head of the service office of the Ministry of Culture Luk\u00e1\u0161 Machala said that the reason for the amendment of the RTVS is a purely political decision. Compared to the first proposal, the ministry canceled the program board and the possibility of dismissing the director without reason, which would violate European legislation. \nThe creation of a new ethics commission body was added in the amendment. The RTVS still has a ten-member ethics commission, but its operation is not regulated by law, but only by statute.  According to the proposal, the ethics commission would be made up of nine members, appointed for six-year term",
    "American physician (1873\u20131959)\nMay Cravath Wharton (1873\u20131959) was an American physician. She is known for her pioneering medical work in Cumberland County, Tennessee, for providing medical care to the people of the Cumberland Plateau during the 1919 flu pandemic, and for establishing hospitals and clinics in rural Tennessee. She settled in Tennessee in 1917 with her husband and was the resident physician at Pleasant Hill Academy. Born in Minnesota, Wharton attended Carleton College and graduated from the University of North Dakota. She earned her medical degree from the University of Michigan. She wrote the 1953 autobiography Doctor Woman of the Cumberlands.\nEarly life and education\nMay Cravath was born on a farm in St. Charles, Minnesota, on August 18, 1873. Her uncle was Erastus Milo Cravath, a pastor and activist who helped to found Fisk University.\nFrom 1890 to 1893 she attended Carleton College in Northfield. She was elected class president in her first year, was a member of the Gamma Delta Society, a women's literary society, and organized women's athletics. She earned her bachelor's degree at the University of North Dakota in 1895 and in 1896 voyaged to Europe with classmates and faculty from Carleton, touring Germany, France, and Switzerland. She was briefly engaged to fellow student William C. Allen. Upon her return to the United States, she taught at the University of North Dakota from 1898 to 1899. She later continued her education at the University of Michigan, earning a medical degree there in 1903.\nCareer\nFollowing her graduation from the University of Michigan, Cravath moved to Atlanta, Georgia. She established a medical practice there and married Congregational minister Edwin Wharton. They moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1907 and founded a settlement house where she served as its resident physician. They moved again to New Hampshire in 1909 where May continued her medical practice. May wrote an article on braided rug making for the magazine The House Beautiful in 1917.\nThe Whartons moved to Cumberland County, Tennessee, in 1917 where Edwin had secured a position as the principal of Pleasant Hill Academy, a boarding school for disadvantaged youths established by the American Missionary Association. May taught health courses there and was employed as a physician for students and staff members. Aside from Mary T. Martin Sloop, she was the only woman physician to practice medicine in Central Appalachia. During the 1919 flu pandemic she provided medical care for families throughout the Cumberland Plateau, traveling on country roads by buggy, mule, and horse to visit her patients. She was known as \"Doctor May\" and earned renown for her determination and compassionate care. As the epidemic raged across the state, she bore witness to its devastating effects on rural Tennesseans, who lacked hospital facilities and trained medical personnel. Along with her staff, Wharton established \"homemade Chautauquas\" and public outreach programs in local schools.\nFollowing Edwin's death in 1920, May continued serving as a community physician in Pleasant Hill, founding a three-room hospital with Alice Adshead and Elizabeth Fletcher. Wharton raised funds to construct the Uplands Sanatorium by 1922. Following the construction of the Memphis to Bristol Highway (now Tennessee State Route 1) in 1927, she established clinics in nearby communities and provided outreach programs for their residents. The construction of a general hospital (later known as Cumberland General) in 1935 and an annex in 1938 was accomplished through fundraising in New England. Wharton worked to establish cooperative health centers in rural communities and staffed monthly clinics in Big Lick, Tennessee.\nCravath later raised funds for the construction of the fifty-bed Cumberland Medical Center in Crossville, which was established in March 1950. Her autobiography, Doctor Woman of the Cumberlands, was published in 1953. In 1957 she also established Pleasant Hill's May Cravath Wharton Nursing Home, which went on to be incorporated as the retirement village Uplands, Inc. That same year, the University of Chattanooga gave her an honorary degree. She also received awards from Carleton College and the Tennessee Medical Association.\nWharton died on November 19, 1959. She was 86.\n",

He painted most Syrian monuments and costumes. He was active since the mid XIXth century, and was \u00ab\u00a0the first to document the Syrian cultural heritage\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0omitting neither a coma nor a period\u00a0\u00bb. The historian Muhammad Bashir Zuhdi (1927\u20132020) stated that \u00ab\u00a0Zukkari has replaced the photographic camera with brushes\u00a0\u00bb. He painted the old souqs and khans, the monuments of Palmyra, and old popular costumes. The artist and art critique Adib Makhzoum stated that Zukkari is \u00ab\u00a0an important source for documenting local costumes\u00a0\u00bb.\nBattle of Saladin, Syria, by Ziad Zukkari\nBiography\nZiad Zukkari was born in 1926 in Damascus. At age eight, Ziad Zukkari starts drawing with white or colour chalk the family trips or scenes of daily life on the walls of his family house in Douma. Later, his family leaves Douma to settle in Damascus, in the neighborhood of Al Bahsa Al Baraniyah, in front of the Al Tausiyah mosque (peacocks mosque), where many artists and calligraphers are living. He discovers the atelier of the painter Akram Khalqi located close to Arnous avenue in the neighborhood of Al-Salihiya, and he spends hours there.\nAs he was employee with the Syrian Ministry of Culture, he makes study trips in all governorates in order to systematically document the national heritage.\nTraditional costume of Ramallah, in Palestine, by Ziad Zukkari\nWorks\nAs he still was a teenager, he participated to a fine arts exhibition in Damascus with a charcoal representation of a Tiger hunting scene in ancient India. While the head of State (under French mandate), Taj al-Din al-Hasani, was delivering a speech during the inauguration ceremony, he made his portrait with pencil. An assistant of the president took the portrait and gave it to the president, and the next morning the portrait was published on the front page of the newspaper Al-Istiqlal Al-Arabi with the author's name and some words of encouragement. From then on, he would never stop drawing.\nTeenager, he finds in a magazine a reproduction of a young lady in traditional costume from the region of Hauran, and he notices many imperfections.

He met their inhabitants and documented their traditions. The journalist Al-Khaldi stated that he is a reference like no other for researchers in regional costumes and handicrafts. The artist Mamdouh Kashlan considered him as \u00ab\u00a0master of representation of cultural heritage\u00a0\u00bb.\nHis main contribution was to represent folk costumes in their context, by including in his canvas local monuments, whether archaeologic or historic, and handicrafts such as objects used for traditional Arabic coffee.

    "\nUnited Kingdom legislation\nThe Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011 (nawm 2) is an act of the National Assembly for Wales that established several provisions with regard to Welsh Ministers complying with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nFunction\nThe Measure places a duty on Welsh Ministers to comply with the UN Convention, and a duty to promote the convention.\nThe Welsh Government must now consult children and young people, the Children's Commissioner for Wales and other relevant stakeholders.\nThe Welsh Government lacks devolution over justice, so the Measure does not apply to legal aid, policing, among other policy areas. Asylum and migration policy is also not devolved, is also not devolved so the Measure also does not apply to policies regarding unaccompanied minors.\nThe Measure also makes provisions for a children's scheme to ensure compliance with the convention. The Measure also makes provisions for a consultation on applying the measure to people aged 18\u201324 - the Measure only applies to those younger than 18 at this moment. This consultation did not lead to change, when it did happen, because upon consultation stakeholders indicated that the Convention \"will not address these transitional problems and that there are better ways of focusing on the rights of young people aged 18-24years.\"\nHistory\nIn 2008 the four children's commissioners of the UK recommended incorporating the Convention into domestic law.\nOn 18 January 2011, the Welsh Assembly passed Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales)\nMeasure 2011 partially incorporating the Convention into domestic law. It only applied to devolved matters.

The stream flows from the slopes of Mount Meron eastward, passing through agricultural lands and numerous natural areas, and it empties into Nahal Amud. The length of the stream is about 5 kilometers, and it is considered a relatively short stream but of great historical and geographical importance. The stream's course passes near the settlement of Meron and north of Mount Merarvim. Along its length are several springs, including Ein Meron (\"Mei Megiddo\") and Ein Bar-Yochai. On the upper northern bank, near the settlement of Meron, are the ancient synagogue in Meron and the tomb of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai. On the southern bank are the remains of the synagogue at Horvat Shema.\nHiking trail\nThe hiking trail of Nahal Meron begins at the entrance to the Nahal Amud Nature Reserve, located on the eastern side of Road 886, south of Moshav Meron.

    "Prominent Nebraska attorney, state legislator\nEdwin L. King was a Nebraska attorney who served in both houses of the state legislature; was instrumental in passage of legislation improving public education and regulating the railroad as a public utility; and was a revisor and codifier of the state's laws.\nEarly life\nEdwin Laverne King was born February 4, 1855, in Bedford, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, the son of a farmer whose ancestors were emigres to the Connecticut Western Reserve in the early 19th century. In 1867 the family moved to Benton County in central eastern Iowa. King graduated from Iowa State College in 1877 and from the Des Moines Law School the following year, and entered law practice in Vinton, the county seat of Benton County. In July 1879, King moved to Osceola, Nebraska, where he spent the rest of his life.\nCareer\nKing early established himself in the community. In addition to his law practice, he was an original trustee of Osceola upon its incorporation August 26, 1881.  Also that year, another influential citizen, John H. Mickey, incorporated Osceola Bank, the first bank in Polk County. King was appointed vice-president of the bank, reflecting a relationship between the two men that endured for more than twenty years.  King was a city councilman and served as a member of the Osceola School Board for 18 years, many years as its president. He held the office of Polk County Attorney twice, 1887\u20131888, and 1915\u20131916.\nLegislative career and accomplishments\nKing served in the Nebraska House of Representatives in 1885\u20131886, and in the State Senate from 1907 to 1912.\nThe 1907 Nebraska legislative session produced much reform legislation. Senator King was instrumental in the efforts.\nKing framed and championed an anti-pass law, limiting the issuance of free railroad passes, a custom which was said to have led to abuses such as influencing legislation and the administration of justice. Hand in hand with this, King supported passage of the Nebraska Railway Commission law, which created the regulatory agency to investigate and control the railroads and other public corporations.\nHe introduced legislation that became known as \"King\u2019s High School Bill,\" which sought to expand educational opportunities by allowing for four years of high school for all youth. This enabled young people in rural communities to attend public schools in the towns, supported by tuition charges of $.75 paid by counties.\nKing was also the author of the Corporation Tax Law, imposing for the first time a tax on corporate earnings.\nIn the 1909-1910 legislative session, King was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\nDuring the term of Nebraska Governor John H. Mickey (1903\u20131907), King served as his legal advisor. Both Osceola residents, the two had enjoyed a long business relationship.\nCodification\nIn 1911, Nebraska Governor Chester Hardy Aldrich appointed King one of three members of a commission to arrange, compile, and codify state statutes for the first time in the state's history. He was joined by state judges  A.M. Post and J.H. Broady. They produced the Nebraska Revised Statutes of 1913, a codification, with regular statutory updates and revisions, that remains intact today. King was recognized as the one who did a disproportionate amount of work on the commission.\nPolitical life\nKing attended the 1912 Republican national convention in Chicago as a delegate from Nebraska. He was regarded as an \"ardent progressive,\" but disapproved of Theodore Roosevelt's bolting the party that year. From 1912 to 1914, he served as chairman of the Republican State Committee. In 1916 King presided over the Republican state convention.\nPersonal\nIn 1880 King married Abby Fowle of Clarksville, Iowa, whom he had met in college. They had two children, Edna Laura, born 1881, and William Ross, born 1886.\nKing was a Mason, a past master, trustee, and treasurer of Osceola Lodge No. 65, A.F. and A.M., and was a member of Modern Woodmen of America.\nKing died suddenly of an apoplectic stroke at his home, April 22, 1921, at age 66.

Chhun worked to raise funds in America, including aboard the Queen Mary, whilst conspirators in Cambodia provided weapons. Chhun organised the attack from a location in Thailand. The group planned to strike 291 target and were able to raise US$50,000.\nIn the morning of 24 November, around 100 armed individuals attacked the Ministry of Defence and national police building, but the attack was halted by authorities before it reached the prime minister's residence. 38 conspirators, including two American citizens, were arrested. Hun Sen was attending an ASEAN Summit overseas and was not in the country. At least four people died and several dozen were wounded. The attacks did minimal damage and were defeated within a few hours. Chhun himself remained the Thai border with the intention for him to lead a new government if the coup was successful. Government spokesperson Khieu Kanharith described the attacks as terrorism and not a coup.\nThe Cambodian government convicted 38 people, including 2 American citizens, for the attack. Chhun was sentenced in absentia. He was later investigated in the United States, and was arrested in June 2005 in connection with the violence. He was convicted in 2008 and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2010. In 2010, Hun Sen suggested that the opposition Sam Rainsy Party had had a role in the attempted coup.\nSee also\nBangkok Plot\n1997 Cambodian coup d'\u00e9tat\n",

    "2023 American film by Mary Dauterman\nBooger is a 2023 American body horror comedy film written and directed by Mary Dauterman in her feature directorial debut. It stars Grace Glowicki, Garrick Bernard, Heather Matarazzo, and Marcia DeBonis. The film follows Anna (Glowicki), who, while grieving the unexpected death of her best friend and roommate Izzy (Sofia Dobrushin), is bitten by their runaway cat Booger, causing Anna to undergo an unusual bodily transformation.\nBooger had its world premiere at the Fantasia International Film Festival on July 24, 2023, as part of the festival's \"Underground\" section. The film is scheduled to receive a limited theatrical release and be released on video-on-demand (VOD) on September 13, 2024.\nProduction\nBooger marks Dauterman's feature directorial debut; prior to Booger, Dauterman directed such short films as Wakey, Wakey (2019) and Unfinished Business (2020), the former of which screened at the Fantasia International Film Festival and Fantastic Fest in 2019. Dauterman described Booger as \"a disgusting comedy about grief. Or a body horror that's funny and sad. Or a tragedy that makes you laugh and squirm. It's the nuanced story I wanted to tell about the joys of friendship, the pain of loss, and the dizzying search back to your center after a crisis.\"\nRelease\nBooger had its world premiere at the Fantasia International Film Festival in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on July 24, 2023, as part of the festival's \"Underground\" section. A second screening at the festival followed on July 26.\nIn February 2024, it was announced that Dark Sky Films had acquired the US distribution rights to Booger. The film is slated to be released in limited theaters and on video-on-demand (VOD) on September 13, 2024.\nReception\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Booger has an approval rating of 100% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10.\nJ Hurtado of Screen Anarchy praised Dauterman's direction and Glowicki's performance, writing, \"There are endless films and stories about grief, but none of them are like this one, and I have to assume that very few feature this number of graphic scenes of a human woman coughing up hairballs.\" Collider's Maggie Lovitt gave the film a grade of \"B+\", calling it \"a bold and refreshing journey into grief and the damaging effects of holding it in when it desperately wants to claw its way out.\"\nEmily Gagne of Dread Central gave the film three out of five stars, complimenting Glowicki's performance while desiring to know more about the character of Izzy; Gagne concluded: \"Like picking your nose, Booger is a film that will work for some and make others wholly uncomfortable.\" Nick Allen, writing for RogerEbert.com, described the film's story as \"too slack, even for 75 minutes of movie\", and concluded: \"Booger could stand to have more going on as a character study, but the movie does have promise for Dauterman's animalistic cinema.\"\n",

He earned the title of Sheikh al-Hadith and Tafsir.\nEarly life and education\nAbdul Ali was born in Lakukhil in 1938 to Mawlana Sher Muhammad, a cleric. He received basic religious education from his father. Later, he went to Kandahar to pursue higher education at Muhammadiyah School. Subsequently, he studied sharia at Darul Uloom Haqqania in Akora Khattak in 1964. However, other sources mentioned that he enrolled at Darul Uloom Deoband.\nCareer\nUpon finishing his Sharia studies, Abdul Ali went back to Afghanistan and taught Islam in several areas in Kandahar.\nAfter the Saur Revolution, Abdul Ali called for jihad against the communist government. He then fled to Pakistan and continued teaching to mujahideen. He only returned to Afghanistan after the fall of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. As he returned, he resumed teaching and became a mediator among warring armed groups in his area.\nDuring the first Taliban government, Abdul Ali taught hadith in Kandahar and worked as a radio host on Voice of Sharia, answering Islamic questions about worship, beliefs, transactions, politics, Islamic economics, and personal status. Other than that, he also served as Mullah Omar's ideology advisor, albeit he did not hold any position in the government.\nAbdul Ali was believed to have fled to Pakistan in 2001. In early 2006, he was reportedly lived in Quetta. He died on 2 November 2009 due to natural causes.\nViews\nWomen's rights\nAbdul Ali was against teaching women reading and writing, even at home. Additionaly, he also believed that women were prohibited from attending congregational prayers. He assumed that allowing women to learn reading and writing or attend congregational prayers \"leads to women's corruption\" because the present times were \"temptation\".\nAbdul Ali forbade women from using mobile phones since they utilized them to \"form relationships and turn to immorality and vices.\u201d\nMausoleum of Imam Ali\nAnswering a question from a listener on the Mausoleum of Imam Ali, Abdul Ali stipulated that there was no Ali's grave in the shrine, and the tomb was built on a former Zoroastrian fire temple.

    "Public market in the Philippines\nFa\u00e7ade of the La Paz Public Market\nLa Paz Public Market is a public market or palengke located in La Paz, Iloilo City, Philippines. It is considered as the birthplace of a popular Filipino dish, La Paz Batchoy.\nHistory\nLa Paz has been operated its own market even before its conglomeration with Iloilo City in 1937. The current La Paz Public Market traces its origins to the early 1920s, evolving from a reclaimed fishpond filled with dredged materials from the Iloilo River, as documented in the Quarterly Bulletin of the Bureau of Public Works in 1918. The main market building, showcasing an Art Deco design typical of its era, was constructed between the 1920s and 1930s.\nAfter World War II, the market resumed operations with a general covered area where vendors sold goods on tables or makeshift kiosks. In the 1960s, during the tenure of Vice Mayor Dicen, public stalls were erected and rented out to vendors. Subsequently, walls were installed between stalls, which were then individually leased.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the main building of the La Paz Public Market housed the La Paz Police Station.\nA significant fire in 1989 damaged parts of the market's northern section, leading to the temporary relocation of stalls to Rizal Street while repairs were undertaken.\nThe main building of the La Paz Public Market underwent improvements and rehabilitation in the early 2000s under the initiative of Congressman Raul Gonzales Sr.\nRehabilitation\nInside of La Paz Public Market temporary site on Rizal Street\nThe public market underwent major rehabilitation and renovation in 2022, which necessitated the temporary relocation of stalls to Rizal Street once again. The entire market was demolished, except for the distinctive feature structure with art deco architecture, preserved for its historical value. The rehabilitation is expected to be completed in December 2024. The market is set to feature an additional 73 stalls compared to its pre-renovation configuration.\nLa Paz Batchoy\nMain article: Batchoy\nA bowl of Batchoy served inside the public market\nThe origin of Batchoy is traced to the public market, with multiple accounts claiming credit for its creation. It is believed to have been created in 1938 by Federico Guilergan Sr., evolving from a playful combination of \"bats\" and \"choy\" (from chop suey). However, Inggo's Batchoy also claims to be the first batchoy shop in La Paz, established in 1922 at the La Paz Public Market, predating Deco's La Paz Batchoy Shop by 16 years. Teodorico \"Ted\" Lepura further popularized the dish with Ted's Oldtimer Lapaz Batchoy, founded in 1945. The dish's name \"batchoy\" is believed to originate from Hokkien Chinese, meaning \"meat soup\" or \"minced meat.\"\n",

    "2018 book by Clementine Ford\nBoys Will Be Boys: Power, Patriarchy and the Toxic Bonds of Mateship is a book about toxic masculinity by Clementine Ford, first published in 2018. The book was well received by critics.\nPublication\nBoys Will Be Boys: Power, Patriarchy and the Toxic Bonds of Mateship was first published in 2018.\nSynopsis\nBoys Will Be Boys presents several aspects of toxic masculinity typical of the upbringing of boys, arguing that patriarchal upbringing is damaging for adult men. Examples of gender coding in children about expected characteristics of boys and girls are presented in terms of statistics from films and television shows, with few girls and women being actors, writers and directors, particularly from her experience of childhood in the 1980s. According to Ford, an example of toxic masculinity that persists into male adulthood is men being shamed for expressing emotions, in behaviour that is seen as feminine. She argues that patriarchical culture requires males to \"kill of the emotional parts of themselves\".\nThe book covers traditional home roles of domestic housekeeping and roles at work. Ford describes what she sees as links between the gender conditioning of children and the long-term effects when the children become adults.\nThe book includes an argument that \"toxic male spaces and behaviours\" act to preserve male dominance.\nFord makes recommendations of how to change the ways that boys and girls are raised, which she believes may avoid or reduce toxic masculinity.\nPersonal reflections on the birth of Ford's son play a role in both the beginning and end of the book. The book's epilogue is a letter by Ford to her young son, describing \"boyhood in which being sensitive, soft, kind, gentle, respectful, accountable, expressive, loving and nurturing are no longer framed as incompatible with being a man\".\nCritical reception\nAuthor Katherine Brabon described Boys Will Be Boys as presenting a \"cogent and passionate argument\" that the teaching of boys and men's roles is \"broken\". Criminology lecturer Carl Bradley strongly commended the book as \"challengingly good\".\nAlex Casey describes the book as written with \"withering wit\", as an \"incredibly thorough time capsule of the modern fight for gender equality\", an as \"some of the most essential and electric feminist reading of the year\".\nSee also\nFeminism in Australia\n",

    "1892 Konkani play by Lucasinho Ribeiro\nItalian Bhurgo (transl.\u2009Italian Boy) is a Konkani play written and directed by Lucasinho Ribeiro. The play premiered on Easter Sunday, 17 April 1892, at the New Alfred Theatre (now Police Commissioner's head office) in Bombay, British India. It was the first Konkani play or teatro (tiatr) ever staged. Ribeiro's first play was staged with the assistance of fellow Goans Caitaninho Fernandes, Agostinho Mascarenhas, Jo\u00e3o Agostinho Fernandes, and Fransquino Fernandes, collectively known as the Goa Portuguese Dramatic Company. The play was based on an Italian operetta by the Gonzalez Brothers.\nProduction history\nRibeiro during his youth\nLucasinho Ribeiro was a Goan immigrant who resided in Bombay (now Mumbai) during the late 19th or early 20th century. He exhibited a high level of proficiency in the English language, showcased musical prowess by excelling in violin performance, and gained recognition for his abilities as both a composer and singer. His journeys ultimately brought him to work as a stagehand for an Italian opera troupe touring Bombay during that period. In this capacity, he accompanied the troupe to various locations across British India. Ultimately, he decided to leave the opera company, but not before being exposed to and influenced by one of their operettas, likely composed by the Gonzalez Brothers. Utilizing the knowledge and experience he gained through his work with the Italian opera company, Ribeiro went on to adapt one of their operettas into his own original Konkani play or teatro, titled Italian Bhurgo (Italian Boy). When departing the opera company, he had the foresight to purchase some of their velvet costumes, which he subsequently incorporated into the staging of his Italian Bhurgo production.\nAccording to the analysis of Goa University professor Andr\u00e9 Rafael Fernandes, the inception of Italian Bhurgo by Ribeiro was not a haphazard creative decision; instead, it was influenced by his past interactions and engagement with the Italian opera troupe. Conversely, some writers have argued that Ribeiro's play was in fact an adaptation of an existing English opera known as Italian Boy, rather than an entirely original work. His first theatrical production, which he titled Italian Bhurgo, drew inspiration from the Italian operatic tradition, incorporating elements of that form into the nascent Konkani dramatic genre. As the driving force behind this pioneering Konkani play, he assumed a leadership role among his collaborators, who recognized his experience in theatrical production. Following his departure from employment in Bombay, Ribeiro joined forces with Caitaninho Fernandes of Taleig\u00e3o in the quest for actors to take part in a play. Despite their best efforts, they faced obstacles in attracting young men to participate in the production. The aspiring actors exhibited skepticism towards Ribeiro's novel theatrical approach, likening it to the established Goan folk drama form known as zagor. This comparison posed a substantial barrier, ultimately resulting in Ribeiro's decision to forego the staging of the production.\nJo\u00e3o Agostinho Fernandes, better known as Pai Tiatrist, during his middle age from the 20th-century\nIn the late 19th century, a group of individuals in the city of Bombay (now known as Mumbai) came together to establish the foundations of the Konkani theatrical tradition known as tiatr. It began with a chance encounter between Caitaninho, an employee of the Bombay Gazette, and Jo\u00e3o Agostinho Fernandes. The two men discussed the teatro (theater) genre, prompting Jo\u00e3o to accompany Caitaninho to meet Ribeiro at his residence on Picket Road in Bombay on a Sunday. Following this initial introduction, Jo\u00e3o would regularly visit Ribeiro in the evenings after his workday had concluded. A group consisting of Caitaninho, Jo\u00e3o, and Ribeiro embarked on a quest to discover youthful talents to engage in the theatrical presentation of Italian Bhurgo. Their search led them to local clubs where they identified and recruited Agostinho Mascarenhas and Fransquino Fernandes for the production. To stage the opera or theater production effectively, a total of nine performers were essential. Each performer assumed the responsibility of portraying multiple roles, typically handling 2-3 characters. The group dedicated their evenings after work to rehearse and prepare for the upcoming production. Impressed by their dedication, Ribeiro took it upon himself to formally establish the foundations of Konkani tiatr in February 1892. He did so near the Rodond Bungalow on Picket Road in Bombay, that had five actors (his associates), including himself, portraying a total of nine characters.\nIn the late 19th century, the Konkani-speaking community residing in Bombay faced a void in their entertainment options. This issue was recognized by Jo\u00e3o Agostinho Fernandes, a popular figure within the community, who sought to address the problem. Fernandes provided encouragement to his",
    "\nSusan Bassett was a competitive swimmer in High School and a swim coach and assistant director of Athletics at Union College from 1987 through 1995 where she led the Union men to a New York State Championship in 1995 and the Union Women to New York State Championships in 1990 and 1994.

She ran often to build endurance, but considered swimming her primary sport.\nIn December, 1975, at the end of her first semester at Ithaca College, Bassett received a number of serious injuries, including a fractured pelvis, and was in critical condition, after becoming the victim of a hit and run accident by an automobile that hit her and a close friend from behind while they were on a walk.  She needed months to recover, withdrew from college athletics, but gradually resumed some of her swimming.  Within six months, she resumed her work as Head Coach of the Briarcliff Municipal Pool.\nBassett graduated from Ithaca College in 1979 with a major and concentration in Athletic Training.  She earned a master's degree in Physical Education from Indiana University in 1980.\nCoach and athletic director\nHobart and William Smith Colleges\nBassett coached the swimming teams at Hobart and William Smith Colleges from 1981 to 1987, and returned to the schools serving as Director of Athletics from June 1995 through 2005.

She has also played an important part in improving the entire College's athletic facilities.\nDuring her time at William Smith, she also served as an assistant coach with the lacrosse and field hockey teams.\nUnder Bassett's guidance as Coach and later Director from 1995 to 2005, William Smith won two National Championships, many conference championships and three ECAC titles.  Bassett noted that in 2007, 18-20 percent of American Collegiate Athletic Directors among all three NCAA division were women.\nShe also noted that before Title IX, only 1 in 27 women participated in sports.  She noted that by 2007, the number was closer to 50% of women.  As Director she helped add Golf and Sailing teams to William Smith, and engineered the Peak Performance plan which helped athletes reach their potential in athletics, academics, and in their profession.\nUnion College\nBassett led Union College swimming team from 1987 to 1995.  In her eight years with the men's team, she led them to a New York State Championship in 1995, her last year with the team.  The team earned an overall record of 42\u201320, representing a .677 winning percentage.\nIn eight years coaching the women's team, Bassett earned a notable overall record of 63\u201310, earning a noteworthy .863 winning percentage, and led the team to its first New York State Title in 1990, and again in 1994, when the team completed a rare perfect 9\u20130 season.

    "\nCharles Eaton Silvia was an All-American competitive swimmer for Springfield College, and a Hall of Fame swimming coach for Springfield from 1937 through 1978 where he led his teams to ten New England Intercollegiate Championships.  A 1956 Assistant Olympic swim coach, he was an outstanding contributor to the swimming community and served as President of the College Swimming Coaches Association of America, as well as chairing the Board of the International Swimming Hall of Fame.  He authored seven books on swimming, Life Saving, and Scuba Diving, and was best known for his book, Life Saving and Water Safety Today.\nEducation\nSilvia was born January 3, 1911 in Sommerville, Massachusetts, outside of Boston to Anthony B. and Jane Kemp Silvia.  He grew up in Haverhill, Massachusetts, and attended Haverhill High School, around 30 miles North of Boston, where he was honored in their Hall of Fame.  Though he did not compete with a swimming team at Haverhill, he excelled and lettered in a variety of other sports including basketball, football, and baseball.  He later attended the New Hampton School, a preparatory school in New Hampton, New Hampshire, where he was also active in athletics.  At New Hampton, he received a medal for outstanding academic achievement, played basketball, and was Captain of New Hampton's football team in 1929.\nHe attended and swam for Springfield College from 1930 to 1934, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1934 and later completed a master's degree in Physical Education between 1937 and 1940 while serving his early years as the swim coach for Springfield.  As a Senior at Springfield, Silvia made the Kappa Delta Pi academic honorary society.\nSpringfield College swimmer\nWhile swimming for Springfield College, he won the New England Intercollegiate Championship in the 440-yard event in 1933, also known as the quarter mile, setting the 440-yard New England Conference record which he held for two years.  In 1934, he retained his New England Swimming Association league record in the 440-yard swim with a time of 5.18.2 for the short pool, and 5:19.7 for the long pool course.  Silvia's 440-yard record was broken in February, 1935 by Springfield College swimmer C.F. Pawling who swam a new record time of 5:17.3.  Silvia's fastest time in the 300 Individual Medley in 1934, was 4.00.8 for the short pool course, also a New England Swimming Association League record.  Silvia may have also set a National Collegiate record in the 300-yard Individual Medley on March 3, 1933, at Springfield's McCurdy pool, with a time of 4:08.4 (prior record 4:08.6, 1930, by Yale swimmer J. W. Hart) though the record was not broken during an official meet, but rather in a match between Springfield's Varsity and Freshman teams.  At least one reliable source, the International Swimming Hall of Fame Bio for Charles Silvia referenced the 1933 300-yard IM swim as a national record.\nExcelling in longer freestyle competition as well, Silvia was a collegiate All-American in the 1500-meter event his Senior year in 1934 when he served as Captain for the Springfield College team.   An open water distance swimming enthusiast, Silvia completed a two hour swim from Hampton Beach to Salisbury Beach in early August, 1934, and planned an 11 mile swim from Hampton Beach to the Isles of Shoals.\nSilvia swam under Coach Thomas K. Cureton, an honoree of the International Swimming Hall of Fame for his contributions to the science of physical fitness testing and research for swimmers as well as athletes in other sports.  Cureton, widely published in his field, swam for and graduated Yale, obtained a PHd in educational research from Columbia in 1939, and later taught at the University of Illinois from 1941-1969.  Cureton emphasized endurance training as being more valuable than mastering mechanical skills for athletes, which may have been one of his primary focuses in training his swimmers at Springfield, and became his lasting contribution to training athletes.   As a Senior, Silvia's exceptionally strong 1934 team broke nearly all prior Springfield records.    Silvia was considered one of Springfield's greatest endurance swimmers.  As an outstanding contributor as a Senior, he scored the second highest number of combined dual meet points, for the 1934 season, a total of 76, out of a total of 421 scored by the entire Springfield team of 20 that year.  His mastery of multiple strokes as a medley swimmer, would later benefit him as a swim coach.  Possibly influencing his future choice of coaching swimming as a career, during summer breaks from Springfield College, Silvia worked as an Assistant swimming  director at the Brimfield Red Cross Camp in the greater Springfield area.\nImmediately after graduating Springfield College in 1934, Silvia worked for his former preparatory school, the New Hampton School in New Hampton, New Hampshire as Director of Athletics, continuing in the position through 1937.  At New Hampton, he coached baseball, bask",
    "University political society\nThe University of Warwick Conservative Association, is a student conservative association founded in 1965 at the University of Warwick. It is affiliated with Warwick Students' Union.\nHistory\nAs one of the associations most famous alumni, David Davis was the honorary chairman of the association. However, it was accidently let slip on BBC Radio 5 Live by the then-internal affairs secretary that due to his uncooperative nature, Davis was to have the position removed by the association. It was recognised that since David was Brexit Secretary at the time, he did have other prioritise, but it was felt that this did not excuse the lack of communication on Davis part. In response, the association reported that is was considering changing who held the role.\nIn May 2022, the association invited the then-Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi to address them. Attempts to deplatform him for transphobia failed, protesters instead picketed the hall where the talk occurred. They rushed Zahawi after the talk, in the ensuing scuffle striking the events secretary. The campus safety team had to escort Zahawi to ensure no harm came to him.\nIn October 2022, concerns were raised by the Warwick Northern Society over an advertised 'Dress like a leftie' event. It was suggested that inspiration could have been taken from Warwick Labour Society, which had previously run \u201cdress like a Tory\u201d social events.\nIn June 2024, concerns were raised when footage from their annual Chairman's Dinner in May was reported by The Sunday Times. Following the meal, a member asked the DJ to play Erika (song)\"Erika\", which some of the members laughed at. Reflecting the Nazi theme, one member was reported to declare \"Hail the chairman\". The association condemned the behaviour and apologised for any offence it caused. It defended its members actions, claiming that they were not aware of the connotations of the song, but said that the member who requested the song would no longer be welcome to attend any of their events. The university reported that the footage was \"reprehensible\", and it was reviewing it with the Jewish Society. The Union of Jewish Students called the clip \u201cutterly abhorrent\u201d and claimed it showed \u201cblatant and unchallenged support for nazism\u201d. The association defended itself by highlighting that it acted quickly on the night, which the short clip released does not show, with a member of the executive committee rushing to the DJ to have him stop playing the song. The association also has said that the person seen actively singing along was not even a member of the association, but they would still be banned from attending events.\nIn response, the student union suspended the association for an externally led investigation to take place.\nOrganisation\nNotable alumni\nSir David Davis, MP\nTim Loughton, MP, UWCA Secretary\nDame Andrea Leadsom, MP\n",
    "Criminal organization\nThe Black Diamond Riders Motorcycle Club are a Toronto-based Canadian outlaw biker gang.\nFounding\nIn the late 1940s, Harry Paul Barnes, aka \" \"Johnny Sombrero\"\", of Toronto was a member of the Humber Valley Riders Motorcycle Club, but broke away in 1951 to found the Black Diamond Riders. The Black Diamond Riders were notorious as the most violent biker gang in Toronto in the 1950s and Peter Edwards, the crime correspondent of the Toronto Star wrote: \"Some fights were so ferocious that Queen Street in Toronto had to be blocked off to accommodate the young thugs\".\nThe clubhouse of the Black Diamond Riders was located at Steeles and Dufferin Street in Toronto, which consisted of a house along with a swimming pool; a cage for the mascot of the Black Diamond Riders, namely a white rabbit; and for some reason a burial ground for groundhogs. Barnes stated in a 2015 interview: \"We had five acres of land. We had rabbits, foxes, pheasants by the dozens, groundhogs\". In the late 1950s-early 1960s, the Black Diamond Riders were in the words of the American journalist Mick Lowe the \"undisputed kingpins\" of the biker scene in the Toronto area as Barnes engaged in \"often heavy-handed maneuvers\" that forced most of the other biker gangs to disband.\nThe \"Battle of Pebblestone\"\nIn 1962, the Black Diamond Riders violated the outlaw biker code by attacking other bikers at a field day where bikers show off their bikers and where violence was forbidden. During the field day at the Pebblestone Golf Course in Courtice, the Black Diamond Riders kept to themselves and fastened makeshift weapons by ripping off tree branches. At the signal given by Barnes, the Black Diamond Riders charged and attacked the other bikers. The Black Diamond mercilessly beat the bikers and stole their motorcycles. The American journalist Mick Lowe wrote: \"The Battle of Pebblestone sent a chill through all of the Toronto-area clubs.\" Barnes followed up his triumph at what the media called the \"Battle of Pebblestone\" by riding down the Gardiner Expressway along with the other Black Diamond Riders in the wrong direction. Media reports in 1963 described the Black Diamond Riders as a biker gang \"terrorized high school dance halls, staged brawls and administered serious beatings to whoever was considered an opponent.\"\nDecline\nTo end the attacks of the Black Diamond Riders, four other biker gangs merged under the leadership of Bernie Guindon to found Satan's Choice Motorcycle Club in 1965. Satan's Choice greatly outnumbered the Black Diamond Riders, and in turn used their numerical superiority to beat the Black Diamond Riders in a series of brawls across the Toronto area in 1965\u20131966. At the conclusion of the conflict, Guindon imposed the new boundaries of the Black Diamond Riders, giving them a small slice of Toronto as their territory while taking the rest for Satan's Choice.\nAfter losing the biker war to Satan's Choice, the Black Diamond Riders dwindled, going from having 200 members in 1963 to having 15 members in 1968. A 1973 report by the Ontario Provincial Police listed the Black Diamond Riders as being marginal in the drug market in Toronto. However, the Satan's Choice hitman Cecil Kirby shot up the clubhouse of the Black Diamond Riders one night in 1974 for no better reason than he disliked Barnes, whom Kirby stated had \"a really big mouth\".\n\"Sudbury Saturday Night\"\nIn the early 1990s, the Black Diamond Riders experienced a resurgence and planned to found a chapter in Sudbury, which was viewed as a threat by Guindon. On a Saturday night during the Labour Day weekend in 1992, a brawl broke in the parking lot of the Sorrento Motor Hotel in Sudbury, where Barnes and 6 other Black Diamond Riders were beaten up by Guindon along with 44 other Satan's Choice bikers armed with guns, knives, boards and baseball bats. Barnes said of the brawl: \"There were about forty-five of them. Attacked seven of us. They shot two of us. They shot him in the guts and shot me in the face\". The brawl came to be known as the \"Sudbury Saturday Night\" in biker circles.\nLast years\nAfter the brawl in Sudbury, the Black Diamond Riders faded into irreverence. The Black Diamond Riders last played an important role in the biker world in 1996 when Barnes expelled a number of Black Diamond Riders who had challenged him. The expelled Black Diamond Riders founded what  journalist Jerry Langton called  the \"rather forlornly named\" Lost Souls Motorcycle Club of Milton. Instead of rejoining the Black Diamond Riders, Satan's Choice to made a better offer, leading for the Lost Souls to join Satan's Choice on 13 April 1996.  When Barnes died in 2016, the gang had 40 members, the majority of whom were older men in their 70s and 80s.\nBooks and articles\nEdwards, Peter (2013).

    "Linear Operators is a three-volume textbook on the theory of linear operators, written by Nelson Dunford and Jacob T. Schwartz. The three volumes are (I) General Theory; (II) Spectral Theory, Self Adjoint Operators in Hilbert Space; and (III) Spectral Operators. The first volume was published in 1958, the second in 1963, and the third in 1971. All three volumes were reprinted by Wiley in 1988. Canonically cited as Dunford and Schwartz, the textbook has been referred to as \"the definitive work\" on linear operators.:\u200a2\u200a\nThe work began as a written set of solutions to the problems for Dunford's graduate course in linear operators at Yale.:\u200a30\u200a Schwartz, a prodigy, had taken his undergraduate degree at Yale in 1948, age 18. In 1949 he began his graduate studies and enrolled in his course. Dunford recognised Schwartz's intelligence and they began a long collaboration, with Dunford acting as Schwartz's advisor for his dissertation Linear Elliptic Differential Operators.:\u200a30\u200a One fruit of their collaboration was the Dunford-Schwartz theorem.:\u200a4\u200a The work was originally intended to be a short introduction to functional analysis (the original material comprising what was published as Chapters 2, 4, 7 and part of 10 in Volume I) but the material ballooned.:\u200a32\u200a The work enjoyed funding from the Office of Naval Research and a popular joke at the time was that every nuclear submarine had a copy.:\u200a30\u200a William G. Bade and Robert G. Bartle were brought on as research assistants. Dunford retired shortly after finishing the final volume.:\u200a30\u200a Schwartz, however, went on to write similarly pathbreaking books in various other areas of mathematics.\nThe book met with acclaim when published. It won the Leroy P.

    "1795\u20131796 gold rush in County Wicklow, Ireland\nThe Wicklow gold rush, or the Avoca gold rush, was a gold rush that began on 15 September 1795, following the discovery of gold on the northern slopes of Croghan Kinsella mountain, County Wicklow, Ireland. The unregulated gold collection ended with a military takeover exactly one month later, on 15 October 1795. Over the four week period, as much as 80 kilograms of gold was recovered by prospectors. It was the only recorded gold rush to have occurred on the island of Ireland.\nHistory\nBackground\nIreland was the major area of gold working in Bronze Age Britain and Ireland, with Irish gold being especially well known from the Bronze Age as jewellery in the form of gold lunulae, torcs, gorgets and rings.\nThe first gold produced in Ireland occurred c. 2500 BC during the late Neolithic/Atlantic Bronze Age, with a likely source for it having been placer mining in Ireland's rivers, including the rivers of County Wicklow and the \"Gold Coast\" of County Waterford. The National Museum of Ireland maintains that \"although gold has been found in Ireland at a number of locations, particularly in County Wicklow and County Tyrone, it has not yet been possible to identify the ancient sources where gold was found\", but that \"the sites most likely to have been recognised and exploited by prehistoric people were alluvial deposits from rivers and streams\".\nThe area around Woodenbridge where the future gold rush would occur was already traditionally known for mining, with the pits of East Avoca and their underlying workings having supported copper and sulphur production since the year 1720. The mining district in Avoca was, at that point, one of the richest in Europe, and by the 1770s, copper mines were shipping more than a hundred tons of ore annually from Wicklow. It would go on to become the most extensive mining operation in Ireland, remaining so until 1960 when it closed.\nAt the time, the gold was thought to have originated in a quartz vein in the mountain, but since then, studies by Riofinex in the 1990s determined that two separate bedrock sources were more likely - those of Kilmacoo-style sulphide ores, and Ballcoog-Moneyteige ironstone.\nDiscovery\nAlluvial gold and gold nuggets from County Wicklow on display at the National Museum of Ireland \u2013 Archaeology, Dublin\nVarious claims exist as to the nature of the gold discovery in County Wicklow that ignited the 1795 gold rush. A 2007 article in New Scientist magazine claims it was a local schoolmaster named Dunaghoo (or Donaghoo) who, living beyond his means, was found to have been quietly panning the Aughatinavought river for sands containing grains of gold, which he had then been selling to Dublin jewellers. McArdle also notes tales of a fisherman who, by chance, spotted a gold nugget in the river. Another story recounts how the river sediment had been worked surreptitiously by a local farming family since the 1780s, and that the family secret had been revealed by a disaffected member as revenge.\nNew Scientist claims that the Goldmines River was known as Aughatinavought before gold was found, however IrishCentral contends that the river was called 'Ballinvally' prior to the discovery, as does a 2021 video produced by the Wicklow Heritage Office.:\u200a0:30\u200a\nThe northeastern slopes of Croghan Mountain (Croghan Kinsella)\nIt is known that on 15 September 1795, workers felling timber found gold was found in the roots of uprooted trees on the estate of Lord Carysfort near Woodenbridge in County Wicklow. Gold was already known to exist in the area, as were other minerals in Avoca. \nAs McArdle notes, the gold was probably first spotted by one of the workers exposed in the roots of a tree which had recently toppled, and was \"no pinhead speck of gold, but a half-ounce piece\". \"We can safely assume\", according to McArdle, that \"the workers immediately abandoned their tiresome labours on behalf of Lord Carysfort and devoted themselves wholeheartedly to their new gold mining enterprise\". Gold was known as a \"Royal metal\", and any that was found was supposed to belong by right to the Crown.\nAnnouncement of find\nThose closest to the story would have naturally been cautious to alert journalists to the find, to give themselves more time to pan, but as news spread by word of mouth, increasing numbers of prospectors arrived to the area with each passing day.\nThe first mention of the gold find in the Freeman's Journal was a letter from Rathdrum dated 29 September 1795 which also subsequently appeared in Finn's Leinster Journal and Saunder's News-Letter. However, Finn's Leinster Journal had broken the story proper in its edition of 16-19 September in which it described the accidental discovery of the tree-fellers, but had a smaller readership than the bigger newspapers. The gold was reported to be pure, \"as pure as any brought from the Gold Coast of Africa\", but it is unknown whether the gold was being properly assayed by this early stage. As McArdle not",
    "Occupation of buildings by right-wing political groups\nSquatting is the practice of occupying empty buildings. The occupied spaces are used for different purposes like communal living and organizing actions. Squatting is often practised by left-wing groups, but there are also cases of right-wing squatting. In these squats, the spaces are occupied by right-wing groups or organisations.\nRight-wing squats seem to be inspired by left-wing squats in their formation, appearance and practice but differ from them in other aspects. The phenomenon of right-wing squatting is mostly prevalent in countries with big left wing squatting movements.\nNetherlands\nIn 2000 a building in Eindhoven was squatted by neo-Nazis from the right-wing organisation Voorpost. They initiated a squatted social centre, which was used as a place for organisation of the group. In 2008 a right-wing movement squatted a building in Monster near Den Haag in the wake of protests against a squatting ban.\nItaly\nItalian right-wing groups have been trying to establish squatted right-wing social centres since the 1980s. Since 2003 CasaPound Italia has been upholding a right-wing squat in Rome. They want to spread their activities and squats all over Italy and name housing needs as their main reason for squatting.\nSpain\nIn 2014 the Movement \u2018Hogar Social\u2019 initiated a squatting in Madrid. Linking social issues with xenophobic ideas they named the housing shortage for \u2018native families\u2019 as their motivation for squatting. The campaign behind this was initiated by the neo-Nazi Republican Social Movement.\nFrance\nIn 2017 right-wing youth organisation 'Bastion Social' squatted in Lyon. They claimed that there would be too little housing for non-immigrants and emphasized the fear of 'colonisation' by mass-immigration.\nGermany\nAfter the Fall of the Berlin Wall neo-Nazis became more visible again in Berlin. From December 1989 on new groups joined from the West and in January 1990 a new neo-Nazi Party 'Nationale Alternative' (NA) was founded. In the wake of GDR collapsing there was a power vacuum and many empty buildings at that time. Because of these exceptional conditions the Berlin districts Friedrichshain and Prenzlauer Berg became places for many left-wing squats. In need of a place for organising the party-affairs, NA squatted a house in Lichtenberg, the district right next to Friedrichshain, in February 1990. Because the house they first occupied was not owned by the state they were offered alternatives. They chose Weitlingstra\u00dfe 22 and founded \u2018B\u00fcrgerinitiative Wohnraumsanierung e.V.\u2019, making the squatting seem like a project for common good.\nThe occupied building served as a headquarter, a space for communal living, planning actions, partying, propaganda production, a meeting point for (international) neo-Nazi groups, a place to stay for leading figures in neo-Nazi parties and terrorist groups. To the media it was communicated that the goal was to realise communal living and include right-wing practices in everyday life. Activities from the squatters of Weitlingstra\u00dfe 22 also extended the occupied space and influenced the neighbourhood. The group committed acts of violence against asylum homes and left-wing squats in the area. There were similarities to left-wing squatting. Having bars in front of the windows, political claims on banners visible on the outside of the building, wearing military uniforms and motorcycle helmets and threatening the political opponent were common both in Weitlingstra\u00dfe 22 as well as in other left-wing squats in Berlin. Another similarity was a solidarity-centred practice of shared income and expenses in the household. In other areas the squatters differed significantly from their left-wing counterparts. The clothing style was cleaner and more disciplined, the facades of the house plainer. They emphasized traditional values like order and tidiness in their communal living, which can also be interpreted as a fa\u00e7ade of discipline presented to the outside. Hierarchies, traditional gender roles and exclusive \u2013 racist and xenophobic - forms of equality were promoted.\nIn April 1990 the police carried out a raid in Weitlingstra\u00dfe 22 and arrested the NA leaders. The squatting declined further after an Antifa-Demo against the squat in June 1990. In July 1990 the lease agreement was terminated. Disagreements between members of NA and Gesinnungsgemeinschaft der Neuen Front (GdNF) as well as the lack of NA's success in the elections lead to the dissolution of the squatting and the house being empty at the end of 1990. Today the conditions for right-wing squatting have changed. Police repression and the housing situation make the practice of squatting harder.\n",

    "Species of lichen\nRhizocarpon torquatum is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichen in the family Rhizocarpaceae. This species is recognised by its pale, thick, smooth, areolate thallus that contains hypostictic acid as a major metabolite, and its large apothecia (fruiting bodies) that are distinctively adorned with a whitish inner collar in immature stages.\nTaxonomy\nIt was first described by the lichenologists Patrick M. McCarthy, John Alan Elix, and Gintaras Kantvilas. The specific epithet torquatum\u2014meaning adorned with a collar in Latin\u2014refers to the characteristic appearance of the apothecia's margin, which often retains a whitish inner collar. This feature, along with the chemical profile and apothecial anatomy, helps distinguish Rhizocarpon torquatum from similar species.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Rhizocarpon torquatum is crustose and epilithic, forming colonies approximately 1\u20134\u00a0cm (0.4\u20131.6\u00a0in) wide, varying in colour from greyish white to pale grey with a greenish tint. The thallus, up to 300\u00a0micrometre (\u03bcm) thick, with a rimose to areolate texture with smooth to coarsely rugulose areoles that are contiguous and mostly flat. The thallus lacks a true cortex, instead featuring an uppermost necral layer directly above a discontinuous algal layer.\nApothecia (fruiting bodies) are numerous, ranging from 0.52 to 1.30\u00a0mm in diameter, with a margin that can be thick and varies from being the same as the blackish disc to considerably paler. These reproductive structures are initially embedded but become more prominent as they mature. The excipulum is annular, typically darkening to brown-black, and the hypothecium is thick.\nHabitat and distribution\nRhizocarpon torquatum is known only from its type locality along the Frankland River in north-western Tasmania. It grows on seasonally inundated, siliceous rocks within the river bed, an environment that also supports a diverse range of other rock-dwelling lichen species adapted to periodic disturbances. These species include: Paraporpidia leptocarpa, Baeomyces heteromorphus, Trapelia coarctata, Stereocaulon ramulosum,Hymenelia lacustris, and the only known locality of Porina australis.\n",
    "\nAleksey Gavrilovich Rogov (pseudonym Trofim Ryabov; March 15, 1886, Durasovo, Penza Governorate \u2013 1950, Moskva) was a Bolshevik terrorist, one of the leaders of the Krasnoyarsk Republic (1905), a delegate to the All\u2013Russian Constituent Assembly and a member of the All\u2013Russian Central Executive Committee, People's Commissar of Communication Routes of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (1918).\nBiography\nEarly years. Bolshevik locksmith\nAleksey Rogov was born on 15 March 1886 in the village of Durasovo, Penza Uezd, province of the same name (or at the South Altay Mine in Tomsk Governorate) in the family of a \"proletarian\" (miner). At the end of the 1890s, the Rogov Family moved to Krasnoyarsk. Aleksey graduated from a parochial school, after which, together with his father, he went to work at the Main Railway Workshops in Krasnoyarsk.\nIn November 1902, Rogov was an active participant in the \"ticket strike\", and in August of the following year he led a three\u2013day strike of student workers (together with Pyotr Roslyakov and V. Stroganov, who were later executed). In 1903\u20131904, Rogov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, where he joined the Bolsheviks.\nIn January 1904 Aleksey Rogov was dismissed from the railway workshops \"for unreliability\". In search of work he went to Sankt\u2013Peterburg, but returned to Krasnoyarsk in 1905 and got a job as a mechanic in the depot of the local railway station. After this, he was elected a member of the Krasnoyarsk Underground Party Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party.\n1905. Krasnoyarsk Republic. Arrests and escapes\nIn 1905, during the December Armed Uprising of Workers of the Krasnoyarsk Railway Workshops and Depots, nineteen\u2013year\u2013old Rogov became one of the leaders of the uprising. He ended up in the leadership of the Krasnoyarsk Republic, working together with its \"president\" \u2013 warrant officer Andrey Kuzmin.\nAfter the suppression of the Krasnoyarsk Uprising Rogov was imprisoned, but on 14 May 1906 he escaped (together with Aleksandr Melnikov, Innokentiy Vorontsov and some other \"prominent figures of the republic\") and soon appeared in Baku under the name of Trofim Ryabov. In 1906\u20131907 he worked in the local \"Council of the Unemployed\" and in the \"Union of Oil Industry Workers\". On instructions from the Baku Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, he participated in the murder of the manager of the Eastern Society Plant; was arrested in the fall of 1909, but escaped from Baku Prison.\nAfter escaping again, Rogov again found himself in the Far East, where he became a member of the Harbin Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. In 1909, Rogov came to Krasnoyarsk illegally to conduct revolutionary work. Here he worked as a machinist at the Bekker Brick Factory and actively participated in the activities of the Krasnoyarsk Party Organization.\nIn June 1911, Aleksey Rogov organised a strike of workers at a brick factory and builders of a military town: this strike \"ended in victory\". But its organizer was arrested, identified, and on February 18, 1912, he was sentenced to eight years of hard labor (under Article 102 of the Criminal Code), which he served in the Aleksandrovskoe Central Prison, known for its cruelty, near Irkutsk.\n1917. Constituent Assembly and All\u2013Russian Central Executive Committee\nIn 1917, after the February Revolution, Aleksey Gavrilovich, who was amnestied on 6 March, came to Krasnoyarsk again: on 19 March he and former \"president\" Andrey Kuzmin arrived by morning train.

    "William MacLellan was 6th Lord Kirkcudbright from 1734 to 1762. Though his son, John, did not present a petition to establish his right to the title of Lord Kirkcudbright until 1767. Born c. 1690 in Borness, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, William was the son of William MacLellan of Balmangan and Agnes McCulloch.\nBiography\nAs indicated in the Register of Edinburgh Apprentices, William MacLellan was apprenticed to John Lennox, skinner, on 22 August 1705. He continued to develop his trade as a leather tanner and glover, selling his goods in the guildhalls of Edinburgh. \nWilliam MacLellan married Margaret Murray in Edinburgh, Scotland, on September 13, 1710. They had eleven children: Margaret, Charles, Samuel, Agnes, William, Isobel, James, Edward, Agnes, John, and Mary. \nIn 1711, John Russell of Bradshaw, an Edinburgh lawyer, lodged a comprehensive accusation against William McClellan. William was the eldest legitimate son and expected heir of the late William McClellan of Balmangan, and also the grandchild of the late Robert McClellan of Balmangan. The accusation pertained to William's attempt to establish himself as the rightful heir to his grandfather's estate. In 1712, William McClellan renounced his rights as heir, because if he entered as heir, it would have been to his greater prejudice, and consequently he gave all his bonds and titles to John Russell. The latter eventually obtained sasine of Chapeltoun and Borness in 1732. \nOn April 2, 1734, William MacLellan of Borness, glover in Edinburgh, and son to William MacLellan of Balmangan, was specially served heir to James MacLellan, last Lord Kirkcudbright, who was the lineal descendant of Robert, 1st Lord Kirkcudbright, so created Anno 1633; who represented Sir Thomas MacLellan of Bombie, Kirkcudbright, who lived in 1490. This service was clear and well connected. William MacLellan of Borness assumed the title of Lord Kirkcudbright upon the death of James MacLellan, 5th Lord Kirkcudbright, and was served heir-general on April 9, 1734. \nOn June 6, 1734, a protest was entered by the Earl of Marchmont against the persons claiming to represent the Lords Borthwick, Kirkcudbright, and Rutherford, their titles having lain so very long dormant, and still wanting the sanction of the House of Peers. Another was entered by Ephraim M\u2018Clellan of Barmagachan, and also by James M\u2018Clellan, son of the late Provost MacLelan, who claimed the title of Lord Kirkcudbright. Also one by Captain John Rutherford, claiming the title of Lord Rutherford. \nMacLellan is sometimes referred to as the 7th Lord Kirkcudbright, a common misconception that arises due to the fact that in 1668, John McClellan of Auchlane, in the Parish of Kelton and the County of Kirkcudbrightshire, made a supplication as heir of the deceased William MacLellan, 4th Lord Kirkcudbright, as nephew of John MacLellan, 3rd Lord Kirkcudbright, but immediately renounced his right as heir because he was pursued by his father William MacLellan of Auchlane's creditors and lacked sufficient funds to pay off his debts. Nevertheless, he is occasionally referred to as a Lord Kirkcudbright, despite the fact that he never possessed the title.\nThe Lords of Session, on their report on the Union Roll of 1739, stated that William McClellan had voted as Lord Kirkcudbright at the election of Representative Peers in 1734 and at subsequent elections down to 1739. At the election of 1741, a protest was entered against the vote by James McClellan, eldest son of the deceased Sir Samuel McClellan, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, in which he stated that the right to the Peerage had been referred by the King to the Law Officers of the Crown. The votes of both parties seem to have been received. At the next election protests were given in by both claimants: that of William McClellan stated that the Lord Advocate and Solicitor General for Scotland had reported on James McClellan's petition to the effect that he had not made good the allegation that he was nearest heir-male of the first Lord Kirkcudbright, and that in consequence his claim to the peerage fell to the ground. James McClellan lodged another protest, and again both their votes seem to have been taken. James, however, did not pursue his claim further, and William McClellan voted as Lord Kirkcudbright at all subsequent Elections of Peers down to 1761, except that of 1744. \nOn April 27th, 1742, William MacLellan, 6th Lord Kirkcudbright, was among the twenty-three Peers present to elect John  Marquis of Tweeddale a Peer of Scotland. \u201cFriday last the most honorable John Marquis of Tweeddale was elected at Holyroodhouse (nemine contradicente) one of the sixteen Peers, to represent the Peerage of Scotland in Parliament, in room of Charles Earl of Hoptoun deceased.\u201d\nOn November 30, 1748, a dispensation passed the Great Seal, to enable Charles Addington, Clerk, M.A. Chaplain to the Right Honorable Lord Kirkcudbright, Baron of Bombie, to hold the Rectory of Litchborough in the County of Northampt",
    "Coprolite museum in Williams, Arizona, U.S.\nThe Poozeum is a museum in Williams, Arizona, dedicated to coprolites (fossilized feces). It was founded in 2014 as a website and resource center by George Frandsen, who owns the world's largest collection of coprolites. Pieces from Frandsen's collection served as a traveling exhibition before the Poozeum opened its physical location in 2024.\nThe Poozeum includes 8,000 coprolites, including Barnum, the largest coprolite to have been discovered, a  9.28\u00a0kg (20.5\u00a0lb) specimen believed to have been pooped by a Tyrannosaurus rex.\nBackground\nPoozeum founder George Frandsen began collecting coprolites as an 18-year-old, purchasing his first piece of fossilized feces from a rock and fossil store in Moab, Utah. He expanded his collection over the years, and by 2016 it included 1,277 specimens and was recognized as the largest collection of its kind in the world, earning it a Guinness World Record. By 2021, the collection had grown to 5,000 coprolites. To differentiate coprolites from rocks, Frandsen looks for \"the proper sphincter marks\".\nThe museum\nFrandsen was motivated to establish the Poozeum due to the paucity of coprolite representation in museums. The Poozeum was established as an online gallery in 2014. Frandsen, then based in Florida, would also lend his coprolites to museums as a travelling exhibition. In 2024, Frandsen quit his corporate job, sold his house, and moved to Arizona to open a physical museum for the collection.\nThe Poozeum opened in Williams, Arizona, along Route 66, on May 18, 2024. It has the slogan, \"#1 for fossilized #2\", and bills itself as the \"world's premier dinosaur poop museum and gift shop\", selling dinosaur-themed merchandise. The museum includes a replica of Titanosaur poop, measuring 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) in length. Aside from the collection of coprolites, the museum has a bronze statue of a Tyrannosaurus rex squatting on a toilet. The statue, named The Stinker, is a nod to Auguste Rodin's The Thinker.\nEntry to the museum is free to the public.\nCoprolite collection\nThe Poozeum holds Frandsen's collection, which as of 2024 numbers 8,000 coprolites. It includes coprolites dating from 10,000 years ago to 400 mya. The coprolites range in size from tiny pebble-sized specimens to a behemoth weighing over 9\u00a0kg (20\u00a0lb).

It is believed to have come from a Tyrannosaurus rex and was discovered in Harding County, South Dakota. It was given the name Barnum after paleontologist Barnum Brown, who discovered the T. Rex. The coprolite is 67.5\u00a0cm (26.6\u00a0in) long by 15.7\u00a0cm (6.2\u00a0in) wide and weighs 9.28\u00a0kg (20.5\u00a0lb). An X-ray fluorescence analysis of the specimen showed the presence of phosphorous and calcium in significant amounts. It also contains a high percentage of crushed bone inclusions. Barnum holds the Guinness World Record for being the \"world's largest fossilized excrement from a carnivore\".\nOther coprolites\nFrandsen purchased a coprolite found near Summerville, South Carolina, with bite marks from an online vendor.

    "Austrian/German scholar of Ethiopia (1928 \u2013 1993)\nErnst Hammerschmidt and two monks on a boat in Lake Tana, Ethiopia in 1963\nErnst Eduard Maria Hammerschmidt (29 April 1928 \u2013 16 December 1993) was a scholar of Ethiopia as well as Ethiopian Christianity.  From 1970 to 1990 he was professor for African languages \u200b\u200band cultures at the University of Hamburg, specializing in Ethiopian studies: history, culture, religion, and classical Ethiopic literature.  He also spent much of his life as a priest in the Old Catholic Church of Austria, and served as coadjutor bishop from 1991 to 1993.\nBiography\nErnst Hammerschmidt was born in 1928 in Marienbad, Czechoslovakia (Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b); he and his family were Sudeten Germans.  The German-speaking Volksdeutsche were expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1945 after the end of World War II, including Hammerschmidt and his family.  He finished his high school education in Weiden in der Oberpfalz in Bavaria.  He spent an extensive amount of time in higher education, studying philosophy, theology, oriental studies, and law.  He attended the University of Bamberg from 1946 to 1948, the University of Innsbruck from 1949 to 1950 (gaining a licentiate of Philosophy), the theological college of St. Florian Monastery near Linz in 1950\u20131951, the University of Salzburg in 1951\u20131952 (gaining a doctorate in philosophy), and the University of Vienna in 1952\u20131953 (earning a doctorate in theology).  This was followed by studies on liturgical texts of the Coptic Church and Ethiopian Orthodox Church at the University of M\u00fcnster (Westphalia) in 1954\u20131955, the University of Oxford in 1955\u20131957 (earning a degree as Bachelor of Letters), and again at the University of Vienna in 1957\u20131958.  He completed his habilitation in 1962 at Saarland University, where he then taught as a private lecturer.  He was appointed adjunct professor there of Oriental Studies in 1968.\nIn 1970, Hammerschmidt gained a position as full professor for African languages \u200b\u200band cultures in the Oriental Studies department of the University of Hamburg, where he succeeded Johannes Lukas\u00a0. This shifted the focus of the department toward Ethiopian studies, Hammerschmidt's specialty.  He completed a third dissertation in 1986 at the University of Vienna, this time earning a Doctor of Jurisprudence in law.  Oxford awarded him a doctorate in literature in 1989; Hammerschmidt had attained four separate doctorates.  He took emeritus status at Hamburg in 1990 and moved back to Austria.\nHammerschmidt married Ilse Br\u00fcner in 1955.  They would go on to have two children, Ulrich and Verena.\nHe converted from the Roman Catholic Church to the Old Catholic Church of Austria in 1957.  Hammerschmidt was ordained a priest by Bishop Stefan T\u00f6r\u00f6k\u00a0 on June 27, 1958 (the Old Catholic Church allows married priests).  He suspended his work with the Austrian Old Catholics when he moved to Germany (Mannheim, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Hamburg) in the 1960s, participating in the German community of Old Catholics instead.  In 1990, after his retirement from Hamburg, he took on management and examination duties at the Vienna Theological Seminary of the Old Catholic Church.  In July 1991, he became bishop coadjutor to Bishop Nikolaus Hummel\u00a0.  In August 1993 he and his wife fell out with the Old Catholic Church and converted back to the Roman Catholic Church, although he continued to work with the Old Catholic Church's journal, Internationale Kirchliche Zeitschrift\u00a0.\nHammerschmidt's grave at Vienna Central Cemetery\nHammerschmidt died on 16 December 1993, in a car accident in Baden bei Wien.  He was buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery.  His extensive private library of Ethiopian works and manuscripts was given to the Asia Africa Institute of the University of Hamburg.\nScholarly work\nHammerschmidt was particularly interested in codicology (the study of manuscripts), literature in the classical Ethiopic language (Ge'ez), and the history of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. While at Hamburg, he founded the Aethiopistische Forschungen, a scholarly monograph series focused on Ethiopian studies.  He continued his involvement until his death in 1993, with the last volume he edited #35.\nMuch of his time in the 1960s was spent in Ethiopia where he performed his most significant scholarly work and contributions.  He was on good terms with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, in particular Abuna Theophilos, then the Archbishop of Harar (later to become Patriarch).  He gained permission to undertake a cataloguing project of ancient manuscripts held on monasteries in the islands of Lake Tana, largely in classical Ge'ez (by then a liturgical language, as Amharic was used for everyday communication).  Hammerschmidt photographed 31 manuscripts held at Gabriel Monastery on the island of Kebr\u0101n, 22 manuscripts on Rema Island, none on Tana Qirqos (the monks had fled for unrelated reasons), 67 manuscripts on Daga Island, and more manuscripts at Dabra Maryam monastery on a peninsula.  182 manuscripts ",

    "Species of lichen\nEremothecella cyaneoides is a species of foliicolous (leaf-dwelling) lichen in the family Arthoniaceae. Identified as a new species in 2001, it is a distinct species of leaf-dwelling lichen found in Queensland, Australia. This species is marked by its continuous or marginally dispersed, smooth, whitish-grey thallus. It hosts a phycobiont of the genus Phycopeltis, characterised by rectangular cells arranged in radiate rows.\nTaxonomy\nEremothecella cyaneoides bridges the gap between the species Arthonia cyanea and Eremothecella macrocephala, displaying intermediate characteristics such as pruinose, bluish apothecia (fruiting bodies) and filiform (threadlike) conidia. The species differs from Arthonia cyanea in its larger ascospores and from Eremothecella macrocephala in having smaller, less septate ascospores and a non-enlarged proximal cell. This species highlights the close connection between Eremothecella and foliicolous Arthonia species, raising questions about the distinctiveness of the genus Eremothecella. Despite limited material, the formal description of Eremothecella cyaneoides was deemed necessary due to its systematic implications.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Eremothecella cyaneoides is epiphyllous, appearing either continuous across the leaf surface or marginally dispersed, with a smooth texture and whitish-grey colour. Its apothecia (fruiting bodies) are adnate (closely attached), rounded or slightly irregular, measuring 0.7\u20131.2\u00a0mm in diameter, and feature a distinctive dark bluish-grey disc, often with a thick whitish pruina. The hypothecium is pale yellowish-brown, and the hymenium is colourless, with an epithecium of horizontal hyphae in pale yellowish to greyish brown.\nParaphyses within the hymenium are branched and anastomosing, leading to broadly ovoid to roughly spherical asci. Ascospores are broadly clavate, 3\u20135-septate, colourless, and measure 25\u201335 by 8\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm. Pycnidia are applanate (horizontally flattened), greyish black, and similar in anatomy to Eremothecella macrocephala, while conidia are filiform (threadlike) and mostly broken into 1\u20133-septate pieces.\n",
    "Bourgeois country house in Leipzig, Germany\nThe Gohlis Palace (in German: Gohliser Schl\u00f6sschen) is a Rococo building in the Leipzig borough of Gohlis, Germany, built as a representative bourgeois country house. It is one of the city's sights.\nLocation\nNorth side (courtyard side) (2022)\nThe plot of the Gohlis Palace stretches between the streets named Menckestrasse (courtyard side) and Poetenweg (garden side) in Leipzig-Gohlis. It is about 2 kilometres (1\u00a0mi) from the city center and only 200 metres (656\u00a0ft) from the Rosental landscape park via Turmgutstrasse and the Parthe Bridge (Parthenbr\u00fccke).\nHistory\nIn 1755/56, the Leipzig councillor and council architect Johann Caspar Richter (1708\u20131770) had a summer palace built in the then village of Gohlis, northwest of Leipzig. The plot of land on which the building was constructed was created by merging two adjacent farms that belonged to Christiana Regina Richter (1724\u20131780), the owner's wife. Comparative studies suggest that the Leipzig municipal architect Friedrich Seltendorff (1686\u20131752), who was influenced by the Dresden architect Johann Christoph Kn\u00f6ffel (1700\u20131778), provided the design.\nDue to the high contribution payments that Richter, as a wealthy citizen of Leipzig, had to make during the Seven Years' War, the interior work was delayed. After Johann Caspar Richter's death in 1770, the next husband of Richter's widow, Johann Gottlob B\u00f6hme (1717\u20131780), professor of history at Leipzig University, completed the work. The Leipzig painter and sculptor Adam Friedrich Oeser created the paintings in the ballroom of the castle. The castle can be seen as an intellectual center during this period. Georg Joachim G\u00f6schen and Christian Gottfried K\u00f6rner are said to have been guests, as was Friedrich Schiller during his stay in Gohlis in 1785.\nIn 1793, the Gohlis Palace was bequeathed to the city of Leipzig. During the Battle of Leipzig of 1813, it initially provided quarters for high-ranking military officers, and then served as a military hospital. In 1832, the city council sold it to the Alvensleben family, from whom it passed in the next generation to the Leipzig merchant Christoph Georg Conrad Nitzsche. In 1906, the city finally became the owner of the building.\nAfter renovation in 1934/35, it was opened to the public as a \"House of Culture\" and used for cultural events. From 1951 to 1985, the Bach Archive Leipzig was also based here.\nDuring the general renovation from 1991 to 1998, the building was restored to its 18th century condition. From 1998, the Cultural Office of the City of Leipzig ran the house. At the end of 2003, austerity measures forced its closure. Between 2004 and 2020, the Friends of Gohliser Schl\u00f6sschen eV operated the complex. Since 1 April 2021, the newly founded \"Gohliser Schl\u00f6sschen | Musenhof am Rosental gemeinn\u00fctzige GmbH\" has operated the palace complex. The aim is to preserve the culturally and historically significant building and the associated baroque garden in its original structure, in strict compliance with the heritage protection requirements. At the same time, the entire palace complex is to be made accessible to as wide a public as possible. Through culturally appealing and varied event formats, flexible space options and opening times tailored to needs, the cheerful mood and lightness of the Rococo is conveyed and the Gohlis Palace is developed into a center of social life and civic responsibility. The rooms are used for concerts and theater events as well as exhibitions. The Oeser Hall on the upper floor is available for civil and non-denominational weddings, while the stone hall, which can be accessed from the gardens, provides a dignified setting for funeral ceremonies. Guided tours are held and some rooms are used as a cultural caf\u00e9 for catering or can be booked for company or private family celebrations.\nArchitecture\nThe main building of the Gohlis Palace is a three-wing complex about 40 metres (131\u00a0ft) wide with side wings just 4 metres (13\u00a0ft) long on the courtyard side. The risalit in the middle section is flat on the courtyard side and arched outwards on the garden side and is slightly divided by lesene strips. Above this rises a 36 metres (118\u00a0ft) tall tower-like structure, which is why the complex was previously called the Turmgut (Tower Manor). Because of the hillside location, in addition to the ground and upper floors on the courtyard side, there is also a base floor on the garden side. The risalits and the tower structure feature decorative Rococo elements (rocailles) .\nThe middle section contains three representative rooms, one above the other, facing the garden. On the ground floor is the stone or garden room, a vaulted room. Above this is the salon and on the upper floor is the ballroom. The ceiling painting in this room shows a depiction of the \"Life of Psyche\" by Adam Friedrich Oeser. Next to the door are two evening fantasy landscapes by the same painter.

    "2004 live album by Evan Parker, Alexander von Schlippenbach, and Paul Lytton\nAmerica 2003 is a two-disc live album by saxophonist Evan Parker, pianist Alexander von Schlippenbach, and drummer Paul Lytton. It documents two concerts presented during a month-long tour of the United States, with disc one recorded on May 1, 2003, at the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center, and disc two recorded on May 14, 2003, at the Seattle Asian Art Museum. The album was released on CD in 2004 by Psi Records.\nOn the tour, Schlippenbach was a replacement for bassist Barry Guy, who found himself unable to participate at the last minute. As a result, the group is a blend of Parker's usual trio (Parker, Guy, Lytton), and Schlippenbach's trio (Schlippenbach, Parker, Paul Lovens). All track titles were taken from \"The Nature Theatre of Oklahoma,\" the unfinished final chapter of Franz Kafka's novel America.\nReception\nIn a review for AllMusic, Fran\u00e7ois Couture wrote: \"The pianist tends to bring out the softer, jazzier side of Parker, but this time the sax player is downright melodious at times... Parker's music often stretches out across the dynamic spectrum, but this album goes further, stretching through a wider range of expression...  makes a very fine document of that particular tour.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings awarded the album a full four stars, calling it \"one of Parker's most accessible and straightforwardly enjoyable\" sets, as well as \"an excellent place to start with his recent work.\"\nAndrey Henkin of All About Jazz commented: \"The music has a marvelous urgency to it that paradoxically takes its sweet time to develop... Unlike many other players of their generation who wallow in improvisation due to a dearth of creativity or have spurned it entirely, Parker, Schlippenbach and Lytton take it seriously and listeners will be struck with wonder at the results.\"\nJazzWord's Ken Waxman remarked: \"within the parameters of individual expression that the three have developed over the years, you can hear echoes of honking R&B saxmen from Parker and boogie-woogie bluescians from Schlippenbach... Jazz, boogie woogie, atonality, free music, whatever... In this configuration Parker, Schlippenbach and Lytton build an unanticipated novel sound from the sum of their techniques, backgrounds and future ideas.\"\nWriting for One Final Note, Russell Summers praised Lytton's contribution, noting that the album \"shows Lytton's inventiveness within a fresh setting.\" He wrote: \"Lytton propels the music with an almost swing feel, which complements Schlippenbach's Monk influence throughout...

The live recordings... show the strength of this great trio.\"\nIn an article for Paris Transatlantic, Nate Dorward wrote: \"Both performances start calmly enough, but within minutes they've reached whirlwind speed... what gives the music its excitement is the sense that it's always a step away from another insanely accelerated spin-cycle. It's scary enough how fast and dense it gets; even scarier, it's delivered so lucidly you can actually follow it even at warp speed.\"\nBill Meyer of the Chicago Reader stated that each member of the trio has \"attained singular mastery of his instrument, and between them they've stripped the jazz vernacular out of their musical language.\" He commented: \"America 2003... \"flows inexorably from one possibility to the next, including jagged juxtapositions of density and space and a bit of serialist boogie-woogie.\"\nTrack listing\nDisc 1\n\"Rejoicing in Their Hearts Over the Journey\" \u2013 21:48\n\"Ask to be Taken On as a Trumpeter\" \u2013 5:43\n\"This Blowing of Trumpets Confused Them\" \u2013 9:48\n\"What Memories of the Past Were Recalled!\" \u2013 8:19\n\"Perhaps This Was His Chance\" \u2013 8:25\n\"To Avoid Monotony\" \u2013 6:07\nDisc 2\n\"No One Wanted to be an Artist but Every Man Wanted to be Paid for His Labours\" \u2013 15:00\n\"The Breath of Coldness\" \u2013 10:19\n\"Are You Strong Enough for Heavy Work?\" \u2013 10:07\n\"I Had a Friend Among the Angels\" \u2013 12:52\n\"Down With All Those Who Do Not Believe In Us\" \u2013 11:32\nPersonnel\nEvan Parker \u2013 saxophone\nAlexander von Schlippenbach \u2013 piano\nPaul Lytton \u2013 percussion\n",

    "Chinese village official (1989-2019)\nIn this Chinese name, the family name is  Huang.\nHuang Wenxiu (Chinese: \u9ec4\u6587\u79c0; pinyin: Hu\u00e1ng W\u00e9nxi\u00f9; 18 April 1989 \u2013 17 June 2019) was a Chinese Communist Party village official of Zhuang ethnicity. During her time as head of a village in Guangxi, she dedicated herself to poverty alleviation efforts such as promoting economic development and implementing poverty reduction initiatives. Following her death in 2019 from flash flood, the Chinese Communist Party posthumously elevated Huang into a national model for poverty alleviation.\nEarly life\nHuang was born on 18 April 1989, one of three children born to a poor peasant family in Tianyang District of Baise City in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Despite the poverty and her parents suffering from illnesses, she worked hard from a young age and was determined to receive a better education. In college entrance examinations in 2007, Huang did not perform well and in 2008, she retook examinations and on the same year, she was accepted into Changzhi University to study ideology and political science. She graduated in 2010 and in 2011, she became a member of the Chinese Communist Party.\nIn 2013, she was admitted to the School of Philosophy at Beijing Normal University and graduated with a degree in law in 2016.  Following her graduation, she gave up her desire of finding a profession in Beijing and instead decided to return back to Baise to work with rural government's poverty alleviation. When asked why she decided to work in a remote rural area, she stated that: \"Baise is the main battlefield for poverty alleviation. Why shouldn't I come? Our party is a party that truly seeks development and happiness for the people. I am a Communist Party member, and this is my mission.\"\nPolitical career\nHuang's vest identifying her as village party secretary, on display at the Museum of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing\nShe returned to Baise in 2016 and was assigned to work in the Propaganda Department of the Baise Municipal Party Committee. In August 2017, she was assigned to work as deputy secretary of the Party Committee in Naman town in Tianyang County, Baise and in 2018, she took the initiative to request to serve as the first secretary of Baini village in Leye County, a key county in Guangxi for national poverty alleviation and development work.\nWhen she first took office, she found there were 103 households with 474 people identified as registered impoverished households in the village, with a poverty incidence rate of 22%. As a result, it was categorized as a deeply impoverished village. These households were scattered across several different hills, which posed a significant challenge for her as she was unfamiliar with the village's terrain to quickly grasp the detailed situation of all impoverished households within the shortest possible time. Regardless, she engaged with the community and after two months of investigation, she basically understood the overall situation of the entire village. The village has a total of 472 households with 2068 people. There are 195 households with 883 people identified as registered impoverished households. After starting her work in the village, she led the village committee and others to conduct field visits for learning, invited technical experts for on-site guidance, conducted household-by-household mobilization and propaganda, and led party members in demonstrating agriculture techniques. These efforts swiftly promoted rapid development in the village's collective economy through horticulture. In 2018 alone, through the establishment of an e-commerce service station, they helped villagers sell their agricultural produce, generating sales of around 220,000 yuan and creating additional income of approximately 2,500 yuan per household for more than 30 impoverished families in the village.\nDuring her tenure as first secretary of Baini village, she was known for her frugal and simplistic lifestyle when providing assistance to impoverished families and left-behind children in the village. She also helped unprevilaged students, who have been admitted to universities, to apply for various subsidies, enabling them to have financial support for higher studies.\nDeath\nOn the evening of 16 June 2019, heavy rain suddenly triggered flash floods in Lingyun County, Guangxi causing severe damage to several road sections. In the early hours of June 17, Huang, who had just visited her seriously ill father in Baise, headed back to Leye County but went missing while driving through Lingyun County. On June 18, search and rescue team members found Huang's body in the downstream river channel, confirming that she had died after her vehicle was washed away by flash flood. On June 22, her funeral service was held in Baise and was attended by 100 people, and following her funeral, she was buried at Baifuyuan Cemetery in Baise.\nLegacy\nWenxiu Kindgergarten in Baini village\nIn July 2019, the General Secretary of the Chi",
    "Ukrainian politician\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is  Bohdanovych and the family name is  Boiko.\nNot to be confused with Volodymyr Boyko.\nVolodymyr Bohdanovych Boiko (Ukrainian: \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0301\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0411\u043e\u0301\u0439\u043a\u043e; born 16 February 1985) is a Ukrainian politician from Batkivshchyna who served as a People's Deputy of Ukraine from Ternopil Oblast from 2012 to 2014. Prior to his election, he was a longtime activist and a party functionary for Batkivshchyna.\nEarly life and career\nVolodymyr Bohdanovych Boiko was born on 16 February 1985 in the city of Ternopil, then part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union. He studied at the Viacheslav Chornovil Galician Vocational College\u00a0 beginning in 2002, eventually graduating with a specialisation in jurisprudence. From May 2003 to November 2004 he served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a conscript in the city of Fastiv.\nBoiko began participating in Ukrainian politics while he was studying in college, joining the Ukraine Without Kuchma and Rise up, Ukraine! protests. He joined the Batkivshchyna party on the day he became 18, and rapidly rose through the ranks, going from a member of the Ternopil city committee of Batkivshchyna in March 2005 to first deputy chairman of the Ternopil Oblast committee of Batkivshchyna by January 2008. He was also the leader of Young Batkivshchyna from April 2005 to January 2007. From 2006 to 2009, he also served as a member of the Ternopil Oblast Council.\nPeople's Deputy of Ukraine\nDuring the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election Boiko was the candidate of Batkivshchyna in Ukraine's 165th electoral district, including the city of Zboriv and its surroundings. The election was marked by claims by Boiko's opponents that his party had sold the district to agricultural magnate Ivan Chaikivskyi, as well as a \"clone\" candidate who shared Boiko's name and surname in an attempt to steal votes from him. Boiko ultimately won the election, gathering 39.53% of the vote and defeating his closest opponent, Chaikivskyi.\nFor most of his time in the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) Boiko was absent, instead spending time in his district as part of what he referred to as a strategy of \"close communication\". As part of his work, 668 appeals were submitted by Boiko in his capacity as a People's Deputy to various government bodies on behalf of citizens. Anti-corruption portal Antikor alleged that these actions were done for payments of US$5,000\u20137,000.\nBoiko did not run in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, and he ran for the Ternopil Oblast Council in 2015. He was not successfully elected.\n",

    "\nRugby League Las Vegas is an annual event held at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas showcasing the sport of rugby league. The event was started in 2024 by Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) before being joined by the United Kingdom's Super League in 2025.\nBoth NRL and Super League are regarded as the pinnacle club competitions of the sport. The event was created by the NRL to expand the audience of the competition and develop rugby league in the United States. The event is contracted until 2028.\nHistory\nIn August 2023 the National Rugby League (NRL) announced that two games of the opening round of the 2024 NRL season would be held in Las Vegas. Brisbane Broncos, Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, South Sydney Rabbitohs, and Sydney Roosters were selected to play in the event, with the remainder of round one being confirmed at a later date. The two matches took place of March 2, 2024, and marked the first NRL regular season games held outside Australia. The 2024 event saw Manly Warringah beat South Sydney and Sydney beat Brisbane in front of an audience of over 40,000, the largest attendance of any rugby league event at the time held in the United States. Both games were arird on Fox Sports in the United States. While stadium attendance was deemed a success, TV viewing fixtures were low in the United States at only 61,000, though it was 16,000 higher than the last NRL programme to be aired in the state. Viewing figures in Australia surpassed 1.6 million across both games. The day prior to the event, a Colonial Cup match between the national men's teams of the United States and Canada was held. The game ended 16\u201316.\nIn July 2024, the NRL announced that the 2025 event would feature reigning champions Penrith Panthers as well as Canberra Raiders, New Zealand Warriors, and Cronulla Sharks. In addition, the 2025 event will also feature an opening round match of the United Kingdom's Super League with competition's reigning champions Wigan Warriors facing local rivals Warrington Wolves. Like the NRL in 2024, this game marks the first regular season Super League game to be held in the United States. Further, the event would also showcase an ashes test match between the Australia and England women's national sides. Super League's involvement in the event came after a speculative email was sent to the organizers by Wigan's CEO Kris Radlinski after he watched the 2024 event on TV.\nResults\n2024\nSee also: 2024 NRL season\nGame 1\nGame 2\n2025\nSee also: 2025 NRL season and 2025 Super League season\nGame 1\nGame 2\nGame 3\nGame 4\nStatistics\nAttendances\nGames by Competition\nTeam Appearances\n",

Schaumburg was born in St. Louis, Missouri on July 7, 1842.\nHe was born to Charles and Orleana C. Schaumburg. His father was a district judge in New Orleans. His grandfather was Colonel Bartholomew Schaumburg, a distinguished United States Army officer.\nIn 1856, he was admitted to the St. Louis High School. He enrolled in the University of Virginia in 1860.\nAmerican Civil War\nAt the outbreak of the American Civil War, the university student took part in the impending struggle against St. Louis Unionists and aligned himself with the Confederate cause. When the Southern Guard, a volunteer force composed of 100 University of Virginia students formed in January 1861, he joined. Schaumburg left with the Southern Guard on April 17, 1861.\nCamp Jackson Affair\nOnce the Southern Guard disbanded at the start of May, Schaumburg became involved in a unit of the pro-secession Missouri Volunteer Militia (MVM) set up by Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson. Mobilized by Jackson to seize the U.S. Arsenal in St. Louis, the militia's plot was thwarted by Union General Nathaniel Lyon in the Camp Jackson affair. Schaumburg was captured on May 10, 1861, with the entire brigade at Camp Jackson. Days of rioting ensued after the men were marched back into the city, and he, along with other militiamen, escaped the Federal military, rejoining the pro-Confederate forces.\nMissouri State Guard\nIn the months that followed, he volunteered his services to the newly created Missouri State Guard (MSG) under the leadership of Governor Jackson's appointee, General Sterling Price. Schaumburg was an Aide-de-Camp in the State Guard's Fifth Division.\nConfederate States Army\nAlong with other Missouri State Guard officers, he transferred to enter the service of the Confederate States Army in late 1861. The volunteer troops raised from Missouri were divided into brigades and battalions. Wright Schaumburg was appointed to the First Missouri Confederate Brigade commanded by Colonel Henry Little. By order of Major General Price, Schaumburg was designated as Little's Adjutant with the rank of Captain on December 12, 1861. He was also the Quartermaster and Commissary of the brigade.\nBattle of Pea Ridge\nCaptain Wright C. Schaumburg was involved in the Battle of Pea Ridge with the Confederate Army of the West on March 7 and 8, 1862 at Elkhorn Tavern. Amid the defeat of the Confederate forces, his bridage was tasked with covering the rear on their retreat from Springfield, Missouri. Despite the loss, he was thanked by Henry Little for delivering his orders to various parts of the field under heavy fire, acting as his Assistant Adjutant-General.\nSchaumburg was appointed to the Adjutant and Inspector-General's Department of the Confederate States Army on June 24, 1862.\nBy February 1863, he held the position of Adjutant General for General Earl Van Dorn who was placed in command of forces in the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. When Van Dorn died in May 1863, General Joseph E. Johnston was assigned to the Department of the West with Schaumburg serving in his staff.\nBy October 1863, he served on General Edmund Kirby Smith's staff until the war's conclusion. He performed the duties of Inspector General for the Trans-Mississippi theater commanded by General Smith. By 1864, he had been promoted to the ranks of Major and then Lieutenant Colonel. The surrender of General Robert E. Lee's forces in the Eastern Confederacy was followed by General Smith's negotiation of his department's surrender in May 1865, marking the end of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department.\nPostbellum career\nDuring the Reconstruction Period, he returned to St. Louis and later engaged in business activities in New Orleans for many years. Schaumburg was distinguished in social, political, and financial circles, and he was a member of The Boston Club and The Pickwick Club.\nGoicouria-Cristo Expedition\nIn 1869, he joined a filibustering expedition led by Cuban General Domingo de Goicouria and his second in command Colonel Louis Eduardo Cristo. Schaumburg accepted the position of Chief of Staff for the expedition, which ultimately failed when the steamship Lilian landed in Cuba from New Orleans.\nCity Council\nIn the 1870s, he resided as a citizen of St. Louis and involved himself in the city's government. From 1876 to 1877, he worked as a clerk in the Auditor's office under St. Louis Mayor Henry Overstolz.\nHe later took up a position with the government of the City of New Orleans. During the first administration of Mayor of New Orleans Joseph A. Shakspeare in 1882, Schaumberg was on the Board of Police Commissioners.\nIn 1888, he was appointed secretary in the second administration of Joseph Shakspeare.  He held the position until the end of the term in 1892.\nUnited Con",

    "French politician\nAndr\u00e9a Kotarac (born 7 May 1989) is a French politician. He has served as a councilor from the National Rally (RN) list in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes regional council since July 2021. He was previously a member of the regional council for the Left Party (PG)/La France Insoumise (LFI) from January 2016 to September 2019.\nEarly life\nAndr\u00e9a Kotarac was born in Thonon-les-Bains, Haute-Savoie. His father, a Serbian, was an activist in the General Confederation of Labour trade union and his mother is Iranian.\nPolitical career\nFrom Socialist Party to Left Party\nKotarac was an unsuccessful candidate running on a left-wing electoral list led by the Socialist Party (PS) in his hometown of Thonon-les-Bains in the 2008 municipal elections at the age of 19. The following year, he met Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon and began participating in Pour la R\u00e9publique sociale, the predecessor organisation of the Left Party which he would joined upon its founding in 2009.\nIn 2012, Kotarac was arrested along with two other Left Front activists after getting into a violent confrontation with far-right sympathisers near Jean Moulin University Lyon 3. By this point, he was the co-leader of the Left Front's youth movement.\nHe led the Left Front electoral list in the 8th arrondissement of Lyon in the 2014 municipal elections, and the Left Party-Europe Ecology \u2013 The Greens (PG-EELV) electoral list in the first round of the 2015 regional elections in Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes before forming a united left-wing list with the Socialist Party and Citizen and Republican Movement under Jean-Jack Queyranne in the second round. He sat in the Rassemblement citoyen \u00e9cologiste & solidaire (RCES) group in the Auvgerne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes regional council after his election.\nHe was heavily involved in M\u00e9lenchon's campaign in the 2017 presidential election and ran as a La France Insoumise (LFI) candidate in Rh\u00f4ne's 7th constituency in that year's legislative election, coming in third with 13.3% of the vote in the first round of voting. Reportedly, Kotarac was a close advisor to M\u00e9lenchon regarding international issues.\nAligning with the National Rally\nIn May, Kotarac announced ahead of the 2019 European Parliament election in France that he would be voting for the National Rally, justifying his decision as \"a call to vote for the only souverainiste list, which puts forward the independence of France and which is best able to block Emmanuel Macron and his anti-social steamroller\". In response, he was expelled from the Left Party and excluded from the RECES group, with M\u00e9lenchon calling him to respect voters by resigning as regional councilor.\nIn September 2019, he became the parliamentary assistant to Herv\u00e9 Juvin, a member of the European Parliament elected on the National Rally list.\nKotarac headed the National Rally-Christian Democratic Party (RN-PCD) electoral list for the 2020 metropolitan council election of Lyon. The list garnered 7.7% of the vote in the first round and failed to win any seats.\nIn 2021, Kotarac and Juvin, neither of whom were members of National Rally despite their association with the party, founded the Localist Party (Les Localistes) ahead of the 2021 regional elections, espousing green politics and identitarian localism.\nSelected over fellow contenders Alexis Jolly and Isabelle Surply, Kotarac headed the National Rally electoral list for the 2021 regional election in Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes. He faced opposition from some of the party's leadership , who considered him too close to Marion Mar\u00e9chal, the niece and rival of National Rally leader Marine Le Pen. The National Rally did poorly compared to 2015, coming in third place in the first and second rounds of voting, garnering just 12.3% and 11.2% of the vote respectively, and losing 17 seats.\nKotarac was included in the National Rally party list for the 2024 European Parliament election in France at 35th, but failed to be elected as National Rally won just 30 seats.\nHe was the National Rally candidate in Ain's 2nd constituency for the 2024 snap legislative election, coming first in the first round of voting with 39.2% of the vote, resulting in a \"triangular\" runoff with the Ensemble Citoyens and New Popular Front candidates who came in second and third respectively. Kotarac lost the second round after the New Popular Front candidate withdrew in favour of the Ensemble Citoyens candidate, who won 55.1% of the vote.\n",
    "Holy well in Inistioge, County Kilkenny, Ireland\nSaint Columbkille's Well, St Colombkille's Well or simply Columbkille's Well (Irish: Tobar Naomh Colmcille) is a holy well in Inistioge, County Kilkenny, dedicated to Saint Colomba.\nIt is a recorded monument under the Sites and Monuments no. KK032-017011-.\nThe holy well is located above Hatchery Lane and accessible via a flight of steps from Hatchery Lane in Inistioge.\nAn information panel at the start of Hatchery Lane informs the visitor that it was the source of water for the monks in the Augustinian priory which was built in 1206.\nOne of its first descriptions was in John G. A. Prim's Nooks and Corners of the County Kilkenny (1848), but it seems to be missing from Canon Carrigan's History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory (1905).\nSeveral architectural elements from the priory were recycled in the construction of the well house, such as a font (KK032-017017-) and an architectural fragment (KK032-017018-) which is no further described in the Historic Environment Viewer as of June 2024, but which likely refers to the carved elements left and right of the gate. There is also part of a pointed window arch built into the wall above the font. Further architectural elements from the priory can be found within the well house at the back wall (see 3D model). There is also a D-shaped basin or trough lying in front of the font.\n\"Mass does be said on the 9th of June\" each year, according to a local resident of Hatchery Lane in June 2024 which confirms the information from the information panel and previous reports in the Schools' Collection and P\u00e1draig \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh's 2018 PhD thesis (see references).\nFolklore\nThe holy well has several mentions in the Schools' Collection. \nOne accounts informs that the well is dedicated to Colm Cille, \"Because he visited it one time and blessed it\". It goes on to explain that all the residents of Hatchery Lane retrieve their water from it. It describes a fish being in the well, a story which was confirmed by a resident of Hatchery Lane in 2024, the fish having been a trout. This account tells of the healing powers of the water, and how the wells is decorated with candles and flowers each year.\nA second account calls Hatchery Lane \"Hatchery avenue\" and confirms the fish living in the well and the domestic use of the water. It tells of a Mrs. Bowels having been cured of her rheumatism in her finger by the healing powers of the water. She is named \"Mrs. Boles of Inistioge\" in another account.\nA third account gives more information about the fish in saying that \"it was in 1863 not long before it was blessed by another priest and a fish was put in it\"\n. According to this account, \"Saint Columcille\" visited the well several times.\nThis account mentions the feast day of June 9.\nA fourth account specifies the fish to be a trout: \"There is a trout in the well for four years.\" It describes the stone carvings as follows: \"Saint Colmcilles head and an Angel is carved on a stone.\"\nSeveral accounts describe two trees growing next to the well which is a recurring motive at holy wells. The trees are often part of the annual pattern celebrated at the tree.\nTwo accounts mention the well having been blessed last by Father William Martin in 1863.\nGallery\nInformation board\nVideo of the approach of the well and architectural details\nExternal links\n3D model (low poly) of the holy well on Sketchfab.com\n",
    "Former lifeboat station in North Yorkshire, England\nUpgang Lifeboat Station was located just over 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) west of Whitby Harbour, midway between Whitby and Sandsend, on the coast of North Yorkshire.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1865, effectively a No.3 station for Whitby Lifeboat Station.\nFollowing the placement of a motor-lifeboat at Whitby, Upgang lifeboat station was closed in 1919.\nHistory\nIn conditions of a northerly gale, launching either of the Whitby lifeboats was proving extremely difficult. In August 1864, a request was made of the RNLI to station an extra lifeboat further along the coast, to the west of Whitby. The station would be managed by the Whitby committee, and manned by Whitby lifeboatmen. Costing \u00a3220-16s-0d, a boathouse was constructed by Robinson and Smales at the tiny hamlet of Upgang, a place that has long since disappeared off the map. A 30-foot Self-righting 'Pulling and Sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, built by Forrestt of Limehouse, and previously at Penzance, was delivered to Whitby, arriving on 4 July 1865. Funds were appropriated from a gift from Dr. H. W. Watson of Derby, and the boat was named William Watson.\nReceiving a legacy from Mrs A. E. Sykes, the lifeboat William Watson would come to be renamed Joseph Sykes, in memory of Lt. Joseph Sykes, who had once been rescued from HMS Alceste (1806), when it was wrecked in 1817. When the 20-year old lifeboat was retired in 1879, after 14 years at Upgang, it had never been called out on service. The new boat arriving at Upgang in 1879 was a 32-foot Self-righting boat, costing \u00a3282, and would also be named Joseph Sykes.\nOn 15 January 1881, the Upgang lifeboat would finally be called upon, but the outcome was not good. Along with Whitby lifeboat Robert Whitworth, she went to the aid of the brig Lumley, on passage from the River Tyne to Motril, Spain, and now stranded on rocks approximately 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) off Upgang. Despite great effort and many attempts by both lifeboat crews, neither was able to effect a rescue, and all 10 crew aboard the Lumley perished.\nThe 1879 Joseph Sykes was transferred to Rhosneigr in 1885. The boat had been launched just twice on service, with no lives saved. In her place, Upgang would receive another 32-foot Self-righting lifeboat, built by Woolfe of Shadwell, previously on service at Bamburgh Castle as the John and Betty Cuttell (ON 184). The boat would be renamed Joseph Sykes (ON 184). Very much like her predecessors, there was little demand for the lifeboat, and she too would not be called in the following 5 years on service.\n1890 saw yet another replacement lifeboat for Upgang. This was a slightly larger 34-foot Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, constructed by Watkins & Co. at \u00a3414. Provided by an anonymous donor, the boat was named Upgang (ON 298). She would come to be launched six times on service, and save 8 lives.\nUpgang was launched for the first time on service on 18 November 1893, to the steamship Southwark, but as the lifeboatmen battled the seas to reach the wreck, all 13 crew were rescued by the Rocket Brigade. Launched to the schooner Maria on 11 June 1899, the lifeboat would finally record its first life saved, in fact rescuing the three crewmen, and recovering the vessel to Whitby harbour. Five crew members of the steamship Ben Corlic were saved on 31 May 1902, when the vessel ran aground on the Upgang rocks.\nWilliam Riley of Birmingham and Leamington (ON 594)\nThe final boat to be placed at Upgang was the William Riley of Birmingham and Leamington (ON 594), in 1909. A 34-foot Dungeness-class (or Rubie) lifeboat, built by Thames Ironworks.\nOne of only two calls made on the William Riley of Birmingham and Leamington was on 30 October 1914, to the 7,400 ton hospital ship Rohilla, which ran onto rocks off Saltwick Nab to the east of Whitby in terrible conditions, with 229 people on board. Much has been documented about the rescue efforts over several days, involving lifeboats from Whitby, Scarborough, Teesmouth and Tynemouth and Upgang. On Friday 30 October, the Upgang lifeboat was transported to Saltwick, and lowered down the cliff on ropes, but the conditions were too bad to launch. On Saturday, the crew rowed for an hour, but couldn't get close, returning exhausted. Finally, other boats managed to rescue 145 of the 229 people on board. For their efforts, Coxswain Robinson and Second Coxswain Kelly were awarded The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum.\nWith a motor-powered lifeboat being placed in service at Whitby, it was decided that the lifeboat at Upgang was no longer required. The Upgang Lifeboat Station was closed in 1919.\nUpgang Lifeboat had been launched just 11 times in 54 years, saving 9 lives. William Riley of Birmingham and Leamington (ON 594) was transferred to the No.2 station at Whitby, serving until 1931. Found in disrepair in 2005, the boat was restored, and was most recently displayed on 4 March 2024, at the",
    "Yugoslav band\nBegnagrad (the name being a combination of the words Beg na grad, transl. Escape to the Castle) was a Yugoslav avant-garde/progressive rock band formed in Ljubljana in 1976. They were a prominent act of the 1970s and early 1980s Yugoslav rock scene.\nSoon after its formation, the band attracted the attention of the audience with their unconventional instrumental compositions that combined elements of rock, jazz and traditional music. They released their self-titled debut in 1982, disbanding two years after album release. In the years following the disbandment, former members of the band released two more albums, Jodlovska Ur\u0161ka (1990), featuring the material originally recorded by the band in 1977 and intended for their debut album, and Tastare (Theoldwones) (1992), featuring studio and live recordings from 1976 and 1977.\nHistory\n1976\u20131984\nBegnagrad evovled from the band \u0160est Kilometara Na Uro (Six Kilometres per Hour), active in Ljubljana in the first half of the 1970s. Begnagrad was formed in 1976, the band's lineup featuring Bratko Bibi\u010d (accordion), Bogo Pe\u010dnikar (clarinet), Vlado \u0160pindler (bass guitar), and Igor Mu\u0161evi\u010d (drums), guitarists Bojan Zidari\u0107, Igor Leonardi and Boris Romih cooperating with them on different occasions. The band performed avant-garde music with the elements of free jazz, swing, traditional music, but also of pop, and soon gained attention of the audience with their unconventional compositions \"Kranjska Gora blues nazaj\" (\"Kranjska Gora Blues Back\"), \"Jara ka\u010da\" (\"Spring Snake\"), \"Tanova\", \"Begnagrad\", \"Zimska\" (\"Winter One\"), and \"Rimish Boro\" (the name being an anagram of Boris Romih's name), the latter featuring a musical quotaion from traditional Serbian dance \"\u017dikino kolo\".\nAfter their performance at the prominent Youth Festival in Subotica in 1977, they recorded part of their songs in Radio Novi Sad studios with producer An\u0111elko Maleti\u0107. The recordings should have appeared on their first album, however that record was never released. During 1977, they performed in Belgrade's Students' Cultural Center on the Days of Slovenian Youth Culture, alongside the bands Buldo\u017eer and Pankrti. At that time, they often performed together with singer-songwriter Andrej Trobentar. Their performances featured the elements of cabaret, and during traditional Slovenian holidays they used to perform in Ljubljana kafanas. In 1978, \u0160pindler had to leave the band to serve his mandatory stint in the Yugoslav army, and Begnagrad went on hiatus.\nThe group reunited at the beginning of the 1980s. During the following years, Begnagrad went to numerous lineup and stylistic changes. They recorded their debut album in the lineup featuring Bibi\u010d, Pe\u010dnikar, Romih, Nino de Gleria (bass guitar), and Ale\u0161 Rendla (drums, violin). The album, entitled simply Begnagrad, was released in 1982 through ZKP RTLJ. The songs on the album were composed by Bibi\u010d and Romih. The band spent 1983 and 1984 performing mostly in Western Europe. They ended their activity in 1984.\nPost breakup\nAfter Begnagrad ended their activity, Nino de Gleria, Ale\u0161 Rendla and Igor Leonardi, all three graduates from the jazz department of the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, formed the alternative jazz band Quatebriga with Milko Lazar (soprano saxophone), Dejvid D\u017ear (trumpet), and Matja\u017e Albreht (saxophone, flute). The group recorded four albums, Revolution in the Zoo (1985), The Choice of the New Generation (1987), Vol. 1 (1995), and Post Mortem Dump (1997).\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, Leonardi was active on New York and New Orleans jazz scenes, for a time performing with trumpeter Don Cherry. In 1997, he formed Fake Orchestra, recording the studio albums Fake World (2004) and Made in China (2009), and the live album Fake Life (2002) with the band. The group featured De Gleria, Rendla, Jelena \u017ddrale (violin), Bla\u017e Ceralec (percussion), Primo\u017e Fleischman (saxophone, flute), Ana Vipotnik (vocals), and Janja Majzelj (vocals). Leonardi composed music for film and theatre, releasing part of these compositions on his solo albums Rezervni deli (Spare Parts, 2003) and Sangeeta (2006).\nBranko Bibi\u010d performed across the world with a number of bands. With the Swiss band Nimal he recorded the albums Voix de Surface (1990), Voix de Surface (1991), and Dis-Tanz (1992). With the backing band The Madleys, featuring Pe\u010dnikar, Shirley Hofmann (trombone), and Matja\u017e Sekne (viola and violin), he recorded the album Of Bridko Bebi\u010d (1995), featuring his compositions for accordion. He recorded three more albums with The Madleys, Na doma\u010dem vrtu (In the Home Garden, 2002), Live at Aplentone (live album, 2009), and Kabinet \u010dudes Brutka Bimbi\u010da (Brutko Bimbi\u010d's Cabinet of Wonders). At the end of the 1990s, he formed the group Accordion Tribe, recording four albums with them: Accordion Tribe (1998), Novitete in staritete (Novelties and Antiques, 2000), Sea of Reeds (2002), and Lunghorn Twist (2006). With a number of collaborators he recorded ",

He was a descendant of John Innes of Coxton, grandson of Patrick Innes, great-great-great-uncle of the first of the Innes baronets of Balvenie. \nThe line of the 1st Baronet failed in 1803. The 7th Baronet was the great-grandson of John Innes, the younger brother of the 1st Baronet. This line of the family failed on the death of the 8th Baronet in 1886.

    "Toy maker from Andhra Pradesh\nC. V. Raju is an Indian toy maker and innovator from Etikoppaka in Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh, India. He is known for  reviving the traditional art of making Etikoppaka toys, which has a geographical indication tag. He also made many vegetable-based dyes for Etikoppaka toys, and also developed new tools, techniques and methods to extend the shelf life of these dyes.\nIn 2003 Raju received 2nd Biennial National Grassroots Innovation and Outstanding Traditional Knowledge Award from National Innovation Foundation \u2013 India. He has also won the Centenary Award, the Seal of Excellence for Handicrafts from UNESCO and Lifetime Achievement Award from Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage. In 2023, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India.\nBiography\nChintalapati Venkatapathi Raju was born on 14 May 1963 in Jonnavalsa village in Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh, India. He did his secondary education in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram, and completed his SSC in 1979. He then graduated with a degree in agriculture.\nCareer\nRaju is a maker of Etikoppaka toys, which has a geographical indication. When the popularity of these toys began to wane, in 1988, Raju decided to revive the 500-year-old craft. He sells these toys to many noted galleries in India. Since 1992, he has been exporting these toys to many foreign countries including European countries.\nHe strengthened the local tradition of making vegetable-based dyes for Etikoppaka toys, making them safe for children and worked to develop new tools, techniques and methods to extend the shelf life of these dyes. Attending workshops and training courses on making natural dyes for textiles, Raju explored dyes in plant roots, bark, stems, leaves, fruits and seeds. The Crafts Council of India helped Raju to test the toxicity of these dyes. His experiments led to the production of more than 12 natural dyes, including royal red and indigo.\nRaju started Padmavati Associates,  a co-operative society of artisans to increase the income of the artisans and ensure natural dyes reach the right market. Today, 160 artisans from the village are engaged in making the toy, and they produce around 30,000- 33,000 toys per month.\nIn 2017, Raju participated in the 4th Innovation Scholar-In-Residence programme at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Delhi. He has also participated in the annual Festival of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (FINE), organized by National Innovation Foundation andDepartment of Science and Technology under the aegis of Rashtrapati Bhawan.\nAwards and honors\nIn 2003 he received 2nd Biennial National Grassroots Innovation and Outstanding Traditional Knowledge Award from National Innovation Foundation \u2013 India, an autonomous body of the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. He has also won the Centenary Award, the Seal of Excellence for Handicrafts from UNESCO and Lifetime Achievement Award from Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised Raju's efforts in promoting the traditional toy industry in his 68th Mann Ki Baat radio program. In 2023, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India.\nControversies\nRaju faced objections from other toy makers after he told an NRI who bought toys from him that some artisans today use artificial colors containing lead, cadmium and barium in Etikoppaka toys. They said that his remarks would have a negative impact on the Etikoppaka toy market itself. Responding to the topic, Raju said that he is only concerned about the quality of the toy and if anyone wants to learn how to make natural dyes for toys, he will teach them.\n",

Prior to his election, he was a soldier in the National Guard of Ukraine.\nEarly life and career\nYurii Tymoshenko was born on 3 April 1961 in the village of Divnoye, Stavropol Krai, in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union. He graduated from Ivano-Frankivsk Cooperative Professional and Technical School with a specialisation in sales consulting. From 1982 to 1983 he was a delivery driver for a Kolomyia-based catering service, before working at the Central Directorate of Trade in the Ministry of Defence of the Soviet Union from 1983 to 1985. Over the next four years, he was employed at multiple kolkhozes.\nTymoshenko was a supporter of the 1989\u20131991 Ukrainian revolution. He was part of the Ukrainian Helsinki Union and the Memorial society. He was also a member of the All-Ukrainian OUN-UPA Brotherhood\u00a0. Following the revolution, he became a painter at the Budivelnyk cooperative, where he worked until 1993. He was a delivery driver for the Ukrainian Publishing Union from 2006 to 2013.\nTymoshenko became a member of the Kolomyishchyna Self-Defence\u00a0 following Euromaidan.

The latter Tymoshenko's campaign accused the former of being a \"clone\" candidate, with the intention of confusing voters and stealing votes from her in an effort to prevent her from winning the election. Yurii Tymoshenko disputed the allegations, noting that he had declared his intention to run for president in a 2017 Facebook post and claiming that he had always wanted to be president. He denied questions by the BBC as to whether or not he had been given money to run, stating that he had taken out a loan for the bank and spent his family's earnings on it.\nTymoshenko was removed from the People's Front parliamentary faction on 17 January 2019, after announcing his decision to run. He was additionally targeted by two individuals who attempted to bribe him with \u20b45 million in return for the withdrawal of his candidacy. They were subsequently arrested. Yurii Tymoshenko was eliminated in the first round of the election, gathering 117,693 votes. Yulia Tymoshenko was also eliminated with 2,532,452, three percent behind incumbent President Petro Poroshenko.\n",

    "2011 song by Jovanotti\n\"Le tasche piene di sassi\" (transl.\u2009\"The pockets full of stones\"]) is a song by Italian singer-songwriter Jovanotti. It was released on 11 March 2011 through Universal Music Italy as the second single from his twelfth studio album Ora.\nComposition\nThe song was written by Jovanotti and Franco Santarnecchi, under the music production of Michele Canova. The singer explained that the meaning of the song is dedicate to his mother Viola Cardinali.\nMusic video\nThe music video for the song, directed by Maki Gherzi was released on March 24, 2011, through the singer's YouTube channel. Jovanotti explained that the video is inspired by Bob Fosse's film Lenny:\"It is a song that offers different possible readings, and making a video with only one visual point of view would have been limiting. It is a purely emotional song and so it was not at all easy to make a video. Then as sometimes happens, suddenly an idea came up that was interesting to us. Going around the net one night I happened to see Lenny, the Bob Fosse film, again.  Fosse in his cinema manages to portray the contrast and reciprocity between intimacy and stage. We decided to 'quote' the atmosphere of Lenny, the cinematography, even the shots.  I tell a story, not necessarily a comic story, a dramatic story, a biographical story ... a story. The viewer who will see the video will not hear what I am saying and will not even see me singing, but will see a man alone, in the dark, lit only by a bull's eye telling a story to an audience in semi-darkness, telling a story that is life, telling perhaps his life, perhaps telling the lives of those in the audience.\"\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nYear-end charts\nCertifications\nGiorgia version\nItalian singer Giorgia recorded a cover of \"Le tasche piene di sassi\", as the lead single from her first cover albumPop Heart, released on October 12, 2018, through Sony Music Italy.\nBackground and release\nThe singer described the cover as \"among the most hardest\" to perform because she had to \"find a way that I didn't actually have to find, but I just had to follow the lyrics, and yet it took me a while to get this thing in focus\". In an interview with Radio Italia Solo Musica Italiana, Giorgia explained the decision to cover the song:\"I chose it easily, it is true that it is a personal song, however that lyric so poetic is already a classic of our music, it gets straight to the soul and tells about a moment that sooner or later we all experience. The first time I heard it I cried like a desperate person, it was the first song I chose to do, I wanted to participate in that magic: I connect it very much to my son, reversing Lorenzo's idea in which instead it is the son who addresses his mother.\"Jovanotti himself prised Giorgia version, stating that \"The arrangement, by Michele Canova, respects the original version but adds a new rhythm that makes Giorgia's interpretation even more special and unique. For me it is a great honor and a recognition that is worth so much, and I want to thank Giorgia\".\nCharts\nCertifications\n",
    "Historical plant specimen collection assembled by Carl Linnaeus\nThe Linnaean Herbarium (herbarium code: LINN) is a historically significant collection of over 13,000 dried plant specimens assembled by Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778). Housed at the Linnean Society of London since 1829, it forms the foundation of modern botanical nomenclature and serves as the primary reference for Linnaeus's 1753 work Species Plantarum, the starting point for modern plant taxonomy. The herbarium includes specimens from Linnaeus's botanical explorations and global collaborations, spanning early Swedish collections to acquisitions from the Americas, Asia, and Africa.\nBegun during Linnaeus's student days, the collection grew significantly during his time in the Netherlands and England. After Linnaeus's death, his son inherited the herbarium, which was sold to English botanist James Edward Smith in 1784. Smith's acquisition and subsequent founding of the Linnean Society of London advanced the Linnaean system globally. The herbarium's organisation remains largely as Linnaeus's son left it in 1783, offering essential context for interpreting Linnaeus's specific names.\nToday, the Linnaean Herbarium is a key resource for botanical research and understanding 18th-century scientific practices. Ongoing preservation, documentation, and digitisation efforts have improved its accessibility. It remains vital for modern botanical nomenclature, providing context for about 5,900 Linnaean specific names. Current research, including the Linnaean Plant Name Typification Project, demonstrates its enduring relevance in botanical studies more than two centuries after its creation.\nHistory and significance\nCarl Linnaeus upon his return from Lapland in 1737\nLinnaeus started his herbarium as a student at Lund University in 1727\u201328, collecting about 600 Swedish plants by autumn 1729. The collection grew significantly during his time in Holland and England (1735\u201338), where he acquired specimens from Virginia, the West Indies, Central America, and various gardens. This period was vital for his botanical development, as he obtained specimens from diverse sources, including George Clifford's garden and John Clayton's Virginian collection (via Johann Gronovius). Linnaeus was an avid collector, gathering specimens from his Lapland journey in 1732 (where he named Linnaea borealis), and trips to \u00d6land, Gotland, and Sk\u00e5ne. He cultivated plants in the Uppsala Garden from seeds sent from various regions. Despite travel challenges and preservation difficulties, Linnaeus's collections formed the foundation for his extensive botanical work. His network of students, colleagues, and correspondents, including Torbern Bergman, Erik Brander, Johann Reinhold Forster, Pehr Osbeck, Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber, Anders Sparrman, and Domenico Vandelli, contributed specimens from around the world, further enriching his herbarium.\nLinnaeus was among the first botanists to leave his herbarium unbound, storing dried plant sheets separately in purpose-built cabinets. This innovation allowed easy addition, removal, and reorganisation of specimens, significantly influencing 18th-century botanical study methods. His herbarium cabinets were designed to store unbound sheets of dried plants. The specimen paper was relatively small, 12.3 by 8\u00a0inches (32\u00a0cm x 20.56\u00a0cm), and often provided scant information about the collector and collection details. Linnaeus relied on memory, using brief notes or signs to remind himself of a specimen's source.\nCover page of Species Plantarum, 1753\nBy 1753, when Linnaeus published Species Plantarum, the herbarium included specimens from southern France, other parts of Europe, Siberia, coastal China, India, southeastern Canada, New York, and Pennsylvania. After 1753, Linnaeus added specimens from South America, Jamaica, China, and the Cape of Good Hope. Lists from 1753, 1755, and 1767 provide some insight into the herbarium's contents, but the collection was not static. Linnaeus continually added to it, and it also suffered losses over the years, making it difficult to identify all original specimens.\nAfter Linnaeus's death in 1778, his herbarium passed to his son, Carl Linnaeus the Younger. When the Carl Linnaeus the Younger died in 1783, the herbarium was sold to English botanist James Edward Smith, fulfilling Linnaeus's wishes. This sale has been a source of regret for Swedish botanists ever since. While the main herbarium went to England, many Linnaean specimens stayed in Sweden. These specimens were often gifts from Linnaeus to friends and disciples. For example, about 30 plants classified by Linnaeus are in the Bergian herbarium at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Carl Linnaeus the Younger also had his own herbarium, including plants he collected and some from his father. After his death, part of this collection (the 'Herbarium parvum') was given to Baron Clas Alstr\u00f6mer, and eventually became part of the Swedish Museum of Na",
    "Mikhail Fetisov was a career police detective and member of the Moscow Militia (then known as the Moscow Municipal Militsiya) who in 1983 became the lead investigator into the Andrei Chikatilo serial murder case.  He later became a lieutenant general in the Russian police force. \nMurder investigation\nChikatilo's murders had begun as early as 1978 in the Rostov Oblast, at that time covered by a rural police militia with only a small detective force, known as the \"Division of Most Serious Crimes\".  By 1983, as murders of young boys and girls mounted across the countryside overwhelming local authorities, the Soviet government ordered a team from Moscow, with Fetisov as its commander to take charge and investigate the killings.\nFetisov, then a major in the Moscow militia, arrived in Rostov-on-Don with a team of specialists, including a forensics expert named Victor Burakov who Fetisov put in charge of a new investigation division which he christened the \"killer department\".  The two spent the next seven years searching for Chikatilo, their investigation seriously hampered by Soviet era bureaucratic methods as well as the reluctance of local Communist Party officials to even admit that a serial killer was on the loose in Rostov.\nChikatilo, who had been mistakenly released once during an initial roundup of suspects, was eventually arrested after a sting operation caught him emerging from the woods near a rural train station shortly after a young child had been killed in the same location.  Chikatilo was eventually tried and convicted for dozens of murders and executed in 1994.\nLater career\nFollowing the Chikatilo investigation, during which time Fetisov had been promoted to a colonel in the police militia, he returned in Moscow and remained in the police after the breakup of the Soviet Union.  In the new Russian Federation, Fetisov was promoted to major general and retired shortly thereafter as a lieutenant general with several civil service awards.\nCivil Service Awards\nOrder \"For Personal Courage\"\nJubilee Medal \"In Commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin\"\nMedal \"For Distinction in the Protection of the State Borders\"\nMedal \"Veteran of Labour\"\nJubilee Medal \"50 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"\nJubilee Medal \"70 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"\nMedal \"For Impeccable Service\" (Classes 1st through 3rd)\nPortrayals in media\nFetisov was later portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1995 film Citizen X.\n",

    "2014 double murder of British medical students in Malaysia\nOn 6 August 2014, two 22-year-old British medical students - Aidan Brunger and Neil Dalton - were attacked and stabbed to death in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia, where they were completing a six-week placement caring for patients in a local hospital of Sarawak. The Royal Malaysia Police investigated the case and arrested five suspects. One of these suspects, a local fishmonger named Zulkipli Abdullah, was charged with the double murder, which made international headlines as crimes against tourists in Malaysia was extremely rare.\nAfter a short but highly reported trial that concluded in March 2015, Zulkipli was found guilty of murdering both Dalton and Brunger, and sentenced to death by hanging. The higher courts heard Zulkipli's appeals thrice between 2015 and 2024 and they were all dismissed. Zulkipli is on death row as of 2024.\nDouble murder\nOn 6 August 2014, outside a bar in the Jalan Padungan area of Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia, two British nationals Aidan Brunger and Neil Dalton, both 22, were stabbed and died from the attack.\nBrunger, who lived in Kent, and Dalton, who lived in Ambergate, Derbyshire, were both students studying at the medical school of Newcastle University. Both men were on a six-week intern programme that sent them to Sarawak to work at a local Kuching hospital, and were set to complete the work placement in a few more days.\nWitnesses said that outside the bar, Brunger and Dalton were attacked by a group of men, one of whom had earlier argued with the two Britons for being noisy. The same man, who gave chase with his friends, later stabbed Brunger after catching up with him outside a car repair shop before he pursued Dalton and killed him, stabbing him around 50m away from where Brunger collapsed. An autopsy revealed that Brunger died from a single stab wound on his chest while Dalton died from a total of four stab wounds, two on his back and two on his chest.\nDalton's brother Glen and his parents Jan and Phil Dalton fondly remembered Dalton as a \"caring and thoughtful young man\" who was a sports lover and avid cricket and football fan who made friends easily. About 500 family members, friends from school and Newcastle University attended Dalton's funeral at St Peter's Church in Belper. A month later, a charity cricket match was specially held by Dalton's favorite cricket team Belper Amateurs Cricket Club in memory of Dalton.\nBrunger's parents Paul Brunger and Sue Hidson and his sister Amy also described him as a wonderful boy whose death left a massive hole in their lives, and called out his killers for the \"senseless\" murder. They were grateful to remember him as Dr Brunger after the university agreed to issue him a degree posthumously.\nTony Stevenson, the university's acting vice-chancellor who received news from the Malaysian police and later relayed it to the university, stated that the news of the killings was tragic and a blow to the school community. Reg Jordan and another staff member from the university travelled to Sarawak to provide support for their remaining students stationed in Sarawak. Jane Calvert, dean of undergraduate studies for Newcastle University Medical School, offered her condolences for the victims, who were noted to be hard-working students who left a good impression on friends and teachers around them. Residents of Kuching were shocked as it had been widely regarded as one of Malaysia's safest cities and crime against foreigners were extremely rare in Malaysia. A day after the double murder, many local residents of Kuching went to the murder scene to leave flowers as tribute for the two deceased Britons.\nIn light of the Kuching double murders, there was a huge public concern that the crimes against foreign tourists had been rising in Malaysia, the worst of which included the murder of Stephanie Foray, a French tourist who died on Tioman Island in 2011; a 39-year-old Malaysian shopkeeper named Asni Omar was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death earlier the same year when both Dalton and Brunger were murdered.\nBoth Brunger and Dalton were posthumously awarded honorary degrees by their university nine days after the occurrence of the Kuching double murder.\nInvestigations\nWithin a day of the stabbings, the Royal Malaysia Police arrested four suspects. According to the police, the suspects were a 23-year-old fishmonger, a 29-year-old mechanic, and two unemployed men aged 19 and 35. Two were previously convicted of robbery and drug offences. A week later, a fifth male suspect, aged 55, was also arrested and remanded in custody pending further inquiries.\nDeputy police commissioner Chai Khin Chung announced that the case had been solved with the arrests of the five suspected killers. The first four suspects had reportedly confessed to murdering both Dalton and Brunger. Police also revealed in a public statement that the first four suspects had consumed methamphetamine prior to the murders and were lik",

Lawsuits alleged that Khalilian used much of their investment to pay off a $4 million settlement case from the Federal Trade Commission, which arose due to Khalilian's prior involvement with a telephone marketing company sending out automated calls to people about fake extended car warranties.\nMonster Cable\nIn 2017 Khalilian was appointed as the COO of Monster Cable, a consumer electronics and manufacturing company. An article published on October 11, 2017, by Digital Trends described Khalilian as \"a former telemarketing kingpin, wannabe reality TV personality, two-time FTC loser.\"\nIn 2018, Khalilian exited as the COO, after employee's of Monster Cable sought restraining orders against him because he allegedly made threats of violence and mutilation against various employees. Fereidoun then filed a lawsuit against Monster Cable, claiming executives at the company made false allegations against him, in order to defame him. A federal judged dismissed Khalilian's lawsuit.\nAlleged murder-for-hire-plot\nIn 2019 Khalilian reportedly reconnected with one of his former employee's named Juan Esco, who was then working as an independent film producer and documentarian. Esco proposed a documentary to Khalilian, about his life controversies, with Esco telling Khalilian that he would garner notoriety from the documentary. However the purpose of the documentary was to expose Khalilian as con-artist and fraud. Once Khalilian found out about the documentary's true purpose, he became upset and agitated with Juan Esco.\nIn March 2022, Khalilian reportedly solicited Michael Sherwood, (one of his bodyguards), to assassinate Juan Esco, paying him $12,500. Sherwood accepted the offer, but instead of carrying out the murder, warned Esco of the plot against him. Esco and Sherwood then purchased fake blood, and took staged photos which showed Juan's hands bound behind his back, laying face down in a pool of fake the fake blood they purchased. Sherwood then sent the photos to Khalilian.\nAfter staging the death, Esco contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and reported the incident. The FBI expressed interest, but stated they needed more information. Sherwood then began acting as a confidential informant, recording phone calls and encounters between him and Khalilian.\nAccording to law enforcement sources, on June 20, 2023, Khalilian arranged to meet Sherwood in Las Vegas. Sherwood allegedly picked Khalilian up, and they drove around as a hidden camera recorded the audio and video of their encounter, during which Khalilian allegedly admitted his involvement in the attempted murder of Juan Esco. After Sherwood finished driving around with Khalilian, he dropped him off at a nearby Dunkin' Donuts, where federal agents were waiting to arrest him.\nKhalilian was officially charged with one count of \"use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire\" as well as one count of \"conspiracy to witness tamper.\"\nFollowing Khalilian's arrest, the United States Department of Justice published a press release alleging that between August\u2013September 2023 Khalilian, had contacted a witness in the case and instructed his family members to offer the witness a bribe. The press release also stated that Khalilian was ordered to be held without bail at the federal jail he is currently incarcerated in.\n",
    "2023 American horror film\nFor other uses, see Blackout (disambiguation).\nBlackout is a 2023 American horror film written and directed by Larry Fessenden and starring Alex Hurt, Addison Timlin and Motell Gyn Foster. As with Fessenden's previous film Depraved, it is inspired by classic monster movies (in the case of Blackout, werewolf films such as The Wolf Man) though it is not a direct remake. Fessenden has named Marvel Comics's Werewolf by Night series as an inspiration for the film, in addition to the Universal Classic Monster films of the 30s, 40's and 50's.\nPlot\nCharley Barrett, an artist in a small upstate New York town, has become a werewolf. Struggling with alcoholism and depression and realizing that he'll keep killing every full moon unless he is stopped, he sets off to try and find some closure among the various residents of town (including his ex, a local pastor, and people on both sides of a simmering local anti-immigrant movement). After an assisted suicide attempt with a silver bullet fails, he transforms into a werewolf and goes on a rampage, eventually stopped by his sympathetic ex-girlfriend, who realizes what he's become and puts him out of his misery.\nCast\nAlex Hurt as Charley Barrett\nAddison Timlin as Sharon Hammond\nMotell Gyn Foster as Earl\nJoseph Castillo-Midyett as Luis Sanchez\nElla Rae Peck as Alice\nRigo Garay as Miguel Lopez\nJohn Speredakos as Pastor Francis\nMichael Buscemi as Andy\nJeremy Holm as Harry\nBarbara Crampton as Kate\nCody Kostro as Burt\nMarc Senter as Ernie\nKevin Corrigan as Bob Kraus\nJoe Swanberg as Stuart\nAsta Paredes as Asta Carter\nClay von Carlowitz as Clay Carter\nJames Le Gros as Tom Granick\nMarshall Bell as Jack Hammond\nIn addition, there is a small cameo in a post-credit scene from Alex Breaux reprising his role of Frankenstein's monster from Fessenden's film Depraved. According to Fessenden \"This is the beginning of my monsterverse, and... I do intend to make a mashup. It\u2019s the final comment on these movies I love\" (referring to the Universal \"Monster Rally\" films such as Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man.)\nProduction\nThe script for Blackout was adapted from an episode Fessenden wrote and produced for his horror podcast inspired by 1930s radio dramas, Tales From Beyond the Pale. Fessenden claims the idea originated with a pitch (ultimately unproduced) that he made for a segment in one of the V/H/S films. Fessenden met actor Alex Hurt through his son, Jack Fessenden, who had directed Hurt in the 2021 film Foxhole. Fessenden explained: \"When I met Alex (while I was producing Jack\u2019s film), Alex revealed that he loved old monster movies, that they were why he decided to become an actor in the first place. He then revealed that he had had a volatile relationship with his dad , and it just triggered something in my mind. That\u2019s something very much a part of the original Wolf Man story, the  father-son relationship... Each of these dynamics are heartbreaking and, I thought, worth mining further.\" The elder Hurt appears in real family photographs with his son in the movie.\nOn the subject of werewolf films, Fessenden has said \"I think about the personality of the monster. What is its mythology? What about the characteristics of the monster? And that suggests the themes... With Blackout, I was thinking about a werewolf. What is that? A divided personality. Then I\u2019m like well our whole nation is divided right now, so you can see how one comes from the other.\" The fictional town \"Talbot Falls\", where most of the movie takes place, is named after Lon Chaney Jr.'s character Larry Talbot from The Wolf Man and its sequels. Hurt watched \"every Lon Chaney  movie multiple times\" and ran \"seven to 10 miles a day\" to lose weight in preparation for the role.\nFilming was significantly funded by the tax incentives from Fessenden's previous film Depraved, which took several years to arrive. The film was shot near Woodstock, New York, \"within two miles\" of Fessenden's home, allowing him to make \"handshake deals\" with locals for use of their locations, which allowed the film to be shot much cheaper.\nThe paintings depicted in the movie were created by Brooklyn-based artist John Mitchell. Mitchell had invited Fessenden to sit for a portrait, and while paining it the two had discussed their mutual interest in werewolf iconography, after which Fessenden decided to make the protagonist of BLACKOUT an artist.\nRelease\nBlackout had a world premiere at the 27th Fantasia International Film Festival in August 2023, and at the Brooklyn Horror Film Festival in October. It was released on Video on demand April 12, 2024.\nReception\nReviews of the film were generally positive. Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave it a mixed review, calling Blackout \"a werewolf psychodrama,  showcases  usual attention to performance and character-driven details,\" but concluded it \"has a lot to recommend it, but not enough to fully satisfy.\" Robert Abele of the LA times called the film \"appealingly scrappy and thoughtful\" noting ",
    "\nCatherine Wells (n\u00e9e Amy Catherine Robbins; 8 July 1872 \u2013 6 October 1927) was an English writer and poet.\nLife\nAmy Catherine Robbins was born in Islington, London on 8 July 1872, the daughter of Frederick and Maria Catherine Robbins.\nShe was described as \"fragile figure, with very delicate features, very fair hair, and very brown eyes\". Following the death of her father, she undertook degree study in order to become a teacher. She was a student of H.G. Wells at the Tutorial College in Holborn, and they married on 27 October 1895. They lived initially in Camden Town and Sevenoaks, and later at Woking and Worcester Park in Surrey. Their household in Worcester Park was portrayed by Dorothy Richardson in Pilgrimage (1915). Richardson had been a schoolfriend of Catherine Wells. The couple were known to their friends as H. G. and Jane.\nSpade House, home of the Wells family from 1900\nIn 1900, they moved to Spade House, a home built for them and designed by architect C. F. A. Voysey. They had two sons: George Philip (b. 1901) and Frank Richard (b. 1903). The Times described Catherine Wells as \"her husband\u2019s devoted friend and assistant\", and \"one of the very few transcribers who could read the odd mixture of longhand and shorthand in which he wrote his books\", adding that she showed a business acumen which supported her husband. Her own literary output, they wrote, \"was necessarily restricted by her domestic responsibilities\".\nWritings\nDuring her lifetime, Catherine Wells had a small number of writings published, predominantly in . Reviewing her stories (published posthumously in The Book of Catherine Wells), Katherine Anne Porter wrote that Catherine Wells' writing was partly a reaction against her identity being subsumed to domestic life and overshadowed by H.G. Wells. Porter argued that:this indefatigable woman asked for one thing more. She asked for one fragment of her mind to use as she liked. She resolutely set herself to write...  the stories offer a strange contrast to the portrait her husband gives.Sylvia Lynd in The Daily News described the collection as offering:a sense of the short story as a medium for revealing life rather than for surprising the reader... There is so much insight, so much observation, so much courage, so much compassion in them. Their writer was too good an artist to succeed as a magazine writer, perhaps too good a magazine writer to please herself as an artist.The Civil & Military Gazette wrote that \"For lightness of touch: power of making her readers see what she sees: and almost uncanny insight, these short stories can scarcely be surpassed\".\nDeath and legacy\nCatherine Wells died from cancer on 6 October 1927. Her funeral at Golders Green Crematorium was led by T.E. Page, using a service written by H.G. Wells. He had based this on the secular ceremony script created by humanist and educationist F.J. Gould. Attendees included George Bernard Shaw and Arnold Bennett. In an obituary in The Times, Catherine Wells was described as having been \"an admirable hostess...  a pretty sense of humour\":Nor was her benevolence confined to her home, which she made an abiding centre of harmony and good-will. For she was always ready  to help any lame dog over a stile in the most tactful and unobtrusive manner.Following her death, H.G. Wells collected Catherine's poetry and short stories for publication.The Book of Catherine Wells was published by Chatto & Windus in 1928.\n15 pocket book diaries kept by Catherine Wells are held in the archives of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n",
    "Hospital in Ruyigi Province, Burundi\nThe Rema Hospital  (French: H\u00f4pital Rema) is a hospital in the town of Ruyigi in the northwest of Ruyigi Province, Burundi.\nIt was founded in 2008, and once was flourishing, but by 2017 it had fallen into disrepair.\nLocation\nThe Rema Hospital is in the Ruyigi health district, as are the nearby Ruyigi Hospital in the settlement of Ruyigi and the faith-based Cimpaye Hospital to the east. \nIt is on the RN13 national highway just east of the town of Ruyigi.\nService\nThe Rema Hospital serves the Ruyigi health district, and also receives patients from nearby provinces.\nThe Ministry of Health reports that the status is public but does not give the target area population or quality of service metrics.\nHistory\nA center for mother and child care was built in 2007 by the Belgian and Burundian armies on land near Ruyigi owned by the family of Maggy Barankitse.\nThe hospital was developed on the same site.\nThe embassies of France, Germany and Luxembourg, the UNHCR and the Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Peterbroeck Foundation provided support.\nRema Hospital was founded by Maison Shalom, which manages it, and inaugurated on 22 January 2008.\nIn the Kirundi language Rema means providing comfort to a person who is experiencing difficulties.\nThe hospital serves mothers and children, and tries to reduce the mortality rate of pregnant women.\nIt includes a center for teaching about hygiene, nutrition, vaccines and birth control.\nIn October 2013 the Maison Shalom held a celebration of its 20th anniversity in the Rema Hospital grounds, attended by guests from the national government, UN organization representatives, ambassadors and other Europeans and Americans.\nGervais Rufyikiri, Second Vice-president of Burundi, inaugurated the Maison Candice and Maison Nathan, a neonatology unit.\nOn 4 November 2015 the Attorney General of Burundi ordered that the accounts of Maison Shalom be frozen.\nThe state took over the hospital.\nA 2017 report on its condition noted that there were now only ten patients.\nThe incubators were no longer working, pipes were broken, lamps had not been replaced, the grass was not mowed and a police position was occupying the maternal and child protection center.\nNotes\n^ The name is often capitalized as REMA, but Rema seems more appropriate, since it a Kirundi word.\n",
    "Species of lichen\nArctoparmelia incurva is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. First described in 1794 by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon, it has undergone several taxonomic reclassifications before being placed in its current genus in 1986. This yellowish-green lichen, characterised by its narrow, convex lobes and globular soralia, typically grows on sun-exposed siliceous rocks in alpine and arctic habitats. It has a circumpolar distribution, found across North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. A.\u00a0incurva can be distinguished from similar species by its specific morphological features and chemical spot test reactions. The lichen is known to host several parasitic fungi and has shown tolerance to acid pollution.\nTaxonomy\nIt was first scientifically described as a new species in 1794 by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. He classified it in the genus Lichen, as was the custom thanks to the influence of Carl Linnaeus. Following proposed transfers to various genera, including Lobaria, and the now-obsolete Imbricaria and Placodium, the taxon got transferred to Parmelia by Elias Magnus Fries in 1826. It remained in that genus for more than a century, when Mason Hale reclassified it in the large genus Xanthoparmelia in 1974. A dozen years later, he transferred it to Arctoparmelia.\nCommon names used to refer to this lichen include \"powdered rockfrog\", \"fist lichen\", and \"sorediate ring lichen\".\nDescription\nArctoparmelia incurva is a lichen with a yellowish-green thallus measuring between 0.5 and 2\u00a0cm (3\u204416 and 13\u204416\u00a0in) in diameter, often merging with others to form much larger thalli, sometimes up to 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in) wide. The thallus is very closely attached to the substrate, with the inner parts frequently showing signs of degeneration. The lobes comprising the thallus are narrow, up to 3 or occasionally 4\u00a0mm wide, radiating outwards in an intricate pattern without overlapping and are convex.\nThe upper surface of the thallus is a dull yellow-grey, becoming darker towards the centre. Soralia, which are structures that produce soredia (reproductive granules), measure 2 to 4\u00a0mm in diameter and are found at the ends of smaller, inner lobes within the thallus. These soralia are globular and scattered. The lower surface is pale and finely pubescent (covered with soft, fine hairs). Rhizines, which are root-like structures that anchor the lichen to its substrate, are sparse, dark, short, and lack septa (dividing walls).\nApothecia, the fruiting bodies of the lichen, are rare and have a brown disc. The medulla (the inner layer) and soralia are C\u2013 and K\u2013, but are KC+ (red). They react to para-phenylenediamine either Pd+ (rust-red) or Pd\u2013. Under ultraviolet light, they show a vivid glaucous blue fluorescence, indicating the presence of alectoronic acid, and sometimes also \u03b1-collatolic and/or protocetraric acids. The cortex (the outer layer) reacts K+ (yellow) and KC+ (yellow) due to the presence of usnic acid. There is significant variation in the content of protocetraric acid among populations of Arctoparmelia incurva; in some populations, it is absent, while in others, it is predominant.\nSimilar species\nXanthoparmelia mougeotiiArctoparmelia centrifuga\nWhile sharing several morphological characteristics with Arctoparmelia incurva, Arctoparmelia centrifuga can be distinguished by its lack of soredia and the presence of apothecia. Another member of the genus, Arctoparmelia subcentrifuga, also produces soredia but differs in that its soredia are diffuse rather than discrete on the upper thallus surface.\nArctoparmelia incurva bears a superficial resemblance to Xanthoparmelia mougeotii. Nonetheless, several key features set X.\u00a0mougeotii apart: its lobes exhibit less curvature, and it possesses round, flattened soralia on its surface. Furthermore, the medulla of X.\u00a0mougeotii displays a distinctive colour change from yellow to red when exposed to potassium hydroxide solution (K), yet shows no reaction to ultraviolet light (UV). Additionally, X.\u00a0mougeotii is characterised by a glossy, even outer layer.\nHabitat and distribution\nArctoparmelia incurva grows on sun-exposed siliceous rocks, and very rarely on wood. It is tolerant of acid pollution. It is widely distributed in Europe, where it has been recorded from 19 countries. In North America its range is mainly arctic, with records documented as far south as southern British Columbia and the Cascade Range. Researchers have also reported it in the Appalachians and the Great Lakes region. Arctoparmelia incurva has also been recorded in Greenland, Japan, Russia, and Ukraine.\nSpecies interactions\nLichenoconium erodens is a lichenicolous fungus species that is known to parasitise Arctoparmelia incurva. It is also a known host of Arthrorhaphis arctoparmeliae, Trimmatostroma arctoparmeliae, and Intralichen lichenicola.\n",
    "Species of plant\nSyntrichia caninervis, also known as steppe screw moss, is a desert moss species distributed throughout the world.  As an extremophile, it is able to withstand desiccation under dry conditions with little access to water and is commonly found in hypolithic communities.  It makes use of a novel adaptation to the desert environment to harvest and collect water sources such as dew, fog, snow, and rain, using tiny hairs instead of roots. In laboratory experiments, S. caninervis has shown the ability to survive in a simulated Martian environment.\nDescription\nThe plant was first described by English bryologist William Mitten (1819\u20131906) to the Linnean Society of London in May 1858, with a description published in their journal in February 1859.  It belongs to the Syntrichia genus and the Pottiaceae family. It is commonly known as steppe screw moss.\nDistribution and habitat\nS. caninervis has a widespread global distribution and is an extremophile commonly found in extreme desert environments and hypolithic communities with the capacity to withstand desiccation under dry conditions. It has been observed growing in China, Mongolia, Siberia, central and southwestern Asia, Europe, and North America.  In Tibet, Antarctica, and circumpolar regions, it is part of the biological soil crust, which is a resilient type of ground cover often found in arid lands.  In North America, the plant is found throughout the western and northwestern United States and in two western Canadian provinces. In the United States, it is found as far east as New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana, all the way through Idaho, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada, and as far west as California, Oregon, and Washington.  Two of the most common plant communities in the United States are found in the Mojave Desert and in the Columbia River drainage basin. In Canada, it is found in British Columbia and Alberta.\nExtremophile characteristics\nDrought tolerance\nS. caninervis is well-known for its ability to tolerate drought conditions, making it well-adapted to desert environments. Among these adaptions is its tiny hairs on the leaves that allow it to exploit multiple different sources of water, such as dew, fog, snow, and rain. Another example is its ability to photosynthesize once remoistened after desiccation.\nExtreme temperature tolerance\nResearch has shown that S. caninervis can survive freezing temperatures as low as \u2212196\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212320.8\u00a0\u00b0F) (in liquid nitrogen) for up to 30 days. It has also demonstrated the ability to withstand storage at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212112\u00a0\u00b0F) for up to 5 years. In both cases, the moss was able to regenerate upon thawing, with dehydrated specimens showing faster recovery compared to hydrated ones.\nRadiation resistance\nS. caninervis exhibits remarkable tolerance to gamma radiation. It can survive exposure to doses of up to 500 Gy, which is lethal to most plants and far exceeds the lethal dose for humans (around 50 Gy). Some studies have even suggested that exposure to 500 Gy of gamma radiation may promote the plant's growth.\nSimulated Martian conditions\nIn laboratory experiments, S. caninervis has demonstrated the ability to survive simulated Martian conditions. These conditions included an atmosphere composed of 95% CO\u2082, temperature fluctuations between \u221260 and 20\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221276 and 68\u00a0\u00b0F), high levels of UV radiation, and low atmospheric pressure. Dried moss plants achieved a 100% regeneration rate within 30 days after being subjected to these conditions for up to 7 days.\nVarieties\nThe Global Biodiversity Information Facility lists the following five varieties for Syntrichia caninervis:\nSyntrichia caninervis var. abranchesii (Luisier) R.H.zander\nSyntrichia caninervis var. astrakhanica Ignatov, Ignatova - Suragina\nSyntrichia caninervis var. caninervis Mitt.\nSyntrichia caninervis var. gypsophila (J.J.Amann ex G.Roth) Ochyra\nSyntrichia caninervis var. pseudodesertorum (Vondr.)

    "Kentucky trafficker and farmer (1801?\u20131836)\nJohn W. Anderson (1801?\u2013September 20, 1836) was an American interstate slave trader and farmer based near Maysville, Mason County, Kentucky.  Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court John Marshall was an investor who funded Anderson's slave speculations. Anderson was involved in the establishment of the Forks of the Road slave market in 1833. Anderson was elected to the Kentucky General Assembly in 1836 but died before he could take office. A log-built slave jail established on Anderson's property is now on exhibit in the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center and is believed to be the only surviving rural American slave jail in existence.\nBiography\nAnderson was probably a Virginian from Amelia County.\nHe may have initially been involved in tobacco production and shipment, but soon added slave trading as an additional source of income. In 1825 he was able to purchase 100 acres near what is now Walton Pike and Kentucky Route 9 in Mason County, Kentucky. Here he built or converted a log-hewn building for use as a slave jail, where he could sequester slaves before taking them down to the Dover, Kentucky boat landing and shipping them south by pole-guided flatboat, or later steamboat, to the cotton kingdom markets of Natchez and New Orleans. He was fronted tens of thousands of dollars for slave speculation by his neighbor Thomas Marshall III, and his neighbor's first cousin, Chief Justice John Marshall. He also began investing in thoroughbred race horses during the 1820s.\nOhio River landings in Kentucky near Maysville, The Western Pilot (1832)\nIn 1825 he was listed as a witness in a court case in Natchez, Mississippi involving a Kentucky slave trader named Edward Stone and a male slave who had gotten into a fight. The following year, Stone and his nephew Howard Stone and three other men would be killed on the Ohio River by slaves they were transporting south to the cotton kingdom.\nIn 1833, Anderson was seemingly involved in the establishment of the Forks of the Road slave market outside Natchez, Mississippi. Cholera was epidemic that year, and a shipment from Alexandria, Virginia to the Delta region arrived with a number of sick and dying enslaved passengers. Trader Isaac Franklin and his overseer apparently conspired to dump several of the bodies of the dead in a ravine near Natchez, Mississippi, and refused to participate in an investigation of the circumstances by which the barely buried bodies came to be in the ravine. The population of the town was irate at the dead babies and teenagers, and alarmed at the possibility that slave traders were importing contagion. To placate the citizens of Natchez, 10 slave traders, including John W. Anderson, Paul Pascal, and Thomas McCargo, signed a public letter agreeing to relocate outside the city limits.\n\"Two Hundred Dollars Reward\" Mississippi Free Trader, July 5, 1833\nIn the summer of 1833, John W. Anderson advertised heavily for the recovery of four slaves who had escaped him. Carter, Emanuel, Hannah, and Caroline were all in their 20s, and Carter and Emanuel wore suits made of green cord. In February 1834, a man named John Adams who lived near Vicksburg, Mississippi placed a runaway slave ad seeking the return of \"a Negro Man named ANTHONY, about 25 years of age, he was purchased from Mr. Anderson, a negro trader, last spring: said negro was brought from Kentucky.\"\nIn 1836, J. W. Anderson was nominated and elected as a Whig to represent Mason County in the Kentucky General Assembly. Anderson died a month after the election and never served in the legislature.\nSlave jail\nMain article: Mason County, Kentucky slave pen\nThe slave jail that stood on Anderson's land is believed to be perhaps the only surviving rural slave jail in existence. It was sheltered inside a tobacco barn built around it at a later date, and thus had some protection from the elements. When the landowners heard about the establishment of the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, they reached out and let them know about what they had been told was a \"jail cell\" when they bought the property. The family donated the building to the museum in exchange for a new barn. Archeological work in the vicinity found 6,000 related objects. When the building was being dismantled for transport, one of the logs was found to be stamped J. W. Anderson.\nSee also\nList of slave traders of the United States\nHistory of slavery in Kentucky\nSlave markets and slave jails in the United States\nBibliography of the slave trade in the United States\n",

Carr FAIA (October 25, 1825 \u2013 May 12, 1915) was an American architect in practice in Leavenworth, Kansas, Denver, Colorado and Miles City, Montana from 1857 until his retirement in 1898. Carr, along with John G. Haskell, was one of the first two professional architects to practice in Kansas.\nLife and career\nErasmus Theodore Carr was born October 25, 1825, in Greenfield, New York to Almon Carr and Arathusa Carr, n\u00e9e Morse. As a young man he was trained as a mason and carpenter. In 1852 he moved to Syracuse, New York, where he worked as a builder. In 1855 he moved to St. Paul, Minnesota and almost immediately was hired to superintend construction at Fort Leavenworth, outside Leavenworth. At the close of this work in 1856 he returned east. This was planned as a permanent move, but in the spring of 1857 he returned to Leavenworth, where he opened an architect's office. While maintaining his independent practice, he was again hired by the government in 1859 to take charge of construction at Fort Leavenworth. During the Civil War Carr intended to enlist, but did not at the request of General Jesse L. Reno, who thought he was most useful at Leavenworth. His work at the fort was not complete until 1871.\nAfter completing his work for the federal government Carr briefly formed the partnership of Carr & Schultz, which was responsible for the new Leavenworth County Courthouse, completed in 1874. Carr formed a second partnership, Carr & Grodavent, in 1884 with Frank J. Grodavent. This was dissolved in 1887. In 1891 he moved to Denver, then a boomtown, and formed a third and final partnership, Carr & Feth, with William Pratt Feth. This was dissolved in 1893 and Carr moved on to Miles City, Montana, where his daughter and son-in-law, Jepp Ryan, lived. In 1898 Carr retired from practice and Ryan closed out his business interests in Miles City. The family then returned to Leavenworth.\nCarr was made a Fellow of the Western Association of Architects in 1885, and was also elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1888. The two organizations merged in 1889. Carr's membership in the organization lapsed in 1895, while he was resident in Montana. In all of the places he lived Carr was prominent in Masonic circles. He originally joined the Masons in 1856 in Leavenworth. At the time of his death he was a 33rd degree Mason.\nAt least four buildings designed by Carr have been listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places, and others contribute to listed historic districts.\nPersonal life\nCarr was married in 1859 to Margaret Redfern Cubbins. They had one daughter, Addie Bell, who married Jepp Ryan. After the death of Mrs. Carr in 1903 the family moved to California. Carr died May 12, 1915, at his daughter's home in Glendale at the age of 89.\nArchitectural works\n1867 \u2013 Henry W.

    "Bilateral relations\nIndonesia\u2013Rwanda relations refer to foreign relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of Rwanda since the establishment of diplomatic ties on 16 January 1984. Both countries are members of the World Trade Organization, Non-Aligned Movement and the G77. Additionally, the two nations make major contributions to UN peacekeeping forces.\nHistory\nOn 15 November 2022, Paul Kagame, the President of Rwanda, visited Indonesia and met with Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia, amid the G20 Summit in Bali. According to Rwandan Presidency, the two leaders discussed the future of bilateral cooperation including strengthening diplomatic relations between the two nations. In addition, President Jokowi suggested that a trade pact be established between Indonesia and Rwanda while also expressing his desire to see significant economic cooperation between Indonesia and Africa. In the meantime, President Kagame announced that he had accepted President Jokowi's invitation to the Summit and that a Rwandan embassy will open in Indonesia the following years. He also expressed gratitude to Indonesia for helping his nation's capacity building efforts.\nIn an effort to strengthen bilateral relations between Indonesia and Rwanda and as a follow-up to the plan to open the Rwandan embassy in Jakarta, the Indonesian Ambassador to Tanzania, Tri Yogo Jatmiko, met with the Rwandan Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta, the CEO of the Rwanda Private Sector Federation (RPSF), Stephen Ruzibiza, the Rwandan Ambassador Candidate to Indonesia, Sheikh Abdul Karim Harelimana, and representatives of the Rwanda-Indonesia Friendship Association (RIFA) in Kigali from 12 to 13 October 2023. Ambassador Jatmiko brought up a number of developments and prospective areas of focus for bilateral cooperation between Rwanda and Indonesia in an effort to convert the two nations' political proximity into agreements that have real-world effects for the community.\nOn June 6, The Rwandan government formally inaugurated its embassy in South Jakarta, Indonesia.  According to Minister Biruta, the opening demonstrated Rwanda and Indonesia's steadfast dedication to forging close ties through bilateral collaboration. The inauguration of the Rwandan Embassy in Indonesia is a significant development in the history of relations between the two nations and is expected to act as a \"bridge\" for future collaboration on issues of shared interest, trade, and investment. Biruta went on to say that the establishment of an embassy in Indonesia is a testament to Rwanda's commitment to forging ahead with regional diplomacy and establishing a substantial footprint.\nFollowing the inauguration, the signing of multiple memorandums of understanding (MoU) by Foreign Ministers Retno Marsudi and Biruta signaled a collaboration in three areas: general cooperation, political and security discussions, and the relaxation of visa requirements for holders of diplomatic service passports. Minister Retno expressed optimism that the opening of the Rwandan embassy would improve relationships between the two nations and between Indonesia and Africa. She reaffirmed Indonesia's dedication to promoting cooperative relationships with African countries and greeted Rwanda's entry into the upcoming second Indonesia-Africa Forum, which is scheduled to occur in Bali in September 2024.\nTrade\nIndonesia sold $21.3\u00a0million to Rwanda in 2022. Indonesia's top exports to Rwanda were uncoated paper ($5.04\u00a0million), other vegetable oils ($6.87\u00a0million), and palm oil ($35.4\u00a0million). Indonesian exports to Rwanda have grown at an annualized rate of 137% over the last five years, from $283\u00a0thousand in 2017 to $21.3\u00a0million in 2022.\nRwanda sold $44.3\u00a0thousand to Indonesia in 2022. Integrated Circuits ($184\u00a0thousand), Uncoated Paper ($38.7\u00a0thousand), and Soap ($29.3\u00a0thousand) were Rwanda's top exports to Indonesia. Rwanda's exports to Indonesia fell at an annualized rate of 29.5% over the previous five years, from $255\u00a0thousand in 2017 to $44.3\u00a0thousand in 2022.\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic, Minister Retno claims that trade between Indonesia and Rwanda has improved even more. She said that the trade value between the two nations grew by 32% in the first quarter of 2024 after increasing by 100% the previous year. Having said that, there is still room for trade to grow in this area.\nSee also\nForeign relations of Indonesia\nForeign relations of Rwanda\n",

    "Swiss mountain guide\nNicole Catherine Isabelle Niquille (born May 13, 1956) is a Swiss mountain guide, mountaineer and humanitarian. She is the first Swiss woman to become a certified mountain guide and the first woman to reach over 8,000m without supplementary oxygen.\nBiography\nBorn in Fribourg, as one of four children, Nicole Niquille grew up in Charmey, Gruy\u00e8re District, in the heart of the Fribourg Alps. When she was 18, she had a serious motorcycle accident, which nearly resulted in the loss of her left leg. To recover, she was prescribed as much exercise as possible. It was then when her twin sister Fran\u00e7oise introduced her to climbing. Through climbing, she met Erhard Loretan, who would become her partner in climbing and life for the next decade.\nTogether with Loretan, Niquille would make a number of expeditions to the Alps and to the Himalayas. She climbed the Frendo pillar on Mont Blanc, made some first ascents of the Aiguilles Rouges, as well as climbed the English route on Norway's Trollryggen. At the same time, she began training to become a mountain guide.\nOn the first day of her mountain guide course in 1984, the instructor called for a \"Mr. Nicole Niquille\", not expecting a woman to be participating in the course.\nIn 1985, she made an expedition to K2, where she lived for two months at base camp, and fell in love with the Himalayas and the people. On her summit attempt, she had to turn back at 7,600m\u00a0due to thrombosis, possibly due to her previous motorcycle injury. After turning back, it took her 16 hours to return to base camp on her own.\nThe next year, she made an attempt to climb Mount Everest. She cut her trip to the Himalayas short to return to Switzerland to complete her certification to become a mountain guide.\nHer certification process required her to complete every exercise as the men on the course, where she estimates she was tested twice as hard. For example, during the abseiling exercise, she had to secure the heaviest participant. She persevered, and on September 27, 1986, she became the first woman to become a Swiss mountain guide. In Switzerland, her graduation was widely reported, as women only received the right to vote in 1971 and were excluded from the Swiss Alpine Club until 1980.\nShe became widely known in Switzerland when she appeared in the 1991 documentary Visages suisses directed by Claude Goretta. In it, she accompanied a client to the summit of the Zinalrothorn (4,222\u00a0metres). In 1991, she led a successful expedition to Gasherbrum II, where four members of the team reached the summit.\nParalysis\nOn May 8, 1994, Niquille lost the use of her legs completely after suffering a concussion while picking mushrooms. She was hit by a falling rock, fractured her skull, and was paralyzed. It would take over twenty months for her to recover, after which she had to stop her work as a mountain guide. After recovery, she began a new career as a restaurant manager in Lac de Tanay. There, she met her second husband Marco Vuadens, as well as Ang Gelu Sherpa, the brother of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa, the first woman to summit Mount Everest.\nIn 2003, Nicole and Marco established the Foundation Nicole Niquille to support the work of a new woman's hospital to be created in Nepal around Mount Everest, as well as to support the memory of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa.\nTwo years later in 2005, the Foundation Nicole Niquille opened the Pasang Lhamu Nicole Niquille Hospital, in Lukla, at the foot of the Nepalese side of Mount Everest. The hospital treats 900 patients per month from the local area.\nIn 2022, Niquille summitted the Breithorn in Zermatt (4,163 m) in a specially designed sled, escorted by a rope team of 16 women. The unique sled was made of a racing car seat attached to a snowboard, and pulled by women wearing harnesses designed for sled dogs. It was her first summit in the Alps since her accident. In October of that year, she was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Swiss Paraplegic Foundation for being a role model for disabled people in Switzerland.\nFilmography\n1987 - Nicole Niquille, Guide de montagne\n1987 - Le troisi\u00e8me p\u00f4le, Jean Afanassieff\n1991 - Swiss Faces / Visages suisses, Claude Goretta\n2014 - La doppia vita di Nicole, Mario Casella\n2016 - Jean Troillet, toujours aventurier, S\u00e9bastien Devrient\n",
    " Netherlands Indies was one of the participants in the 1938 FIFA World Cup. Brazil and Cuba were the only non-European participants in the World Cup. The Dutch Colony was qualified for the final round without having to play qualifying matches, because opponent Japan withdrew. \nBecause the mother country of the Netherlands also took part, the Wilhelmus was heard twice at the event. The team consisted only of players from the Nederlandsch-Indische Voetbal Unie (NIVU) and the Dutch association chairman Johannes Mastenbroek acted as trainer. The indigenous association PSSI, with which the NIVU collaborated, was not represented and among the players there were several of Chinese descent. The 1938 participation was the only one in the history of the Dutch East Indies. In 1950, at the next World Cup, the colony was now independent and the country was called Indonesia. After independence, Indonesia has never managed to qualify for a final round.\nQualification\nThe Dutch East Indies were placed in qualifying group 12 with Japan.\nWhen Japan withdrew, FIFA decided that the Dutch East Indies would have to play against one of the countries from group 11. The United States was selected by lot.\nThis match would be played on May 29, 1938 in Rotterdam in the Feijenoord stadium.\nHowever, the United States also withdrew, meaning that the Dutch East Indies qualified for the final round without playing.\nPreparation\nIn preparation for the 1938 world championship, the team made a long boat trip to the Netherlands to train at HBS in The Hague.\nA practice match against HBS was also played, which ended in a 2-2 draw.\nFurthermore, there was practice against Haarlem, this match ended in a 5-3 victory.\nMatches at the World Championship\nThe Dutch East Indies only played one match at the World Championship, with the 6-0 defeat against Hungary eliminating them for the second round.\nAfter the World Cup\nAfter the World Cup, the Dutch East Indies played on June 26, 1938 on the Olympic Day against the Dutch national team, losing 9-2.

    "Species of lichen\nUmbilicaria isidiosa is a species of foliose lichen belonging to the family Umbilicariaceae. It is endemic to Bolivia, where it occurs in high-altitude regions of the Bolivian Andes. It is distinguished by its thallus, which has an upper surface ranging from ashy brown to mouse grey, featuring a frosty (pruinose) texture that varies from smooth to slightly rough. This surface is adorned with numerous isidia (reproductive propagules), ranging from spherical to richly branched, primarily concentrated along the margins. The lower surface is dark, transitioning from smooth to rough in texture, and sparsely covered with dark rhizines (root-like structures).\nTaxonomy\nThis species was first described by the Polish lichenologist Beata Krzewicka in 2009. The type specimen of Umbilicaria isidiosa was collected by Adam Flakus northwest of Comarapa city, near the village of Siberia, within the Santa Cruz Department's Manuel Mar\u00eda Caballero Province. Found at an elevation of 3,480\u00a0m (11,420\u00a0ft), the specimen was located on sandstone in an open area. It is placed within the genus Umbilicaria, a group widely recognized for its members that are adapted to extreme environments, including polar and mountainous regions. The species epithet, isidiosa, refers to the presence of isidia, a feature that occurs rarely in Umbilicaria.\nDescription\nUmbilicaria isidiosa features a monophyllous (single-leaf), umbilicate (attached at one point) thallus that is orbicular to irregular in shape, measuring 1\u20134\u00a0cm (0.4\u20131.6\u00a0in) in diameter. The thallus margin is often incised-lobate. The upper surface is ashy brown to mouse grey, pruinose (frosty appearance), smooth to slightly scabrous. The lower surface is blackish and ranges from smooth to scabrous with sparse, blackish rhizines (root-like structures). The lichen is characterized for its numerous, dark brown to blackish, globular to richly branched isidia (outgrowths) clustered at its margins. Thin-layer chromatography reveals the presence of gyrophoric acid, a secondary metabolite.\nHabitat and distribution\nUmbilicaria isidiosa occurs on siliceous sandstone in exposed, sunny locations at a high altitude. These locations are characteristically windy and receive moisture from periodic fogs, making the habitat both humid and challenging. The lichen grows on large rock blocks scattered across an agricultural area at the fringes of the Yungas cloud forest. It is often found in association with species from the genera Aspicilia, Caloplaca, Rhizocarpon, and Usnea, but no other Umbilicaria species have been observed in the vicinity.\n",
    "Colombian illusionist (1951\u20132024)\nGustavo Adolfo Lorgia Vanegas (Spanish pronunciation: ; 18 May 1951 \u2013 14 June 2024) was a Colombian businessman and an illusionist. He was one of Latin America's best known illusionists.\nLife\nLorgia was born in Bucaramanga. From childhood he followed in his father's and grandfather's footsteps as they worked as magicians. In 1971, he participated in the congress of magic in Zaragoza, Spain. He lived in Madrid, working for a news programme's entertainment section.\nLorgia presented various performances throughout Europe and the Middle East, and acted for Le Caire Auberge des Pyramides before such members of the jet set as Jacqueline Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, or before Arab sheikhs.\nIn 1980, Lorgia first began the development of his career on the television programme M\u00e1gico-M\u00e1gico and also took part in presentations on Festival Internacional del Humor (another television programme). Between 1988 and 2020, he was president of the Club Colombiano de Artes M\u00e1gicas, and between 1989 and 2020, he headed the Federaci\u00f3n Latinoamericana de Sociedades M\u00e1gicas (FLASOMA).\nIn 1992, Lorgia organized the International Congress of Magic in Bogot\u00e1. In 2008, a bill was introduced in Colombia that would forbid presenting and keeping wild animals and marine mammals in circuses and public spectacles. In June 2013, the bill was passed into law and is known as Law 1638.. It forbids the use of wild animals, whether native or exotic, in circuses, whether fixed or itinerant. It gave animals protection. However, it also had certain implications for Lorgia's profession, for the new law meant that animals were not to be used in any show, as confirmed by Colombia's Constitutional Court after the law's constitutionality was challenged the next year.\nDeath\nOn 14 June 2024, Lorgia died in Bogot\u00e1 from cerebral complications after being diagnosed with a spinal cord injury and staying in hospital for 20 days, according to his children. He was 73. Days earlier, there had been false reports of Lorgia's death on social media, but Lorgia himself had denied these stories.\nIn a tribute, El Heraldo said of him \"He made luxury cars disappear, pulled doves or rabbits out of hats, sawed ladies in half, did illusions with sticks or umbrellas, he was one of the most creative people in the country.\"\nNotes\n^ This name has been corrected to proper French spelling; in the Spanish Wikipedia source, it reads Le Cairo Auberge des Piramides.\n",
    "\nThe Alliance for Salvation in the Sahel is a Fulani political and military group formed in 2018 during the Mali War.\nFoundation\nThe creation of the Alliance for Salvation in the Sahel (ASS) was announced in May 2018, although preparations to create the group began eight to nine months earlier. The group is active in central Mali, where a communal conflict between Fulani pastoralists and Dogon farmers is ongoing in Mopti Region. The ASS was formed to fight against atrocities committed against Fulani civilians and villages by the Dogon dozo hunters, who accuse them of being jihadists tied to Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin. In the first statement by the group, the ASS denounced JNIM and other jihadist groups, which are composed mainly of Fulani.\nThe ASS did not declare war on the Malian army, but criticized the Malian government for neglecting the region and not developing or building infrastructure. The ASS claimed to have the support of \"politicians and military men\", along with international support.\nOrganization\nThe founder and leader of the ASS is nicknamed Bacar Sow, but his real name is unknown. The ASS claims to have over a hundred fighters, mainly from Nampala, Bambara Maoud\u00e9, and Boulikessi, as well as some fighters from other armed groups. The ASS adopted a flag with three horizontal lines; a white on top, red in the middle, and black at the bottom.\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the Malian Association for Human Rights reported in 2018 that the ASS appears to be commanded from Bamako and \"according to an influential member of the Fulani community, the ASS is essentially made up of young Malian, Nigerian and Burkinabe Fulani, and its hierarchy is composed of civil servants and soldiers from the Fulani community, some of whom occupy high positions within the Malian administration.\"\nHuman Rights Watch reported in December 2018 that the movement's goal was to bring together all existing self-defense groups in Fulani villages into a single organization. Due to a lack of funding, the ASS has failed to bring existing groups into their ranks or attract new ones. Dogon militants do not distinguish between the ASS and jihadist groups. The ASS claimed two attacks against dozos in May 2018 in Bouma, Douentza Cercle and Yoro, Koro Cercle. The attacks killed eight dozos.\n",
    "\nGorodishche Ghetto (summer 1941 - October 21 1941) was a Jewish ghetto established for the forced relocation of Jews from the village of Gorodishche (Today Haradzishcha) in the Baranovichi district of the Brest region and nearby settlements. This occurred during the persecution and extermination of Jews under the Nazi occupation of Belarus during World War II.\nOccupation of Gorodishche and the creation of the ghetto\nAccording to data from 1921, 760 Jews lived in the town of Gorodishche. Until September 1939, the village was part of the Polesie Voivodeship of Poland. After the annexation of eastern Poland by the USSR, it became part of the Baranovichi region. As of August 21, 1940, there were 1,337 refugees from the German-occupied part of Poland in Gorodishche. German troops occupied Gorodishche from June 24, 1941, to July 8, 1944. On June 27, 1941, 17 or 18 Jews were shot by the Nazis, including two families of the Tsirinskys. Soon after, the Germans, implementing Hitler's program of exterminating Jews, organized a ghetto in the town. The ghetto in Gorodishche was located on Slonimsky Lane.\nDestruction of the ghetto\nOn October 20, 1941, an SS team arrived in Gorodishche. Jewish specialists (68 people) were left in the ghetto, while the remaining 100-150 adult men were taken two kilometers from the town to the Pogoreltsy tract and the Mikhnovshchina forest. They were forced to dig pits and were immediately shot there. The next day, October 21, 1941, between 1,200 and 1,440 Jews from Gorodishche were shot at these pits. Some of their names are known: barber Yelin, the Krasilshchikov brothers, and the 105-year-old rabbi Mordukhovich.\nOn the same day, in the Mikhnovshchina forest, the Germans killed another 70 (68) Jews from the intelligentsia. Subsequently, Jews from nearby villages and some Roma were brought to the ghetto. The next \"action\" (used by the Nazis for mass murders) was carried out in early May 1942, when 35 Jews were shot near the Orthodox cemetery. In August 1942, about 100 more Jewish specialists were shot there.\nIn the summer of 1942, a Jewish woman with two children, was shot near the church. In total, 3,830 Jews were killed in Gorodishche and the surrounding area (and in total, considering victims of other nationalities, about 4,000 people).\nMemory\nThe Extraordinary State Commission discovered several mass graves in Gorodishche. One was located in the Pogoreltsy tract forest, two kilometers southeast of the town along the Gorodishche-Baranovichi road on the left side, 200 meters from the highway. There, on October 21 and 22, 1941, the Germans shot 154 Jews. The second grave was 300 meters near the Orthodox church. In 1994, memorial signs were installed near the Orthodox cemetery in Gorodishche and in the Pogoreltsy tract to honor the victims of the genocide of Jews.\n",
    "\n2013 single by Sophie\n\"Nothing More to Say\" is the debut single by the Scottish musician Sophie, released in January 2013 through Huntleys + Palmers. The single contains two versions of the title track and the song \"Eeehhh\". It was characterized as electro house while also containing pop influences. \"Nothing More to Say\" was acclaimed and considered one of Sophie's most essential songs. The single was reissued in early 2022.\nBackground and release\nThe single contains three tracks. Two of them are versions of \"Nothing More to Say\": a dub version where DJ Jackmaster was involved and a vocal mix. The other track is \"Eeehhh\". The single was released in January 2013 through Huntleys + Palmers. Its CEO Andrew Thomson said that the single would've been released earlier if \"distribution hadn't been as slow\". When releasing the single, Sophie said: \"I try to make music which is fun to dance to\u2014that should be the loudest voice talking. I think it would be extremely exciting if music could take you on the same sort of high-thrill three-minute ride as a theme park roller coaster.\"\nComposition\nThe single was characterized as electro house. Philip Sherburne of Pitchfork described it as \"a sparkling take on club pop\", while Resident Advisor's Andrew Ryce wrote that, \"acked with just the right amount of pop, the formula  simple yet undeniable\". Austin Jones of Paste described the three tracks as \"energetic, dubby, with intense, ballroom vocals that twist and contort around candy-coated basslines\".\nJunkee's Jared Richards said that \"Nothing More to Say\" and \"Eeehhh\" are \"ecstatic tracks\" featuring a blend of \"synths, snares, and hard snaps that come together as if each sound is a new addition to a Petri dish\", but with the former being \"more infectious  as if the song is straining under itself\". Jordan Rothlein of Resident Advisor wrote that \"Nothing More to Say\" contains a 1986-like electro bassline and \"reverb-y vocal\", though its precision makes it feel \"far from retro\". According to Rothlein, the dub mix \"turns its attention to the swelling melody that makes the original so easy to get swept up in\".\nReception\n\"Nothing More to Say\" was acclaimed, and Ryce wrote that it \"took the UK house scene by storm\". Dazed's Karen Orton described it as \"a furiously exciting collision of fluro dance and tectonic NRG\" and \"worth the wait\". Britt Julious of Pitchfork said that \"reating a song as bright, cheerful, and instantly enjoyable as 'Nothing More to Say' takes considerable effort\". Jordan Rothlein of Resident Advisor described it as \"a blast\" and \"eon and sugary-sweet\". The Line of Best Fit's Andriana Albert wrote: \"It's a universal dance vibe that you can't help but be addicted to, causing you to instantly want to know more and why you haven't heard this before.\" Duncan Cooper of The Fader described it as \"Mario Kart beats for a real-life Rainbow Road\". XLR8R's Brad Stabler described the vocal mix as \"n outstanding club track no doubt\", with \"the backbone a banger should have\".\n\"Nothing More to Say\" was featured as one of Sophie's most essential songs in the lists published by The Fader and Junkee; writing for The Fader, Shaad D'Souza said: \"Propulsive and gorgeous, it's one of Sophie's most straightforward songs and one of the best, showcasing in early, almost rudimentary ways, the producer's interest in repetitive, durable hooks and burbling synth sounds\". Retrospectively, Jones said that the single \"served as a prelude to the queer carnival Sophie would work towards crafting over the next several years\". On 7 December 2021, it was announced that the single would be reissued in early 2022, with the funds going towards the Scottish Trans Alliance.\nTrack listing\nNotes\n^ a b Some sources consider it an EP.\n",

It is her first release on Dead Oceans and has received positive reviews from critics who have praised her songwriting, evolution as a musician from her previous work, and the cosmic themes on the songs, written with a metaphorical overview effect that discusses personal emotions.\nReception\nEditors at AnyDecentMusic? scored this release an 8.3 out of 10, aggregating 14 reviews. According to the review aggregator Metacritic, My Light, My Destroyer received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 90 out of 100 from 12 critic scores.\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 4.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Timothy Monger writing \"although more experimental and stylistically varied, My Light, My Destroyer plays like an emotional sequel to\" 2021 release An Overview on Phenomenal Nature by \"exploring similar human themes from different angles\" along with \"plenty of sonic variance throughout the set with intriguing field-recorded interludes and instrumentals\". At BrooklynVegan, Andrew Sacher wrote that in spite of the anticipation built up from her last album, \"it sounds to me like Cassandra isn\u2019t letting any of the hype and fame get to her; My Light, My Destroyer is a worthy followup from an artist who\u2019s seemingly keeping her head down and continuing to explore her own musical universe\". John Williamson of Clash Music scored this release an 8 out of 10 for combining various musical elements to make a collection that is \"both deadly serious and funny, but always habitable\". Exclaim!'s Eric Hill gave this work an 7 out of 10, writing that it \"opens an interrogation of subtle differences between guise and disguise\" as Jenkins is \"casting around for meanings hidden in both the far flung cosmos and micro momentary\". Sandra Song of The Fader called this \"an album that\u2019s constantly in flux, with Jenkins dissecting loneliness and connection through cross-genre experimentation and the type of inner thoughts collected from some late-night existential crisis\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian named this the Album of the Week and scored it 4 out of 5 stars, calling it \"an album so thick with sadness and seclusion  is remarkably easy listening\", praising the arrangements in particular.\nJohn Amen of The Line of Best Fit scored the album 9 out of 10, concluding, \" explores themes that have been relevant at least since the advent of the Cognitive Revolution 30,000-plus years ago\u00a0\u2013 creation, destruction, ecstasy, transcendence\u00a0\u2013 yet does so in her own contemporary, refreshing, and utterly commanding way\". Sam Walton of Loud and Quiet gave this work a 10 out of 10, calling it \"a collection of songs that hasn\u2019t been willed into existence by a pressured musician, but rather one that\u2019s been encountered in the process of diligent exploration and then nurtured to maturity\" with songs that \"are confident but never flashy, comforting but never bland, and, throughout, quietly riveting\" and remind him of The Blue Nile, Radiohead, and Wilco. In Mojo, Jim Wirth gave this album 4 out of 5 stars, characterizing it as \"jewel-sparkly and gently devastating\" and compared this work to Skylarking by XTC and Judee Sill. John Murphy of musicOMH scored this release 5 out of 5 stars, stating that it \"feels like a huge step forward for Jenkins\" to move past her earlier dream pop work and that \"there\u2019s a quiet power in the unobtrusive nature of these songs that are destined to salve your soul in troubled times\". In a profile for The New York Times, Grayson Haver Currin characterized My Light, My Destroyer as Jenkins' \"subtle and sprawling third album, out Friday, on which field-recorded collages abut jangling rockers and diaphanous ballads\". Editors at Paste made this a Paste Pick and critic Hayden Merrick scored it an 8.8 out of 10 for having \"affecting, comprehensive songs that template a spiritually healthy existence\", using space imagery in the lyrics as a \"gateway to inspiration and perspective\".\nThe Skinny's Noah Barker gave this album 5 out of 5 stars, stating that \"the record  that grief and anticipatory awe can exist as a singular emotion, in a blip on the cosmic scale; the overwhelming ego death of human self-importance and the perfect realisation of its own in-spite beauty, that love and death are on the same spectrum.

    "1992 single by Whitney Houston\nIn 1992, American singer and actress Whitney Houston recorded a new arrangement of \"I Will Always Love You\" for the soundtrack to The Bodyguard, her film debut. It was the world's best-selling single of 1992 and is one of the best selling singles of all time. Houston won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the song, which was originally written and sung in 1973 by Dolly Parton.\nBackground and composition\nThe song has a saxophone solo by Kirk Whalum. She was originally to record Jimmy Ruffin's \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" as the lead single from The Bodyguard. However, when it was discovered the song was to be used for Fried Green Tomatoes, Houston requested a different song. It was her co-star Kevin Costner who suggested \"I Will Always Love You\", playing her Linda Ronstadt's 1975 version from her album Prisoner in Disguise. Producer David Foster and Houston re-arranged the song as a soul ballad. Her record company did not feel a song with an a cappella introduction would be as successful; however, Houston and Costner insisted on retaining it. When Parton heard that Houston was using Ronstadt's recording as a template, she called Foster to give him the final verse, which was missing from the Ronstadt recording, as she felt it was important to the song. Houston recorded the song on April 22, 1992, and was issued as the soundtrack's leading single on November 2, 1992, by Arista Records.\nHouston's recording is not the only version of the song featured in the film. In a scene where she dances with Costner, a version by John Doe can be heard playing on a jukebox. Houston's version appeared at No. 8 on NME's Greatest No 1 Singles in History list. In 2004, Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" placed at number 65 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. It was also ranked at number 22 on The Guardian's list of Britain's favorite 100 songs, published in May 2002. Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" has sold over 24 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling single by a female artist of all time as well as one of the best-selling singles of all time. It was also the world's best-selling single of 1992.\nIn February 2014, the song placed at number six on Billboard's list of the Top 50 'Love' Songs of All Time. A live performance was included on the 1999 release Divas Live '99, and a 1994 performance of the song was included on the 2014 CD/DVD release of Whitney Houston Live: Her Greatest Performances.\nSheet music for Houston's version of this song shows the key of A major in common time with a tempo of \"freely\" at 60 beats per minute. Three minutes and 31 seconds later, it shifts to B major.\nCritical reception\nHouston's cover of \"I Will Always Love You\" received widespread acclaim from music critics, being now regarded as one of her \"signature'' songs. Larry Flick of Billboard wrote that the song is \"bolstered by a remarkably restrained (and ultimately effective) vocal by Houston. She builds to dramatic, heartfelt conclusion that makes sense, given the unusually slow-building created by producer David Foster.\" Randy Clark of Cashbox noted that \"the unstoppable voice and unquestionable talent of Whitney Houston will no doubt come roaring back onto the charts with this cover\". Amy Linden of Entertainment Weekly said it \"is artistically satisfying and uncharacteristically hip for the MOR songbird.\" John Martinucci of Gavin Report asserted that Houston \"delivers a powerful rendition that reminds us of her natural abilities as a singer with or without musical accompaniment.\" Other critics have called the key change Stephen Holden of The New York Times called it a \"magnificent rendition\", commenting,Houston transforms a plaintive country ballad into a towering pop-gospel assertion of lasting devotion to a departing lover. Her voice breaking and tensing, she treats the song as a series of emotional bursts in a steady climb toward a final full-out declamation. Along the way, her virtuosic gospel embellishments enhance the emotion and never seem merely ornamental. Peter Stanton of Smash Hits commented, \"A slow intro moulds into a crescendo of huggy-kissy-smoochiness that could melt the heart of the yeti of Northern Siberia.\" Writing for USA Today on November 17, 1992, James T. Jones IV labeled it a \"tour-de-force\", and added \" gives a 31\u20442-star  performance. Where Dolly Parton's original 'I Will Always Love You' was plaintive and tear-stained, Houston's is gospel-infused and dramatic.\"\nThe key change after the third verse drew much mention. Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times commented that the singer \"has the goods to deliver on the tune's haunting beauty and resists overpowering it \u2013 until the finale, when the key change and stratospheric notes drain all the heart-rending sadness out of the song and make it sound like just another anthem of survival.\" But more ty",

    "Kenyan football has suffered suspensions by world governing body F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) on three occasions: 2004, 2006, and in 2022 due to alleged government interference.\n2004\nOn 2 June 2004 FIFA sent Kenya to football wilderness for the first time following the appointment of a Transitional Stakeholder Committee chaired by former athlete Mike Boit by Sports Minister Najib Balala at the expiry of Maina Kariuki's term.\nHowever, FIFA lifted the  ban from international football during an Emergency Committee meeting in Zurich on 6 Aug 2004 due to formation of a KFF Normalization Committee aimed at resolving Kenyan football problems.\n2006\nOn 26 October 2006, FIFA banned Kenya for a second time in two years after it's Emergency Committee deemed the country had failed to respect agreements to resolve recurrent problems. Failure to form an 18-team league to replace two independent top flight leagues and disrespect of FIFA's Statutes, regulations and decisions contributed to the ban.\nThe ban was lifted on 9 Mar 2007 by Fifa's Emergency Committee lifted the suspension imposed last October following recommendations by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) after a number of sticking points were cleared which included a declaration from sports minister Maina Kamanda not to interfere in the running of the federation, that the 28 points agreed with Fifa by the KFF and the Kenyan government at a meeting in Cairo in January 2006 would be respected in full, and that Mohammed Hatimy would run the KFF on an interim basis.\n2022\nOn 11 November 2021, Sports Cabinet Secretary Dr. Ambassador Amina Mohamed dissolved the federation and it's executive over allegations of misappropriation of funds and formed a Caretaker Committee led by former Judge Aaron Ringera for an initial period of six months.

    "The Blood Family Mafia, often abbreviated to BFM, is a Canadian street gang active in Quebec.\nOrigins\nThe gang was founded in 2006 and is mostly active in the St. Lawrence river valley with a strong focus in Quebec City area, the C\u00f4te-Nord area and the Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches. The gang was founded in the northern end of Montreal by a Haitian immigrant Valdano Toussaint who was ordered deported back to Haiti in 2008. The style of the BLM is closely modelled after the Bloods gang of Los Angeles.  The membership of the gang was initially mostly Haitian-Canadian, but the group has expanded to take in French-Canadians in the last decade or so.\nConflict with the Hells Angels\nThe BFM traditionally paid a 10% \"tax\" to the Hells Angels, but in 2023 the group came into conflict with the Hells Angels after it ceased paying the \"tax\". Criminologist  Maria Mourani stated in a 2024 interview: \"They never liked working for the Hells Angels\". The current leader of the BFM is said by the police to be David \"Pic\" Turmel. Turmel is a 27-year-old man, living in self-imposed exile in Lisbon. The journalist F\u00e9lix S\u00e9guin said of him: \"Dave Turmel, 27, is a young man who, even as a teenager, was described as ultra violent. In recent years, he decided to attack the Hells Angels of the Quebec chapter head-on. He and his gang, the Blood Family Mafia, refuse to pay taxes that the Hells charge throughout the province, to authorize independent groups to sell drugs on their territory. Very rare thing, in the case of Quebec, the Hells do not retaliate...They are even negotiating a truce.\"\nThe BFM has modelled its tactics after the maras of Central America, and routinely engages in torture, which has led the gang to be considered one of the most violent in Quebec. Mourani said of the gang's use of torture: \"It\u2019s not something that is common in Quebec\u2019s street gangs. Is this a new way of doing business? We\u2019ll see.\" The gang is alleged to have released videos on the internet showing them torturing Hells Angels. In February 2024, members of the BFM were arrested by the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec in connection with the kidnapping, torture and murder of a man in Saint-Malachie. The S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec stated that the victim was not associated with the Hells Angels. The man was subjected to what the Quebec media called \"a night of horror\" with his body being burned and his ears cut off. The victim was reported to be a drug dealer who decided to cease working for the BFM and was invited to attend a fare-well party. The victim was beaten several times and subjected to waterboarding three times before his feet were burned.\nThe attacks of the BFM on the Quebec City chapter of the Hells Angels are said to have badly damaged the image of the Hells Angels in the Canadian underworld along with the contrast between the youthful leaders of the BFM vs. the elderly leaders of the Hells Angels. The journalist Pascal Robdidas reported that the BFM is leading a \"rebellion\" by various street level drug dealers who have grown tired of paying the exorbitant \"taxes\" to the Hells Angels in exchange for the privilege of being allowed to sell drugs. The Hells Angels are reported to have formed \"baseball teams\" to go out and beat up various drug dealers in the regions of Quebec to stop them from defecting over to the BFM.\nPolice crackdown\nRoobens Denis, the deputy leader of the BFM was arrested on 1 March in Portugal following an extradition request from Canada. On 30 June 2024, another BFM leader, Guillaume St-Louis Bernier, was arrested in Kelowna by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police following an extradition request from Quebec to British Columbia.\n",
    "2020 song series by Brockhampton\nTechnical Difficulties Radio (stylized in all caps), also simply referred to as Technical Difficulties, was a series of livestreams and associated free music releases by American rap collective Brockhampton during the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020. Throughout the month of May, tracks were previewed on livestreams and released in sets of two or three each Friday on the groups website. Each set of singles was removed upon the release of the next tracks. The singles were self-released without the involvement of the groups label, RCA Records.\nThe series marked the performance debut of Brockhampton member Jabari Manwa, who had previously served solely as a producer. Matt Champion's presence was also noted, with Wren Graves of Consequence of Sound claiming that \"it almost feels like the rest of Brockhampton are guesting on his solo project\".\nHistory\nOn May 8, 2020, Brockhampton hosted a password-protected Twitch livestream entitled Technical Difficulties Radio. As part of the stream, Kevin Abstract announced the release of two Brockhampton albums in 2020, along with the promise of weekly, non-album singles each Friday. The same day, \"N.S.T\" and \"Things Can't Stay The Same\" were released to the groups YouTube channel and website. On May 10, \"Things Can't Stay The Same\" was reuploaded with different cover art, as the original cover used a painting by Jenna Gribbon without her approval.\nOn May 15, the group followed up with \"M.O.B\" and \"Twisted\", released in the same manner as the previous singles. At the same time, \"N.S.T\" and \"Things Can't Stay The Same\" were deleted, a pattern that would continue for the remainder of the series. On May 22, \"I.F.L\", \"Downside\", and \"Baby Bull\" were released, and the previous set of singles were made unavailable. On May 29, the final set of singles, \"Chain On/Hold Me\" and \"Fishbone\", were released.\nAside from the nine tracks that were released as singles, several other songs were previewed on the livestreams, including \"Bankroll\", \"Edamame\", \"Keep It Southern\", and \"Man on the Moon\".\nOfficial releases\nFinished versions of \"Bankroll\" and \"Chain On\" (the first half of \"Chain On/Hold Me\") were included on the groups sixth studio album, Roadrunner: New Light, New Machine, released on April 9, 2021. On May 18, Abstract expressed a desire to officially release the remaining Technical Difficulties tracks, although he cited sample clearance as an obstacle.\nOn November 18, 2022, \"Man on the Moon\" and \"Keep It Southern\" were released as part of Brockhampton's final studio album, TM. During the groups final concert at The Fonda Theatre, \"N.S.T\" and \"Baby Bull\" made their live debuts, marking the only time Technical Difficulties songs were performed live.\nComposition\nSeveral of the songs in the series utilize a \"Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties\" tag that is sampled from an unreleased freestyle by Jay-Z and Big L.\nThe first single, \"Things Can't Stay The Same\", is \"hard hitting rap track\" with a freestyle structure built around a chipmunk soul sample of \"Trouble Will Find Me\" by Amnesty. Kevin Abstract's verse received praise from Sophie Walker of The Forty-Five, who positively compared it to his work on the Saturation trilogy. However, she declared Matt Champion the best performer, stating that he \"crackles with electricity\" and complimenting his synergy with the instrumental.\n\"N.S.T\" is reminiscent of West Coast and Southern hip hop, with \"body-slam basslines\" and a lo-fi instrumental, according to Walker. The track features performances from Abstract, Champion, Jabari Manwa, and Bearface, with the latter's \"playful\" verse containing references to WWE champion Stone Cold Steve Austin. Wren Graves of Consequence of Sound described Manwa's verse as \"welcome\", and praised Champion's \"scene-stealing, face-melting performance\" on both \"N.S.T\" and \"Things Can't Stay The Same\". Walker also cited Champion as a highlight, describing him as having a \"anarchic spirit with a quickfire verse that knocks it out the park\".\n\"M.O.B\" features a sample of \"Shake Your Booty\" by Bunny Sigler that transitions into a \"stripped-back loop that builds, adding layers of finger snaps, skittering hi-hat, and slippery bass\". Nina Corcoran of Consequence of Sound compared the song to that of the groups debut, Saturation (2017). \"Twisted\" sports a \"blown-out and slowed-down beat\", and features guest performances from Ryan Beatty and Christian Alexander. Corcoran compared the verses to Frank Ocean's writing.\n\"I.F.L\" is another West Coast rap song, and Champion again plays a lead role. Kath Jiang of CelebMix called the raps \"catchy\" and \"addictive\", while Graves said that \"Champion runs wild on 'I.F.L'\", and compared the instrumental to Dr. Dre's 2001.\nIn contrast with the other singles, \"Downside\" is built around a \"pensive\" piano melody. Champion and frequent collaborator Ryan Beatty are the sole performers, with the former's verse serving as an \"inspirational ode\", in the words of Graves",

    "Else-Marie Juul Hansen (19 October 1904, Copenhagen \u2014 12 August 2003, Copenhagen) was a Danish actress and a particularly successful soprano operetta singer. Initially a dancer, she made her operetta debut in No, No, Nanette at F\u00f8nix-Teatret, Frederiksberg, in 1927. From the 1930s to the 1950s, she played leading operetta roles in various Copenhagen theatres, frequently performing with Hans Kurt Jensen. In addition to her many film roles, Hansen is remembered for playing Oda Holm in the popular Danish television series Matador (1978\u201381).\nEarly life and education\nBorn on 19 October 1904 in Copenhagen, Else-Marie Juul Hansen was the daughter of the prosperous shoemaker Hans Frederik Hansen (1875\u20131946) and his wife Maren Jensigne n\u00e9e Nielsen (1875\u20131951). The family's only child, she was brought up in a well-established bourgeois home in the city's N\u00f8rrebro district. She attended a private school and from the age of five took dancing lessons under Agnes Nyrop Christensen which led to her performing as a child at Tivoli's Pantomime Theatre where she eventually danced as Columbine. She later attended drama courses in London and Stratford-on-Avon.\nCareer\nIn 1927, Hansen made a sensational debut at Fenix Teatret in Frederiksberg performing in the operetta No, No, Naneete.

Her final stage performance was in 1949 where she once again appeared with Hans Kurt in Oklahoma.\nElse-Marie Juul Hansen died in Copenhagen on 12 August 2003.\n",
    "Deceit in which one states a truth that is irrelevant or implies a falsehood\nIn numismatics, an evasion (also evasion coin, evasion token) is a close copy of a coin with just enough deviation in design and/or legend to avoid violating counterfeit laws. The best-known evasions appeared in the 18th century in Great Britain and Ireland.\nDetails\nTo counteract the large numbers of underweight, counterfeit copper halfpennies and farthings circulating in 18th-century Britain, Section 6 of the Counterfeiting Coin Act 1741 made it a crime, punishable by 2 years' imprisonment, to \u201cmake, coin or counterfeit any brass or copper money, commonly called a halfpenny or a farthing\u201d; this act was followed by the even stricter Counterfeiting of Copper Coin Act 1771, which made the passing of counterfeit coppers a felony.\nEvasion halfpenny, obv.: bust and inscription of George II, rev.: Britannia and date 1777, incompatible with obverse\nHowever, counterfeiters soon evaded the law by striking \u201ccoins\u201d with designs or inscriptions slightly different from the originals; if caught, they would claim their products were different and not counterfeits. These pieces usually had a bust on the obverse \u2013 often resembling King George III, or some other well known figure \u2013 and a seated Britannia or a harp (for Ireland) on the reverse. Instead of the correct obverse legend \u201cGeorge III Rex\u201d, it may read \u201cGeorge Rules,\u201d \u201cGeorge Reigns\u201d or similar. The reverse legend \u201cBritannia\u201d might be replaced by something like \u201cBriton\u2019s Happy Isles.\u201d Counterfeiters often made their coins look quite worn, some would not add a date or only put a partial date on the die. They also often used earlier dates, such as making halfpence dated 1771 in 1778, or making halfpence with dates and the image of the previous king George II. The makers of these lightweight pieces did not worry about being caught, as the law did not cover \u201cevasions.\u201d\nIn addition to circulating in the British Isles, large quantities of evasion (and other) counterfeit copper coins were also shipped to British America and the United States, particularly from the mid-18th century and especially after 1771.\nSee also\nConder token\n",

    "Weekly newspaper serving Eastern Los Angeles County and Western Orange County, California\nLos Cerritos Community News, also known as Cerritos Community News, is a local weekly newspaper published in California. It covers the cities of Artesia, Bellflower, Buena Park, Cerritos, Commerce, Downey, Hawaiian Gardens, East Lakewood, La Mirada, La Palma, Norwalk, and Pico Rivera. It publishes its papers on Fridays and has won fourteen Los Angeles Press Club awards.\nBrian Hews is the newspaper's sole editor, publisher, and owner. Much of the paper's revenue comes from mandatory public notices placed by cities and government programs. It has been criticized for publishing negative and false stories relating to local political figures.\nHistory\nThe newspaper received much attention in 2012 when it published a story alleging Los Angeles County Assessor John Noguez of corruption. Multiple people then spoke out about Hews' exclusive control over the newspaper and his subjectiveness being carried over into the paper. Ron Beilke, a city council member in Pico Rivera, said that Hews tended to ally with certain figures and people he likes. The former editor of the paper, who quit in 2013, Jerry Bernstein, explained that Hews would falsify and exaggerate facts about people that he did not like, without any substantiation.\nHews faced a lawsuit for libel in 2017, after reporting that the director of the Central Basin Water board, Leticia Vasquez, and Montebello councilmember, Vanessa Delgado, tried to extort money from a real estate firm the year before. Vasquez denied the charges, and Hews was later fined $2,500 because he withheld evidence without any legal justification. During the lawsuit, Randy Economy, the reporter for the Noguez story, and Bernstein filed declarations claiming that Hews \"regularly published false stories about public officials he feuded with or who did not support his newspaper via advertising.\"\nHews received national scrutiny in 2014 when Jim Romenesko wrote about him in his blog, claiming that Hews copied some of sportscaster Dale Hansen's commentary on Michael Sam in his column. Hews later wrote on Twitter that it was \"an honest mistake\".\n",
    "\nOn 1 July 2024, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced that they had foiled a pro-Russian attempt to overthrow the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by members of a Kyiv-based NGO.\nBackground\nIn February 2024, the Main Directorate of Intelligence of Ukraine said that a coup may be attempted in the spring of 2024.\nIn May 2024, the SBU arrested two army colonels who were engaged in a plot to kidnap Zelenskyy and deliver him to Russian President Vladimir Putin, or, should that prove too difficult, assassinate him.\nEvents\nThe SBU announced that the plotters were preparing to detain the government and \"announce the \u2018removal from power\u2019 of the current military-political leadership of Ukraine\" before then seizing the Verkhovna Rada to prevent its ability to respond. The SBU then published photos of the four ring leaders who had been arrested, with their faces blurred, stating that they were all residents of Ivano-Frankivsk and known pro-Russian agitators who had a history of attending anti-government protests. The SBU also reported that they had seized a cache of assault rifles, sniper rifles, handguns, ammunition, laptops, mobile phones and hand-drawn coup instructions. The centerpiece of the plot was to trigger a riot on June 30 as a distraction to seize control of various buildings. They also planned to storm the Verkhovna Rada building.\nThe plotters plans outlined spreading false information throughout the country via social media \"to destabilise the socio-political situation within , which would play out in favour of the Russian Federation.\" The plotters were spread throughout the country, operating in cells of no more than three, and communicated to one another through instant messaging via Telegram. The leader of the plot stated that they would have organized as a \"Veche\" and would have sought public support. The plotters had rented a hall in Kyiv that could accommodate upwards of 2,000, and were supposedly in contact with elements of the military and several mercenary groups to recruit them to their cause. The SBU said that as well as mobilising in Kyiv, the coup plotters had grassroots organisations in Dnipro and other Ukrainian cities.\nThe office of Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general said the alleged leader of the plot is a head of a non-governmental entity, who had \"the experience of participating in fruitless provocative events\" prior to the coup attempt.\nFour suspects have been identified and two currently are in the SBU's custody. They face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty.\nReactions\n\u00a0Russia: The Russian government refused to comment on the allegations that they had helped organize the plotters.\nSee also\n2021 Ukrainian coup attempt allegations\n2023 Moldovan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt allegations\n",

It is best known for exhibiting Caligula exclusively for over a year in 1980\u20131981.\nHistory\nOriginally built in 1920, S. Charles Lee converted what would become Holly Cinema to the 303-seat Studio Theatre for operators Harold B. Franklin and Howard Hughes. Billed as the \"World\u2019s Most Unique Theatre\", this was Hollywood's first \"automatic\" theater, as it had no ushers, with the theater doors opening automatically as the patrons passed through turnstiles. Additionally, candy, cigarettes, and drinks were sold via coin operated slot machines.  The theater opened on July 31, 1931, with a screening of Charles Starrett's The Viking.\nIn 1936, the theater was renamed Colony Theatre, in 1945 it was renamed again, to Music Hall, and by the mid-1950s, it was known as Academy Theatre. As part of these changes, the theater capacity increased to 488.\nLoews bought the theater in 1970, at which point they added a false ceiling, curtained over the art deco interior, and renamed the theater Loew's Holly Theatre. The theater became know as Holly Cinema soon after.\nIn 1980\u20131981, Holly Cinema exhibited the Penthouse production Caligula exclusively for over a year, breaking several box office records.\nIn 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, with Holly Cinema listed as a contributing property in the district. Specifically noted were the building's French Chateauesque style as well as its steep hipped roof and stucco coverings.\nIn 1986, the theater, owned by Pacific Theaters, was shut down, with the building converted to retail use, and in the years since, all traces of the buildings cinematic past have either been removed or covered over.\n",
    "Inactive military unit of the Italian Army\nMilitary unit\nThe 10th Bersaglieri Regiment (Italian: 10\u00b0 Reggimento Bersaglieri) is an inactive unit of the Italian Army last based in Palermo in Sicily. The regiment is part of the Italian Army's infantry corps' Bersaglieri speciality. The regiment was formed in 1871 by the Royal Italian Army with preexisting battalions. In 1914 the regiment was sent to Albania, where it remained for the duration of World War I.\nDuring World War II the regiment was sent to Libya in December 1940, where it fought in the Western Desert campaign. Soon after arriving in North Africa the regiment was overcome during Operation Compass. The regiment was reformed in Italy and sent in November 1942 to Tunisia, where it fought in the Tunisian campaign and was overcome in May 1943. In June 1943 the regiment was reformed once more and fought the following month against allied forces landing in Sicily. By the end of July, the regiment was overcome for a third time and disbanded. The regiment's anniversary falls, as for all Bersaglieri units, on 18 June 1836, the day the Bersaglieri speciality was founded. \nHistory\nThe commander of the XXXIV Battalion, Major Giacomo Pagliari, falls during the storming of Porta Pia in Rome 1870\nOn 1 January 1871 the 10th Bersaglieri Regiment was formed in Rome with the XVI Battalion, XXXIV Battalion, XXXV Battalion, and XXXVI Battalion, which were transferred from the 5th Bersaglieri Regiment. The four battalions were renumbered as I, II, III, and IV battalion upon entering the new regiment. On 16 September 1883 the IV Battalion was transferred to the newly formed 12th Bersaglieri Regiment. On 18 June 1886, all Bersaglieri battalions resumed their original numbering and afterwards the 10th Bersaglieri Regiment consisted of the XVI Battalion, XXXIV Battalion, and XXXV Battalion.\nThese three battalions had been formed in 1859 (XVI Battalion) and 1861 respectively (XXXIV and XXXV Battalion). In 1860-61 the three battalions fought in the Sardinian campaign in central and southern Italy. In 1866 the battalions participated in the Third Italian War of Independence and fought in the Battle of Custoza. In September 1870 the XXXIV and XXXV battalions participated in the capture of Rome, during which the commander of the XXXIV Battalion, Major Giacomo Pagliari, fell when the battalion stormed the breach in the Aurelian Walls near the Porta Pia.\nIn 1895-96 the regiment provided 16 officers and 449 troops to help form the I, II, and IV provisional battalions, which were deployed to Eritrea for the First Italo-Ethiopian War. On 1 October 1910 the regiment's depot in Verona formed the X Cyclists Battalion.

By February 1916 Austro-Hungarian forces had reached the Italian defensive line along the Vjosa river. For the remainder of the war the regiment fought on the Macedonian front. The regiment returned to Palermo in September 1920 when the Italian protectorate over Albania was dissolved. The regiment's X Cyclists Battalion remained in Italy and operated as an autonomous unit on the Italian front throughout the war.\nAs replacement for the regiment the regiment's depot in Palermo formed on 8 April 1915 the 10th bis Bersaglieri Regiment, with the LVII and LVIII battalions, which the depot had formed earlier. Upon entering the regiment the two battalions were renamed XVI bis Battalion and XXXIV bis Battalion. With elements of the two battalions the depot also formed the XXXV bis Battalion. The 10th bis Bersaglieri Regiment was immediately deployed to the Italian front. On 5 January 1916 the regiment was renamed 16th Bersaglieri Regiment and its battalions were renumbered as LVII, LVIII, and LXIII battalion. The LXIII Battalion distinguished itself on 26-27 March 1916 on Pal Piccolo, for which the battalion was awarded a Bronze Medal of Military Valor. The 16th Bersaglieri Regiment was disbanded on 7 March 1918 and its three battalions became autonomous units.\nOn 31 January 1917 the 10th Bersaglieri Regiment's depot in Palermo formed the LXIX Battalion for the 18th Bersaglieri Regiment. In June 1918 the X Cyclists Battalion suffered heavy losses during the Second Battle of the Piave River.

    "Japanese judoka (born 2003)\nMao Arai (Japanese: \u65b0\u4e95 \u4e07\u592e, Hepburn: Arai Mao, born 23 May 2003) is a Japanese judoka. She won a gold medal in the mixed\u00a0team event at the 2024 World Judo Championships held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. She is also a gold and bronze medalist from the 2024 Asian Championships.\nJudo career\nEarly career\nArai began practicing judo at the age of 10 at the Igarashi Dojo. In her third year at Higashimatsuyama Kita Junior High School, he placed second in the over 70 kg class at the National Junior High School Judo Tournament. She then went on to Shukugawa High School, where in her first year, she lost in the third round of the over 78 kg class in the individual competition at the Inter-High School Championships, but placed second in the team competition. She then transferred to Saitama Sakae High School, where in her third year, she placed third in the Inter-High School team competition and won the individual competition with all ippon wins. She placed third in the All Japan Junior Championships. In 2022, she went on to Nippon Sport Science University.\n2022-2023\nIn her first year, Arai faced Hilal \u00d6zt\u00fcrk of Turkey in the final of the 2022 World Junior Championships, where she scored a waza-ari with an uchi-mata and then pinned her down, initially winning with a combination technique, but the ippon was revoked for grabbing below the belt and throwing her. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk later won by ippon with an ouchigari to take the championship. In the team final, Arai defeated \u00d6zt\u00fcrk with an arm lock to secure the team's victory against Turkey. In the 2022 All Japan Junior Championships, she defeated Miki Mukunoki, a first-year student at International Pacific University, who had placed third in the world junior division, to win the championship.\nIn the 2023 Belgian International, she defeated Mukunoki in the junior division final to win, but lost to the latter in the senior division final the following day and placed second.

    "The population of the Netherlands is getting increasingly older, due to longer life expectancy and a sub-replacement fertility rate. In Dutch this phenomenon is called Vergrijzing (English: Graying). As of 1 January 2023 around 20% of the Dutch population is aged 65 or older. It is predicted that this will increase to 24% in 2035 with some areas facing more severe ageing than others, especially rural municipalities in the east of the country. It is expected that the following decades this percentage will continue to increase.\nThe cause of the ageing population of the Netherlands can be traced back to the 1970s when the fertility rate started to rapidly drop.\nHistory\nAfter the Second World War the fertility rate of the Netherlands was for twenty consecutive years higher than 3.0, with the baby boom as an outlier between 1945 and 1954. Starting in 1969 the fertility rate started to decline rapidly; in 1973 it reached 2.1 and in 1976 it stabilized at around 1.5 to 1.6.\nIn 1900 around 6% of the Dutch population was aged 65 or older and fifty years later, in 1950, this percentage was less than 8%. In 1975 this had increased to 11%. In 2024 those aged 65 or older were estimated to be 20.5% of the Dutch population.\nImplications\nEconomy\nThe amount of workers that are aged 55 or older has increased since the early 2000s. In 2020 3.3% of the workers in the Netherlands was aged 65 or older. How employers look at older workers differs; most employers that already employ older workers look more positively to older workers than those that do not employ older workers. Some noted issues with older workers are that they may be less able to cope with work pressure and employing them will result in an increase in wage costs for companies. The ageing of the Dutch population will also lead to a shrinking work force and more demand for workers.\nPublic finances\nThe ageing of the Dutch population will also impact the public finances since it will lead to more government spending to deal with age related issues, while the amount of people contributing to public finances will decrease as a result of a shrinking work force. One of the areas this will put pressure on are social services because ageing will lead to more demand and rising costs.\nSociety\nThe increasing amount of older people will lead to more demand for care, both informal and professional care.\nMilitary\nAs a result of ageing more military personnel are leaving the Dutch Armed Forces, while at the same time the amount of new recruits are fewer than those leaving. To counter this the Ministry of Defence has started new initiatives and recruitment campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of the armed forces among the youths and make them consider pursuing a career in the Dutch armed forces.\nGovernment policies\nThe Dutch government has taken several policy measures to deal with the ageing of the population. One of these measures is raising the age of retirement.\nCitations\n^ a b c \"Wat wordt precies bedoeld met vergrijzing? En waar staat Nederland nu?\".

People's Architect of the USSR (1970). Laureate of the Lenin Prize (1962), State Prize of the USSR (1980) and Stalin Prize of the second degree (1949). He is mostly known for being Chief Architect of Moscow (1960\u20131980). Among his main completed projects are a high-rise residential building on Kudrinskaya Square and the development of New Arbat Avenue in Moscow. He served as a member of the Union of Architects of the USSR. Full member of the USSR Academy of Arts (1979), member of the Presidium, academician-secretary of the Department of Architecture and Monumental Art of the USSR Academy of Arts (1979). Corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Architecture (1950\u20131955), Academy of Construction and Architecture (1956\u20131963).\nBiography\nEarly life\nBorn on November 30 (December 13), 1910 in Tomsk. His parents, Vasily Mikhailovich and Maria Alexandrovna, belonged to the educated philistines. His father worked in a printing house while his mother worked in a library.\nAfter graduating from high school in 1927, he enrolled as a student at the Siberian Technological Institute, at the same time attended the creative studio of the artist Vadim Mizerov and worked as an apprentice decorator at the Tomsk Drama Theater.\nSoon he moved to Kuznetsk-Sibirsky and began working on the construction of the Kuznetsk Metallurgical Plant. Then he entered the Kuznetskstroy Training Center and in 1931 received a diploma in civil engineering. He moved to the design department of the institution, where he took part in the creation of a \u201csocialist city\u201d.\nIn 1935, he moved to Moscow to enter the workshop of Alexey Shchusev at the Moscow Architectural Institute, and graduated from the university as an external student in three years. During his studies, he met the young architect Ashot Mndoyants, who became his friend and colleague for many years. According to the memoirs of Mikhail Posokhin, even many years after they met, the two architects \"worked all day in the studio, then walked home from work together, continuing to discuss new ideas along the way, most often they came to us, had dinner, drank tea, and then on the vacant table , and often they laid out tracing paper and paper on the floor and continued to work, search, discuss, sketch\". In the late 1930s, their first joint projects were presented at competitions at the air terminal in Moscow and the theater in Komsomolsk-on-Amur.\nAfter the start of the war, he was assigned to an engineering reconnaissance company of a Civil Defense unit, which was engaged in the construction of camouflage structures and the prompt restoration of destroyed buildings. However, already in 1943, the young architect was attracted to cooperation by Dmitry Chechulin, who at that time was in charge of the reconstruction of the Mossovet building on Gorky Street. At the same time, Posokhin and Mndoyants were entrusted with the reconstruction of the building of the former Alexander School on Frunze Street, which was to house the General Staff of the Red Army. Work on the first independent project was completed in 1946. The building received typical features of the new Stalinist Empire style.\nIn 1946, he headed one of the design workshops of the Moscow City Council. Two years later, he and Mndoyants won a competition to create a Stalinist high-rise - a 24-story residential skyscraper on Vosstaniya Square. The facades of the building were decorated with elements characteristic of the Stalinist Empire style: sculptural groups, colonnades, pilasters and the spire crowning the building. Numerous innovative solutions were used in the residential building, which was unusual by Soviet standards. On the lower floors there was a two-hall cinema \"Plamya\", a laundry, and the largest grocery store in the USSR \"Gastronom\". The building also had underground parking for 134 cars. The unique building received an individual layout, expensive finishing and equipment. In particular, 28 four-room apartments were built in the house. In all apartments, the kitchens were equipped with refrigerators, built-in furniture, sinks with a crusher for the destruction of large waste, and access to a garbage chute was provided.\nPosokhin wrote about the work on this building in his memoirs \"Roads of Life\". Among other things, he noted the fact that architects were categorically forbidden to use foreign magazines in order to avoid copying the techniques of Western masters. In 1949, the architect was awarded the Stalin Prize of the second degree for the completed project.\nTypical residential development\nHe was interested not only in the creation of outstanding structures - he was one of the first architects in the USSR to develop and implement projects for large-panel buildings. In his book, published in 1953, he explained in detail the new principles of reside",
    "Norwegian priest\nSir Povel Hansson Paus (1620 \u2013 1658) was a Norwegian priest.\nBiography\nHe was born in Oslo in 1620 as the son of the priest Hans Povelsson Paus the Elder (1587\u20131648). He attended Latin school in Frederiksborg, Denmark.\nHe then went abroad for university studies together with his brother Anders Hansson Paus. From November 1642 the brothers studied philosophy and theology at the University of Franeker. From Anders Hansson Paus, there is an academic oration printed in Greek at the University of Franeker in 1644, where he lists some of the country's most prominent men\u2014chancellor Jens Bjelke, Bjelke's son-in-law Daniel Ottesen Bildt of Hafslund, Admiral Sten Willumsen Rosenvinge of Tose, and Bishop Oluf Boesen\u2014as patrons of his father who funded his education, and S. H. Finne-Gr\u00f8nn writes that the same patrons certainly also paid for Povel's studies. In May 1649 Povel earned the Magister's degree at the University of Copenhagen.\nHe then served as tutor at Oslo Cathedral School before becoming the school's conrector.\nIn 1653 he received a royal decree that promised him a position as parish priest of a parish to which the Crown held right of patronage. In September 1655 he became parish priest of Lier, Bragernes and Str\u00f8ms\u00f8 (i.e. Drammen and surroundings). He celebrated his first mass in Bragernes Church on 21 October 1655.\nPovel Hansson Paus participated in the homage to Prince Christian in 1656 and in the meeting of the estates of the realm\u2014the closest thing the kingdom had to a parliament\u2014in 1657 as a representative of the clergy in the Diocese of Oslo. He died aged only 38 in February 1658. He was interred inside Bragernes Church, an honor reserved for notables. He married Magdalene Eriksdatter in Christiania in 1652.\nNotes\n^ As a member of the clergy, one of the two privileged estates, he was styled as herr in Norwegian or Dominus in Latin, conventionally rendered as Sir as an ecclesiastical title in English; the Norwegian style herr was (until the 19th century) reserved for members of the clergy and the nobility; its predecessor sira (sir) had been introduced as the style for clergymen in Norway in the 13th century and gradually been replaced by the Norwegianized version herr from the 15th century.\n^ The Magister's degree was the highest degree at the Faculty of Philosophy. Only a small minority of priests possessed this degree; many of them rose to prominent positions such as bishop or provost.\n",
    "Extinct genus of tetrapodomorphs\nGaiasia is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapods from the Early Permian of Namibia, containing a single species, Gaiasia jennyae. Gaiasia was a freshwater predator which was exceptional among stem-tetrapods for its combination of relatively enormous size, Southern occurrence, and late survival.\nGaiasia is known from three fossil specimens, including an incomplete skeleton with a crushed skull and partial vertebral column. Though limb material is not preserved, the skull of Gaiasia indicates that its affinities lie with digit-bearing stem-tetrapods (early amphibians, in the broad sense). It was a close relative to the colosteids, a family of aquatic stem-tetrapods with long bodies and small limbs. Most digit-bearing stem-tetrapods, including the colosteids, go extinct by the Carboniferous rainforest collapse near the end of the preceding Carboniferous Period. Gaiasia is one of the few to survive into the Permian alongside crown-tetrapods (the groups directly ancestral to living amphibians, mammals, and reptiles).\nGaiasia is the largest known digit-bearing stem-tetrapods, with an estimated maximum skull length reaching 60 centimetres (24\u00a0in). It was found in the Gai-As Formation, a rock unit corresponding to cold temperate lake environments located near the South Pole (around 55\u00b0 South) in the Permian. Other digit-bearing stem tetrapods were significantly smaller (skulls under 40 centimetres (16\u00a0in) in length), and nearly all were restricted to the tropics of Euramerica, a low-latitude region equivalent to present-day Europe and North America. Gaiasia hints that stem-tetrapods in Southern latitudes continued to persist and evolve through the Late Paleozoic icehouse interval, even as low-latitude species died out and were supplanted by crown-tetrapods. Gaiasia's genus name references the Gai-As Formation, while the species name honors the late Jenny Clack, an expert in early tetrapods.\nDescription\nGaiasia has a broad flattened skull, large keeled branchial elements (throat or gill bones), a reinforced neck, and massive interlocking fangs at the front of the snout. Together these traits indicate that it was well-adapted for both suction feeding and a strong bite. The front edge of the snout is not fully preserved, but the profile of the skull shows that the snout is short and boxy. The bones of the skull roof are thin and ornamented by radiating ridges and grooves. A pineal foramen is absent, but lateral line canals are well-developed and a small intertemporal bone is present. Most unique features relate to the palate (roof of the mouth). The parasphenoid bone (which forms the floor of the braincase) is large and wide, with a blunt front tip, but the interpterygoid vacuities (large holes which flank the parasphenoid) are narrow. The paired bones at the front of the palate have large fangs: two fangs on each vomer, one per palatine, and one per ectopterygoid. Each fang is paired with a large pit which hosts developing replacement teeth.\nThe lower jaw is rather thin and smoothly curved at the front, but thickens further back and extends past the jaw joint. Several fangs occur at the front of the lower jaw, with three on each side (six in total). Two of the three fangs are adjacent to the symphysis (the point where the two sides of the jaw converge at the middle). These two fangs are hosted by the adsymphyseal and dentary bones. The largest fang is located a bit further back, on an enlarged first coronoid bone which swells inwards from the rim of the jaw. The neck joint is a strong hinge, formed from the contact between a pair of exoccipital condyles (rounded surfaces on the braincase) and a partially fused atlas-axis complex (the first few neck vertebrae). Paired exoccipital condyles have convergently evolved in a number of crown-tetrapod lineages (lissamphibians, stereospondyls, some \"lepospondyls\", and mammals), none of which are related to Gaiasia. On the edge of the braincase, a spur of bone divides the spiracular cleft (a hole which hosted the spiracle or ear canal) from the depressor mandibulae fossa (a pocket for the muscles which open the mouth).\nThe vertebrae of Gaiasia are diplospondylous. This means that each vertebra has three components: a two-part centrum with a spool-shaped intercentrum and pleurocentrum, plus a stout neural spine at the top. The ribs are large, curved, and strongly attached to their corresponding vertebra on thick pedicels. Fossils of the limbs, shoulder, or hip are completely unknown in Gaiasia. The limbs may have been completely absent (akin to stem-tetrapods such as aistopods and adelospondyls) or merely small (akin to stem-tetrapods such as colosteids and Crassigyrinus). The original description did not attempt to estimate the total body length, as much of the skeleton is incomplete. News articles publicizing the discovery suggest it could have reached a length of 2.5 metres (8.2\u00a0ft) to 4 metres (13\u00a0ft).\n",
    "\nCocoa harvested in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\nCocoa is the primary cash crop of the West African island country of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, accounting for 95% of its exports. Historically, the volume of cocoa produced, and consequently the health of the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an economy, has revolved around the global demand for chocolate. European demand for chocolate rose shortly after the introduction of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe in 1824, solidifying the crop's agricultural primacy on the islands. In the early 1900s, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe was known as \"the Chocolate Islands\", producing and exporting more cocoa than anywhere else in the world. However, cocoa production declined throughout the 20th century due to a combination of corporate boycotts, infestations, and government attempts to diversify the economy. A number of national and international initiatives have been undertaken since the turn of the 21st century to revitalize cocoa production in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, as the islands' equatorial climate provides an ideal environment for the growth of cocoa.\nHistory\nIntroduction of cocoa and boom years\nA cocoa pod on a tree in eastern S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 Island\nThe cocoa tree was introduced to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe by Portuguese colonial administrators seeking a profitable cash crop for their colony. The islands' forests were first cleared in the 16th century for sugarcane plantations, and, through the use of slave labour, the colony became the largest producer of sugar in the world. However, competition from the other Portuguese colony of Brazil diminished profits, and by the end of the century the colony's primary purpose had become to temporarily house African slaves being transported to the Americas. Hoping to generate more income from the colony, the colonial administrators introduced the coffee plant (Coffea) in 1780 and the cocoa tree in 1819. However, the cocoa tree did not fully grow on the islands until 1824, on Pr\u00edncipe. Cocoa proved to be the more profitable crop, as global demand for it gradually increased throughout the century. By the early 1900s, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe had become the world's top producer and exporter of cocoa, and the colony became known as \"the Chocolate Islands\". The United Kingdom's three largest chocolate makers at the time\u00a0\u2013 J. S. Fry & Sons, Rowntree's, and the Cadbury Brothers\u00a0\u2013 all sourced their cocoa primarily from S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.\nSlave labour and indentured servitude were used to produce cocoa during this period of growth and prosperity. Portugal abolished slavery in its colonies in 1869, when the United Kingdom and United States signed a treaty to jointly suppress the slave trade. Europeans and most Forros (freed slaves and their descendants) refused to work in the labour-intensive cocoa plantations. As a result, Portuguese colonial authorities turned to the African mainland for a replacement labour force. Between 1888 and 1908, an estimated 67,000 Africans were hired to work on cocoa plantations in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe; contemporary sources recorded a few cases of forced recruitment. Nearly all of them came from the other Portuguese colonies in Africa\u00a0\u2013 Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde. The new workers became servi\u00e7ias, contract labourers who earned low wages and possessed few rights.\nCocoa beans inside a drying shelter, at a ro\u00e7a in Monte Forte\nServi\u00e7ias worked and lived in ro\u00e7as (English: /\u02c8r\u0252s\u0259z/), large-scale plantations that functioned as self-sufficient company towns. Ro\u00e7as had chapels, hospitals, schools, stores, and workers' housing. These buildings were typically built around a plaza used for daily roll call and drying cocoa beans, among other activities. During the early 1900s, male servi\u00e7ias received a monthly salary of around 2,500 reis (about US$2.50) per month, while female servi\u00e7ias received just 1,800 reis. Because every store on the island was company-owned, nearly all wages paid to the servi\u00e7ias went back to plantation owners. Alcoholism and tropical diseases, particularly malaria, were also widespread in the ro\u00e7as.\nDecline in production\nBy 1910, cocoa production in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe had entered a steep decline due to boycotts from British and German chocolate manufacturers, who had become aware of the slave-like working conditions of the ro\u00e7as. The global revelation made it difficult for plantation owners to attract new workers and buyers. Insects, fungal diseases, and the swollen shoot virus destroyed poorly maintained fields of cocoa in the 1910s and 1920s. A plague of thrips in 1919 was particularly devastating to that year's cocoa harvest. By 1935, most buildings and equipment in ro\u00e7as had been abandoned or repurposed to grow crops to sustain the islands' population. By the early 1940s, cocoa production per hectare had fallen well below that of other West African countries. Nonetheless, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe continued to produce modest quantities of cocoa until its independence from Portugal on 12 July 1975.\nThe new Marxist",
    "Painting by Paul C\u00e9zanne\nThe Pont de Maincy is a painting by a French painter Paul C\u00e9zanne who resided during this period in Melun, a neighboring commune of Maincy, France.\nThe work, measuring from 58.5\u00a0cm south 72.5\u00a0cm, is preserved at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris.\nMain exhibitions: London (1914, 1996), Paris (1926, 1936, 1995, 2011), Beijing (1989), New York (2005).\nHistory, subject, and conservation\nCreated between 1879 and 1880 \u2014 the identification and dating of the work were not simple \u2014 it depicts a bridge that spanned the Almont in the commune of Maincy in France.\nLegacy\nIn 1993, the Peruvian painter Herman Braun-Vega referenced Pont de Maincy in Papaye \u00e0 la guitare (C\u00e9zanne), a realistic inverted still life that dialogues the post-impressionism of C\u00e9zanne with a cubist guitar. The intrinsic light of C\u00e9zanne's landscape is doubled by the natural extrinsic light to the painting through the shadow play of a sophisticated frame.

It is owned by the Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation.\nThe government closed the mill in 2020 saying it will be reopened after modernization. Pabna Sugar Mill Workers Union represented the workers of the mill.\nHistory\nThe construction of Pabna Sugar Mill started on 26 December 1992 with test production starting in 1996. The mill started commercial production in 1997 with 15 thousand tons of annual production.\nWorkers of Pabna Sugar Mill held protests in February 2018 against Nitol-Tata group which had purchased large tracts of land near the sugar mill. Md Tofazzal Hossain, managing director of Pabna Sugar Mill, also opposed the project by Nitol-Tata.\nPabna Sugar Mill had 400 million BDT in unsold sugar in 2020 and the mill was not able to explain why it could not sell them beyond poor planning.\nOn 2 December 2020, the government of Bangladesh ordered Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation to close Pabna Sugar Mill due to a number of reasons. The mill had four billion BDT in debt which has rises to seven billion BDT in 2023. Around the same time, Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation was also ordered to close Panchagarh Sugar Mill Limited, Shyampur Sugar Mills, Setabganj Sugar Mill, and Kushtia Sugar Mills. Local sugarcane farmers  and workers of the mill protested the decision to close the mill. Sanat Kumar Saha, Chairperson of Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation, announced plans to reopen the mill after modernization. Some had to sell their corps to North Bengal Sugar Mills while.\nThe Pabna Sugar Mill never made a profit during the nearly 30 years it was running from 1992 to 2020. The mill transferred around 600 employees to various state owned sugar mills. Pabna District Sugarcane Farmers' Association and Bangladesh Sugar Industry Corporation Workers-Employees Federation called for the mill to be reopened.\nDespite being closed, the government was spending money for utilities and maintenance of the mill. It is maintained by a staff of 61 including 30 security personnel. Prothom Alo asked the government of Bangladesh to investigate why Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation was spending millions to build Effluent Treatment Plants in Pabna Sugar Mill and other closed state owned sugar mills.\n",
    "1960 committee to investigate desegregation in Georgia\nSixteen of the committee's nineteen members. Chairman John A. Sibley is seated fourth from the left.\nThe General Assembly Committee on Schools, commonly known as the Sibley Commission, was a committee created by the state government of Georgia in 1960 in order to study possible approaches to public school desegregation in the state. The committee consisted of 19 members and was led by its namesake, Atlanta businessman John A. Sibley.\nIn 1959, a federal judge ruled that the system of racial segregation in Atlanta's public schools was illegal based on the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. While the Atlanta school system developed an incremental plan to allow for some token integration, this would have violated existing state laws barring integrated educational institutions from receiving public funding. Griffin Bell, the chief of staff for Georgia Governor Ernest Vandiver, proposed the idea of forming a committee to analyze the issue of desegregation and make recommendations to the state government on the matter. This committee would function as a blue-ribbon committee and was tasked with holding hearings throughout the state in order to gage the public's opinion on desegregation. For the hearings, Sibley, who would serve as the committee's chairman, decided to frame the question of desegregation as one of two choices: either following Georgia's existing laws that would result in defunding and the closure of public schools or allow for a \"local option\" plan where state laws would be changed to allow for each school district to decide for itself how it would handle school desegregation. Sibley promoted the local option plan as a legal path forward to both allow Atlanta to move forward with its limited integration while largely maintaining segregated educational institutions in the rest of the state.\nDuring March 1960, the committee held hearings in each of the state's ten congressional districts and took testimony from roughly 1,800 witnesses, the majority of whom favored maintaining existing state laws that could have resulted in school closures. However, as these hearings were nonbinding, the committee instead drafted a majority report that largely promoted the local option plan and a minority report that promoted the existing system of massive resistance. In January 1961, following the reconvening of the General Assembly and the integration of the University of Georgia, the government adopted many of the recommendations, allowing Atlanta to become the first city in the Deep South to peacefully integrate its public schools. Summarizing the commission, University of Georgia historian Christopher Allen Huff wrote, \"Although the Sibley Commission helped to prevent the violence that accompanied desegregation in other Deep South states, it also provided tactics that local school boards could use to slow down the desegregation process. As a result, serious attempts at desegregation across the state would not begin until the late 1960s\".\nBackground\nRacial segregation in public schools\nFurther information: School integration in the United States, Jim Crow laws, and Separate but equal\nWhite American protestors against school integration at the Arkansas State Capitol in Little Rock, Arkansas, 1959\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States issued their landmark decision in the court case Brown v. Board of Education that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional. In response, conservative state politicians in the Southern United States adopted a policy of massive resistance where they passed a number of legislative acts designed to delay or outright stop attempts to integrate public schools. In Georgia, where historian Alton Hornsby Jr. described the state's general assembly as \"overwhelmingly segregationist\", legislators had previously approved a constitutional amendment in 1953 that would have cut state funding to any public institution that voluntarily integrated and converted those school districts from public systems to private schools, and in 1956, the state government passed additional legislation further outlining the transfer of public school property to private entities in the event of mandatory integration. Much of this legislation had been passed under the administration of Governor Marvin Griffin, who was succeeded by Ernest Vandiver in 1959. As part of his campaign, Vandiver promised to uphold the laws signed by Griffin that would have defunded integrated public institutions, often saying \"no, not one\" with regards to admitting African American students into white-only institutions.\nLegal action against segregation in Georgia\nBecause of the ambiguous wording in the Brown case, individual school districts did not have to integrate until they were mandated to do so by a court order. However, following the Little Rock Crisis in 1957, federal courts began to issue more decisions on school segregation cases that ",

Negotiations on the DCA agreement started between Finland and the United States in March 2023. The Parliament of Finland was informed as the negotiation process progressed.\nIn its general session on December 14, 2023, the government decided to propose to the president Sauli Niinist\u00f6 that he authorizes defense minister Antti H\u00e4kk\u00e4nen or, if he is prevented, foreign minister Elina Valtonen to sign the agreement on defense cooperation. Niinist\u00f6 accepted the presentation made at the presentation of the President of the Republic on December 15, 2023.\nThe defense agreement between Finland and the United States was signed in Washington, D.C. on December 18, 2023. It was signed by minister H\u00e4kk\u00e4nen and US Secretary of Defence Antony Blinken. Foreign minister Valtonen was also present at the event.\nThe next day, Russia invited the Finnish Ambassador of Moscow, Antti Helanter\u00e4, to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for an interview regarding the agreement. Later, the Finnish Foreign Ministry announced that Finland had already requested a meeting regarding the situation on Finland's eastern border. In this same meeting, the Russian Foreign Ministry also discussed the agreement concluded between the United States and Finland. Russian officials said that they \"are taking the necessary steps to respond to the aggressive decisions of Finland and its NATO allies.\"\nThe DCA agreement proceeded to the parliament's hearing after the government decided on the matter on May 30, 2024. On June 24, 2024, the Constitutional Law Committee issued a statement that approval of the DCA agreement requires a qualified majority of two-thirds of the votes cast. Parliament approved the DCA agreement on July 1, 2024. Only Anna Kontula (from the Left Alliance) made a motion to reject the agreement, but the motion was not supported. Thus, the DCA agreement was unanimously approved without a vote.\nContent\nU.S. soldiers pilot the M2 Bradley Vehicle during the Arrow 23 exercise in Niinisalo, Finland on May 5, 2023.

    "Canadian oilman\nRobert Arthur Brown Jr. (20 March 1914 \u2013 4 January 1972) was a Canadian oilman who was active from the late 1930s to the early 1970s. In June 1936, his father discovered oil in Turner Valley and ushered in a new era in Alberta's petroleum industry. After the discovery, Brown worked alongside his father until the latter's death in 1948. In 1950, he acquired control of the Home Oil Company and in 1955 became the company's president. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Brown turned Home into one of Canada's most successful exploration and production companies. In 1969, Brown attempted to acquire control of Atlantic Richfield, and in the process amassed a personal debt of $26 million. The debt forced him to sell his share of Home, which prompted the intervention of the federal government prevent a foreign takeover. After he found a buyer in the Consumers' Gas Company, Brown stayed on as president of Home, but died shortly thereafter at age 57.\nBiography\nRobert Arthur Brown Jr. was born in Calgary on 20 March 1914 to Robert Arthur Brown Sr. (1886\u20131948) and Christina McLaughlin (1887\u20131970). Brown was educated at University School in Victoria, British Columbia. He then attended the University of Alberta and studied commerce. Although he was on track to graduate in 1936, he business activities prevented him from obtaining his degree.\nOn 16 June 1936, Robert Arthur Brown Sr. and his partners, Max Bell and John W. Moyer, discovered crude oil in Turner Valley with their Royalties No. 1 well. The discovery began a new era in Turner Valley, which had been in production since the Dingman No. 1 well hit oil on 14 May 1914. At the time, it was the largest discovery of oil in Canadian history. Robert Jr. joined his father in the oil business and worked primarily to raise capital. The Brown group formed a new company for every well they drilled and, accordingly, paid royalties per individual well. At most, they group operated twelve companies.\nIn May 1943, Brown joined the navy and left Calgary. After completing his basic training at HMCS Cornwallis, he received a commission and was posted to naval headquarters in Ottawa. Brown continued to receive private income from his petroleum activities, and rather than live in barracks, took out a suite at the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier, where he lived for the duration of the war. Brown hosted regular parties in his suite, and hosted prominent members of society through contacts of his friend J. Ross Tolmie. In his post at naval headquarters, Brown worked on fuel supply.\nAfter the war, Robert Jr. concluded that the oil industry in Alberta was done, and believe instead that he could make money importing consumer goods and electronics from the United States. Accordingly, he formed Northland Automatic Appliances and received capital from his father. The company was a failure, and in 1948, he returned to Calgary and rejoined his father in the oil business. By this time, most of the Brown interests had been consolidated into a company called Federated Petroleums, which in turn was controlled by the holding company United Oils. After Robert Sr. died on 17 May 1948, Robert Jr. assumed control of the family interests.\nIn 1950, Brown began purchasing share of Home Oil on the open market. By 1952 he had effective control of Home, and in 1955 merged the operations of Federated Petroleums into Home. In 1957, Home began purchasing shares of Trans-Canada Pipelines, and by 1960 had invested $38 million. The investment gave him a 14 per cent interest in the company, making him the largest shareholder. Home remained Trans-Canada's largest owner until Canadian Pacific Investments acquired a larger share in 1967.\nIn 1968, Atlantic Richfield made a major oil discovery on the Alaska North Slope. Brown and Home proceeded to acquire 450,000 acres of leases on the North Slope and drill two well, which cost the company $40 million. Home acquired also a two per cent stake in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. Brown spent $69 million to acquire 622,280 shares of Atlantic Richfield, 145,900 of which he acquired personally with $23 million loaned from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Bank of Nova Scotia. The remainder of the shares were owned by Home. By 1970, Atlantic Richfield shares had halved in price, while Home shares went from $80 in 1969 to $20 the following year. Given a deadline by the banks to repay his loan, Brown sought to find a buyer for his stake in Home. His most promising offer came from Ashland, though government ministers Joe Greene and Jack Austin pressured him not to sell to foreign interests. Brown found a Canadian buyer finally in the Consumers' Gas Company, a utility based in Toronto.\nAfter selling his stake in Home to Consumers', Brown was allowed to stay on as company president. However, less than a year after the sale, he died at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto on 4 January 1972 at age 57.\nBesides his involvement with Home, Brown also served as a director of Trans-Canada Pip",
    "Church in Maramure\u0219 County, Romania\nThe church of Archangel Michael in S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba-Peri from the village of S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba in the region of Maramure\u0219, Romania is the tallest wooden church in the world. A representative of the characteristic wooden churches of Maramure\u0219 with double eaves, the church continues the tradition of the old Orthodox monastery in Peri, the ruins of which are now found in the area of Hrushove in Ukraine.\nHistory\nOriginal church\nSlavonic document about the Peri monastery dated May 1, 1404 in Sighet (National Archives of Hungary, DL 42811).\nIn 1391, the grandsons of Drago\u0219 of Moldavia donated lands and goods to the Peri Monastery, and a stone church was built. For more than 300 years, this stone church was used as the headquarters of the Romanian Diocese of Maramure\u0219, being later built by the craftsman Ioan Macarie a place to serve as a place of prayer for the Greek-Catholic community in the surroundings. During the time of the Drago\u0219e\u0219ti voivodes, the monastery was patronized by Saint Michael the Archangel.  At the Peri Monastery, \"The Psalter\", \"The Gospel\", \"The Sunday Legend\", \"The Voro\u021bean Codex\" and \"The Acts of the Apostles\" were translated and copied into Romanian for the first time. In 1404, a number of Romanian nobles reinforced the possession of the Monastery, mentioning the previous donation of Balc and Drag: three villages (Taras, Criva and Peri) and a mill \"in the land of C\u00e2mpulung on the S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba river, where S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba flows into the Tisza, and after their death, Dumitru voivode and his brother Alexandru.\"\nNowadays, the church's charter quotes the following: \"The craftsmen strengthened these dominions in front of the monastery\". Historical events led to the destruction of the original monastery church in the year 1783.\nRebuilt monastery\nThe S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba-Peri Monastery was founded in 1997, within the boundaries of the village of S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba, out of the desire to renew the historical tradition of the old Monastery of the Holy Archangel Michael, from Peri, Maramure\u0219. Founded by the parish priest Grigore Lutai, according to the plans of the architect Dorel Cordo\u0219, the S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba Peri Monastery received, from 2005, a community of nuns, which continued the construction work started previously. The Maramure\u015f style church of the monastery was originally plated with 8.5 kilograms of gold, and the cross, seven meters high, in turn, covered with four kilograms of gold. The construction is located on the banks of the Tisza and was built between 1998 and 2003. The tower of the monastery is visible from a distance of five kilometers over the Tisza river and can be admired by Romanians from Transcarpathia, a region of historical Maramure\u0219 which is nowadays part of modern Ukraine. Currently, the monastery hosts 6 nuns, the abbess being Stavrofora Agnia Ciuban.\nWith a maximum height of 78 m, the church of the S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba-Peri monastery is currently ranked third among other tall places of worship in Romania by pinnacle height, after the Timi\u0219oara Orthodox Cathedral and the Roman Catholic church of Sf. Mihail in Cluj, and before other imposing wall edifices, such as the evangelical churches in Bistri\u021ba or Sibiu.\nGallery\nThe dendrological park of \u201eLivada\u201d\nThe tower\nThe summer altar \nOverview \nOverview \n",

The basis of the service is search and rescue units.\nHistory\nThe modern system of search and rescue was created in accordance with the Order of the Government of Russia of July 28, 1992 No. 528 on the basis of tourist and mountaineering rescue services, points and centers.\nThe Search and Rescue Service is a subordinate institution of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, and is intended to carry out search and rescue operations in emergency situations of a natural and man-made nature.\nMarine rescue\nIn 1923, the Special Purpose Underwater Expedition (EPRON) was created in the Soviet Union. Until 1931, it was under the jurisdiction of the OGPU, in 1931 it was transferred to the NKPS, in 1936 - to the People's Commissariat of Water Transport, in 1939 - to the People's Commissariat of the Marine Fleet. EPRON has become a powerful specialized monopoly organization for carrying out rescue, ship-lifting and diving operations. It had its own structural units (expeditions) in the Baltic, Black Sea, Northern, Pacific fleets and the Caspian military flotilla. With the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, EPRON was included in the Soviet Navy, and in 1942 it was reorganized into the Navy Rescue and Ship Lifting Service, which in 1944 was transformed into the Navy Rescue Service (ASS VMF).\nBy Order of the Council of Ministers of the USSR dated August 23, 1956 No. 5128-, the implementation of ship lifting and underwater technical work for national economic purposes for all civilian departments was transferred to the USSR MMF. These functions were to be performed by the Main Directorate of Sea Routes, Ship Lifting and Underwater Technical Works of the USSR MMF (Glavmorput MMF), which began to create on January 1, 1957, the corresponding units in all sea basins as part of the basin organizations of sea routes. Auxiliary watercraft and diving equipment were transferred to the Main Sea Route of the MMF from the ACS of the Navy}}.\nThen, in the Black Sea, Baltic, Murmansk, Northern, Kamchatka, Sakhalin, Far Eastern and Caspian shipping companies, expeditionary teams of emergency rescue and underwater technical work (EO ASPTR) were created, operating on a self-supporting basis, which were assigned by order the functions of performing emergency operations. rescue operations and responsibility for rescuing people at sea. In 1972, the All-Union Association (VO) \"Sovsudopodjem\" was created at the USSR MMF, to which all expeditionary detachments of the ASPTR were functionally subordinated. In 1982, the VO \"Sovsudopodjem\" was abolished with the distribution of its functions between the VO \"Moreplavaniye\" and VO \"Morstroyzagranpostavka\".\nIn 1988, the State Marine Rescue Coordination Center and corresponding centers and subcenters in the country's sea basins were established under the USSR MMF. On January 15, 1991, the State Maritime Emergency Rescue Specialized Service of the USSR (Gosmorspetsvsluzhba) was created in accordance with Order of the Council of Ministers no. 48, subordinating basin emergency rescue departments to it. This structure, which in 1992, after the collapse of the USSR, became part of the system of organizations of the Ministry of Transport of Russia (Mintrans of Russia), was named the State Maritime Emergency Rescue Specialized Service of the Russian Federation (Gosmorspetsluzhba of Russia), and subsequently became the basis of the State Marine Rescue Service of Russia.\nOn July 23, 1998, by merging the Main Directorate of the State Marine Special Service of Russia and the State Maritime Rescue Service of Russia, the State Institution \"State Emergency and Rescue Coordination Service of the Russian Federation\" (Gosmorspasluzhba) was created. In 2004, during the administrative reform of the State Institution Gosmorspasluzhba and its divisions became subordinate to Rosmorrechflot of the Ministry of Transport of Russia. On March 31, 2005, the State Institution Gosmorspasluzhba became a federal unitary enterprise, and on May 26, 2011 - a federal budgetary institution (FBU \"Gosmorspasluzhba of Russia\").\nIn 2007, the Russian State Marine Rescue Service employed about 1,500 people, about 80 fleet units, including multi-purpose vessels, sea rescue tugs, diving vessels and auxiliary fleet. In addition to rescuing people at sea, the Russian State Marine Rescue Service also cleaned up oil spills at sea.\nOn June 24, 2014, the State Marine Rescue Service of Russia was transformed into the Federal Budgetary Institution \"Marine Rescue Service of Rosmorrechflot\". On March 15, 2018, the Federal Budgetary Institution \u201cMarine Rescue Service of Rosmorrechflot\u201d was renamed into the Federal State Budgetary Institution \"Maritime Rescue Servic",
    "British politician\nAdam Thompson is a British Labour Party politician who has served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Erewash since 2024.\nHe stood for the neighbouring Amber Valley constituency for the previous general election in 2019.\nEarly life and education\nThompson attained a PhD in metrology from the University of Nottingham, following which he worked at the university as a research scientist in manufacturing engineering. He served as a union representative for research scientists at the institution as a member of the University and College Union. He is also a former teacher, and has cited his experience working in schools during Michael Gove's tenure as Education Secretary as a key influence on his decision to enter electoral politics.\nPolitical career\nThompson joined the Labour Party following the 2015 general election, inspired by a speech made by then-outgoing party leader Ed Miliband. Prior to his election as a Member of Parliament, he contested a number of local elections, including to Sandiacre Parish Council, Erewash Borough Council, and Derbyshire County Council. In the 2019 borough council election, he fell eight votes short of winning one of the three council seats in Long Eaton Central ward.\nShortly ahead of the 2019 general election, he was selected as the Labour Party candidate in the Amber Valley constituency, which neighbours Erewash. He finished second, defeated by sitting Conservative MP Nigel Mills; Mills won with a majority of 16,886 votes (37%), the largest margin for any winning party in the seat since its creation in 1983. Mills was subsequently defeated at the 2024 general election by Labour candidate Linsey Farnsworth.\nThompson was serving as a Vice-Chair of Scientists for Labour in 2020 at the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic. In that role, he co-led a team which briefed the Shadow Cabinet during the crisis.\nThompson was selected as Labour's parliamentary candidate for Erewash in July 2022. He was endorsed in this process by the CWU, regional branches of UNISON, the GMB, and Unite, as well as the East Midlands branch of the Co-operative Party. At the time, he was also serving as secretary and campaign coordinator in the Erewash Constituency Labour Party.\nHe was the Labour Party candidate in Erewash at the 2024 general election, in which he defeated incumbent MP Maggie Throup. Thompson won by 5859 votes (13.6%), becoming the first Labour MP for Erewash since Liz Blackman; who had stood down 14 years earlier.\nPersonal life\nHe has resided in Long Eaton since 2019, having previously lived in Sandiacre from 2015.\n",
    "\nProtectorate bilingual name of Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1 Street in \u0158evnice, Czech Republic\nThe Czech-written tombstone of Franti\u0161ka Kellner from 1830 in the cemetery near St. Havel in Zbraslav, Havl\u00edn, Czech Republic\nIn some countries, surname inflection (Czech: p\u0159echylov\u00e1n\u00ed p\u0159\u00edjmen\u00ed, Polish: odmiana nazwiska, Slovak: prechy\u013eovanie priezviska) consists in the formation of surname of the opposite sex, but mainly in women, by by modifying the initial form of the surname, mostly the surname of a male person.\nThe reason is usually the expression of the family status of the bearer of the surname to be brought into line with the expression of its grammatical gender. We also inflect personal names in a similar way (Jan/J\u00e1n - Jana) and nouns denoting persons, e.g. Czech and Slovak professions (doktor - doktorka). But the procedure is different for surnames. Inflection allows them to be inflected in accordance with the rule of agreement of subject and predicate, thereby expressing relationships in the sentence (for example, what is the podmet and what is the subject) in the sentence.\nOn the contrary, it rarely deviates from the feminine form of the surname to the masculine, e.g. when a person changes gender to masculine or during marriage the groom takes the bride's surname or for the son of an unmarried mother. Then the masculine form is used, commonly understood as basic, uninflected.\nThe female variant of the surname is usually formed as feminative from the basic, male variant, or the male and female variants are grammatically symmetrical. Moreover, in some other languages and cultures, maiden surnames (belonging to the father, e.g. Polish -\u00f3wna) were or are being distinguished from wives' surnames (belonging to the husband, e.g. Polish -owa).\u00a0 Inflection of surnames is especially typical for inflective language, in which it is usually done with specific suffixes.\nInflection is usually not governed by grammar, it is often only a matter of adding the ending -ov\u00e1. So, for example, from the surname Jakub\u016fv, the inflected form is not Jakubov\u00e1, but Jakub\u016fvov\u00e1 (or it is not inflected either), from the surname V\u00edtr, the inflected form is not V\u011btrov\u00e1, but V\u00edtrov\u00e1, from the surname Smrt, the inflected form is Smrtov\u00e1, not Smr\u0165ov\u00e1. Latin endings are also not respected, which fall out during declension, so that, for example, the inflected form of the surname Simonides is not Simonides, but Simonides, from Herod is Herodova, not Herodova, from Paulus is Paulusova, not Paulova. For some slanted surnames ending in -\u011b, the letter \"t\" is also added according to the \"chicken\" pattern, so, for example, there are three possible slanted forms of the surname Kn\u00ed\u017ee, namely Kn\u00ed\u017eov\u00e1, Kn\u00ed\u017eetov\u00e1 and Kn\u00ed\u017eeov\u00e1. This is not always the case, e.g. with the surnames Ko\u0165ov\u00e1 or K\u00e1n\u011b, where there are only variants Ko\u0165ov\u00e1 and K\u00e1\u0148ov\u00e1. With exceptions (Jank\u016fov\u00e1, Petr\u016fov\u00e1, Pavl\u016fov\u00e1, Bratr\u016fov\u00e1), surnames ending in -\u016f are not inflected, unless they are of foreign origin, e.g. the surname Fa\u016f is commonly inflected as Fa\u016fov\u00e1, because it comes from the German word Pfau.\u00a0 Surnames ending in -\u00fd can also have inflected forms ending in -\u00fdov\u00e1, especially if the adjective is outdated and sounds strange or it is not obvious that it is an adjective, so for example the surname \u0160ur\u00fd has the inflected form \u0160ur\u00e1 and \u0160ur\u00fdov\u00e1. For foreign surnames from adjectives ending in -i and -y, the same rules apply as for their Czech versions. In the case of the endings -o, -\u00e9 and -ic, there is also the possibility that a woman will keep a surname that does not end in -ov\u00e1. With exceptions, surnames formed from clear adjectives following the \"spring\" pattern are not inflected, such as Ho\u0159ej\u0161\u00ed, Dolej\u0161\u00ed, Ho\u0159en\u00ed, Dom\u00e1c\u00ed, Ryz\u00ed, etc. If it is likely that it is not an adjective, the surname is sometimes inflected, e.g.\u00a0 in addition to the main form, the surname Brix\u00ed can also be a slanted form Brix\u00edov\u00e1. In the case of surnames such as Krej\u010d\u00ed or Ko\u010d\u00ed, there are also slanted forms Krej\u010dov\u00e1 and Ko\u010dov\u00e1 (rarely Ko\u010d\u00edov\u00e1).\nCzech language\nThe forms of female surnames are mainly created for historical and linguistic reasons by inflection from male surnames.\nDevelopment and methods of deflection\nAs historical records testify, women's names used to be as free as men's names. A woman was therefore a separately named person, often independent of a man's name, e.g. by origin. Examples: Eli\u0161ka z K\u0159iv\u00e9, \u017eena Jana P\u0161eni\u010dky z Ra\u010d\u00edna (1483); M. \u0160. Plach\u00fd koupil dv\u016fr od Mariany Bos\u00e1kovic, man\u017eelky Jakuba Kokl\u0161tejna (1610). Gradually, several ways of writing the names of persons of the female gender became established:\nFirst name of the woman and her occupation. (K\u00e1\u010da d\u011bve\u010dka, Anna kucha\u0159ka, Barbora markyt\u00e1nka)\nThe woman's first name and her relationship (Anna matka Probo\u0161ta, Manda \u017eena P\u00e1tka, Ludmila za Bobka, Dorota vdova po Novotn\u00fdm, Anna dcera Hejla). This method of writing was also used in registers kept in Latin (Ludmilla filia Jakobi Holan, Anna vidua post Vitum Slaby).\nThe woman's first name combined with an ",
    "Hugo Erikovich Jalava (3 February 1874 in Saint Petersburg \u2013 28 April 1950 in Petrozavodsk) was a train driver and carried out administrative tasks in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). He is known for his role in the Russian Revolution, when he helped Lenin flee Finnland in July 1917 and then return to Saint Petersburg shortly before the October Revolution.\nLife\nFamily and occupation\nHugo Erikovich Jalava was born on the 3. of February 1874 in Saint Petersburg. Not much is known about his childhood as many records were lost during the second world war, as well as the Russian and Finnish civil wars.\nIn 1889, Jalava worked as a lathe operator in a factory, from which he was dismissed for being \"unreliable.\" He got a position at the depot of the Finland Station in Saint Petersburg as a boiler cleaner in 1898 and later became a fireman. He became an assistant train driver in 1901 and then a train driver in 1904.\nHe married the worker Lydia Germanovna Jalava (1886\u20131975) in 1903. Together, they adopted three orphaned girls.\nPolitical and revolutionary work\nHugo Jalava actively participated in the work of the railway union and vigorously defended the interests of the workers in the years of the first Russian revolution (1905\u20131907). Jalava was chairman of the railway committee in the fall of 1905 during the political general strike in October. He repeatedly transported party members, money, weapons and illegal literature across the Finnish border. Starting 1907, \"conspiratory\" party actions were organised in his apartment. \n\nJalava was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Finland between 1906 and 1917.\nRussian revolution\nH2 293 as a Memorial-locomotive at the Finland Station in Saint. Petersburg\nAfter the events of the July days in 1917, Jalava smuggled Lenin across the finish border twice with the steam engine H2 293. Disguised as a stoker, Lenin was able to stay undetected by the border patrols. From August to September, the Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) maintained written communication with Lenin through Jalava. On October 14, 1917, Lenin held a meeting at Jalava's apartment in St. Petersburg with leading party workers and militant organizations under the Central Committee of the RSDLP to discuss preparations for an armed uprising.\nIn 1918 Jalava participated in the Finnish civil war and was secretary of the foreign ministry of the revolutionary government. After the defeat of the revolution, Jalava returned to Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd). He worked as the head of the Secretariat Office for the Support of Finnish Refugees, which was established by the revolutionary government of Finland, and later in the People's Commissariat for Nationalities. In the years of the Russian civil war, Jalava returned to the railway and worked as a driving instructor and senior official in the depot.\nContinued life and activities\nIn 1921, Jalava was wrongly arrested due to a denunciation but was released on Lenin's personal order.\nFrom 1925/26, Jalava was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). In 1930, he was sent to the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Karelian ASSR), where he worked in the apparatus of the Central Executive Committee and then in the Council of the People's Commissars of the Karelian ASSR.\nDuring the German-Soviet War (1941\u20131945), Jalava worked in the administration of the Sverdlovsk Railway.\nHe returned to Petrozavodsk in 1947/48. From 1947 he worked in the Council of Ministers of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic. During the last years of his life, Jalava lived in Petrozavodsk Lenin Street 13.\nHe died in 1950. Jalava was buried at the Neglinsky Cemetery in Petrozavodsk.\nIn 1974, he was reburied in the honorary burial site of the Sulashgorsk Cemetery in Petrozavodsk.\nAwards\nFor revolutionary and labor achievements (40th anniversary of his work activity), Jalava was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labour on November 30, 1931.\nIn 1948, on the 25th anniversary of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, he was awarded the Order of Lenin.\nRememberence\nMemorial plaque for Jalava in Petrozavodsk\nIn 1970, a memorial plaque made of pink granite with Russian and Finnish text was placed on the house at Lenin Street 13 in Petrozavodsk. The inscription on the plaque roughly reads: \"In this house lived Hugo Erikovich Jalava from 1948 to 1950. Following the events of July 1917, he brought V. I. Lenin to Finland with the historic locomotive No. 293 and brought him illegally to Petrograd in October 1917.\"\nThe Viennese band Schmetterlinge paid musical tribute to him in the most famous track of the album Proletenpassion (1977).

    "1854 armed uprising in the Eureka Rebellion\nThis is an incomplete list of those who were among the rebel garrison at the Battle of the Eureka Stockade that took place in 1854 at Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It was the culmination of the 1851\u20131854 Eureka Rebellion during the Victorian gold rush. The fighting resulted in at least 27 deaths and many injuries, the majority of casualties being rebels. The miners had various grievances, chiefly the cost of mining permits and the officious way the system was enforced. There was an armed uprising in Ballarat where tensions were brought to a head following the death of miner James Scobie. On 29 November 1854, the Eureka Flag was raised during a paramilitary display on Bakery Hill that resulted in the formation of rebel companies and the construction of a crude battlement on the Eureka lead.\nFortification of the Eureka lead\nMain article: Eureka Stockade (fortification)\nA plan of the Eureka Stockade in the 1855 Victorian High Treason trials\nFollowing the oath swearing and Eureka Flag raising ceremony on Bakery Hill, about 1,000 rebels marched in double file to the Eureka lead, where the Eureka Stockade was constructed over the next few days.  It consisted of pit props held together as spikes by rope and overturned horse carts. Raffaello Carboni described it in his 1855 memoirs as being \"higgledy piggledy\". It encompassed an area said to be one acre; however, that is difficult to reconcile with other estimates that have the dimensions of the stockade as being around 100 feet (30\u00a0m) x 200 feet (61\u00a0m). Contemporaneous representations vary and render the stockade as either rectangular or semi-circular. Testimony was heard at the high treason trials for the Eureka rebels that the stockade was four to seven feet high in places and was unable to be negotiated on horseback without being reduced.\nLieutenant governor Charles Hotham feared that the goldfield's terrain would greatly favour the rebel snipers. Ballarat gold commissioner Robert Rede would instead order an early morning surprise attack on the rebel camp. Carboni details the rebel dispositions along:\nThe shepherds' holes inside the lower part of the stockade had been turned into rifle-pits, and were now occupied by Californians of the I.C. Rangers' Brigade, some twenty or thirty in all, who had kept watch at the 'outposts' during the night. \nThe location of the stockade has been described by Eureka veteran John Lynch as \"appalling from a defensive point of view\" as it was situated on \"a gentle slope, which exposed a sizeable portion of its interior to fire from nearby high ground\".\nIn the early hours of 1 December 1854, the rebels were observed to be massing on Bakery Hill, but a government raiding party found the area vacated. The riot act was read to a mob that had gathered around Bath's Hotel, with mounted police breaking up the unlawful assembly. A three-man miner's delegation met with Rede to present a peace proposal; however, Rede was suspicious of the chartist undercurrent of the anti-mining tax movement and rejected the proposals as being the way forward.\nThe rebels sent out scouts and established picket lines in order to have advance warning of Rede's movements and a request for reinforcements to the other mining settlements. The \"moral force\" faction had withdrawn from the protest movement as the men of violence moved into the ascendancy. The rebels continued to fortify their position as 300-400 men arrived from Creswick Creek, and Carboni recalls they were: \"dirty and ragged, and proved the greatest nuisance. One of them, Michael Tuohy, behaved valiantly\". Once foraging parties were organised, there was a rebel garrison of around 200 men. Amid the Saturday night revelry, low munitions, and major desertions, Lalor ordered that any man attempting to leave the stockade be shot.\nEureka Stockade defenders\nMain article: Battle of the Eureka Stockade\nSwearing Allegiance to the Southern Cross by Charles Doudiet (1854)\nEureka Slaughter by Charles Doudiet (1854)\nEureka Stockade Riot by J.B. Henderson (1854)\nEureka Stockade by Beryl Ireland (c.1890-1900)\nCommon estimates for the size of the Eureka Stockade garrison at the time of the attack on 3 December range from 120 to 150 men.\nAccording to rebel commander in chief Peter Lalor's reckoning: \"There were about 70 men possessing guns, 30 with pikes and 30 with pistols, but many had no more than one or two rounds of ammunition. Their coolness and bravery were admirable when it is considered that the odds were 3 to 1 against\". Lalor's command was riddled with informants, and Rede was kept well advised of his movements, particularly through the work of government agents Henry Goodenough and Andrew Peters, who were embedded in the rebel garrison.\nInitially outnumbering the government camp considerably, Lalor had already devised a strategy where \"if the government forces come to attack us, we should meet them on the Gravel Pits, and if compelled, we should retreat by the ",

    "Second conference of the 2024 PVL season\nVolleyball competition\nThe 2024 Premier Volleyball League Reinforced Conference will be the eighteenth conference of the Premier Volleyball League and its ninth conference as a professional league.\nThis will be the second conference for the 2024 season. It was originally slated to be a merged tournament of the Invitational and Reinforced Conferences, but PVL Commissioner Sherwin Malonzo announced in a simultaneous interview during the commencement of the 2024 PVL Draft Combine that this would be a stand-alone Reinforced tournament and that the Invitational Conference will start in September.\nTwelve teams will compete in the Reinforced tournament, which have been grouped into two pools. Each team will be allowed to be reinforced by one foreign player. Strong Group Athletics changed its name to Zus Coffee Thunderbelles.\nChanges\nPVL Draft\nFurther information: 2024 Premier Volleyball League draft\nThe PVL Rookie Draft was conducted before the start of the conference. To join, the draft required candidates neither playing experience nor academic qualifications. It was open to all aspiring Filipino and Filipino-foreign citizens ages 21 years old and above who want to play in the professional league.\nThe application for the Rookie Draft was originally scheduled to end on May 31, 2024. But PVL Commissioner Malonzo later announced that it will be moved to June 12, 2024, so that rookies can have time to prepare documents needed for the draft.\nThe draft combine was held on June 25\u201326, 2024, and the draft proper was held on July 8, 2024.\nExclusion of the national team players from the upcoming conference\nPVL players on the Philippine women's national volleyball team are excluded from the upcoming conference, as the national team season of the FIVB calendar is ongoing. The national team suited up for the 2024 FIVB Women's Volleyball Challenger Cup, and will prepare for the 2024 SEA Women's V.League.\nParticipating teams\nPools composition\nThe teams are grouped into two pools using the serpentine system with the 2024 All-Filipino Conference final standings as the basis for the Top 9 teams. Like the 2023 Premier Volleyball League Invitational Conference, the league ensures that sister teams would not be drawn into the same pool. If the sister teams of Farm Fresh and Zus Coffee happen to be placed in Pool A using the serpentine system, for example, they would be separated to prevent immediate collision between them. Thus, Farm Fresh (9th) and Galeries (10th) are placed in Pool A, and Capital1 (11th) and Zus Coffee (12th) are placed in Pool B.\nVenues\nTransactions\nNational team players\nThe following players are part of the Philippine national team that played at the 2024 FIVB Women's Volleyball Challenger Cup and will play for the 2024 SEA Women's V.League. They are therefore excluded from the upcoming conference.\nTeam additions and transfers\nThe following are the players who transferred to another team for the upcoming conference.\nForeign guest players\nThe following are the foreign guest players for the upcoming conference.\nDrafted players\nThe following are the drafted rookie players for the upcoming conference.\nCoaching changes\nFormat\nThe following format will be conducted for the entirety of the conference:\nFirst Round\nSingle round-robin format; two pools.\nTeams are ranked using the FIVB Ranking System.\nThe top three teams from each pool will move on to a second-round crossover with the bottom three teams from the other pool.\nSecond Round\nSingle round-robin format; two pools.\nThe results and the points of the matches between the same teams already played during the first round shall carry over to this round.\nTeams are ranked using the FIVB Ranking System.\nThe eight teams with the best combined win-loss records will advance to the quarterfinals.\nQuarterfinals\nAll games are knockout matches.\nQF1: #1 vs #8\nQF2: #4 vs #5\nQF3: #2 vs #7\nQF4: #3 vs #6\nSemifinals\nAll games are knockout matches.\nSF1: QF1 Winner vs. QF2 Winner\nSF2: QF3 Winner vs. QF4 Winner\nFinals\nAll games are knockout matches.\nBronze medal: SF1 Loser vs SF2 Loser\nGold medal: SF1 Winner vs SF2 Winner\nInvitational Conference\nThe semifinalists of this conference will qualify for the 2024 Premier Volleyball League Invitational Conference.\nPool standing procedure\nFirst, teams are ranked by the number of matches won.\nIf the number of matches won is tied, the tied teams are then ranked by match points, wherein:\nMatch won 3\u20130 or 3\u20131: 3 match points for the winner, 0 match points for the loser.\nMatch won 3\u20132: 2 match points for the winner, 1 match point for the loser.\nIn case of any further ties, the following criteria shall be used:\nSet ratio: the number of sets won divided by number of sets lost.\nPoint ratio: number of points scored divided by number of points allowed.\nHead-to-head standings: any remaining tied teams are ranked based on the results of head-to-head matches involving the teams in question.\nFirst round\nAll times are Ph",

He was one of the few Chaoui members, and he quickly distinguished himself as a vocal advocate for Tifinagh revival and recognition. \nin 1973, Mohand Arav Bessaoud vouched for him to chair the academy as secretary general. Negadi's tenure was marked by his prolific writings and advocacy efforts, Afterward he started distributing Tifinagh publications in the Aures region. However, in 1975, Negadi left the academy, citing 'infiltrations by agitators' as the reason. \nIn 1980, Negadi, alongside Professor Messaoud Nedjahi and other activists from the Aur\u00e8s region, founded the association UPA (Union of the Amazigh People). Ammar Negadi's grave - headstone written in Tifinagh scriptThis spin-off association continued to promote a standardized version of the Neo-Tifinagh script through its Azaghen/Link publication. By 1993, there were several sets of Neo-Tifinagh fonts in place. \nNegadi is also credited with establishing a Berber calendar linked to an ancient event contrary to the traditional calendar that doesn't compute the years. This new calendar gained recognition and has been featured on Algerian currency since 2022 . The calendar marks the beginning of Berber history, corresponding to the year Shoshenq was enthroned as Pharaoh of Egypt in 950 BC. \nLegacy\nAmmar Negadi's legacy transcends his scholarly contributions; he is remembered as a dean among Amazigh activists in the Aur\u00e8s, Following Negadi's passing on December 2, 2008, his body was repatriated to Algeria, where he was laid to rest in his hometown of Merouana. The funeral was attended by a multitude of activists from across the Aur\u00e8s region, underscoring the profound respect and admiration he commanded within the Amazigh community. \nIn 2018, Ammar Negadi's final wish was fulfilled when over 7,000 books and documents his association had collected on Aures history were donated to universities in Batna and Khenchela \n",
    "State-sponsored veneration of Hua Guofeng, considered a failed cult\nA ballet dedicated to Hua Guofeng \"With flowers to Chairman Hua\", 1978\nHua Guofeng's cult of personality was the attempted cult of personality of Hua Guofeng, who became the second Paramount leader of China from 1976 to 1978 after the death of Mao Zedong. During his rule he was referred to as \"the brilliant leader Chairman Hua (\u82f1\u660e\u9886\u8896\u534e\u4e3b\u5e2d)\".\nBackground\nHua Guofeng, relatively unknown to the public at his appointment, launched a nationwide campaign in late 1976 to criticize the Gang of Four and rehabilitate those punished during the Cultural Revolution. Over 4600 disgraced cadres were restored between October 1976 and December 1978. Deng Xiaoping was also rehabilitated in July 1977, marking significant changes in the Central Committee's composition.\nHua famously stated; \"We will resolutely uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made, and unswervingly follow whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave\", later referred to as the \"Two Whatevers (\u4e24\u4e2a\u51e1\u662f)\". Hua was criticized for his perceived blind obedience. He initiated the first National College Entrance Examination since the Cultural Revolution and mandated the display of his and Mao's portraits side-by-side at official gatherings.\nA primary class displaying Hua's portrait next to Mao's, 1978\nIn 1978, Hua played a key role in drafting a new state constitution, which aimed to restore some rule of law and planning mechanisms, though it retained elements of continuous revolution. Despite his efforts to elevate his prestige through reforms and propaganda, Hua's changes were eventually overshadowed by Deng Xiaoping's rise.\nAttempted cult of personality\nHua Guofeng attempted to establish a cult of personality by closely associating himself with Mao Zedong's legacy. He adopted Mao's style, including his distinctive hairstyle, and often emulated Mao's public demeanor. State media and propaganda were employed extensively to project Hua as Mao's rightful successor, positioning him as the new helmsman of the revolution.\nHua also leveraged Mao's supposed endorsement, prominently featuring the phrase \"With you in charge, I\u2019m at ease,\" which was attributed to Mao, to legitimize his leadership. This endorsement was heavily promoted to reinforce his authority and connection to Mao.\nAdditionally, Hua sought to embed his image into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Schools, government offices, and public institutions were required to display his portrait alongside Mao's. He also revised the national anthem to incorporate Mao's name and the Communist Party, reflecting a shift towards a more ideologically driven tone.\nDespite these efforts, Hua's cult of personality failed to resonate deeply with the public or within the Communist Party, largely due to the emerging influence of Deng Xiaoping and the general shift away from the extreme cultism of the Mao era. Hua's reliance on Maoist rhetoric and symbolism was seen as out of step with the country's growing desire for reform and modernization, contributing to the eventual decline of his political influence.\nSee also\nList of cults of personality\nMao Zedong's cult of personality\nXi Jinping's cult of personality\n",
    "\nState Defense Committee (Polish: Komitet Obrony Kraju; KOK) was a government organization which existed from 1959 in the Polish People's Republic and continued to exist following the demise of the communist system, until 2002 when it was dissolved.\nHistory\nThe process of creatin of a body which would create and coordinated integrated state defense system in the Polish People's Republic began in the mid-50s Poland in the mid 50s. In a document dated 3 November 1955, a note was written with the handwritten signature of Prime Minister J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz. It contained the first official information about the planned State Defense Committee. For this, a body with political and military competences was needed. The National Defense Committee was established by Resolution No. 66 of the Council of Ministers of February 18, 1959. In times of peace, the committee had the authority to coordinate and supervise the implementation of defense tasks by other state authorities on an ongoing basis, while in state of emergency the committee was empowered to take over full power which was composed of the leadership of the party and the government under the leadership of the Prime Minister. The priority task of KOK was an attempt to develop a concept of the functioning of central and local authorities during war and to synchronize the states of combat readiness of operational troops with the states of defense readiness of the state.\nThe committee was to consist of eleven members responsible for appropriately grouped ministries and state institutions, with specified minimum personnel necessary for their functioning. The Committee gained legal authority under the Act on the general duty to defend of November 21, 1967, which entrusted it with determining threats to state security and managing all related matters. The KOK resolution of December 7, 1981 extended the competences of provincial defense committees, thanks to which they were to be structures responsible for introducing and maintaining martial law. Despite this, with some exceptions, provincial defense committees did not play a significant role during martial law. After martial law, the Act of 1983 allowed any person appointed by the Sejm (the 1st Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party) to become the chairman of the State Committee. Moreover, the chairman of the KOK gained competences in the event of a state of emergency newly introduced into the legislation, and in the event of its introduction, he would become the commander-in-chief of the state's armed forces, while the committee itself was to lead the restoration of order in the state.\nFollowing the fall of the communist system in Poland, the National Defense Committee was subordinated to the National Security Bureau until it was formally dissolved in 2002.\nSee also\nCouncil of National Defense, a similar body existed during the 1920 Soviet Polish War.\nCouncil of Defence, a similar body existed in the Soviet Union\n",

    "\nAmerican football player\nJerry \"Rat\" Murtaugh (born April 30, 1948) was an American college football linebacker for the Nebraska Cornhuskers who was named a first-team All-American in 1970.\nMurtaugh was a co-captain of the 1970 Nebraska team which won the 1970 National Championship by defeating LSU in the 1971 Orange Bowl to cap off an undefeated 11\u20130\u20131 season.\nBiography\nEarly years\nJerry Murtaugh was born April 30, 1948, in Omaha, Nebraska.\nMurtaugh attended Omaha North High School, where he was a star wrestler, winning a Nebraska state wrestling championship. He also was an outfielder on the school baseball team, and played fullback and linebacker for the North High football squad.\nCollegiate career\nMurtaugh started for the powerful Cornhuskers team as a sophomore in 1968 and garnered honors as a unanimous All Big-Eight selection during his 1969 junior season. As a junior he broke All-American Wayne Meylan's school record for tackles with 126.\nHe entered his 1970 senior season highly touted, being named to the Playboy magazine and Football News preseason All-America teams.\nThe 1970 Nebraska team was loaded with talent, including in addition to Murtaugh future Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Rodgers, running back Jeff Kinney, and quarterback Jerry Tagge, a 1972 first round draft pick of the Green Bay Packers. Ahead of the season co-captain Murtaugh attracted attention with a Joe Namath-like \"guarantee\" that the Cornhuskers would finish the 1970 season undefeated.\nMurtaugh later recalled his September 1970 encounter with the 35 members of the press seeking flavorful news copy. \"A bunch of reporters around, and they just asked me, bluntly: 'How do you think you're going to do?' And I just told them \u2014 I said, 'We're going to win it all \u2014 nobody's going to beat us.'\"\nThe 1970 team ultimately put their money where Murtaugh's mouth was, running the table to finish 11\u20130\u20131 \u2014 culminating with a 17\u201315 win on New Year's Day over the LSU Tigers and a first national title for the scarlet-and-white.\nLife after football\nDuring the 2000s, Murtaugh assumed the unofficial role of coordinator of the Nebraska football program's alumni and fans of the team from around the country. Working with the school's outreach director and president of the booster club, Murtaugh constructed and maintained a database of former players and their contact information with a view to coordinating speaking engagements for the players and bringing them to closer connection with the university and its athletics program.\nAs of 2024, Murtaugh still stands as #2 on Nebraska's all-time tackles list, with 342, despite having had only three years of varsity football eligibility in accordance with NCAA rules of the day.\n",

To headline, there\u2019s a pressure that comes with it. Expectations get higher and higher as the night goes on. You\u2019re worried if people are going to hear their favorite songs or not. I\u2019m a people pleaser, which is horrible. I really want my fans to be pleased. But I\u2019m actually enjoying this. There\u2019s a lot of work that comes with the show, before you go out and sing a song. But it\u2019s rewarding to do your own show, too, so I\u2019m all the way in it. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m doing it.\n\u2014Ledisi, Billboard magazine interview\nPrior to the commencement of The Pieces of Me Tour in support of her sixth studio album Pieces of Me, Ledisi performed as the opening act of American singer Kem's Intimacy Tour.

    "1972 studio album by Jean Shepard\nJust Like Walkin' in the Sunshine is a studio album by American country singer Jean Shepard. It was released in September 1972 by Capitol Records and was her nineteenth studio album. It would be Shepard's final Capitol album before moving to United Artists Records. Shepard was noticing a lack of attention towards her music from Capitol by this point and would even boycott recording sessions for the album until receiving more support from the company. Nonetheless, the album was completed and included three singles that peaked outside the US and Canadian country top 40 songs charts: \"Safe in These Lovin' Arms of Mine\", \"Virginia\" and the title track. It was given a positive review from Billboard following its release. \nBackground, recording and content\nJean Shepard was among the country genre's first female solo artists to find commercial success. Her career launched in the 1950s on Capitol Records where she had top ten, top 20 and top 40 singles over the next two decades. By the early 1970s, Shepard's record sales had dropped and her commercial success waned. According to her autobiography, Shepard claimed that she was \"getting lost in the shuffle\" within the Capitol Records roster. In 1972, Shepard went on \"strike\" against Capitol, vowing not to record her next studio album until receiving \"support\" from the company. Shepard then went into the studio to finish sessions her final sessions for Just Like Walkin' in the Sunshine in June 1972. It was produced by Earl Ball and Larry Butler. The album consisted of ten tracks. New material from  Don Reid (\"Virginia\") and Jerry Chesnut (\"Love Will Always Be There\") was included in the track listing. Song story lines varied from discussing the joy's of love (such as the title track) and giving advice to a woman having an extramarital affair (\"I've Loved Him Much Longer Than You\").\nRelease, critical reception and singles\nJust Like Walkin' in the Sunshine was released by Capitol Records in September 1972. It was her nineteenth studio album in her career. The label distributed the disc as a vinyl LP, with five tracks on side of the disc. Shepard would later move to United Artists Records shortly after the album's release. It was given a positive response from Billboard magazine who called it a \"strong entry\" that should be \"sure to prove a big seller\". Despite this prediction, the album's three singles reached positions outside the country songs top 40 charts in the US and Canada. The album's release was preceded by its lead single in November 1971 called \"Safe in These Lovin' Arms of Mine\". It climbed to the number 55 position on the US Billboard country songs chart. The next single released from the album was \"Virginia\" in March 1972. The song went to the number 68 position on the US country songs chart. In July 1972, the title track was issued as the album's third single. It reached number 46 on the US country songs chart and number 65 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart.\nTrack listing\nRelease history\n",

It grows on the moist leeward slopes and on roadsides in valleys with running water in the more montane part of its range, but also in more open scree forests in the more subalpine part of its range.\nIn the Ellenberg system of indicator values, C. greimleri scores 9 for light availability, 5 for temperature, 9 for climatic continentality, 5 for soil moisture, 5 for soil pH, 8 for soil fertility, 0 for soil salinity. As calculated by these values, the coterminous Cirsium species with greatest ecological similarity was C. arvense, followed by C. heterophyllum and C. spinosissimum. The species is calcifuge, but does sometimes grow on calcareous substrates.\nDescription\n1853 illustration by Carl Schnorr.\nRepresentative specimen.\nRoot is an oblique, cylindrical rhizome.\nPlants grow to a height of 110-180\u00a0cm, with the exception of a form that grows to 30\u00a0cm identified in 1902 and designated C. greimleri f. depressum by Eugen Johan Khek, and sterile basal rosettes. Growth is erect but nodding below the capitula. Stems are shallowly ribbed. Stems are simple or have few branches. The form with branches was designated C. greimleri var. ramosum by Khek after he identified it in 1906. Their colour is green or reddish green but pilose or subglabrous at the base, whitish green and sparsely arachnoid in the middle, and white and densely arachnoid below the capitula. Leaves grow all along the stem.\nBasal leaves are 11-24\u00a0cm wide and 1-2\u00a0cm longer than wide in mature specimens. Their morphology ranges from ovate, to orbicular, to deltate especially in younger leaves. Peduncular leaves amplexicaul, often auriculate. Their shallow pinnate lobes are doubly serrate to pinnatipartite, with weak yellowish to brownish-purple spinules up to 2\u00a0mm situated at the margins, subglabrous to scattered pubescent above and densely arachnoid-lanate below. All leaves are soft and herbaceous.\nFlowers are capitula, each with 1-8 flowers, solitary or corymbosely terminally clustered, rarely solitary on 1-5 lateral pedicels. Involucre dimensions are 13-21\u00a0mm long at flowering. Phyllaries in 6-7 rows. Individual bracts bracts flare out from the bud, with distinct vittae, the outer and inner bracts being distinguished by the presence and absence, respectively, of a visible spine. Involucres are \u2003 purplish brown to \u2003 purplish black.\nCorolla length is 17-21\u00a0mm in hermaphrodites, 15-19\u00a0mm in females. At full anthesis, corollae average \u2003 deep violet, but can be \u2003 greyish violet or even \u2003 ruby. During fading, corollae average \u2003 dark purple, but can be \u2003 lighter, \u2003 dark magenta, or even \u2003 dark ruby or \u2003 dark violet. They ultimately fade to whitish, as does the \u2003 (hermaphrodite) or \u2003 ochre synantherium. The style is always whitish except for the \u2003 ruby shortly bi-lobed stigma, which fades to \u2003 deep crimson or \u2003 brownish-purple.\nStrongly anemochorous, its fruits contain oblong, compressed, asymmetric \u2003 greyish ochre achenes, 16-19\u00a0mm in hermaphrodites, 14-18\u00a0mm in females. They are attached to 4-5\u00a0mm pappi. The pappus is plumose, whitish, or stramineous.\nLookalikes\nC. waldsteinii Rouy is genetically close and almost identical in appearance.

    "Musical artist\nRandy Gurley is an American country singer who performed in the US and the UK. She had several hits on the US country charts from 1977 to 1979. She recorded for the ABC and RCA labels. She is most likely remembered for her version of \"True Love Ways\".\nBackground\nRandy Gurley was an artist who had the good fortune to be recognized within the music industry before she had a hit on the charts. ABC's actions with her were something of an exception to the trend that they were following by not signing acts that they felt could not develop into a substantial album selling artist. They would normally establish an artist with a single first. Jim Foglesong who was ABC's president in Nashville felt that Gurley had a unique talent that could go far. Making an exception with her, they released an album and a single almost at the same time.\nShe was born circa 1963 in Salem, Massachusetts, and grew up in Maine and California. She was singing from the age of sixteen. She apparently was on the verge of giving up singing. However she borrowed money and headed to Dallas to stay with a friend and try to get her career going. It was there that she came into contact with a young public relations specialist called David Van Cronkhite. He is the man who was credited with discovering her. It was Cronkhite who took her to see veteran producer Owen Bradley and have him interested in producing her as an artist. He then took her to Tulsa where she met Jim Halsey to get him interested in handling her career.\nGurley's hits include \"True Love Ways\" in 1977 and \"Don't Treat Me Like a Stranger\" and \"If I Ever\", both in 1979.  She was a Cash Box Country Album place Winner (New Female Vocalists section) in 1978 and a Country Music Magazine Bullet Award runner up the following year.\nShe was on the ABC Nashville roster that also included Tom Bresh, Roy Clark, John Conlee, Narvel Felts, Freddy Fender, Barbara Mandrell, The Oak Ridge Boys and Tommy Overstreet etc. She was also a touring support act for The Oak Ridge Boys. She had also hired Vickie Carrico as her backing singer.\nAs of July 1977, Randy Gurley was being managed by DVC, Inc. headed by David Van Cronkhite.\nCareer\n1977\nRandy Gurley recorded the Carol Bayer Sager / David Wolfer song \"Heartbreaker\" which was produced by Harold Bradley. Backed with \"Louisville\", it was released on ABC/Dot 17728 in 1977. It was a recommended single in the Country section of the November 12 issue of Billboard.\nAccording to the December 9, 1977 issue of Radio & Records, her single was added to the playlist of KLAK in Denver, Colorado.\n1978\nOn February 14, 1978, Randy Gurley was set to headline at her first major show at the Palomino club in North Hollywood.\nGurley's performance at the Palomino Club was reviewed by Patricia Thomas in the March 11, 1978 issue of Cash Box. Thomas wrote that after the support acts, Gurley came bounding across the dance floor then on to the stage. She started off with the song \"Southland\" which was described as a rock stomping tribute to the southern neighbors. Thomas said that it was a well-chosen kick off for the set of songs which were weritten or performed by artists such as the Eagles, Bonnie Raitt and J.D. Souther. It was the cover of Souther's \"Faithless Love\" which was singled out as a fine performance. Some songs from Gurley's forthcoming album were also performed. In addition to saying that Gurley's 5 feet 1 inch of unaffected personality and vocal style mix well, Gurley's clear voice as her outstanding feature and her cross-over potential was also noted.\nLet Me Be the One (album)\nGurley's debut album Let Me Be the One which was produced by Harold Bradley and Jim Foglesong was released in 1978 on ABC AB-1067. It was reviewed in the May 6 issue of Cash Box with the reviewer saying that it bursts with smooth professionalism. The consistency of the material was also noted. The picks were the title song which was referred to as a standout and J.D. Souther's \"Faithless Love\" and Steve Young's \"Old Memories Mean Nothing to Me\". The reviewer predicted a long line of her albums to follow.\nThree songs from the album were recommended by The Gavin Report in the publication's April 28 issue. They were \"Only Diamonds Are Forever\", \"Faithless Love\" and \"Old Memories\".\n\"Let Me Be the One\" (single)\nThe single \"Let Me Be the One\" was released on ABC AB-12347. It was reviewed by Record World in the magazine's April 1 issue. It was one of the two Country Picks of the Week, the other being \"Two More Bottles of Wine\" by Emmylou Harris. The reviewer referred to Gurley's song as pleasant and easy-going and it would go well with the coming of the spring season. According to The Country Column in the April 15 issue of Cash Box, the song had been chosen by American Airlines for all of their aircraft's in-flight stereo music programming.\nFurther activities\nDuring July, she was appearing at the Park Tahoe Hotel in Stateline, NV and was set to wrap up her month-long engagement on the",
    "Diplomatic mission\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands has had a diplomatic representation at the Holy See since 1944. Previously this was the case from 1814 to 1871 and from 1918 to 1925. Initially this was in the form of a legation, but this was converted to ambassador in 1967.\nHistory\nThe mission was established in 1814, just after the emergence of the Netherlands as an independent unitary state. After the Capture of Rome and the unification of Italy in 1870, the Papal States and territorial power of the Pope came to an end. This was a reason for the liberal Member of Parliament Gerard Dumbar to submit an amendment in 1871 to delete the item from the budget. The amendment was adopted with 39 votes in favor and 33 votes against. The recall followed in early 1872.\nDuring the First World War, a lot of diplomacy took place in the Vatican between warring countries. In 1915, the liberal Cort van der Linden cabinet decided to temporarily reestablish the embassy as a 'listening post' for the neutral Netherlands. In 1920 it was converted from temporary to permanent legation. In 1925, the leader of the Political Reformed Party (SGP) Gerrit Hendrik Kersten submitted an amendment to abolish the legation. This was supported by opposition parties and the Protestant ruling party Christian-Historical Union (CHU). The so-called Night of Kersten led to the fall of the first Colijn cabinet and the abolition of the legation in 1926.\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, representation became relevant again. The Americans already insisted on this in 1940. During the war, however, this proved difficult for the Dutch government-in-exile, partly because they did not know how the Protestant part of the population would react to this. Queen Wilhelmina, who was not enthusiastic about the embassy anyway, was particularly concerned about this. Minister of Foreign Affairs Eelco van Kleffens even briefly threatened to resign if it was not instituted. Ultimately, Wilhelmina agreed and the embassy was established in 1944.\nSince then, CHU, SGP and Democrats 66 (D66) have tried at various times to abolish the post, but without success.\nList of representatives\nS.G.M. baron van Voorst tot Voorst in 1942\nOctaaf van Nispen tot Sevenaer (1915\u20131926)\nM.W. van Weede (1944\u20131954)\nF.R.W.H.M.J. graaf de Marchant d'Ansembourg (1954\u20131967)\nS.G.M. baron van Voorst tot Voorst (1967\u20131975)\nJ.I.M.

    "American rapper (born 1999)\nMusical artist\nTatiana Mann (born January 23, 1999), known professionally as Hook, is an American rapper. She started her solo rap career at age 18. She released her debut studio album, Bully, in 2019, which was executive produced by record producer Nedarb, and released a collaborative album with him, Crashed My Car, in 2020.\nLife and career\nTatiana Mann was born on January 23, 1999 in San Diego and raised in Riverside, California. Her biological father was a rapper. As a child, she was in two R&B girl groups with her stepsisters that were managed by her stepfather, in which she was a singer and rapper. There, she first came up with her stage name, Hook, due to her writing the hooks for most of the groups' songs. While in the groups, she toured various Los Angeles high schools and transitioned to homeschooling in order to accommodate her touring schedule. Also with her stepfather, she recorded her first song, \"Pop My Gum\". Mann attended the Riverside City College with plans to study forensic science, but dropped out, considering it to be less important than making music. She started her solo rap career at age 18.\nHook made her musical debut with her debut mixtape, Hook, at the beginning of 2019. Hook's debut studio album Bully was released on June 24, 2019, and executive produced by record producer Nedarb, who previously worked extensively with rapper Lil Peep. Her second mixtape, I Love You, Hook, was released on September 27, 2019, preceded by its single \"Stand It\". She released the single \"Bad Bitty\" with a music video in November 2019. Her collaborative third album alongside Nedarb, Crashed My Car, was released on January 23, 2020; her album I Love You 2, Hook and her mixtape Pretty Bitty: The Mixtape, were both also released in 2020.\nHook's album From, Hook was released in January 2022 and her album Castle was released in March 2024.\nMusical style\nHook's music is West Coast and alternative hip hop. Jack Angell of The Fader described her flow as \"staccato\" and \"unorthodox\" and her lyrics as \"unapologetic\", also writing that her 2019 album, Bully, was \"a SoundCloud-influenced take on classic West Coast hyphy and G-funk styles\". For Pitchfork, Nadine Smith also wrote that her delivery was \"staccato\" and that her \"confident and calculated\" flow was often backed by \"overdubs and ad-libs\" that sounded \"exasperated, overrun with anxiety and gasping for breath\". Alphonse Pierre, also of Pitchfork, wrote that her songs on Bully and 2020's Crashed My Car were West Coast \"house party anthems\", while her later music was defined by \"mayhem\" and being \"deranged\", also writing that her best songs \"crash different moods together like bumper cars\".\nPierre and NPR's Stephen Thompson both called her rapping style \"combative\". Uproxx's Aaron Williams also wrote in 2020 that she has \"an unconventional flow and a quirky ear for beats\". Jordan Darville, for The Fader, wrote that her 2024 album Castle showcased her \"experimental tendencies\".\nHook has stated that her primary musical inspiration is Back from the Dead, a 2012 mixtape by Chief Keef, which she listened to while high on psychedelics and was inspired by its experimental nature. She has also said that she is inspired by artists she was introduced to by her parents growing up: R&B artists such as Mary J. Blige and SWV from her mother, chopped and screwed music from her biological father, and hip hop artists such as Rick Ross and Nipsey Hussle from her stepfather. Hook also produces her own music.\nPersonal life\nAs of 2019, Hook is based out of Leimert Park in South Los Angeles. She has stated that she has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from crashing her car nine times.\n",
    "Ecological site in County Roscommon, Ireland\nThe Cloonchambers (Irish: Portach Chluain Sheamhair) Special Area of Conservation or SAC is a Natura 2000 site based close to the town of Castlerea in County Roscommon, Ireland. The qualifying interests by which it is protected as an SAC are the presence of three habitat types: the presence of active raised bogs (priority habitat), the presence of degraded raised bogs still capable of natural regeneration, and the presence of depressions on peat substrates of Rhynchosporion vegetation.\nLocation\nThe Cloonchambers Bog SAC is located 6 kilometers to the west of Castlerea, County Roscommon, in the townlands of Cloonchambers, Cloonconra (Electoral District (E.D.) Coolougher), Cloonkeen (E.D. Coolougher), Cloonsuck and Leveelick. Schedule 1 of the Statutory Instrument for this site identifies it as encompassing an area of 348.25 hectares.\nCloonchambers Bog, Co Roscommon\nSAC qualification\nIreland has a legal obligation to designate a range of habitats and species under the European Union Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC and the Irish regulations which implement this Directive (European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 477 of 2011). Ireland has designated an area of approximately 13,500 km2 as SACs to date, including land, lakes and marine habitats. The Irish National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) investigates, designates and advises on such SACs and other protected sites. Details of the Cloonchambers Bog SAC can be found on their website. \nThe Cloonchambers Bog site was proposed as a Site of Community Importance in November 1997, and was designated as a Natura 2000 site under the Habitats Directive. Statutory Instrument No.  389 of 2022, establishing the site as an SAC (Site code: 000600), was passed in 2022.\nThe three ecologically significant features which qualify this site for designation as a Special Area of Conservation are the presence of specific protected habitat types.  \nThese three habitats are: \nActive raised bogs (Natura 2000 code 7110; Annex 1 priority habitat)\nDegraded raised bogs still capable of natural regeneration (Natura 2000 code 7120)\nRhynchosporion vegetation/Depressions on peat substrates of the Rhynchosporion (Natura 2000 code 7150).\nSAC site description\nCloonchambers Bog SAC comprises two elongated peat-filled basins, separated by grassy, fen vegetation. This strip of vegetation occurs at locations where the thinner peat mixes with mineral soil. The bog includes 7.66 hectares of active raised bog, 21.09 hectares of degraded raised bog and 0.3638 hectares of Rhynchosporion vegetation. The site includes three habitat types for conservation, including one priority habitat. \nThe National Parks and Wildlife Service site synopsis for this Special Area of Conservation notes that: \n\u201dCloonchambers Bog is of high conservation value as it is a good example of a western raised bog that contains areas of active raised bog, degraded raised bog and Rhynchosporion vegetation. The presence of an extensive flushed fen area on the high bog surface is a very rare feature of Irish raised bogs and is thus of considerable ecological and eco-hydrological interest. Of particular botanical interest is the presence of Vaccinium vitis-idea, a rare plant species usually associated with montane heath habitats in the west and north of Ireland\u201d. \nActive raised bog\nActive raised bog is a priority habitat protected under the Habitats Directive. It includes wet, actively peat-forming high bog, with a high proportion of Sphagnum moss species (the term \u2018high bog\u2019 refers to the area of intact deep peat: the remains of the original raised bog. It also should include some or all of these features: hummocks, pools, wet flats, Sphagnum lawns, flushes and soaks. At this Special Area of Conservation, the active raised bog is well-developed but to be found in only a relatively small, wet part of the high bog surface. The active raised bog area includes several small pool systems. The flora in this habitat includes Bog Asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), Bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), bog moss (Sphagnum cuspidatum) Common Cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), and White Beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba). This area also includes Rhynchosporion vegetation.\nDegraded raised bog\nDegraded raised bog corresponds to those areas of high bog whose hydrology has been adversely affected by peat cutting, drainage and other land use activities, but which are capable of regeneration. In habitats with this classification (Natura code 7120), peat is not currently forming, but natural peat regeneration is still possible.  This constitutes the majority of the uncut high bog area. There has been peripheral drainage and burning at the site, so the degraded bog area is relatively dry. As a result, the vegetation consists of mixtures of Carnation Sedge (Carex panicea) and/or Bog Asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum). Other plant species occurring here include Cross-leaved Heath (Erica ",

    "\nTaha al-Jumailly, also known as Taha al-J, (born 1991 or 1992) is an Iraqi former member of Islamic State (ISIS) currently serving a life sentence in Germany for his role in the Yazidi genocide. He is believed to be the first ISIS member to be found guilty of genocide.\nal-Jumailly joined Islamic State in 2013. As a member of the group he held several roles in Raqqa, the group's Syrian \"capital\", and in his home country of Iraq. While in Syria in 2015 he met Jennifer Wenisch, a German Islamic convert who had recently emigrated to the Middle East, at a Quran reading he was holding at Wenisch's guest house. Wenisch showed interest in marrying al-Jumailly but said she did not want to look after the household, and al-Jumailly agreed to find some household help. Shortly afterwards, al-Jumailly purchased a Yazidi woman and her five-year-old daughter Reda as slaves while on an ISIS base. The two victims had been captured by ISIS during the Sinjar massacre in August 2014 and had been sold and resold several times.\nWenisch and al-Jumailly married in summer of 2015. The two of them lived in Fallujah, Iraq. al-Jumailly forced the two Yazidi slaves he had procured to perform household chores, beating them in order to punish them for failing to obey his commands and giving them very little food. The woman was forced to perform regular Islamic prayers, and she and her daughter were physically abused by al-Jumailly, often at Wenisch's request.\nIn either July or September 2015, al-Jumailly became enraged after he discovered that Reda had wet the bed. As punishment he forced Reda's mother to stand barefoot outside in temperatures of around 50 degrees, causing her to suffer severe burns. He then took Reda outside and tied her to a metal window grille, tightening her restraints to the point that she was unable to breathe or stand. Wenisch warned al-Jumailly that Reda would die if left in that position, but al-Jumailly did nothing. When Reda was eventually cut down, al-Jumailly took her inside and Wenisch tried to give her water to drink, but she was already dead.\nBoth Wenisch and al-Jumailly were questioned by ISIS security officers about the child's death, leading them to flee to Turkey rather than risk arrest. Wenisch was captured in Ankara and sent back to Germany in 2016, where her and her husband's involvement in Reda's death became known. al-Jumailly avoided arrest, but was later captured in Greece and extradited to Germany to stand trial under the doctrine of universal jurisdiction. Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney located Reda's mother, known as Nora, and arranged for her to be brought to Germany to act as co-plaintiff in the criminal case.\nal-Jumailly was charged with committing genocide against the Yazidis. Prosecutors argued that al-Jumailly's actions had been performed in furtherance of Islamic State's extermination campaign against the Yazidi minority, and thus had the necessary intent to be guilty of the crime. He was also accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity and human trafficking. On November 30, 2021, a court in Frankfurt found him guilty on all counts. al-Jumailly fainted when he learned that he had been convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the same day.\n",
    "2022 novel by Cecile Pin\nWandering Souls is a novel by British author Cecile Pin, published in 2022 by HarperCollins. The story of a family of Vietnamese refugees adapting to life in the United Kingdom, it features references to various atrocities and disasters that afflicted refugees in the 20th century.\nPin began writing the novel, based partially on the experiences of her mother, after reconnecting with her Asian heritage around the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2023, it was shortlisted for the Waterstones Debut Fiction Prize and longlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction.\nBackground\nPin's mother was a Vietnamese refugee who travelled by boat to Thailand before settling in France, losing five siblings and her parents along the way. Pin heard stories about these experiences as she grew up in France and the United States, but felt disconnected from her Asian heritage. She began to explore her heritage, first through cooking and later through reading books by Asian writers.\nPin collected archival evidence about the life of refugees to expand her knowledge of the subject and to add authenticity to the book. She was inspired to conduct deeper research after watching an episode of A Very British History entitled Whatever Happened to the Boat People?\nPin's philosophy studies influenced the book's direction, as she learned about grief during this time. Pin also stated her desire to write a book reflecting the experiences of the South East Asian diaspora in the United Kingdom, feeling that this community was underrepresented in British literature.\nSummary\nThe novel begins in 1978, in the village of Vung Tham in Vietnam. A family is preparing to leave their home and begin a new life with their family in New Haven, Connecticut. The family plans to send the three oldest children, 16-year-old Anh, 13-year-old  Minh and 10-year-old Thanh ahead of their parents and four younger siblings.\nThe three older children travel by boat, eventually arriving in Hong Kong, where they are housed in a refugee camp close to Kai Tak Airport. Later, the children are brought to a beach and asked to identify the bodies of their parents and siblings who drowned during their journey. The children struggle with their grief but Anh is determined to care for her brothers.\nAnh begins to feel resentful towards her uncle in America, blaming him for the deaths of her family members. After she refuses to tell resettlement officers that she has family in the United States, the children are instead resettled in the United Kingdom. They are first housed in a camp in Sopley before moving to a small flat in Catford. The children struggle to adapt to life in England, finding the language difficult and the food unpalatable. They are also subject to occasional racism.\nAnh begins work in a garment factory but later feels she is not meeting her potential and finds work in an accounting firm. There, she begins a relationship with Tom, an auditor raised in London by parents of Cantonese origin. Tom helps Anh to deal with her feelings of guilt over the deaths of her family members.\nMeanwhile, Minh drops out of school and struggles to find regular work. Disillusioned, he is apparently involved in illegal activity and his relationship with Anh suffers.\nAs the youngest of the three, Thanh finds it easiest to adapt to life in England. He studies well at school and hopes for a career in astronomy, but later takes an unappealing office job after failing to secure finance for a university place.\nIn 2016, Anh has started a family with Tom. Her daughter, Jane, wishes to study philosophy at university, despite her mother's disapproval. Jane encourages Anh to join Facebook to reconnect with other Vietnamese boat people. After reconnecting with relatives in the US, the family travel to Vietnam to cremate the remains of their lost family members.\nThe main narrative is interspersed with experimental chapters from alternative perspectives. The ghost of one of the drowned siblings observes his living relatives, soldiers involved in Operation Wandering Soul recount their memories of their experience and a narrator, later revealed to be Anh's daughter Jane, discusses her research and thoughts on various atrocities committed against refugees.\nReception\nWandering Souls received mostly positive reviews from critics. The Guardian praised the book's prose style and emotional resonance while expressing excitement about Pin's future career.\nThe Times Literary Supplement said Wandering Souls \"touches a resounding chord of melancholy\".\nThe New York Times offered praise for the novel, describing its experimental structure as \"something special\", but commented that elements of the narrative seemed aimless.\nThe i was mixed in its assessment, describing elements of the novel's narrative as \"clunky\" but praising the \"sensory experiences\" present in the narrative.\nAwards\nIn 2023, Wandering Souls was shortlisted for the Waterstones Debut Fiction Prize, and longlisted for the Women's Priz",
    "\nThe One My Soul Loves (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05ea \u05e9\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05d9) is a play by Israeli playwright and writer Itai Segal, which premiered at the Habima Theatre on 25 December 2021. It was brought together by Habima and  Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality\u2019s \u201cFuture of the Theater\u201d project.\nThe play was inspired by the Tel Aviv gay centre shooting in a youth bar and also deals with conversion therapy, homophobia and hate crimes. The cast also traveled overseas to perform the play at theatre festivals in Cyprus and Romania. \nThe play includes the actors Amit Rahav, Daniel Litman, Orly Silbersatz Banai, Yadin Gellman and Naya Bienstock.\nSynopsis\nA Modern Orthodox mother, Dvori (Silbersatz Banai) receives a late-night call about her 17-year-old son, Yehonatan (Rahav/Arenson/Mosheiov). He is in a hospital bed in Central Israel, seriously injured from wounds he sustained from the Tel Aviv gay centre shooting at Bar Noar. \nYehonatan is unconscious and his mother does not understand what her presumably heterosexual was doing at Bar Noar. He unwittingly has to come out to his family once he is conscious. His father, Aharon (Sade/Geva) is accepting of his son's sexuality. However, Dvori refuses to accept the truth and convinces Yehonatan to under conversion therapy.\nCast\nAmit Rahav/Avraham Arenson/Ran Mosheiov as Yehonatan\nDaniel Litman/Yadin Gellman as Adam\nYigal Sade/Danny Geva as Aharon\nOrly Silbersatz Banai as Dvori\nNaya Bienstock as Tamar\nUri Hochman/Oded Leopold as Rabbi\nAmos Buaron/Nadav Shama as Policeman\nAmit Zittoun/Michal Brand as Nurse\nOfek Zarko, Dor Galula, Yogev Atias, Yoni Kruvi as ensemble\nBackground\nSegal initially envisaged the project as a short film, focusing on a mother in the hospital waiting room after the Noar Bar attack. Upon meeting the director, Moshe Kepten, Segal realized that the forced revelation of the son's sexuality could develop into an expanded story for the theatre. Segal and Kepten were both troubled by the issue of conversion therapy and decided to use it as part of the story around the bar attack.\nSet designer, Eran Atzmon uses a minimalist stage set that is largely empty and white. There is a hanging box and video clips are projected onto the white floor. There are four chairs on stage. The aim was for the audience to feel more immersed and active in the play and not to feel too relaxed.\nProductions\nThe play premiered at Habima Theatre in December 2021. \nIn October 2022, Habima brought the production to Nicosia Municipal Theatre in Nicosia in Cyprus. The performance was supported by the Embassy of Israel in Cyprus. The play was chosen to open the Nicosia International Festival. The performance and reception were attended by Cypriot Deputy Minister of Culture Mr Yiannis Toumazi and the Israeli Ambassador in Israel, Oren Anolik.\nIn June 2023, Habima brought the play to Romania, where it was part of the Sibiu International Theatre Festival.\nPerformances resumed for a second run at Habima Theatre in December 2023. Litman played the role of Adam throughout. He explained to audiences that Yadin Gellman, whom he shared the part with, was unavailable to attend due to medical reasons. Gellman was recovering from gunshot wounds from the October 7 attacks amid the Be'eri massacre.\nReception\nHaaretz wrote that the play is \"still very relevant, the writing is convincing, the direction is sensitive and above all the acting of Amit Rahav stands out. The humane message of \"You One My Soul Loved\" is conveyed in a detailed and optimistic manner.\"\nMako praised the play as \"rare and very exciting\", adding that the play is \"still essential for many who do not really know the struggle, and do not really remember the bloody wound that is the shooting in Bar Noar\". Mako also praised the direction of Moshe Kepten and casting, particularly the performance of Silbersatz Banai.\n",
    "Species of lichen\nXanthoparmelia beccae is a species of saxicolous and terricolous (rock- and soil-dwelling) foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. Endemic to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean, it has been assessed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature  (IUCN) due to its small population and threats to its habitat.\nTaxonomy\nXanthoparmelia beccae was first described by the Dutch lichenologist Andr\u00e9 Aptroot in 2008 based on specimens collected during a lichen survey of Saint Helena in 2006. The specific epithet beccae honours Rebecca Cairns-Wicks for her assistance in introducing Aptroot to the plants and vegetation of Saint Helena during his field work.\nAptroot noted that X.\u00a0beccae superficially resembles Xanthoparmelia eradicata, which occurs in South Africa, but differs in having a denser branching pattern and being isidiate. The coralline growth form of X.\u00a0beccae is unusual for the genus Xanthoparmelia.\nDescription\nXanthoparmelia beccae has a foliose thallus that appears fruticose, forming dense, nearly hemispherical tufts up to 3\u00a0cm in diameter. The marginal lobes are branched, convex, slightly flattened, and generally about 0.3\u00a0mm wide (up to 0.8\u00a0mm wide). The upper surface is greenish-grey due to the presence of usnic acid, with blackened lobe tips. The lower surface is dark brown to black, especially towards the tips, with numerous simple black rhizines about 0.2\u00a0mm long.\nMost of the thallus is covered with a dense layer of richly branched, cylindrical isidia up to 1.5\u00a0cm long. The isidia are greenish-grey with blackened tips on the upper side and dull brownish on the lower side. No apothecia or conidia have been observed to occur in this species. The medulla does not react with C or K spot tests, but is PD+ (red). It does not fluoresce under UV light. The lichen contains usnic acid and protocetraric acid.\nHabitat and distribution\nXanthoparmelia beccae grows on soil and rocks in dusty areas and boulder fields on Saint Helena. It has been recorded from locations including Rupert's Hill, Bryans Rock, The Barn, and Great Stone Top. In some dusty areas it can be the only lichen species present.\nConservation\nBecause of its restricted distribution, Xanthoparmelia beccae is subject to accidental extinction by trampling, collecting, road development, and local over-grazing. For these reasons, it has been assessed as a vulnerable species on the global Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n",
    "\n2024 studio album by Pylon Reenactment Society\nIf Pylon, Patti Smith Group and the Feelies had a baby, it might be this song. It\u2019s a kinetic tribute to those who teach us how to fix it. Shero Kate Pierson joins me for a duet. I\u2019ve been a fan of the B-52s since I first saw them at the Last Resort. About a year ago at the final date of their last tour in Athens, GA, I had the idea that Kate would be a perfect fit on \u201cFix It\u201d\u2014we had just finished laying down the tracks for our album and were due in the studio the following week to mix it. I got up the nerve to ask her if she would as we were saying goodbye. She said yes and recorded it the next week. Kate\u2019s timing is perfect\u2014her vocal track was delivered five minutes after we had finished mixing the rest of the album. We were \u201cover the moon\u201d when we heard her vocals.\n\u2014Vocalist Vanessa Briscoe Hay on the track \u201cFix It\u201d, guest-starring fellow Athens, Georgia singer Kate Pierson\nMagnet Factory is the debut full-length studio album by American rock band Pylon Reenactment Society. It has received positive reviews from critics and was promoted by live touring by the band and music videos for \"3 x 3\" and \"Fix It\". The album includes two tracks written by Pylon, a band that also included vocalist Vanessa Briscoe Hay, who formed this group in 2014.\nReception\nWriting for the Associated Press, Steven Wine wrote that vocalist Vanessa Briscoe Hay has not mellowed with age and this music \"sounds as fresh as Pylon first did\" and ended \"from start to finish, the band is an irresistible blend of simplicity and synchronicity, the music both edgy and therapeutic\". Lee Valentine Smith of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote that these songs \"deftly recall the kinetic New Wave energy of the original Pylon ethos, tempered by a decidedly pop mindset\". Ryan Dillon of Glide Magazine praised Hay's vocals as \"a welcomed trip down memory lane as she displays her magnificent range of honed arrangements\" in an album that is inconsistent but this quality \"lends to its charm and those stunning peaks it hits have quite the view, from up here you can see her lofty ideas become reality like the perfect sunrise\". At PopMatters, Allison Ross rated this album an 8 out of 10 and also praised the vocals as \"relatable\" and also wrote that the music has \"hearty hooks  magnetic melodies\" with a mix of genres that includes \"jangle pop, garage rock, dance punk, and new wave with equal skill and flair\". Ross' colleague Jedd Beaudoin reviewed \"Heaven (In Your Eyes)\" on the day the album was released, stating that the track \"reminds listeners of Pylon\u2019s forward-thinking sound, its alternate ability to report on the zeitgeist and predict what future generations would embrace\", which \"sounds like it could have emerged in 1978 or 2024 or at a moment in time we have not yet reached\".

    "Lithuanian politician\nAgn\u0117 \u0160irinskien\u0117 (born 9 November 1975) is a Lithuanian politician. She was elected to the Seimas with the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union in 2016. One of the leading members of the party, she was described as \"Ram\u016bnas Karbauskis's hitwoman\". She left the party in 2021 and joined Dawn of Nemunas in 2024.\nBackground\n\u0160irinskien\u0117 was born in Vilnius in 1975 and graduated from school in D\u016bk\u0161tas in 1993. She graduated from Vytautas Magnus University with a master's degree in pastoral theology in 2000. In 2005, she obtained a doctor's degree of humanitarian sciences from Mykolas Romeris University. In 2016, it was revealed that her doctoral thesis claims that \"the spread of AIDS is a reminder that man's presence in the world is not solely determined by forces under his control. In this case, God, who punishes for moral evil and the distortion of the purpose of sexuality with sexually transmitted disease\". \u0160irinskien\u0117 claimed that the quote was taken out of context and she argued against it in her thesis.\nFrom 2004 until 2016, she was Associate Professor at the Institute of Public Law of Mykolas Romeris University. Before 2016, she was also a non-statutory expert for the Seimas Committee on Health.\nPolitical career\n\u0160irinskien\u0117 ran as the Peasant-Green candidate in the Polish-majority \u0160al\u010dininkai constituency in the 2016 Lithuanian parliamentary election and was soundly defeated by Polish Electoral Action candidate Leonard Talmont. However, she entered the Seimas on the party's electoral list.\n\u0160irinskien\u0117 became the chairwoman of the Seimas Committee on Health. Soon after the election, she was criticized by the medical community for her attempt to restrict assisted reproductive technology.\nAfter the party's vice-chairwoman Greta Kildi\u0161ien\u0117 resigned over suspected embezzlement from her workplace on 24 January 2017, \u0160irinskien\u0117 became one of party chairman Ram\u016bnas Karbauskis's key allies in parliament. Described as a \"duo\", they were stated as being responsible for most of the strategic decisions in the party's parliamentary group. Justas D\u017eiugelis described her as \"Karbauskis's hitwoman\", and Povilas Urb\u0161ys described as \"the chief of the Seimas, more powerful than the Speaker, Viktoras Pranckietis\".\n\u0160irinskien\u0117 led several investigatory commissions throughout the Twelfth Seimas of Lithuania, including an investigation into Gabrielius Landsbergis and his wife's  business, potential corruption and influence over state organs. On January 2019, \u0160irinskien\u0117, Art\u016bras Skard\u017eius and Rima Ba\u0161kien\u0117 displayed a shooting range target in the Seimas chamber which they named \"Gabrielius\".\n\u0160irinskien\u0117 was reelected in 2020. In December 2021, she left the party, which was described as surprising by the media due to her close cooperation with Karbauskis. \u0160irinskien\u0117 cited insults, reproaches and bullying by her colleagues, complaints over her presence in the media, including an order to avoid entering the parliamentary chamber through the main entrance to avoid being seen by journalists, and lacking support as reasons for her departure, while remaining deputies in the party claimed that she left due to her own difficult character. However, she did not join the Union of Democrats \"For Lithuania\", founded by former members of the party around the same time. Though she was invited by the party's chairman Saulius Skvernelis, many of the party's members were opposed to her joining. In June 2024, \u0160irinskien\u0117 joined the Dawn of Nemunas, led by Remigijus \u017demaitaitis.\nPersonal life\n\u0160irinskien\u0117 is a Roman Catholic.\n",

    "Romanian novelist, playwright and screenwriter (1932\u20132011)\n\u0218tefan Vasile Neagu, commonly known as F\u0103nu\u0219 Neagu (5 April 1932 \u2013 24 May 2011), was a Romanian novelist, playwright, journalist, and occasional film actor. Born to a peasant family in the B\u0103r\u0103gan Plain, he drew inspiration from that environment throughout his literary career. He undertook his training during the early stages of the communist regime, when he was still a teenager; in his early twenties, he was already pushing the limits of literary discourse, and the patience of ideological censors, acquiring his fame as an irrepressible rebel. Neagu's published debut came in 1959, and coincided with the onset of de-Stalinization. His short stories of the period pushed back against the influence of socialist realism, relying instead of neo-romantic and modernist models, as well as on Neagu's own resources as a raconteur. He became known for a richly metaphorical and oftentimes absurdist prose, which integrated him into the tradition of magic realism, and established his reputation as a unique voice in Romanian literature. The subtleties of this style also allowed Neagu to drop hints about communist crimes against the peasants in his debut novel, \u00cengerul a strigat, which appeared, to critical acclaim, in 1968.\nAn unrelenting bohemian and lifelong drinker, Neagu had an on-and-off career in the press\u2014in the 1960s, he was mainly an editor at Luceaf\u0103rul, whereby he encouraged younger authors; with time, he specialized in covering Romanian football, with columns that were admired for their skill and greatly loved by the reading public. He condensed these experiences in the 1976 Frumo\u0219ii nebuni ai marilor ora\u0219e, which is a multilayered novel and a best-seller of its day. At that stage, Neagu had also involved himself with Romanian cinema\u2014as a screenwriter, he went from being derided for his superficial comedies to being praised for dramas based on his own novellas and novels. As a literary celebrity, he had a complex relationship with Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, who had emerged as communist leader in 1965: though welcoming Ceau\u0219escu's national-communist ideology (both in replicating some of its assumptions, including the revival of nationalism, and in not resisting its July Theses), he was resentful of the entire Ceau\u0219escu family, and continued to speak his mind about some of the regime's excesses. He was kept under watch by the Securitate secret police, but also enjoyed protection\u2014as a Dinamo-supporting journalist, he endeared himself to the overarching Ministry of Internal Affairs.\nThe revolution of December 1989 witnessed a critical reevaluation of Neagu's contribution, raising issues about the diminishing quality of his prose, now perceived as incoherent, repetitive, or \"kitsch\". He was additionally targeted for his politics, in particular after joining a left-wing nationalist and anti-capitalist caucus that supported Ion Iliescu's post-revolutionary administration. After being active within the Democratic Agrarian Party, Neagu became a committed supporter (and alleged client) of Iliescu's Social Democrats. In the 1990s and early 2000s, he generated controversy as manager of the National Theater Bucharest, as well as editor in chief of several publications, including Cronica Rom\u00e2n\u0103 and Literatorul. His answers to criticism became increasingly violent; though made a full member of the Romanian Academy in 2001, he was further isolated when he also came to reject Iliescu's policies. Incapacitated and hospitalized during the final years of his life, Neagu chronicled his declining health, and his indifference to dying, in a set of diaries, the final one of which was published posthumously.\nBiography\nEarly life\n\u0218tefan Neagu was born on 5 April 1932 at Gr\u0103di\u0219tea, Br\u0103ila County, in what was then the Kingdom of Romania. His was a peasant family, and he remained attached spiritually to both that social class and the geographical contours of the B\u0103r\u0103gan. As he himself put it in a 1987 interview: \"The people, the water, the grassland of that spot are what's dearest to me in the world.\" His parents Vasile and Paraschiva (n\u00e9e Miroslav) knew him under the pet name \"F\u0103nu\u0219\", which became his favorite signature, as well as a mononym in the literary community: \"few people know that his other name was Neagu.\" The future writer had a brother and a sister; only the latter was still alive at F\u0103nu\u0219's death in 2011. In old age, Neagu liked to tell highly exaggerated stories of his childhood poverty, to see if those present would believe them\u2014for instance, he circulated the claim that his feet had been bound, so that his parents would not have to spend money on shoes. In other contexts, he described his childhood as \"fabulous\" and rich in life lessons. His childhood friends, many of whom appear in his work under their nicknames, included both Romanians and Romanies, as he reportedly \"made no difference\". Aged eleven, he traveled to the local port city, Br\u0103ila, for which he preserved an \"",

The incident of Lai's kidnapping-turned-murder brought shock to the whole of Malaysia when it first came to light.\nIn 2011, the mastermind Teh Kim Hong (\u90d1\u9526\u6d2a Zh\u00e8ng J\u01d0nh\u00f3ng) was sentenced to death while two of Teh's co-defendants Leong Soon Long (\u6881\u987a\u9f99 Li\u00e1ng Sh\u00f9nl\u00f3ng) and Wong Soon Heng (\u9ec4\u987a\u5174 Hu\u00e1ng Sh\u00f9nx\u012bng), who were underaged at the time of the murder, were spared the gallows and detained indefinitely, and a fourth accused Wong Kah Wai (\u9ec4\u5bb6\u4f1f Hu\u00e1ng Ji\u0101w\u011bi), who was also underaged, was acquitted without his defence being called.\n13 years later, after Malaysia abolished the mandatory death penalty and enabled murderers to face either death by hanging or a long prison sentence of 30 to 40 years instead, Teh filed an appeal to reduce his sentence, and in spite of the request of prosecutors and Lai's family for the death penalty, the  Federal Court commuted Teh's death sentence to 40 years' imprisonment and 17 strokes of the cane in May 2024.\nBackground of Lai Ying Xin\nBorn on 16 April 1992, Lai Ying Xin was the third of four children to Lai Then Song (\u8d56\u6dfb\u9001 L\u00e0i Ti\u0101ns\u00f2ng) and Chia Siew Peh (\u8c22\u79c0\u840d Xi\u00e8 Xi\u00f9p\u00edng), and had two older sisters and one younger brother, and she grew up in Kulai, located in the Malaysian state of Johor. Lai enrolled into SMK Sultan Ibrahim, a notable secondary school in Kulai, to pursue her secondary school studies. Due to her natural beauty and kind-natured personality, Lai was the most popular schoolgirl in her school and well-liked by her friends, teachers and schoolmates alike.\nAside from being active in her school's extra-curricular activities, Lai was also an academically inclined student; she had once attained seven As and one B for her Penilaian Menengah Rendah (PMR) examinations, a national examination for third-year secondary school students in Malaysia (up until its abolition in 2014), and she had plans to further her studies in Taiwan after graduation and to become an air stewardess upon reaching adulthood. To make ends meet, Lai worked part-time as a salesgirl at a local shopping centre in Kulai.\nDisappearance and murder\nOn the night of 11 September 2008, 16-year-old Lai Ying Xin was last seen leaving a shopping mall in Kulai, where she worked part time as a salesgirl.\nLai did not return home that night, and during the next morning, on 12 September 2008, Lai's family received a phone call from an unknown caller. The caller claimed that he had kidnapped Lai, and he demanded a ransom of RM60,000 from Lai's family in exchange for Lai's freedom. Lai's family contacted the police and a special team of investigators was set up to monitor the situation while tracing the identities and whereabouts of Lai's abductor(s). Meanwhile, Lai's family tried to raise some money but within a day, they only managed to gather a total of RM33,000, and handed the money over to the kidnappers.\nThe police also did not give up tracing the identities of the kidnappers, and finally, on the evening of 15 September 2008, the police arrested seven male youths, but in the end, three of them were released after some questioning while the final four suspects were officially held in custody for their suspected involvement in the abduction of Lai, who was discovered to be dead. The suspects, who all admitted to their involvement, led the police to a forest near Taman Puteri Kulai, where the officers found the burnt body of 16-year-old Lai Ying Xin.\nAn autopsy report was later conducted by Dr Mohammed Aznool Haidy, and he certified that Lai had been strangled to death by her killers before her body was burnt, likely to destroy evidence. DNA tests were also conducted on the corpse, and the results confirmed that the charred remains discovered in Kulai belonged to Lai. After the autopsy, Lai's corpse was released to the family for funeral proceedings. Khoo Ting Loo, Lai's boyfriend, and many of her classmates and teachers attended her funeral, and many were saddened and mourned for Lai, whom they remembered as a good-natured girl popular in school for her looks and inner heart, as well as a filial and obedient daughter.\nUpdates of the investigative process revealed that all the four alleged kidnappers were known to the victim, as they had gone to or used to attend the same school as Lai. According to Lai's mother Chia Siew Peh, her daughter had reportedly rejected the confes",

    "Landslide that struck a remote Indonesian gold mine\nThe 2024 Sulawesi landslide was a mass casualty event that occurred at an unauthorized gold mine in the Bone Bolango regency located in Gorontalo province on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, on 6 July 2024. The disaster occurred as a result of heavy rainfall causing a landslide that struck over 100 villagers digging for gold at the site of the gold mine, killing at least twelve people and leaving about 48 more missing.\nBackground\nUnauthorized mining operations frequently take place in Indonesia, exposing many workers to environmental hazards such as floods, landslides, and tunnel collapses, as well as toxic exposure to mercury and cyanide during gold ore processing frequently with minimal to no protection. Several disasters involving mining in Indonesia have occurred, including a landslide in April 2022 at Mandailing Natal in North Sumatra, killing 12 women working at an illegal gold mining operation. Another disaster took place in February 2019 at a North Sulawesi illegal gold mine, where several mining holes caused a wooden structure to collapse, burying and killing over 40 people.\nStarting on 6 July, torrential rains struck several regions of Indonesia including Bone Bolango, which caused an embankment to break, resulting in floods reaching as high as 3 meters (10 feet) deep in five villages, impacting nearly 300 houses, and forcing over 1,000 people to evacuate.\nDisaster\nOn 6 June, several tons of mud and debris slid down several hills surrounding the gold mine before crashing into an unauthorized mining camp of over 100 villagers, burying their makeshift settlements as well as several houses of residents living near the gold mine. At least twelve people were killed in the landslide and had to be pulled out of the mud, including a four-year-old child and three women. 44 people were able to escape the landslide, while six more people were pulled out with injuries. Roughly 48 people were reported missing following the initial landslide.\nRescue\n164 personnel were dispatched to the site of the disaster for rescue and recovery. Rescue operations were complicated by heavy rainfall and other landslides blocking roads necessary to get to the site of the disaster, forcing personnel to walk over 20 kilometers (12.43 miles) to reach the encampment. Torrential rainfall forced rescue personnel to temporarily cease operations on the evening of 8 July.\nBy 9 July, rescuers were able to recover 23 bodies and rescue 23 more living villagers, including 18 who were injured, leaving 35 more people missing. Detection dogs were brought to the site to aid in recovery, while video taken from Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency showed rescuers using farm tools and their bare hands to dig out deceased villagers from the rubble.\nSee also\nIndonesia portalGeology portalWeather portal\n2024 Sumatra flash floods\n2023 Serasan landslide\n2014 Banjarnegara landslide\n",

    "Spanish artist and businesswoman\nManuela Saborido Mu\u00f1oz (born 1 October 1943), better known by her stage name Manolita Chen, is a Spanish artist and businesswoman. She is recognized as being one of the first trans women to have her change of name and sex approved on her national identity document (DNI) in the late 1970s, for being granted the right to adopt in 1985, and for being a key figure in the LGBT community in Spain.\nEarly life and career\nSaborido was born in Arcos de la Frontera, C\u00e1diz on 1 October 1943. Her father died of alcoholism when she was young, and her mother was left to take care of her eleven siblings. From childhood she identified as female, and her family and part of her community rejected her for her gender identity. At the age of six she worked cleaning houses in exchange for food, and at eleven as an apprentice shoemaker.\nFor a time, Saborido took over the family business, the Mar\u00eda la Viuda tavern, which prospered until the mayor abruptly decided to close it. This caused her to move to Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa in the early 1960s, where she worked as a bricklayer, cleaner, kitchen assistant, and newspaper delivery girl. The poverty and mistreatment that Saborido suffered during her childhood and youth took her to Paris, where she became a vedette at just 16 years old. She was then assigned to C\u00f3rdoba to fulfill the Francoist mandatory military service requirement, but due to mistreatment by her companions and because she did not pass the physical entrance tests, she was assigned to Jerez as a cook.\nSaborido married twice, the first time at age 20 by \"transsexual rite\", and the second time in 1966, a marriage that lasted 28 years. In 1969, she had an operation in Casablanca, then settled in Barcelona and began her artistic career as a copla singer. She was hired by Paco Espa\u00f1a\u00a0, and began to act in several Spanish theaters. Outside Spain, she performed in Paris, Rome, Berlin, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. She belonged to the companies of Juanito Navarro, and also acted with Lola Flores and Juanito Valderrama. She eventually created her own company called Manolita Chen. Despite her popularity, the Vagrants and Criminals Law\u00a0 was applied to her three times.\nDuring the Spanish transition to democracy, she became an activist for LGBT rights and participated in the first demonstrations that were held in the country to support this cause, visiting the Pasaje Bego\u00f1a\u00a0 in Torremolinos on several occasions. In the late 1970s, Saborido became the first person in Spain to have her female identity appear on her DNI, changing her name to Manuela Saborido Mu\u00f1oz. She later recalled,\nFreedom was approaching, and we began to loudly demand that some of the rights we have today be recognised. For example, that our real identity be shown on our ID cards. And that we should be able to get married. I went to many of those first demonstrations. We ended up with the Guard on our backs. People booed us and even threw stones at us. But I have always been a fighter. I wanted Manuel Saborido to stop appearing on my ID card. I was fed up with hotel receptionists looking at me with sarcasm. So, shortly before the law that allowed it was passed, I pulled some strings in the government. Because I knew several queers in high places \u2013 homosexuals and gentlemen from head to toe. And that is why, before the 80s, I managed to obtain the first Spanish ID card that recognised that someone who had been born a man could be legally treated as a woman.\nIn the early 1980s, she abandoned her artistic career to become a businesswoman in the Arcos hospitality industry, opening the cabarets El Camborio, El Rinc\u00f3n Andaluz, La Cuadra, and the restaurant Los Tres Caminos.\nIn March 1985, Saborido became the country's first transgender adoptive mother, of her first daughter Mar\u00eda, who had Down syndrome. She then adopted sons Alfonso and Jos\u00e9, both with cerebral palsy. She was also the first openly transgender woman interviewed on Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, on Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1igo's show in the 1980s. Shortly afterward, she divorced and went through a period of depression that almost led her to ruin, so she had to close her businesses.\nSaborido was convicted of a crime related to her ex-husband and drug trafficking that led to her imprisonment in 2004, although she later declared that she had been convinced to accept a plea agreement despite not being guilty. She was detained for nine months in the Puerto II prison in C\u00e1diz, during which time Saborido became the head of the prison's library and dedicated herself to caring for sick and struggling inmates.\nDuring her life, she collected Elizabethan-style decorative pieces and antiques for her home, and in August 2013 she turned it into a museum, with money received from ticket sales being dedicated to social assistance for the people of her hometown.\nIn 2021, she founded the Manuela Saborido Foundation: Manolita Chen, Arcos de la Frontera.

    "American rancher, oilman, and politician (1862\u20131929)\nLee Bivins (October 12, 1862 \u2013 January 17, 1929) was an American rancher, oilman, and politician. At the time of his death, he was purported to be the largest individual cattle owner in the world, and his fortunate was estimated to be $20\u00a0million (equivalent to $279\u00a0million in 2023). Bivins was brought to the petroleum industry in his later years with the discovery of large amounts of gas and oil on much of his property.\nBivins was born in a small Grayson County settlement, the son of a rancher, merchant, and mill operator. By age 20, he had amassed a sizable herd of dogies and had established two general stores. Bivins interest in cattle led him to the Texas panhandle in the early 1880s, where he was elected county commissioner. A much-publicized feud in the 1890s involving a local father and son lead to the death of Bivins\u2019 brother, which prompted him to attack his brother\u2019s killer. Although Bivins was charged with attempted murder, he was acquitted the following year.\nThe early 1900s saw numerous purchases of large ranch properties in the panhandle made by Bivins, which eventually made up his approximately 500,000 acres of property. It was said that he cornered the Texas steer beef market by 1918. A 1918 discovery of natural gas on his Potter County land proved to be part of the largest field in the world. Bivins died on January 17, 1929 while serving his second term as the 11th mayor of Amarillo.\nEarly life (1862\u20131882)\nLee Bivins was born on October 7, 1862 in Farmington, Texas, the son of Oliver Cromwell Bivins (1835\u20131907) and Elizabeth Jane Bivins (n\u00e9e Miller; 1842\u20131925). He had two younger sisters: Elizabeth Alice and Cora Bell; and three younger brothers: Emory Hood, Richard Henry, and Albert William. His father, a native of Indiana who moved to Texas in 1849, ranched, ran a mercantile store, and operated the county's first mill. His mother was a native of Tennessee. Bivins received his education in Grayson County public schools. He entered his career as a cattleman at age 16 on his father\u2019s ranch. On August 18, 1882, Bivins married Mary Elizabeth Gilbert.\nCareer (1882\u20131929)\nBy 1889, Bivins had established a makeshift shack in Claude, Texas, where he lived alone; his family joined him after he expanded business. He opened a grocery store, a wheat mill, an elevator, and purchased from the Ja Ranch (Later the Mulberry Ranch) seven miles south of town. In 1890, he was elected county commissioner from his precinct.\nIn the 1890s, a much-publicized local feud occurred between Bivins, saloons-keeper \u201cSkid\u201d Ellis, and Ellis\u2019 son Ed Ellis, when Ed had embezzled money entrusted to him by Bivins. The situation only worsened when Bivins\u2019 brother Richard began courting Skid\u2019s niece, prompting him to shoot and kill Dick. Bivins attempted to settle the feud when he found himself on the same train as Ellis, although he managed only to wound him. Bivins, who was initially charged with attempted murder, was acquitted the next year. Ellis was tried for the murder of Richard Bivins, but was acquitted, eventually leaving the panhandle.\nBivins opened a livery stable in Amarillo in 1900. During his first years of business in Amarillo, he leased several hundred acres of land for his growing herd. His first big purchase was the Cross Bar Ranch, located on the south bank of the Canadian River. A dispute began when it became apparent both Bivins and rancher R. Ben Masterson both wished to purchase more than 100,000 acres of grassland from the British owners of the LX Ranch. According to a family story, Bivins and Masterson agreed on a coin toss which would give the winner a choice of purchasing land from the north or south side of the Canadian River. Masterson won the toss, choosing the north side. Bivins\u2019 purchase of land included the LX Ranch headquarters, built by Henry C. Harding in 1902. Before long, he had purchased the right to use the LX Brand which, along with the purchase of land, totaled $79,000.\nIn 1915, the Bivins Building, built on the site of the old opera house, which Bivins had owned stock in, was destroyed by a fire. on May 19 of that year, he purchased the 53,329 acres from the American Pastoral Company for about $203,000. Another 50,000 acres of LIT land was added to his holdings with Berkeley Dawson in 1918. He purchased the Coldwater Ranch, which made up part of XIT properties, and extensive holdings near Fort Sumner, New Mexico. It is believed he cornered the Texas steer beef market in 1918\u20131919, and had been the largest individual owner of cattle by the 1920s. He contributed to the establishment of Amarillo\u2019s first airport, the Panhandle Aerial Service and Transportation Company, and served as it\u2019s first president.\nBivins served eight years as an Amarillo City Commissioner before being elected as the 11th mayor of Amarillo in April 1925. He was re-elected in 1927. In January 1927, he became ill from indigestion en route home from a visit with his sis",

Her father's expertise was with devices like juke boxes and slot machines and he had a number of businesses. Hardy learned to love making things in his workshop and every vacation she was employed in one of her father's businesses. She went to school in the village of Liphook where she had a blow to her confidence when she failed her 11+ examination. Her parents enrolled her at Bedales School. She was not a natural academic, but she took a strong interest in the life of the school. She left after her first year in the sixth form because she was keen to learn more.\nHardy initially trained as a goldsmith at Sir John Cass College before she worked grading rough diamonds for the De Beers company. She worked in a number of countries including Israel, Belgium and the USA. The diamonds were then all cut by hand and she could look at a gem and tell where it had been cut by the angles of the cuts.\nShe went through a rigorous process to appreciate the authenticity and value of a pink diamond gem that was finally auctioned by Phillips and sold at $6 million in 1995.\nShe joined the BBC's television's Antiques Roadshow in 2007 when she was working for the auctioneers Sotheby's.\nIn 2014 she was cautioning collectors as it was observed that coloured gemstones were the fashion rather than diamonds. Some of the value and interest was due to fashion, but Hardy noted that the gems were rare and that was the underlying reason why they achieved high prices. However many gems were heatreated to give an unoriginal colour.\nHardy was a member of the board of the Gemmological Association of Great Britain in 2024.\nPublications\nHardy, Joanna (15 May 2012).

    "Species of beetle\nCaccothryptus championi is a species of minute marsh-loving beetle in the subfamily Limnichinae. The species was described alongside five other Caccothryptus species by Natural History Museum entomologist Keita Matsumoto in 2021, using specimens gathered in 1953 by Harry George Champion in Haldwani, India alongside an earlier 1925 specimen collected nearby. Like the other Caccothryptus species described by Matsumoto, it was distinguished from its original classification of C. ripicola due to differences in the shape of its genitalia. Twenty-seven specimens from the British Natural History Museum collection were identified with C. championi, named after Champion.\nTaxonomy\nThe Limnichidae (minute marsh-loving beetle) genus Caccothryptus was first described by David Sharp in 1902. In 2014, the genus was divided into five species groups by Carles Hernando and Ignacio Ribera.\nA group of Caccothryptus specimens were collected in 1953 by forester Harry George Champion in the Haldwani division of the Kumaon Himalayas, India. These were labeled as C. ripicola, which Champion had previously described in 1923. These were stored at the British Natural History Museum. In 2021, Natural History Museum entomologist Keita Matsumoto identified a number of distinct species from these specimens. One male specimen was labeled as the holotype of Caccothryptus championi. Twenty-six other specimens, including an earlier individual collected in 1925, were labeled as paratypes. C. championi was placed in the species group C. testudo and named for Champion.\nDescription\nThe Caccothryptus championi specimens identified have an elytral length of 2.35\u20132.74mm, and elytral widths of 0.87\u20131.04\u00a0mm. Their prothoraces measured 1.97\u20132.16\u00a0mm in length and 3.01\u20133.33\u00a0mm in width. C. championi's body is dark brown spare for reddish-brown tibia and patches of long setae, yellow along the underside and white on the dorsum. Its tarsi are divided into five segments, of increasing length, with the fifth segment as long as the others combined. It has long, narrow, light brown tarsal claws. The beetle's head, smooth and punctured, is slightly retracted into its pronotum, and features eleven-segment antennae. Little sexual dimorphism exists between the male and female specimens, beyond a longer fifth abdominal ventrite on the female.\nThe beetle's genitals display a number of differences from the original classification of C. ripicola, which enabled its classification as a separate species. C. championi's has ovoid apexs on its median lobe. Their parameres narrow from a top-down view, with v-shaped notches along their bottom and a slight bump on their side near the apex. Between the parameres is a deep, narrow depression forming a pointed V-shape. Females have long ovipositors.\n",
    "Bruneian historian (1936\u20132018)\nIn this Malay name, there is no surname or family name.  The name Pengiran Metali is a patronymic, and the person should be referred to by their given name, Pengiran Shariffuddin. The word \"bin\" or \"binti\"/\"binte\" means 'son of' or 'daughter of', respectively.\nPengiran Shariffuddin bin Pengiran Metali (19 October 1936 \u2013 22 April 2018), pen name P. M. Shariffuddin, was a historian and monographer from Brunei who previously served as the first director of the Brunei Museum from 1974 to 1982. Due to his understanding of the genealogical history of the Sultans of Brunei and profound comprehension of Brunei's sociocultural history, Pengiran Shariffuddin was a highly sought-after authority on Bruneian history and a valuable resource of information on the sultanate's early history.\nEarly life and education\nOn 19 October 1936,  Awangku Sharifuddin bin Pengiran Metali was born in Tutong District, which at the time was the third-largest district in Brunei but was still a remote region. He was brought up in pre-World War II Brunei and experienced a lot of hard yet fascinating realities. His early life was not nice because he came from a poor family and lived in a modest place. He once remembered that in order to get to the local school at Tutong, he had to walk a considerable distance through forests and under the intense tropical sun.\nNevertheless, Pengiran Shariffuddin have been inspired by his uncle Pengiran Yusuf, who, like his nephew, was a distinguished official and life member of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (MBRAS) who eventually became Brunei's Menteri Besar. Through his example, he was early convinced that a solid education was essential to achieving greater things. In light of this, he applied to and was accepted into Brunei Town's Government English School, where he completed his secondary education from 1951 to 1957.\nCareer\nFollowing his secondary education, Pengiran Shariffuddin was dispatched by the government of Brunei in April 1957 to work as an apprentice at the Sarawak Museum in Kuching. Under the supervision of Tom Harrisson, who was leading the Niah Caves excavations, Pengiran Shariffuddin gained valuable knowledge about museum operations in Kuching, sparking his interest in Brunei's history and enhancing his research skills. This experience prepared him for his future role as the first director of Brunei Museum, after which he enrolled in the Museums Association of the United Kingdom's certificate program in public management and anthropology.\nPengiran Shariffuddin advanced to the position of assistant keeper in 1959, and was appointed museum officer in 1964. He has been a part of MBRAS since 1964. He was named a Vice President in 1972 and a Member of the Council in 1965. He were named acting curator on 1 May 1965, and on 1 March 1966, they were put on probation as a curator. He held the position of museum curator from 1 January 1968 to 31 December 1973; this position was subsequently renamed director museum. He then served as museum director from 1 January 1974 until 31 December 1982. He became a life member of MBRAS in 1982 after becoming a regular member in 1981.\nNot only did Harrisson's guidance and exposure to archaeological work excite Pengiran Shariffuddin's interest in the then-largely uncharted historical territory of his own nation, Brunei, but Harrisson also improved his own historical research abilities. When Queen Elizabeth II visited Brunei in 1972, he was appointed as the inaugural director and curator of the country's oldest museum based on his expertise and training. He did, in fact, have a major role in the conception and building of the museum, which carried his signature.\nNot long after leaving the civil service, Pengiran Shariffuddin became a well-liked local businessman with a wide range of ventures. His commercial ventures, which started in the 1980s, rapidly escalated subsequent to his retirement. He was in charge of several businesses under the PDS name, which he successfully created and expanded, which included PDS Abattoir, PDS Meat Industries, and the PDS International School. Pengiran Shariffuddin was a longtime member of MBRAS, but it wasn't until 1981 that he was granted a Life Membership. In that same year, his uncle Pengiran Yusuf, also received the same honour. As Vice-President, Pengiran Shariffuddin was regarded as an esteemed and knowledgeable individual who freely shared his opinions, particularly those pertaining to the overall betterment of MBRAS.\nEarly in 1981, Pengiran Shariffuddin forwarded a letter to MBRAS President Nik Ahmad Kamil inviting the council members to a meeting to be held in Brunei on behalf of the Bruneian government. The invitation was accepted, and on Wednesday, 27 May, eleven members of the council touched down in Bandar Seri Begawan via Royal Brunei Airlines. Pengiran Shariffuddin organised a special ceremony in the large Brunei Museum entrance hall, where retired Sultan Omar Ali Saif",
    "1895 Konkani play by Pai Tiatrist\nThe Belle of Cavel vo Sundor Cheddum Cavelchem is a two-act Konkani play written and directed by Jo\u00e3o Agostinho Fernandes in his debut as a playwright. It is a musical comedy that explores themes of romantic comedy. It was first composed in 1893 and later debuted on stage in 1895. Between the years 1909 and 1943, this theatrical work had no less than ten more showings, solidifying its place as one of Fernandes's most acclaimed productions. The play was known by different titles such as Charni Road Bagh and Eoc Goencar B.A. Exam Passar until 1927 when it was rebranded with its present title in 1932.\nCharacters\nDeodita is the belle of Cavel, an educated young woman and the female protagonist.\nAmaral, a law student, is the Belle's love interest and the male protagonist.\nHellen is depicted as the traditional-minded companion of the Belle.\nGregory is the Belle's elderly father who opposes his daughter's decision to marry her lover.\nProfessor Dom Berthold Mustard is the mad professor known for his witty remarks and disputes. He later marries Esperans.\nBhojjawalla is the man who argues with Berthold.\nJo\u00e3o is a passerby and an acquaintance of Amaral.\nEsperans is the village woman who appears in the subplot and is part of a love triangle.\nSilvester is a sailor who wants to marry Esperans and appears in the subplot.\nMarcelin is the love interest of Esperans and appears in the subplot.\nAlex is the father of Amaral, who later has a fight with Gregory.\nBaltazar is the lawyer who defends Amaral during his trial.\nGunderiwalla is the second witness during Amaral's trial.\nPlot\nThe neighborhood of Charni Road in 2009, where the original play is set.\nAct I\nAmaral, a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) graduate, is focused on his Bachelor of Laws (L.L.B.) exam preparations when he encounters Jo\u00e3o. Their discussions range from politics to current affairs. Meanwhile, Deodita, renowned as the Belle of Cavel, is strolling with her companion Hellen in the distance. Amaral and Deodita share a moment of mutual attraction, leading to the blossoming of love at first sight. The storyline involves Berthold's conflict with Bhojjawalla, along with other events. Amaral is the recipient of a correspondence from the Belle. Their interaction is characterized by intense emotions and romantic discussions. Jo\u00e3o and Hellen are influenced by their romantic gestures. Amaral signals his desire to wed the Belle by presenting an engagement ring as a symbol of their betrothal. Concurrently, Esperans rejects romantic overtures from Silvester. Berthold contributes witty and insightful remarks to the unfolding events.\nAmaral engages Berthold to act as an intermediary for delivering a message of affection to the Belle. Inquisitive about the content of the letter, the Belle's father, Gregory, disguises himself as her grandfather and promises to pass the letter to Deodita upon her return. The peculiar professor entrusts Berthold with the letter and is compensated. After discovering the letter's contents, the furious old man expels the Belle from the residence due to her defiance and disrespect. Berthold feigns sympathy towards Gregory in a mocking manner. Deodita and Amaral convene in the garden, during which Amaral voices his apprehensions regarding the upcoming L.L.B. examination. Deodita offers words of encouragement and support to Amaral during this challenging time. Meanwhile, Marcelin has a rendezvous with Esperans, and Berthold entertains with his witty jokes.\nAct II\nAlex and Gregory, two fathers, engage in a confrontation, resulting in a physical scuffle over the topic of Amaral and Deodita's engagement. The dispute intensifies from verbal disagreements to a physical altercation. Berthold adds his witty remarks to the situation, injecting humor into the tense encounter. Marcelin finds himself in Silvester's control, with both vying for Esperans's hand in marriage. Berthold intervenes, resolving their conflict by brandishing a revolver. He successfully resolves the situation, leading Esperans away in triumph.\nAmaral's apprehension regarding abduction charges is alleviated by the Belle assuming complete responsibility. Their exchange is interrupted by Gregory's arrival with law enforcement to arrest Amaral, and they are then escorted to the police station. In the legal proceedings involving Amaral accused of abducting the Belle of Cavel, the police inspector puts forth a forceful argument. Baltazar provides a competent defense. Berthold's courtroom jests and testimony are notable, with Gunderiwalla appearing as the second witness. The Judge's final remarks contribute to Amaral's ultimate exoneration.\nThemes\nThe play examines the growth of enduring friendships among educated young individuals, disregarding the approval of parents or societal barriers. This theme is subtly introduced in the initial choral passage, as the main characters Deodita and Amaral sing: \"Zaite zananim utor dilam angasori Pai maiche khoxi bhairi\" (transl.\u2009Many",

On May 8, 2014, the ministry officially created the \"Luhansk-1\" battalion from volunteer soldiers to fight in the raging War in Donbas.\nWhen the battalion first created, around 80% were residents of Luhansk Oblast. On August 10, another 200 volunteers were added to the battalion.\nAccording to the commander Artem Vitko, the battalion had only light arms in the early months, and only had basic equipment such as pistols, submachine guns, and light machine guns. In September, the battalion's equipment improved, adding weapons such as the RPG-7, AGS-17, and even BRDM-2 armored vehicles. \nWar in Donbas\nOn August 1, 2014, the battalion engaged in battle against pro-Russian militants in Severodonetsk, killing 15 of them. Later on August 27, \"Luhansk-1\" was part of a military operation to clear areas in Slovianoserbsk Raion, killing in total an estimate of 40 enemy soldiers.\nOn September 4, public activists donated an armored vehicle to the battalion to support their operations.\nOn September 8, the battalion captured enemy positions near the city of Pervomaisk.\nOn October 31, the battalion announced the search for Mykhailo Porechenkov because of his efforts in helping pro-Russian forces in Ukraine.\nOn May 20, 2020, Colonel Serhii Gubanov, the commander the battalion, received shrapnel wounds due to enemy shelling. He died while on the way to a hospital, near the village of Trokhizbenka.\nIn September 2020, the personnel of the battalion was called up due to fires from enemy shelling in Luhansk Oblast.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nOn February 24, 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. The city of Shchastia, where the battalion was stationed in, immediately came under attack. However, their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and the city was soon occupied.\nThe battalion then moved to near the city of Severodonetsk to continue fighting. They also fought in nearby Kreminna and Rubizhne, before both also fell into Russian control.\nFollowing eventual Ukrainian defeats at the battles at Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, the battalion was again redeployed, this time to help Ukrainian forces in the Battle of Bakhmut. \nBy September 2022, the battalion helped carry out the hugely successful Kharkiv counteroffensive, capturing villages including Balakliya, Verbivka, Novoselivka, and Stelmakhivka.\nIn March 2023, the Luhansk-1 Battalion became part of the Liut Brigade. Then in October, the battalion was expanded into a regiment, gaining the current name Luhansk Assault Regiment.\nOn December 28, 2023, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the work of the Liut Brigade, which the regiment is a part of. He specifically praised lieutenant Ivan Krotov and captain Mykhailo Glavatskyi for their battlefield bravery.\nIn the spring of 2024, the regiment were part of the Ukrainian forces defending the city of Chasiv Yar against Russian assaults.\n",

    "Pre-Islamic Arabian poet\nAl-\u1e24u\u1e6day\u02beah (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0637\u064a\u0626\u0629) full name Jarwal ibn 'Aws al-Absi, was an Arab poet of pre-Islamic Arabia, who later converted to Islam. He was known for his extravagant satire and contributions to Arabic poetry. Aside from satire, Al-Hutay'ah also wrote poems with romance, praise, pride and freedom as themes; all of which have been published in the modern era.\nBiography\nLineage\nHis full name is Jarwal ibn 'Aws ibn Malik ibn Makhzum al-Absi. The lineage of Al-Hutay'ah is traced from there to the tribe of Qays which is descendants from the Arabian patriarch Adnan.\nPre-Islamic life\nAl-Hutay'ah was a pioneer of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry and was known for being extreme in making fun of others in his poetry to the point where some of his contemporaries disliked him for that. The Abbasid historian and poet Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani narrated in his Kitab al-Aghani that Al-Hutay'ah was a very eloquent poet with a bad reputation and was regarded to be evil and shameless by his pre-Islamic contemporaries.\nAfter Islam\nAl-Hutay'ah reportedly converted to Islam in the 7th century but later apostatized and then returned to Islam after the Ridda Wars for the rest of his life. There is a fable that he had an argument with a Sahaba, al-Zubayr ibn Badr, and the Sahaba sent him to prison under orders of the Rashidun caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab. He was later released on a promise that he would maintain his good conduct and not make fun of other Muslims. The date of death of Al-Hutay'ah is unknown with a few historians speculating he died in circa the 670s.\nPoetry\nSatire\nSatirical poetry directed towards others was a speciality of Al-Hutay'ah. He would even make fun of himself. One such example was where he narrated about his reflection in the water.\nToday I see a face for myself, for Allah has created it. What an ugly face, and how ugly is the one bearing it!\nHe also made fun of his father:\nYou are a good sheikh; you are a disgrace. You are a bad old man in the eyes of the noble ones. You accumulate hostility, may Allah not protect you from the doors of foolishness and misguidance!\nNarrative poetry\nAl-Hutay'ah composed poems in narrative poetry format. An example of this is his poem about generousity.\nThree-folded abdominal bandages, in a wilderness where no one knows its inhabitants. My brother is lonely and isolated from friends, he sees misery in her from his ferocity, Na'ma. And he singled out an old man in the crowd opposite her, three kindred spirits you'd think they had. Barefoot and naked, they did not eat bread of the millet, for they have not known the taste of righteousness since they were created.\nThemes\nAside from satire, Al-Hutay'ah wrote poems with themes that were romantic, praiseful or relating to freedom and joy.\nPublished works\nA collection of the poems of Al-Hutay'ah, known as the Diwan al-Hutay'ah, have been published in modern age. The 9th-century philologist, Yaqub Ibn as-Sikkit, wrote an annotated version of the Diwan and added a commentary to explain the meaning of the poems and the literary devices that were used in them.\nSee also\nList of Arabic-language poets\n",
    "\nPort in United Kingdom\nThe Ramsgate Hoverport or Ramsgate International Hoverport was the world's first purpose-built hoverport constructed on the coast at the village of Cliffsend, around 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) from Ramsgate, with direct access to Pegwell Bay. The hoverport was purpose built in 1969 by hovercraft operator Hoverlloyd to serve the English Channel crossing market using SR.N4 hovercraft. It operated passenger services until 1982 following a merger with rival Seaspeed to form the combined Hoverspeed, and operated exclusively from Seaspeed's Dover hoverport. The site remained in use for administration and engineering until December 1987.\nConstruction\nThe Hoverlloyd company was formed in 1965 to take advantage of the new form of transport of hovercraft, with the intention of starting a cross-channel service to compete against the ferry services. The company initially started operating smaller SR.N6 craft from a pad within Ramsgate Harbour whilst looking for a longer term base for larger craft. Having discounted other options along the Kent coast, they settled on Pegwell Bay, which was sheltered from weather conditions by the Goodwin Sands.\nThe building of the hoverport was controversial, with objections from a range of interest parties including local residents, bird watchers, those wishing to conserve the coastline, and yacht operators. The Kent Trust for Nature Conservation raised money to purchase 100 acres of land in order to block the construction. Multiple rounds of public inquiry were held, before the inspector Charles Hilton recommended granting of permission, with the ministerial approval being given on 10 January 1968. The construction was completed by Cementation, who started construction in July 1968. The build required the tipping of 300,000 long tons (670,000,000\u00a0lb) of colliery spoil to form the base.\nThe purpose-built hoverport opened on 2 May 1969 with the delivery of the company's first two large SR.N4 craft, Swift and Sure, which started operations on the route to Calais. The port cost \u00a31.5 million, and the formal opening was performed by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\nOperations\nThe site continued to operate through the 1970s, eventually operating four craft, including the first SR.N4 Mark II, the Prince of Wales (GH-2054) which started operations from Ramsgate on 18 June 1977.\nClosure\nThe oil crisis of the 1970s caused significant cost pressure on hovercraft operators due to the amount of kerosene used by the craft, and in 1979 Hoverlloyd was put up for sale. There was no successful interest and in 1981, the operator merged with the rival British Rail-owned Seaspeed to form Hoverspeed.\nFor the 1982 season, operations continued from Ramsgate Hoverport under the Hoverspeed branding, but following the end of the season all passenger and vehicle services were moved to Seaspeed's operating base at the Port of Dover.\nThe hoverport remained as an operational and maintenance base, with administration taking place on site until October 1985, and engineering (particularly hovercraft overhauls) continuing until December 1987.\nThe buildings on the site were demolished in August 1995.\nPost-closure use\nIn the mid-1990s the site was proposed to be the site of a major leisure complex with 250 holiday apartments, an indoor ski slope, swimming pool, and other amenities, which was proposed to be part-funded with European Union development grants, and developed by Jimmy Godden who owned Dreamland Margate but negotiations broke down with Thanet District Council in 1996.\nThe site is disused although the hovercraft pad, car-marshalling area, and approach road are still identifiable at the site.\n",

    "\"Canadian\" as an ethnic identity\nNot to be confused with Indigenous peoples in Canada.\nEthnic group\nCanadian ethnicity refers to the self-identification of one's ethnic origin as being Canadian. The identification is most common among white Canadians who do not identify with their ethnic ancestral origins due to generational distance from European ancestors.\nCanadians with ancestral origins in the British Isles and France are the most likely groups to identify ethnically as Canadian. As their languages, traditions, and cultural practices largely define Canadian society, many do not see themselves as linked to any other nation or ethnic group. Nonetheless, most English-speaking Old Stock Canadians still identify ethnically with their European ancestry, while French-speaking Old Stock Canadians are more likely to identify ethnically as Canadian or with other North American identities (such as Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois or Acadian) than with European ones.\nIndigenous Canadians do not identify ethnically as Canadian, identifying instead with their First Nation group, as Inuit, or as M\u00e9tis.\n\"Canadian\" was the most common ethnic or cultural origin reported in the 2021 census, reported alone or in combination with other origins by 5.67 million people or 15.6% of the total population.\nDefinition\nSeveral surnames of the first French settlers of Quebec City ceased to exist in France, but continued use in North America (mainly in Quebec) such as Gagnon, Cloutier, and Corriveau.\nThere exists a contrast in the meaning of ethnicity between English- and French-speaking Canadians. Social scientist Rhoda Howard-Hassmann has stated that among English-speaking Canadians, ethnic identity is frequently misunderstood as meaning biological ancestry, \"so that everyone's true identity is presumed to be rooted somewhere else\". French-speaking Canadians more frequently associate their ethnic origin with their nation, rooted in heritage rather than biological ancestry.\nCanadian identity in English and in French emerged separately from one another and often hold different meanings for speakers of each language. Canadian identity tends to have a more historic meaning to it in French, due to its earlier usage among ethnic French Canadians. In the late 17th century, French settlers in Canada, then a colony within New France, adopted \"Canadien\" as an ethnonym to distinguish themselves from the people of France. During this time, the identity was unique to French settlers. In late 18th century, following the arrival of United Empire Loyalists to British North America, Canadian identity was adopted by English-speakers. Descendants of 17th and 18th century French settlers began using \"French Canadian\" and since the 1960s \"Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\" to distinguish themselves from other Canadians.\nStatistical data\nThe 1996 census was the first in which Statistics Canada allowed \"Canadian\" as a valid ethnic origin response. It was immediately the most common origin reported, and was met with a significant decline in English and French origin responses when compared to previous censuses. Individuals with Scottish or Irish origins were likely to list these origins alongside with \"Canadian\", and the number of responses for them did not significantly change.\nLower educational attainment, residing outside of a metropolitan area, and having a French language background are all indicators of Canadian ethnic identity. In 2001, nearly one-third of those with a high school education or less indicated only Canadian ethnicity, compared to less than 20% of those with a bachelor's degree or higher. Across all provinces, residents of non-metropolitan areas are significantly more likely to report Canadian ethnicity than metropolitan residents. Likelihood is consistent among both men and women.\nIn comparison to other settler countries, Canadians are more likely than Americans but less likely than Australians to identify their nationality as their ancestral origin. 5.3% of the U.S. population claim American ancestry according to the 2022 American Community Survey, while 29.9% of respondents nominated Australian ancestry in the 2021 Australian census.\nOf the 5.67 million people who identified their ethnic origin as Canadian in the 2021 census, 4.18 million reported it as a single origin while 1.49 million reported it in combination with other origins.\nLargest ethnic or cultural origins in Canada by census division in 2021.\nThe decline in Canadian ethnic origin responses in 2021 is largely due to changes in the format of the ethnic origin question in the census. Each census questionnaire between 1996 and 2016 included a list of examples of ethnic origins to enter, all with \"Canadian\" as the first example listed, except in 1996 when it was the fifth example. In 2016, there were 28 examples listed. The 2021 census did not list any examples, negatively affecting a respondent's likelihood of entering \"Canadian\" as an origin. Less consequentially, prior to the 2021 census, a respondent answering \"Frenc",

Until the 1980s, it produced bodies for small European car manufacturers. In some cases, these were just body shells, and in other cases, the vehicles were (almost) completely assembled.\nEmbo worked for De Tomaso and Maserati for a long time, including on the De Tomaso Pantera. Between 1979 and 1990, a total of 463 Panteras of the first series were built, and from 1990 to 1993 another 41 examples of the second series were produced, as well as the De Tomaso Longchamp and the largely identical Maserati Kyalami. They also worked on the De Tomaso Deauville, including an estate version called Giardinetta, which was built as a one-off for Elisabeth Heskell, the wife of Alejandro de Tomaso, in 1985 from some of the last Deauville parts.\nIn 1982, Embo launched a convertible version of the Maserati Biturbo, which had been launched shortly before. The convertible was based on the uncut Biturbo chassis and had a comparatively massive top. This version was not mass-produced. Instead, Maserati owner Alejandro de Tomaso opted for a Spyder version from the Zagato workshops in Milan, which was based on a shortened chassis. Zagato was to produce all of the Biturbo Spyders until 1996.\nIn addition, Embo produced a number of other cars, such as a convertible version of the Innocenti Mini and a revised Renault 5.\nEmbo also collaborated with the Swiss car manufacturer Monteverdi. In the 1970s, Monteverdi had the vast majority of its sports car bodies built at Carrozzeria Fissore in Savigliano near Milan; however, individual bodies were also manufactured in other workshops - possibly for capacity reasons. Embo manufactured at least four 375/L coupes and two 375/4 sedans (in 2007, unofficial production statistics from Monteverdi were circulating on an internet site, in which the manufacturer was incorrectly referred to as BOEM).\nAfter the market for small series vehicles became increasingly poor in the 1980s, Embo switched its activities to supplying sheet metal parts for various automobiles. Today, Embo produces body parts in large quantities for a number of European manufacturers - particularly for the spare parts sector.\nAutomobiles with the brand name Embo\nStarting in 1978, Embo produced an all-wheel drive off-road vehicle with a short wheelbase based on the Fiat Campagnola. The vehicle length was 3100\u00a0mm. Three different Fiat engines were available. These were petrol engines with a displacement of 2000\u00a0cm3 and either 80\u00a0hp or 110\u00a0hp, and a diesel engine with a displacement of 2500\u00a0cm3 and 72\u00a0hp. In 1980, a visual revision took place. The model was now given the name Mega. Production ended in 1982.\nLiterature\nGeorg Amtmann, Halwart Schrader: Italienische Sportwagen, 1.

    "Canadian farmer and peer (1914\u20132001)\nFrederick George Moore Perceval, 11th Earl of Egmont (14 April 1914 \u2013 8 December 2001) was a Canadian farmer and peer. Born in Calgary, upon the ascension of his father as the 10th Earl of Egmont, he and Perceval moved to Avon Castle in Ringwood, Hampshire. When the 10th Earl died in 1932, Perceval inherited his estate and title and promptly moved back to Canada, selling the castle. Marrying Geraldine Moodie in August, they soon built a home on a piece of land they bought right outside Priddis, Alberta, where Perceval was raised. When a fire destroyed that home, they built a new one and sold Avon Castle. They bought the Two-Dot Ranch in 1959 at Nanton, Alberta, where Perceval died in 2001. He was succeeded by his son Thomas as the 11th Earl of Egmont.\nLife and career\n2010 photograph of Avon Castle, the Perceval family estate\nFrederick George Moore Perceval was born on 14 April 1914 in Calgary, Alberta, to Frederick Joseph Travelyan and Cecilia Perceval.:\u200an.pag.\u200a His parents had emigrated to Alberta in 1900, where they bought a ranch in Priddis, Alberta, and where Perceval was raised. Cecilia died two years after the birth of Perceval in 1916, which led to a closer relationship between he and his father. In 1929, his father became the 10th Earl of Egmont after the death of their distant cousin Charles Perceval, 9th Earl of Egmont. The now-10th Earl took the younger Perceval and moved to England, where they resided at the family's seat Avon Castle in Ringwood, Hampshire. After the inheritance, two people attempted to challenge the claim to both the title and land: a baker from Hornsey claiming he was born in Australia to the brother of the 6th Earl of Egmont; and a retired optician from Lancaster. Both cases ended up being dismissed in court, however the House of Lords did not recognise the Percevals' claim until 1939, several years after the death of the 10th Earl. The two were used to their lives in Canada and the 10th Earl would often refuse servants. Him and Perceval would often do chores themselves; this earned the 10th Earl the nickname \"the loneliest peer in England,\" with Perceval being nicknamed \"the loneliest boy in the world.\"\nIn May 1932 the 10th Earl died in a car accident in Southampton, with 18-year-old Perceval inheriting both the title and his roughly million-dollar estate. As Earl of Egmont, Perceval was entitled to sit in the House of Lords from 16 May 1932 to 11 November 1999, when the House of Lords Act 1999 was passed, excluding all but ninety-two hereditary peers from the House. Perceval never ended up taking his seat, described as having rather sit on a horse than in the House.:\u200aA8\u200a Similar to his father, Perceval felt displeasure about residing in England and moved back to Canada in June.\nDoubtless the late earl's accent and manners may, like his boots, have been a shade too thick for the fine carpets of Hampshire. Doubtless he was no master of small talk, because on an Alberta ranch, if you talk at all, the subjects will probably be pretty big. They may be kittle cattle but they certainly won't be tittle tattle.\nJames Agate of the Sunday Express criticizing the secludedness of the Percevals\nTwo months after arriving, on 31 August 1932, he married his cousin:\u200an.pag.\u200a Geraldine Moodie, an orthodontic nurse. During their honeymoon, the couple was followed by journalists, and Perceval was described as being \"the only member of the House of Lords who could rope, throw and brand a steer.\":\u200an.pag.\u200a Perceval and Moodie had 8 children: Thomas, Gordon, June Rose, Patrick, Frederick, Donald, Geraldine, Elizabeth. They were also the foster parents of a girl named Connie.:\u200an.pag.\u200a Moodie died in 1995.\nFor a brief moment the newly-wed couple were indecisive where they wanted to reside, and often moved between England and southern Alberta. They decided to live in Alberta and bought roughly 680 acres (280\u00a0ha) of land right ouside Priddis on the intersection of Macleod Trail and Willow Park Drive, building a Tudor-styled home on it.:\u200aA8\u200a After the home burned down in 1938, they temporarily moved to England, where Perceval bought a car he travelled the country with and planned to send his son to Eton College. Eventually, they decided to stay in Priddis where he built a new 26-room house and sold Avon Castle for $378 thousand.\nIn 1959 their current property, named Egmont Ranch, was threatened by urban sprawl. As a result, Perceval sold the ranch to the Kelwood Corporation, reported at a price to be roughly \u00a3350 thousand ($980 thousand) and he bought the Two-Dot Ranch at Nanton\u2014sized at 5,080 acres (2,060\u00a0ha; 20.6\u00a0km2; 7.94\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\u2014from Claude Gallinger for $284 thousand. After the approval of the House of Lords Act 1999, Perceval reportedly expressed regrets about not taking his seat in the House.\nPerceval died at his ranch of heart failure on 8 December 2001. He was buried at St. Mary's Cemetery in Calgary in a private ceremony on 10 December. He was succeeded by hi",

He had three brothers and two sisters. His family owned a prominent general store named Madathukadai. After his father passed away, his brother Chidambaram Pillai managed the business.

    "Bitextual work (or bi-textual work) is a form of writing where the same text can have different meanings due to the multiple meanings of the words in the text. It is something in the form of a pun but at a higher intellectual level. This form of literary creations was most popular among Sanskrit litterateurs and, due to the influence of Sanskrit literature, it was also popular  among litterateurs of other regional languages in India. In Sanskrit it is known as \u015ble\u1e63a the literal meaning of which is \"embrace'.  It had its origins in the sixth century CE and it flourished in India until the colonial times. In modern times, the writing of bi-textual poems is looked down upon and is considered as an inferior literary activity.\nThe term \"bitextual work\", or more specifically \"bitextual poetry\", should not be confused with the term \"bidirectional poetry\". The latter is a genre of poetry in Sanskrit in which each stanza can be read both from left to right and from right to left, the two readings giving totally different meanings. R\u0101mak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47avilomak\u0101vya\u1e43 of S\u016bryad\u0101sa (c. 1580) is well known example of this genre of poetry.\nBitextual verse: Examples\nDa\u1e47\u1e0din  (fl.\u20097th\u20138th century) in his K\u0101vy\u0101dar\u015ba, which is the earliest surviving systematic treatment of poetics in Sanskrit, illustrates the concept of sle\u1e63a with the following verse:\n\u0905\u0938\u093e\u0935\u0941\u0926\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0942\u0922\u0903 \u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094d \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0932\u0903 \u0964\n\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e \u0939\u0930\u0924\u093f \u0932\u094b\u0915\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0939\u0943\u0926\u092f\u0902 \u092e\u0943\u0926\u0941\u092d\u093f\u0903 \u0915\u0930\u0948\u0903 \u0965\nas\u0101vudayam\u0101r\u016bdhah k\u0101ntim\u0101n raktamandalah |\nr\u0101j\u0101harati lokasya hrdayam mrdubhih karaih ||\nThe verse can be translated into English in the following two ways illustrating the fact that it has two totally different meanings.\n\u201cThis person has ascended the region of prosperity and is full of splendour; and the mandalas of districts are attached to him; and he the king captivates the hearts of the people by light taxes.\"\n\"This resplendent moon has ascended the heavens and is full of splendor and is reddish (as he newly rises) and he captivates the people by soft rays.\"\nThe meanings arise due the different meanings of the words that appear in the verse. The word \"udaya\" has several meanings. In the first meaning it refers to the eastern mountain, over which the moon ascends; in the second meaning it refers to a king\u2019s rise to power. Likewise, the word \"ma\\d n\\d dala\" means a circle, like the moon\u2019s disc, which is the meaning used in the first transaltion of the verse. But it can also mean a king\u2019s circle of allies which is the meaning chosen for the second translation. The word \"kara\"-s means the moon\u2019s rays, but it also means  the taxes levied by a king. In a more general setting, in the traditions of Sanskrit literature, the moon itself is imagined to be the king of the stars.\nDa\u1e47\u1e0din has followed up the above verse with the following verse which may be thought of as the continuation of a poem:\n\u0926\u094b\u0937\u093e\u0915\u0930\u0947\u0923 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0928\u094d \u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0925\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0928\u093e |\n\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u094b\u0937\u094b \u092e\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0925\u092e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u0902 \u0928 \u092c\u093e\u0927\u0924\u0947 ||\ndo\u1e63\u0101kare\u1e47a sambandhan nak\u1e63atrapathavartin\u0101 |\nr\u0101j\u00f1\u0101 prado\u1e63o m\u0101mithamapriya\u1e43 ki\u1e43 na b\u0101dhate ||\nThe two different translations of the verse based on its two different meanings are as follows:\n\"Having secured an alliance with that vicious king, whose conduct is far from noble, is there anything to stop this villain from tormenting his enemy \u2014 me?\"\n\"Now that he\u2019s joined by that nocturnal king, who resides among the planets, is there anything to stop the evening from tormenting me \u2014 separated from my beloved?\"\nTo get the different meanings, the words in the verse may have to be split up differently. For example, the word \"nak\u1e63atra\" without splitting up means planet; but it can be split up as \"na\" + \"k\u1e63atra\" which then has the meaning \"not a warrior\".\nThe beginnings of bitextual work in India\nThe earliest Sanskrit poets never used \u015ble\u1e63a to embellish their poems. For example, there are no \u015ble\u1e63a-s in Valmiki's Ramayana considered to be the first poem in Sanskrit. However  one can see  \u015ble\u1e63a-s in the mah\u0101k\u0101va-s of the second century CE author A\u015bvagho\u1e63a, but at the same time the great fourth century poet and play-wright K\u0101lid\u0101sa used \u015ble\u1e63a-s only very rarely. \u015ale\u1e63a appears prominently for the first time in the writing of the sixth century CE poet Bh\u0101ravi. The earliest literary creation which used \u015ble\u1e63a extensively is V\u0101savadatt\u0101, a  work written entirely in prose by a sixth century author by name Subandhu. Nothing much is known about the author Subandhu.The work V\u0101savadatt\u0101 must have been highly acclaimed and popular and this is attested by the fact that it has caused more than twenty commentaries to be written.\nSome notable bitextual works\nThe following is a partial list of some of the notable bitextual works in Sanskrit whose copies are still extant.\nDvisandh\u0101na Mah\u0101k\u0101vya of Dhana\u00f1jaya (c. 800)\nR\u0101macaritam of Sandhy\u0101karanandin (c. 1100)\nN\u0101bheyanemik\u0101vya of Hemacandras\u016bri (c. 1125)\nR\u0101ghavap\u0101ndav\u012bya of Kavir\u0101ja (c. 1175)\nP\u0101rvat\u012brukmin\u012bya of Vidy\u0101m\u0101dhava (c. 1200)\nR\u0101ghavap\u0101ndav\u012bya of Krsnapandita (c. 1250)\nR\u0101ghavap\u0101ndavay\u0101dav\u012bya of Cidambarakavi (c. 1600)\nPa\u00f1cakaly\u0101",
    "\nHantsavichy Ghetto or Gantsevichi Ghetto (November 1941 \u2013 14 August 1942) was a Jewish ghetto, a place of forced relocation for the Jews of the city of Gantsevichi (Hantsavichy) in the Brest Region and nearby settlements during the Holocaust in Belarus under the occupation of Belarus by the forces of Nazi Germany during World War II.\nOccupation of Gantsevichi and establishment of the ghetto\nBefore the war, Jews constituted 70% of Gantsevichi's population, approximately 1,700 people.\nHantsavichy was captured by German troops on June 30, 1941, and the occupation lasted for three years, until July 7, 1944.\nAt the beginning of the war, the Germans destroyed almost the entire Jewish population of the town and the surrounding villages. Jews from nearby districts\u2014Kletsk, Telekhany, Krasnoslobodsk, and others\u2014more than 6,000 people, were brought to Gantsevichi to be killed.\nFrom June 30 to July 1, 1941, during an \"action\" (used by the Nazis for organized mass killings) in Gantsevichi, 16 Jews were killed, and on August 15, 350 Jews were killed.\nIn the fall of 1941, the Germans, implementing Hitler's program of Jewish extermination, organized a ghetto in the town, which functionally served as a labor camp. It housed 230 Jews from Lenin and 120 from Pogost-Zagorodsky.\nConditions in the ghetto\nThe ghetto, located opposite the railway station and enclosed by a barbed-wire fence, consistently housed around 500 people. Those who died from hunger, beatings, disease, or were shot by guards, were replaced by new able-bodied prisoners from nearby ghettos.\nThe Nazis forced Greenberg (also known as Greenbaum) to become the chairman of the Judenrat. He did everything possible to save the prisoners.\nMost of the prisoners were used in the construction of roads through the swamps, while a smaller number worked in various workshops in the town.\nJews were dying of hunger. Each person was given only 200 grams of ersatz bread made from chaff mixed with straw and 20 grams of cereal per day.\nA sign with \"behavior rules\" hung on the camp gates, with the punishment for any violation being execution\u2014even for hiding a piece of bread. For every escapee or attempted escape, 40 prisoners and all the escapee's relatives were shot.\nThe Germans shot those who became weakened or ill on the spot.\nIn addition to morning and evening roll calls, the exhausted prisoners were counted several more times a day. At the sound of the guard's whistle, the Jews would stand \"in eights,\" and the guards would check if everyone was present.\nDestruction of the ghetto\nA cavalry unit of the SS, which killed Jews in Telekhany, arrived in Gantsevichi in early August 1941.\nOn August 14 (or 11), 1942, more than 300 Jews escaped, and those who remained were shot. The head of the Judenrat, Greenberg, was the initiator of the mass escape preparation and organization.\nMemory\nThere were 31 execution pits in and around the town. They were dug at the sites of today's Sadovaya, Montazhnikov, Dzerzhinsky, and Frunze streets; Korotkiy, Sadovy, and Proletarsky lanes; at the 7th kilometer of the Gantsevichi-Khatynichi road; and in the Krasunya forest area (Malkovich district). Each of these pits contained the remains of 300-500 murdered Jews and partially prisoners of war.\nIn the mid-1960s, the remains of Jews\u2014the victims of the genocide\u2014from all known execution pits were reburied in a grave on Gagarin Street, and a monument was erected at that site. In the 1970s, due to street construction, the remains and the monument were moved to the northeastern part of the town cemetery.\nA monument to the victims of the Jewish resistance during the Holocaust, who died during the uprising in Gantsevichi and whose burial places are unknown, was erected in the Jewish cemetery in the village of Lenin.\nIncomplete lists of Jews killed in Gantsevichi are available.\n",

    "Species of frog\nRanitomeya yavaricola is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae. It is endemic to Peru and possibly nearby Brazil.\nDescription\nThe adult male frog measures about   15.2 - 17.7  mm in snout-vent length and two adult female frogs were found to measure 16.8 and 17.7 mm. Sexual dimorphism appears to be limited to a slight difference in size, with larger females. The skin of the frog's body is black with turquoise spots and stripes on the back. There is one dot on the inside of each eye.  The belly is blue-green with black spots. The iris of the eye is black in color.\nScientists used to think this was the same frog as Ranitomeya flavovittata, but R. flavovitata has black marks on its legs and R. yavaricola does not.\nHabitat\nDespite considerable searching, scientists still know this frog solely from the type locality: The oxbow lake Lago Preto Pared\u00f3n in Peru, 120 meters above sea level.\nThis frog seems to prefer forests that never, but it has been observed near swamp. It lives in places with lots of Geonoma palms. it has been observed sitting on shrubs, branches, and epiphytes, hiding by roots and in plants.\nLife cycle\nThe female frog lays her eggs in pools of water in bromeliad plants, where the tadpoles later develop.\nThreats\nThe IUCN classifies this species as data deficient but notes that its habitat includes protected areas. However, the nearby forests, where the frog is presumed to also live, have several logging concessions. Like many frogs in Ranitomeya, there are concerns about R. yavaricola being caught and sold on the illegal pet trade. While scientists have noted some interested buyers, no one has been caught selling it yet. Scientists believe this is because the frog is so hard to find in the wild.\nOriginal description\nPerez-Pena PE; Chavez G; Twomey E; Brown JL (2010). \"Two new species of Ranitomeya (Anura: Dendrobatidae) from eastern Amazonian Peru\".

    "Minor plebeian family of Rome\nThe gens Hostia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome.  Few members of this gens are mentioned by Roman writers, of whom the best known is the poet Hostius, but many more are known from inscriptions.\nOrigin\nThe nomen Hostius is a patronymic surname derived from the old praenomen Hostus, which also gave rise to the nomen Hostilius.  Chase classifies it among those gentilicia that were either of Roman origin, or are found at Rome, and cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else.\nPraenomina\nThe chief praenomina of the Hostii were Gaius, Marcus, and Quintus, amongst the most common names at all periods of Roman history.  There are multiple examples of other common names, including Publius and Lucius, but individual Hostii sometimes bore more distinctive praenomina, including Decimus, Numerius, and Tiberius.\nBranches and cognomina\nThe Hostii known from epigraphy do not appear to have used any hereditary cognomina, and may not have been divided into distinct families.  However, persons of this name appear to have settled at Casilinum in Campania by the end of the second century BC, and subsequently a number lived at Puteoli.  Most of the inscriptions of this gens are from Rome, Latium, and Campania.\nMembers\nThis list includes abbreviated praenomina.  For an explanation of this practice, see filiation.\nHostius, author of the poem Bellum Histricum, on the Third Illyrian War.  The poem has been lost, except for a few lines quoted by Festus, Macrobius, and Servius.

    "Former lifeboat station in Argyll and Bute, Scotland\nMachrihanish Lifeboat Station was located in the village of Machrihanish, on the west coast of the Kintyre peninsular, 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) west of the town of Campbeltown, in Argyll and Bute.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1912.\nThe station was no longer required following the placement of a motor-powered lifeboat at Campbeltown. Machrihanish Lifeboat Station closed in 1930.\nHistory\nOn 29 December 1908, the steam trawler Albany (FD-82) was on her return trip to Fleetwood after fishing off the west coast of Scotland, when she was caught in a blizzard off the Kintyre peninsular, and ran aground 150 yards (140\u00a0m) off shore at Tangytavil, near Westport, 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) north of Machrihanish. Battered by the storm and huge waves, the ship's boat was washed away. The windows of the wheelhouse were smashed, leaving little protection for the 10 crewmen. Three other trawlers stood by for some time, but unable to get close, or offer and help, they eventually departed, leaving the Albany's crew to their fate.\nOnly the previous day, on 28 December 1908, the Campbeltown lifeboat had been badly damaged on a call, and could not be used. It is doubtful whether the lifeboat could have been brought the 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) miles overland in the blizzard conditions, and a sea journey would have been maybe 30 nautical miles (56\u00a0km).\nThe Campbeltown lifeboat crew still set out to the wreck, to try to effect a rescue, battling the winter conditions, but finding roads blocked with snow. Meanwhile, locals did what they could to get a line to the boat, but without success. Eventually, after nearly 3 days aboard the wreck, the men managed to get a line ashore, and one by one, the 10 crewmen were pulled through the waves to the shore and safety.\nAs a result of this incident, it was decided that a lifeboat should be placed on the west side of the Kintyre peninsular. When required, the lifeboat would be manned by the crew from Campbeltown. A boathouse and slipway were built at Machrihanish, and a 35-foot self righting 'pulling and sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with oars and sails, was constructed by Thames Ironworks of Blackwall, London. A grand inauguration ceremony was held on 19 September 1912, and the boat was named Henry Finlay (ON 618).\nRNLB Henry Finlay (ON 618)\nIn an ideal world, a lifeboat should never be required. But an unused asset is often transferred to somewhere more useful. This would be the fate to befall the Machrihanish lifeboat, for in 18 years, the lifeboat was never required, and never launched on service. In 1929, a 51-foot motor-powered Barnett-class lifeboat was placed at Campbeltown. The Henry Finlay (ON 618) was withdrawn, and the Machrihanish Lifeboat Station was closed in 1930.\nThe Henry Finlay was towed to Ardrossan, and then transported by rail to Teignmouth, where she would serve for another nine years, until that station also closed in 1940. She would remain in store at Teignmouth as a reserve lifeboat, for the duration of the war, being sold for \u00a3200 in 1945. Fully restored in 2008, she was used in the Warner Bros. film Dunkirk in 2017, and it is believed she was subsequently transported to the United States, still in the ownership of Warner Bros.\nThe building still remains as a boathouse / store.\nMachrihanish lifeboat\n^ ON is the RNLI's Official Number of the boat.\nSee also\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\nNotes\n^ 35-foot 10-oared Self-righting (P&S), built by Thames Ironworks of Blackwall, London.\n",

Since October 2023 he is the Chief of the Missile Forces and Artillery of the Russian Armed Forces. As of 2023 he holds Lieutenant General rank.\nBiography\nBorn on August 22, 1969, in the city of Nezhin, Chernigov Oblast, Ukrainian SSR.\nHe graduated from the Odessa Higher Artillery Command School in 1991. Served in artillery units of the army and navy. In 1994, he was the first in the Navy to conduct artillery firing at coastal targets from a self-propelled artillery mount located on the deck of a moving landing ship with a 100% hit rate. He took part in the first Chechen war as commander of a mortar company, and participated in the operations to capture Shali and Vedeno. By October 1999, Major Dmitry Klimenko commanded a division of self-propelled artillery units of the 61st Separate Marine Brigade of the Northern Fleet.\nHe distinguished himself during the Second Chechen war, where he fought as a battery commander.

When large separatist forces attacked infantrymen under the cover of dense thickets, Klimenko personally arrived at the attacked area and, deploying a radio station, began adjusting artillery fire on the enemy. When the separatist forces approached his position at a distance of 70 meters, Klimenko continued to provide data to his battery, despite the fact that he was in the zone of fragments of his shells. Having lost several dozen people from artillery fire, the gang was forced to retreat. During her pursuit, she was almost completely destroyed.\nBy decree of the President of the Russian Federation dated February 21, 2000, Major Dmitry Klimenko was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation for \u201ccourage and heroism shown during the counter-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus region.\u201d At the same time he was awarded the rank of lieutenant colonel.\nHe graduated from the Military Artillery University in 2002, and the Military Academy of the General Staff in 2010.

    "Church in Derbent, Dagestan, Russia\nChurch in Dagestan, Russia\nSouth view\nWindow from the west\nNorth view\nWest view\nThe crossed-dome temple on the territory of Naryn-Kala is an early medieval Christian temple located in the northwestern part of the Naryn-Kala citadel in Derbent, Dagestan. For a long time, it was considered an underground reservoir for storing water.\nDescription\nAccording to written sources, Christianity has been widespread in Derbent since the early Middle Ages. Here, as historian Movses Kaghankatvatsi notes, was the residence of the Church of Caucasian Albania.\nThe temple in Naryn-Kala is a large underground structure and in historical literature was indicated as an \u201cunderground cistern\u201d carved into the rock in which water was stored. However, recent archaeological studies have shown that this structure is a crossed-dome Christian temple, built according to some estimates in the 4th century, according to others in the 5th-7th centuries.\nInitially, the temple was located above the ground, but apparently, over time, it sank into the ground. As a result, in the 17th-18th centuries the abandoned temple was repaired, cleaned and adapted for water storage.\nIts layout has a crossed-dome shape, making it like other Christian churches of Transcaucasia in the 5th-7th centuries. Most likely it was abandoned after the arrival of the Arabs in Transcaucasia in the 8th-9th centuries.\nThe temple consists of 1 central nave and transept topped with a dome (partially destroyed). There is a window at the top of the western wall.\nIn the plan of the structure, the side is a cross with an intra-wall tube 4.7 m long. The internal length of the three sides of the cross is 4.2 m (excluding the central part of the base), and the fourth, western side has a length of 5.6 m. The central part of the structure is covered by a dome with a diameter of 5 m, apparently rebuilt in the late medieval period, the height from the floor to the top of the dome is about 10 m. The square space in the central part of the cross, covered by the dome, has a side equivalent to 5 m (i.e. 1 m more than the width of the end sides of the cross), and, as it were, the internal structure of the wall is cut 0.5 m from each side, which gives its central part a complicated structure. The total length of the monument from west to east is 15 m, from north to south 13 m. An examination of this supposed cistern reveals that it was not previously cut out of the rock, as it was believed, it was formed from large well-hewn blocks for lime mortar. When examining the object, fragments of light plaster coating are found on the surface.\nOn November 19, 2020, a conference was held: \u201cThe mystery of the crossed-dome structure on the territory of the Naryn-Kala fortress. History of Christianity in Derbent\". As a result, the question of introducing amendments to the Order of the Government of the Russian Federation dated 01.06 was raised. 2009. No. 759-r regarding changing the name \u201cCrossed-dome Reservoir\u201d to the former name \u201cCrossed-dome Temple in the Citadel.\u201d\n",
    "Historic house in Los Angeles, California, U.S.\nUnited States historic place\nJanes House, also known as Janes Residence, is a historic home at 1727 Hudson Avenue, on the corner of Hudson Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, in Hollywood, California. The house predates the area's existing commercial development and is the boulevard's only remaining residential structure.\nHistory\nBeginnings\nJanes House was originally developed at 6541 Hollywood Blvd by H. J. Whitley and built in 1903 by architectural firm Dennis and Farwell, the same firm responsible for the nearby Lane House.  The Janes family bought the house for $10,000 the year it was built, and moved in two years later.\nIn 1911, the Janes family opened a kindergarten with fifteen students in their home, soon expanding to K-8th grade. They named the school The Misses Janes School of Hollywood. More than 1000 kids attended in the fifteen years the school was in existence, including the children of Charlie Chaplin, Jesse Lasky, Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Cecil B. DeMille, Jack Holt, Thomas Ince, and Wallace and Noah Beery.\nThe school closed in 1926, at which point the family set up a gas pump as a new source of income, naming themselves Janes Auto Service Station. Later, the house's yard was turned into a parking lot.\nPreservation and restoration\nIn 1980, Hollywood Heritage formed to identify and save historic structures in Hollywood, with Janes House being their first effort. That same year, Janes House was designated Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #227.\nIn 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, with Janes Residence listed as a contributing property in the district. The listing noted that Janes Residence had an unaltered yet dilapidated interior and an intact exterior.\nIn 1984, Janes House was sold to a developer for $600,000. In 1985, the house was moved to the back of its lot, changing its address to 1727 Hudson Avenue, and a 14,000 sq ft mini mall named Janes Square was built in front. The house itself underwent several renovations, becoming Hollywood's official visitor information center in 1986, a restaurant named Memphis in 2006 and another restaurant named Janes House in 2009, and the 1920s-themed speakeasy No Vacancy in 2013.\nArchitecture\nJane House predates Hollywood's existing commercial development and is Hollywood Boulevard's only remaining residential structure. The house is made of wood, was designed in the Queen Anne Victorian style, and features a conical bay with turreted roof, a hewn stone porch, bevelled glass windows, and a shingled exterior.\n",

He finished his studies in international relations at the Belarusian State University in Minsk with distinction in 1997.\nThe next year, Sidarenka joined the Belarusian Foreign Ministry's service and worked for the Pan-European Cooperation section in the Department for Europe. In 2002, he was acting leader of the Permanent Delegation of the Republic of Belarus at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna. He came back to Belarus in 2005 and took over the leadership of the section for the OSCE and the Council of Europe at the Foreign Ministry.\nIn 2009, Sidarenka went as a minister-counsellor to the Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in Austria. At the same time, he became acting Permanent Representative of the Republic of Belarus at international organizations in Vienna.\nIn 2013, Sidarenka became the leader at the Foreign Ministry's Department for Pan-European Cooperation. On 13 December 2016, he took over the office of Ambassador of the Republic of Belarus to Germany. According to Pavel Latushko, Sidarenka advocated pro-European viewpoints.\nSidarenka was, by decree from President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, stripped of his post as ambassador on 11 March 2024.\nPersonal life\nSidarenka was married and father to two daughters. Besides Russian and Belarusian, he spoke English, French and German.\nDeath\nSidarenka died on 24 June 2024 and was buried two days later. He was 48. According to reports, he had committed suicide after he was interrogated by the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (KDB\u00a0RB) upon his return to Belarus. According to information from the Belarusian opposition Internet portal Serkalo, though, Sidarenka had experienced heavy physical stress in the KDB\u00a0RB's lie detector tests. Belarusian exile media have reported that he killed himself by jumping from a highrise in Minsk.\nThe Belarusian news outlet Nasha Niva quoted unnamed sources who said that \" did not get out of polygraphs and interrogations,\" further adding that \"It is said in Minsk that all career diplomats returning from the EU are now subject to close operational scrutiny by special services\"\u00a0\u2014 that is to say, the KDB\u00a0RB.\nFor her part, Katherine Brucker, the Charg\u00e9e d\u2019Affaires of the United States Mission, speaking to the OSCE's Permanent Council, said that Sidarenka had died \"under circumstances that are unclear and very troubling,\" and she asserted that there had been \"reports\" that \"his body showed signs of torture.\" However, no evidence was presented to corroborate these assertions.\nThe Belarusian Foreign Ministry made an announcement about the diplomat's death only after he had been buried, without naming the cause of death. Western media likened the circumstances of Sidarenka's death by falling out a window to the way in which some earlier critics of Russia and Belarus had died, as well as to Vladimir Makei's likewise surprising death in 2022.\n",

    "Rural cooperatives in Burundi\nSangwe cooperatives are government-sponsored rural cooperatives in Burundi, launched in 2019.\nThey receive interest-free loans to develop agriculture and livestock. \nThere have been practical difficulties, including poor management, misconceived projects, theft and concerns that membership of the ruling party is required to gain benefits.\nLaunch\nThe government of Burundi initiated a policy of \"Sangwe\" colline cooperatives in 2019.\nThey were to be supervised by Anacoop (Agence Nationale de Promotion et de R\u00e9gulation des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Coop\u00e9ratives) and funded by Fonic (Fonds National d'Investissement Communal: National Communal Investment Fund).\nAn interest-free loan of 10 million BIF (Burundian francs), about $5,000, is granted to each colline from the general state budget, which should be repaid in two years.\nThe program was launched in the run-up to the 2020 national elections, and many thought it was a way for the ruling National Council for the Defense of Democracy \u2013 Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) party to gain support.\nPresident \u00c9variste Ndayishimiye, who took office in June 2020, created a more open and inclusive political environment and made development a priority.\nHe said, \"the war for peace is won, now we have to win the war against poverty... every mouth must have something to eat and every pocket must have money\".\n90% of the population live by agriculture and/or livestock.\n63% of the population is under 25, and youth unemployment is more than 55%.\nThe Sangwe cooperatives aimed to improve the economy and reduce unemployment, particularly among youth.\nThe government allocated 29.1 billion BIF for these loans in the 2019\u20132020 budget year, and 87.83 billion BIF for subsequent budget years.\nOver 2,900 cooperatives received state loans.\nLittle was done to prepare the collines in terms of training them in cooperative management and business operations.\nMany of the members thought the money was a donation, and did not realize it had to be repaid.\nResults\nProblems raised at a national media meeting in July 2020 included poor management, uncertain weather, shortage of veterinarians, shortage of animal medicines, and poor quality seeds.\nRepayment of a full loan within two years would be difficult.\nTwo years later, problems included poor leadership and organization, misuse of the money, failure of projects and failure to repay the loans.\nSome claimed the cooperatives were controlled by the ruling party, they had to join the CNDD-FDD to receive benefits, and members even had to wear party badges to participate in meetings of their cooperative.\nNgozi Province has over 500 rural cooperatives, of which 298 had been funded by Fonic by February 2024.\nMost were having difficulty repaying their loans.\nOne problem was that only a few members in each cooperative were active, make a fair share of benefits difficult.\nAnother was cases where the management committees and colline chiefs were complicit in stealing livestock or produce.\nManagement of resources was often poor, so productive equipment was underused. \nIn February 2024 the governor of the province, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Minani, recognised the problems and said he intended to revive the cooperatives so that by July that year they could repay their loans and start investing their own money.\n",
    "\nLos Angeles Community Action Network (LACAN) is a grassroots organization based in the Skid Row area of Los Angeles, California. Founded in 1999, LACAN works to organize low-income and homeless residents through advocacy, community organizing, litigation and education. The organization focuses on issues such as housing rights and the civil rights of the unhoused population.The organization is known for prioritizing the leadership of those directly affected by the issues it addresses.\nProjects and initiatives\nEcoHood Project\nThrough its EcoHood project, LACAN aims to build more affordable and energy-efficient housing that is quicker to construct, addressing the increased demand for housing since the pandemic and reducing the ecological footprint.\nImpact of Structural Racism on Women in Skid Row\nLACAN also released a report titled \u201cThe Impact of Structural Racism on Women in Skid Row,\u201d highlighting how structural racism affects unhoused women of color, particularly focusing on issues like family separation and child removal by the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), and was informed by the Downtown Women's Action Coalition (DWAC).\nHousing advocacy\nLACAN members, including former professionals, veterans, and long-time residents, have fought against gentrification, landlord abuses, and city policies. The organization's efforts led to a moratorium on housing conversions and a residential hotel preservation ordinance, protecting 19,000 low-income housing units from demolition or upscale conversion.\nIn 2017, LACAN has filed an appeal and led protests against a proposed 33-story high-rise in Downtown LA's Fashion District, arguing that the city should prioritize housing the homeless over approving luxury residential projects, especially given the high vacancy rate in existing units.\nin 2023, Pete White, executive director of LACAN, criticized the expanding outreach efforts in Los Angeles as a \"smoke and mirrors\" strategy, dubbing it the \"outreach industrial complex,\" suggesting it's more about appearance than real solutions to homelessness.\nIn 2024, LACAN organizer Adam Smith criticized Los Angeles' prioritization of criminalization over addressing homelessness, citing the failure of policies like LAMC 41.18, which resulted in belongings of unhoused residents being confiscated without adequate housing or shelter alternatives, as revealed in a recent LACAN survey of 100 individuals.\nSafer Cities Initiative\nIn 2006, the Safer Cities Initiative, launched by Mayor Villaraigosa and Police Chief Bratton, increased police presence and targeted the homeless population with numerous citations and arrests, predominantly for minor infractions like jaywalking. This initiative resulted in significant displacement and increased arrests, leading LACAN to respond with community watch programs, demonstrations, and legal actions.\nDirty Divide\nThe documentary The Dirty Divide, by filmmaker Paul Freedman, highlights the severe human rights abuses and systemic neglect faced by the unhoused population in Los Angeles, particularly focusing on the efforts of the LACAN in advocating for fair housing, employment, and fighting against police brutality.\nFood\nLACAN operates a rooftop garden and hosts a marketplace where residents can access fresh produce, free haircuts, and community events.\n",
    "Tex-Mex restaurant chain in the US\nMi Cocina is a Tex-Mex restaurant.\nHistory\nChef Michael \"Mico\" Rodriguez, with $77,500 in backing from Ray Washburne, Dick Washburne, Bob McNutt, opened the first location of Mi Cocina in the summer of 1991 at Preston Road and Forest Lane in Dallas.

It was known as a rare spot to eat sit-down tacos in Dallas. After most of its locations closed between 2019 and 2021, the last location shut its doors on January 13, 2024.\nSee also\nList of Tex-Mex restaurants\n",

Morgan spent nearly all of his career as partner responsible for design for Nevin & Morgan, the most successful architectural firm in Louisville during its existence.\nLife and career\nFrederic Lindley Morgan was born January 6, 1889, in Loda, Illinois to Joseph Sidney Morgan and Maud Morgan, n\u00e9e Lindley. He was educated at the University of Illinois, graduating in 1912 with a BSArch. This was followed by travel in Europe. \nIn 1913 he joined the office of J. Earl Henry, architect to Louisville Public School District. In 1915 he moved to Detroit, where he worked for architects Malcomson & Higginbotham and Smith, Hinchman & Grylls. \nIn 1919 he returned to Louisville, where he joined Henry's new private sector firm, Nevin & Henry, as chief designer. Senior partner Hugh L. Nevin had been in practice in Louisville for about a decade. Henry died in 1920, and in 1921 Nevin formed a new partnership, Nevin, Wischmeyer & Morgan, with Morgan and Herman Wischmeyer. In 1929 the partnership was reorganized as Nevin, Morgan & Kolbrook with the withdrawal of Wischmeyer and the admission of Joseph H. Kolbrook. In 1942 Kolbrook also withdrew and the firm became Nevin & Morgan. The partnership was changed for the last time in 1967 to Nevin, Morgan & Weber, reflecting the addition of Herbert A. Weber.

    "German photographer\nPetra Wunderlich (born in 1954 in Gelsenkirchen) is a German photographer. She is associated with the D\u00fcsseldorf School of Photography. Wunderlich lives and works in D\u00fcsseldorf and New York.\nStudies\nWunderlich studied at first painting at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des beaux-arts de Paris, from 1975 to 1985. She later decided to study photography, and as such was as a master student under Bernd Becher at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf, from 1985 to 1988. Wunderlich belongs to the first generation of students of the D\u00fcsseldorf School of Photography. She received a work scholarship from the Kunstfonds Foundation, in 1987, and the Karl Schmidt Rottluff Scholarship, in 1988.\nWork\nThe central themes in Wunderlich's work are church buildings and quarries. She always photographs in black and white. Her works are always devoided of people.\nA subject of her work are the quarries in Carrara, which she has been photographing since the 1980s, and also from Solnhofen, since the 1990s. These quarries rock layers reflect the history of art and architecture, because great masters such as Michelangelo have worked with marble from Carrara, simimarly to many architects and builders since the Roman Empire days.\nQuarries also provide the raw material for the church buildings. In her early works, Wunderlich photographed the churches as seen from the front and with a strong cropping, never depicting the whole building. This formal rigor was later broken by showing different buildings and their interaction. For the series mapping (1994\u20131998), Wunderlich photographed the many different churches that exist in Brooklyn, New York. She shows how the different ethnic groups that live there inscribe their own religion and aesthetics into the cityscape, by designing the facades with religious references. Wunderlich also created a photographic series of synagogues in New York, from 1995 to 2015, first shown with the title Common Ground at the Bernhard Knaus Fine Art Gallery in Frankfurt, in 2013\u20132014.\nExhibitions (selection)\nSeven Stones, BERNHARD KNAUS FINE ART, Frankfurt, Germany (solo), 2013\nNo-Men's Land - 7 Positions of contemporary Photography, Neuer Kunstverein Aschaffenburg e.V, Aschaffenburg, Germany, 2011\u20132012\nDie Erfindung der Wirklichkeit - Photographie an der Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf von 1970 bis heute, Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, 2010\u20132011\nViaggio in Italia, Palazzo Fabroni, Pistoia, Italy, 2010-2011\n",
    "Sikh environmental organization\nEcoSikh is a Sikh environmental organization. It is the most prominent Sikh environmental organization working on global environmental issues. It has been one of the foremost organizations promoting Sikhism as a \"green\" religion.\nHistory\nBackground\nAntecedents of Sikh forays into environmentalism can be found within the Guru Granth Sahib itself. The second shloka of the Japji Sahib of Guru Nanak stresses on the importance of living in-harmony with nature. Furthermore, Guru Har Rai taught that the environment should be cared for by Sikhs. The sarbat da bhala philosophy of Sikhs calls upon them to promote the well-being of all.\nSome earlier Sikh organizations and movements that delved into environmental efforts include Pingalwara, established by Bhagat Puran Singh, whom had pro-environmental inclinations. Balbir Singh Seechewal of the Nirmala sect, spearheaded the movement to clean-up the Kali Bein rivulet in the year 2000 and also raised awareness on the condition of the Buddha Nullah. Sewa Singh, director of the Nishan-e-Sikhi Charitable Trust based in Khadur Sahib, supervised the distribution and planting of hundreds of thousands of tree saplings, including along the roadways of Khadur Sahib.\nEstablishment\nEcoSikh was established in 2009 through a partnership with the Sikh Council on Religion and Education (SCORE). The establishment of the organization was influenced by the United Nations Development Programme and the Alliance of Religions and Conservation initiatives. The founder of EcoSikh is Rajwant Singh, who is the Global President.\nActivities\nEcoSikh primarily operates in the Indian state of Punjab but also conducts global projects. EcoSikh is working towards the \"greening\" of gurdwaras by reducing disposable wastage in the langar halls by introducing environmentally-friendly alternatives. Furthermore, they are working toward the \"greening\" of the areas in-vicinity to the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Other activities of EcoSikh include general cleanup drives, solar panel installations, and seminar events. EcoSikh aims to change individual Sikh attitudes and behaviours toward the environment, and the promotion of a healthy eco-friendly environment surrounding gurdwara complexes.\nSince 2013, EcoAmritsar, an initiative of EcoSikh based in Amritsar, has been providing instruction on the organization of green nagar kirtans, such as by recommending the usage of usage and collection of biodegradable plates and cutlery made from leaves and the serving of organic-based langars.\nEcoSikh reportedly was involved in over 1,500 activities in the year 2013.\nIn 2013, a painting by Rahi Mohinder Singh was gifted to EcoSikh which depicts Guru Har Rai giving a tree to a petitioner to plant, however the tree species portrayed in the painting is an eucalyptus, a non-native species that was not found during the lifetime of Guru Har Rai, making the painting anachronistic.\nIn May 2017, the EcoSikh proposed the establishment of a 100-acre \"sacred forest\" around the shrine of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan to celebrate the then upcoming 550th Guru Nanak Gurpurab celebrations slated for 2019. Rajwant Singh, president of EcoSikh, also expressed dreams of developing the site as an eco-tourism hub, alongside the sacred forest proposal. EcoSikh also suggested a botanical garden could be established at Kartarpur instead of a sacred forest. Alongside the sacred forest suggestion, it was proposed that efforts covering organic farming, install a solar panel installation, dedicated forest areas, amid others, should be considered for Kartarpur. The Guru Nanak Sacred Forests mission of EcoSikh was launched in 2019.\nEcoSikh also operates a branch in Canada, known as 'EcoSikh Canada'. In 2019, EcoSikh Canada planted hundreds of trees in the areas of Brampton and Scarborough, Ontario. 550 trees were specifically planted in the city of Brampton to celebrate the 550th Guru Nanak Gurpurab celebration. This was followed by another 550 trees planted in Scarborough.

    "Television station in Itabuna, Bahia, Brazil\nRecord Cabr\u00e1lia (channel 7) is a Brazilian broadcast television station in Itabuna, in southern Bahia. It operates on analog channel 7 and digital channels 17 (physical) and 7 (virtual) and is an owned-and-operated station of the Record network, which also controls Record Bahia in Salvador.\nHistory\nThe TV Cabr\u00e1lia concession was opened by the Federal Government, by Decree No. 81,600, of April 25, 1978, through transmission to channel 7, including the retransmitter in Buerarema, on channel 11. The authorization was signed by the Ministry of Communications on February 7, 1985, with the intention of operating in the city of Itabuna.\nTV Cabr\u00e1lia went on air on December 12, 1987, as an affiliate of Rede Manchete, being the first affiliate in the interior of Bahia. It was founded by businessman and then federal deputy Luiz Viana Neto, who was one of the partners of TV Aratu, in the capital Salvador, which was also affiliated with Manchete. Its first superintendent director was Nestor Amazonas, responsible for its installation.\nOne of the station's first local programs was Jornal Meio Dia, with thirty minutes, presented by Vilma Medina, then by others, including Cl\u00e1udia Barthel. Claudia Barthel worked at TV Santa Cruz, Globo's O&Os in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo and then went to Rede Manchete and RedeTV!, where she remains today. Another news program was Rep\u00f3rter Regional, presented by Maur\u00edcio Maron.\nIn 1992, TV Cabr\u00e1lia received donations for the campaign to collect food, medicine, clothes and blankets for the victims of Santa Catarina and the Itaja\u00ed Valley, after the long campaign. The broadcaster joined the campaign and in just a few days raised tons of donations. In 1993, due to the serious crisis faced by Rede Manchete since 1992 and the loss of audience, TV Cabr\u00e1lia left the network to be the second affiliate of the Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o (SBT) in Bahia (the first was TV Itapoan, since 1981).\nIn the first months of 1995, TV Cabr\u00e1lia was sold to Central Record de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, belonging to the businessman and bishop of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Edir Macedo. After the purchase, TV Cabr\u00e1lia became Rede Record's own broadcaster on July 1, leaving SBT. The station was the first affiliate of the network in Bahia and installed a relayer on VHF channel 9 in Salvador.\nIn 1997, after the purchase of TV Itapoan and the repeaters in Bahia by the same Edir Macedo, the broadcaster stopped broadcasting Record, as Itapoan, which had been affiliated with SBT since 1981, left the network to become Record's own broadcaster. As a result, Cabr\u00e1lia started to operate without affiliations, becoming independent and being autonomous for a short time, when it produced its own programming.\nIn 1998, the broadcaster became one of the first affiliates of the recently opened Rede Fam\u00edlia, leaving it to be independent, removing several local programs from the air. With the new affiliation, the assistance program Alerta Total debuted, lasting half an hour, presented by Reginaldo Silva, who is an evangelical pastor and also a councilor in Itabuna. The Jornal do Meio-Dia (formed by six news blocks, the first three produced by Itabuna and the last three by Vit\u00f3ria da Conquista) was also maintained.\nOn February 2, 2003, the station began to retransmit Rede Mulher programming, at the same time that Rede Fam\u00edlia also became an affiliate of the network. In the same year, the broadcaster was sued along with TV Itapoan, by practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions (such as the pai-de-santo or babalorix\u00e1s). Religious people complained about the constant daily attacks from pastors who present religious television programs on TV Itapoan and TV Cabr\u00e1lia, carried out by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. In the programs, Afro-Brazilian religious practices were called \"encosto\", a word associated with spirits that can harm people.\nIn July 2004, complaints from the Federal Public Ministry (MPF), based on documents from the Bahia Commercial Board, revealed that the senator for the State of Rio de Janeiro and bishop of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Marcelo Crivella, from the Liberal Party (PL) and candidate for mayor of the city of Rio de Janeiro, he still remained a partner and majority manager of TV Cabr\u00e1lia in 2003, despite the law prohibiting politicians from holding positions in radio and TV stations.\nOn September 27, 2007, TV Cabr\u00e1lia became part of Record News network that replaced Rede Fam\u00edlia, the first 24-hour journalism channel on free open television in the country. After the creation of Record News, in a project to \"reengineer\" the broadcaster to adapt the new network, the broadcaster's general director, Andr\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Ferreira, announced cuts to almost all programs produced and closed the Vit\u00f3ria da Conquista branch.\nOn October 23, the Union of Professional Journalists of Bahia (Sinjorba), released a note of denunciation and repudiation against the manag",

    "Water source in Syria\nEfqa Spring (Arabic: \u0625\u0641\u0642\u0627) is an ancient artesian spring in the Syrian Desert that was first developed between 4000 BCE and 2000 BCE. Once upon a time the spring fed a natural stream that drained eastward into a brackish wetland. The ancient city of Palmyra developed around the oasis created by the spring water. Efqa comes from the Aramaic word meaning source.\nThe spring emerges on the west side of modern Tadmur, \"opposite the modern building of the Cham Palace hotel, situated on the road to Damascus beyond the ruins of the ancient city.\"  The spring flows out of the limestone inside al-Mintar Mountain via nine hand-dug wells that feed into a 400-meter-long cave, or underground irrigation channel, known as a qanat. A recent restoration project sought to undo some of the damage done by ISIS attacks in the area. The spring went dry in 1994, due to a combination of drought, over pumping, and neglect, but has been rehabilitated as the result of a joint Syrian\u2013Russian restoration project and is flowing again as of 2019. Water from the spring is channeled into the 420 hectares (1,000 acres) of date palm and olive orchards surrounding the spring.\nHistory\nAccording to historian Micha\u0142 Gawlikowski, the maintenance of the spring was closely tied to the religious cult of ancient Tadmor (Palmyra to the Greeks and Romans and present-day English speakers):\nOne function of general interest was the\u00a0supervision of the\u00a0Efqa spring; the\u00a0'chief of the\u00a0spring' was chosen every year by the\u00a0god Yarhibol, probably through some rite of divination or drawing of sorts, and the\u00a0same god provided him testimony at\u00a0the\u00a0end of his term. In one case at\u00a0least, there were two chiefs at\u00a0the\u00a0same time...Duties of the\u00a0appointees were no doubt related to the\u00a0cult, but very likely they also supervised the\u00a0distribution of water in the\u00a0oasis, a\u00a0task of utmost importance that was strictly regulated until very recently.The channel into the mountain is  features \"small rock-cut chapels with incense altars (pyrat)\" for offerings to Yarhibol. In addition to the main Efqa spring, the water infrastructure of Tadmor used two other qanats,  underground channels fed by aquifer layers west and north of the oasis. These were possibly constructed under the emperor Hadrian, possibly with a grant from the emperor himself. One ran nine kilometers west to Riweisat, the other ran north and is called Biyar el\u2011Amye, which means wells of the blind.  In an addition to providing water for the settlement, the water was distributed to farms on the outskirts that grew grain and vegetables for wealthy residents; itinerant shepherds were periodically allowed to graze and glean the enclosed fields since the goat and sheep manure that came with the herd was valuable fertilizer for next year's planting.  There is also a second spring in the center of town but as of 1976 it was described as \"not very abundant\".\nIn addition to use as drinking water and for irrigation, the  waters of Efqa were used therapeutically\u2014the ancients carved benches in the stone basins containing the water so that they could bathe in the waters.\nWater profile\nThe spring water emerges from the vent at roughly 33\u00a0\u00b0C (91\u00a0\u00b0F). The mineralized water of the spring smells of hydrogen sulfide.\n",
    "2014 classical recording\nAfrica Express Presents... Terry Riley's In C Mali is a studio album released by Africa Express, a UK-based non-profit organisation. The album is a recording of Terry Riley's minimalist composition In C, with Malian and Western musicians playing on it. It was released through Transgressive Records on 24 November 2014.\nBackground and music\nIn C is a classical piece in the style of minimalism, composed by Terry Riley in 1964. It was inspired by modal jazz and the repetition found in African music. The piece begins with a droning pulse played on the note C. Then, an unspecified amount of performers select from one of 53 melodic segments, which they repeat for as long as they choose. This causes the phrases to interfere aleatorically, creating complex harmony and rhythms.\nThere have been many recordings of In C since the first in 1968, but In C Mali is the first African one. In C Mali was first initiated by the German conductor Andr\u00e9 de Ridder. It was recorded in Bamako, Mali, in 2013. The album was released in 2014, the fiftieth anniversary of In C's composition. It was released physically via Transgressive Records in 2015. Africa Express' rendition runs for 41 minutes. It keeps the same key elements of the original, but adds extra details, for example, flutes, strings, and a spoken word soliloquy (during which, the pulse stops). 17 musicians play on the album, consisting of both Malian and Western musicians (including Damon Albarn, Nick Zinner, and Brian Eno). The pulse is played on the balafon. Ridder served as the conductor.\nReception\nPaul Mardles of The Guardian gave the album four out of five stars, and praised the \"new details\" that give the recording its charm. Joe Tangari of Pitchfork rated the album 8.1 out of 10 points, praising its distinction from other In C recordings, and the ensemble's \"dynamic interplay\". The album received three-and-a-half out of five stars from Andy Beta of Rolling Stone. Mark Kidel of The Arts Desk gave the recording a perfect score, and wrote it may be the most \"exciting version\" of In C.\nPersonnel\nAdapted from Tangari 2015.\nAdama Koita\u00a0\u2013 kamel n\u2019goni\nAlou Coulibaly\u00a0\u2013 percussion\nAndi Toma\u00a0\u2013 percussion\nAndr\u00e9 de Ridder\u00a0\u2013 multi-instrumentalist, conductor\nBadou Mbaye\u00a0\u2013 percussion\nBijou\u00a0\u2013 vocals\nBrian Eno\u00a0\u2013 vocals\nCheick Diallo\u00a0\u2013 flute\nDamon Albarn\u00a0\u2013 melodica\nDefily Sako\u00a0\u2013 kora\nGuindo Sala\u00a0\u2013 imzad\nJeff Wootton\u00a0\u2013 guitar\nKalifa Kon\u00e9\u00a0\u2013 balafon\nModibo Diawara\u00a0\u2013 kora\nM\u00e9m\u00e9 Kon\u00e9\u00a0\u2013 balafon\nNick Zinner\u00a0\u2013 guitar\nOlugbenga\u00a0\u2013 vocals\n",

    "1993 studio album by Evan Parker\nConic Sections is a solo soprano saxophone album by Evan Parker. It was recorded on June 21, 1989, at Holywell Music Room in Oxford, England, and was released on CD in 1993 by Ah Um Records. In 2008, it was reissued by Parker's Psi label. The album is dedicated to the memory of Parker's friend Kunio Nakamura.\nAccording to Parker, the recording came about when he decided to document the current state of his playing, and impulsively contacted recording engineer Michael Gerzon, who managed to book the Holywell Music Room on short notice. However, he later recalled: \"The acoustics of the Rooms are so distinctive that I was pushed away from the kind of playing I'd had in mind; it seemed as though the room itself had something in mind too.\"\nReception\nIn a review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek wrote: \"This is an exhausting yet exhilarating set to take in at one setting; it changes the listener's reality, turns it inside out for over 70 minutes, and allows one to hear, as music, some rather confounding sounds and breathing techniques. Amazing stuff.\"\nMartin Longley of All About Jazz called the album \"a significant work,\" and stated: \"All of  tics have now been bound together into a merged voice, providing an alternative form of minimalism that can also be, upon tilting the ears, considered as maximalism... Parker's development of circular breathing techniques had now opened up the potential for marathon flowing.\"\nWriter John Fordham described the album as \"a remarkable exposition of  talents,\" and commented: \"Parker's achievement is to create a saxophone soundscape of completely personal materials, with little or no references to orthodox idioms, yet deliver it with such intensity - and sometimes ferocity - as to make its vocabulary and syntax utterly logical.\"\nWriting for Coda, Stuart Broomer remarked: \"the music gains from the room's very lively acoustics. Parker seems to be playing the room as much as he is playing the saxophone, and the room seems to be joining in, playing the saxophone and the saxophonist.\"\nIn an article for Paris Transatlantic, Nate Dorward wrote: \"this album marks the logical endpoint to Parker's solo music--he didn't record another until Lines Burnt in Light (2001), which just sounds like a footnote to this one \u2013 but it's still one of his most perfectly realized creations.\"\nTrack listing\n\"Conic Section 1\" \u2013 17:20\n\"Conic Section 2\" \u2013 11:10\n\"Conic Section 3\" \u2013 25:10\n\"Conic Section 4\" \u2013 9:10\n\"Conic Section 5\" \u2013 7:40\nPersonnel\nEvan Parker \u2013 soprano saxophone\n",
    "Carrozzeria Ala d'Oro was a short-lived Italian manufacturer of automobile bodies, which became known after the end of the Second World War primarily for bodies for sports cars. The company was closely linked to the aircraft manufacturer Officine Meccaniche Reggiane (OMR).\nHistory\nCarrozzeria Ala d'Oro was founded in 1947. It had its origins in the aircraft manufacturer Reggiane, founded in 1901, which had built successful combat aircraft before and during World War II. After Italy's defeat in 1943, Reggiane was banned from operating in the aviation sector by the victorious powers. In order to retain the expertise and skilled personnel from aircraft construction, Reggiane founded a company for the production of automobile bodies in 1947 on the initiative of the pilot and racing driver Franco Bertani, which was called Ala d'Oro (English: golden wing). The name was intended to allude to the company's origins in aircraft construction.\nThe Carrozzeria Ala d'Oro was housed in Reggiane's workshops in Reggio nell'Emilia. Bertani acted as owner. Numerous employees were taken on by Reggiane, among them the engineer Aurelio Lampredi and craftsmen who had special skills in the processing of aluminum sheets.\nAla d'Oro was only active for three years. At the end of the decade, the parent company Reggiane switched to building railway carriages. This area completely replaced aircraft production and was increasingly successful. In order to meet the personnel requirements, Reggiane gradually brought back the craftsmen from Ala d'Oro, so that Ala d'Oro had to stop building coachwork in 1949.\nThe name Carrozzeria Ala d'Oro has been used by a repair shop in Turin since 1973. There are no connections to Franco Bertani's company.\nVehicles with Ala d'Oro bodies\nCommercial vehicles\nOne of Ala d'Oro's main activities was the dismantling and conversion of military vehicles into civilian or commercial vehicles. This was a widespread business model in Italy in the immediate post-war period.\nSports cars\nIn addition to the (re)construction of commercial vehicles, Franco Bertani's company also built sports car bodies, although this only made up a small part of the production volume. Typical of the Ala d'Oro bodies were smooth car sides in the pontoon style and a sloping profile at the front and rear, reminiscent of an airplane wing. Ala d'Oro's bodies were considered aerodynamically advanced.\nStanguellini\nStanguellini 1100 Sport Barchetta (1947)\nImmediately after the start of operations, Franco Bertani made contact with the racing car manufacturer Stanguellini, for whose factory team he had competed in numerous races in the pre-war period. In 1947, Stanguellini launched the 1100 Sport, whose drivetrain and chassis technology was derived from the contemporary Fiat 1100. In the following years, the 1100 Sport models received bodies primarily from Bertone, Pininfarina and Motto, but at least two cars were also bodied by Ala d'Oro:\nA chassis received a Barchetta body with smooth flanks, vertical and horizontal chrome struts on the front section and a third headlight located in the middle of the car.\nThe 1100 Sport Berlinetta has the same bodywork, but a fixed roof with a four-part rear window.\nMaserati\nIn 1947, Ala d'Oro fitted one of the first chassis of Maserati's A6GCS series (chassis number 2003) with a closed Berlinetta body on a factory order. The body was designed as a hatchback coup\u00e9 with smooth sides. The wide, fully covered B-pillar continued seamlessly into the rear fenders. The A-pillar was exceptionally steep; the windshield was divided in two by a central bar. The doors were small, as were the side windows. The headlights were set into the front mask.\nMaserati's factory team took part in the Mille Miglia in May 1947 with this car and the drivers Luigi Villoresi and Guerino Bertocchi (starting number 222). The not yet fully developed car retired before the end of the race.\nAfter this race, the chassis received a new, open body, commissioned by a private customer. The Ala d'Oro body was destroyed in 1949.\nErmini\nErmini Fiat 1100 bodied by Ala d'Oro\nIn 1948, Ala d'Oro built a Barchetta for the Florentine racing car manufacturer Ermini, which was based on a Fiat 1100 chassis and had a Fiat engine reworked by Ermini. The car, with the chassis number 214184, had a flat pontoon-style body with a horizontal beltline and rounded front and rear sections. As was usual with Ala d'Oro, the headlights were set far down in the front mask. The cooling air opening was oval in shape and had a grille. Pasquale Ermini started with the car in the 1948 Mille Miglia. He did not finish; the car was badly damaged in an accident. Ermini sold the accident-damaged car to Camillo Rossi, who commissioned Carrozzeria Mariani to repair the body. Mariani designed a new front end with a square cooling air intake and a bulge above the rear wheels that interrupted the otherwise horizontal belt line. Rossi took part in the first edition of the Coppa della Toscana ",
    "Historic building in Hollywood, California, U.S.\nUnited States historic place\nThe Max Factor Salon, formerly the Hollywood Fire Safe Building and also known as the Max Factor Building, is a historic four-story building located at 1666 N. Highland Avenue, Hollywood, California, just south of Hollywood Boulevard. It is best known for its more than five decade tenant Max Factor, and is currently home to the Hollywood Museum and Mel's Drive-In.\nHistory\nThe Max Factor Salon was originally the Hollywood Fire Safe Building before it was bought by Max Factor in 1928.  The building was remodeled by renowned theater architect S. Charles Lee, and in 1935, it re-opened featuring a ground-floor salon, make-up manufacturing on the three floors above, and the Max Factor Make Up Studio in an added one-story wing. 3000 people were invited to the re-opening but more than 8000 attended, and after re-opening, the building earned the nickname the \"Jewel Box of the Cosmetic World\" and the make-up studio earned the nickname \"The Pink Powder Puff.\"\nVirtually all of Classic Hollywood's greatest starlets frequented the salon and make-up studio, including Lana Turner, Rita Hayworth, Claudette Colbert, Jean Harlow, Bette Davis, and more.\nIn 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, with Max Factor Salon listed as a contributing property in the district. In 1994, the building was declared Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #593.\nIn the early 1990s, The Max Factor Museum of Beauty occupied the building, the building itself owned by Procter & Gamble. The museum closed in 1996. In 2001, a Mel's Drive In opened in the building's one-story wing, with the Hollywood Museum occupying the rest of the building in 2002.\nIn 2011, the building held an I Love Lucy reunion to celebrate Lucille Ball\u2019s 100th birthday and the 60th anniversary of the show. In attendance were Lucille Ball's daughter Lucy Arnaz as well as many of the filmmakers who worked on the show.\nArchitecture\nThe Max Factor Building, a four-story brick and stucco structure, was remodeled in the early 1930s by S. Charles Lee, who also added a one-story wing. The remodel combined art deco and regency revival styles into a Hollywood look called Hollywood Regency.\nAspects of the building that define its look include street-to-roof fluted pilasters, curved display windows containing bronze, copper and pewter finished aluminum castings, bas-relief ornaments, art-deco rooftop ornaments, and an entrance and window cases clad in marble and decorated with medallions and garlands. Inside, the building features an art deco lobby that contains pastel hues, marble archways, trompe l\u2019oeil, faux finishes, and crystal chandeliers.\nThe Max Factor Building in Universal Studios Orlando was modeled after the Max Factor Salon, as was an unnamed one-story building in Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios.\n",
    "2024 single by Kelsea Ballerini and Noah Kahan\n\"Cowboys Cry Too\" is a song is a song performed by American singer-songwriters Kelsea Ballerini and Noah Kahan. It was released on June 28, 2024, as the lead single from Ballerini's forthcoming fifth studio album. Ballerini and Kahan co-wrote the song with Alysa Vanderheym, who also co-produced the track with Ballerini.\nContent\nBallerini wrote the chorus of \"Cowboys Cry Too\" in November 2023 on her back porch, before coming to the conclusion that the song needed a male's perspective to bring it to the next level. She first met Noah Kahan at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards on February 4, 2024, where he complimented her songwriting skills for her 2016 single, \"Peter Pan\", and she described their connection as \"songwriter synergy\". She later sent a DM to Kahan to suggest he collaborate on the track with her. He wrote his part while on tour, and the two united with Alysa Vanderheym in the studio to record the song shortly before they performed a mashup of \"Stick Season\" and \"Mountain with a View\" together on the 59th Academy of Country Music Awards on May 16, 2024.\nLyrically, the song is written from a female perspective addressing the concept of toxic masculinity, with Ballerini saying that \"in our world and culture and echo chamber of highlight reels and pretty things, sometimes real feelings start to feel like something you just set aside or push down to keep up. Especially the way so many men grow up, that kind of toxic masculinity mindset of 'saddle up, brush it off'. I wanted to write my perspective and essentially celebrate the vulnerable men in my life, and Noah adding his really unfiltered perspective into it just brought it to life in a more meaningful and beautiful way.\" She described the song as a way to honor \"the men in  life that are emotional\".\nBallerini announced that her fifth studio album was already finished at the time of the release of \"Cowboys Cry Too\" and that the song would be the only collaboration on the record.\nCommercial performance\n\"Cowboys Cry Too\" was the most-added song at the country radio format upon release, and debuted at number 27 on the Billboard Country Airplay dated for July 6, 2024, and at number 16 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart the following week. It debuted at number 50 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Ballerini's highest debut on the chart to date.\nCharts\n",

    "Russian ballet dancer (1934\u20132024)\nMarina Viktorovna Kondratyeva (Russian: \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0430; 1 February 1934 \u2013 8 July 2024) was a Russian ballerina at the Bolshoi Ballet. She is known for roles such as Juliet in Prokofief's Romeo and Juliet and as Giselle. She was also an influential teacher and choreographer.\nBiography\nKondratyeva was born on 1 February 1934 in Leningrad, the daughter of Viktor Kondratiev\u00a0 (1902\u20131979), a famous academic, doctor of physical and mathematical sciences, and winner of the Stalin Prize of the 1st class in 1946. She was recommended by Agrippina Vaganova to the Moscow Choreographic School, from which she graduated in 1952 from Galina Petrova's class. She was then hired by the Bolshoi ballet troupe, and trained by Marina Semionova exclusively. Her partners on stage were M\u0101ris Liepa, Nikolai Fadeyechev, Mikhail Lavrovsky, Boris Khokhlov, V. Tikhonov and Yaroslav Sekh, among others. She was described as \"weightless, airy, poetic and spiritual\", which served her well in roles such as Juliet in Prokofief's Romeo and Juliet and as Giselle. As Giselle, she developed the performance traditions of Galina Ulanova into a richer concept of the character. She appeared in a contrasting double role in The Stone Flower, as \"the sacrificial tender Katerina and the seductive treacherous Mistress of Copper Mountain\". She realised an exuberant Bacchante in Walpurgis Night, but also a \"passionate, rebellious and broken\" Anna Karenina.\nKondratyeva studied choreography further and graduated in 1980 from the Lunarchasky State Institute of Dramatic Art (GITIS) in Moscow. She began her teaching career at the Moscow Classical Ballet (now the Kassatkina and Vassiliov Ballet Theater). From 1980 to 1987, she taught at GITIS, as a docent starting in 1986. In addition to her work at the Bolshoi Ballet, Kondratyeva gave lessons at the Moscow Dance Institute, and between 1990 and 2000, she taught classical ballet at the Moscow State Academy of Choreography, where she was appointed professor in 1999.\nShe rehearsed with such ballerinas as Margarita Perkoun-Bebezitchi of the Classical Ballet Theater, and with artists from the Bolshoi studio of Yury Grigorovich. She became a ballet mistress and director in 1988. She staged Paquita's grand pas at the Bolshoi based on Marius Petipa's choreography and Perrot's Pas de Quatre from Anton Dolin's choreography.\nShe directed the women's classes at the Bolshoi and was a master tutor, saying in a 2006 interview that the goal was not imitation of a teacher but to fill a role with individual character. She prepared and followed the careers of great soloists such as Ludmila Semenyaka, whom she prepared for Les Sylphides, Galina Anna Antonicheva, Ekaterina Shipulina, Galina Stepanenko, Olga Smirnova, Natalia Osipova, Nadezhda Gracheva, Nina Kaptsova, and later Ioulia Stepanova, A. Tourazachvili, N. Biryukova, Nelli Kobakhidze, Chinara Alizade, Anna Tikhomirova, Joo Yun Bae, and Anna Okuneva. Described as \"soft-spoken, introverted, and gentle\", she transferred the traditions of the Bolshoi to her students in great detail.\"\nIn 2013, Kondratyeva was appointed a member of the artistic council of the Bolshoi Ballet troupe.\nKondratyeva died in Moscow on 8 July 2024, at the age of 90. Her burial place is Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.\n",
    "Artur Bernardes, victim of the fake letters\nThe crisis of the fake letters was a political scandal in Brazil in 1921 involving two disclosed letters containing offenses against the Brazilian military and Nilo Pe\u00e7anha. The letters were attributed to Artur Bernardes, then governor of Minas Gerais and a candidate for the 1922 presidential elections.\nThe scandal that ensued intensified the military's opposition to Bernardes, who went on to win the election in March 1922, but faced the tenentist movement during his government, the beginning of a process of political rupture in the First Brazilian Republic that culminated in the Revolution of 1930.\nThe case\nThe first letter, dated 3 June 1921, referred to marshal Hermes da Fonseca as a \"sergeant without manners\". It also called the banquet at which his candidacy for the presidency was launched as an \"orgy\", and said, regarding the military, that \"this scourge needs a reprimand to enter into discipline\". And continued: \u201cSee if Epit\u00e1cio  shows his vaunted energy, severely punishing these daring ones, arresting those who strayed from discipline and removing these anarchist generals to far away\". The second letter, dated 6 June 1921, referred to an extension of the Presidential Convention, \"because it should have been held before the arrival of Nilo , because as you said, this kid is capable of anything. Remove all difficulties as you see fit, without looking at expenses\".\nAfter the letters were published by Correio da Manh\u00e3, other newspapers began to give great attention to the subject. Debates in the Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies and Senate, as well as statements by politicians, military personnel and jurists regarding the authenticity of the letters were prominently publicized in the press.\nThe letters published by Correio da Manh\u00e3 were actually forged, as it later turned out, by Pedro Burlamaqui, Oldemar Lacerda and Jacinto Cardoso de Oliveira Guimar\u00e3es. Lacerda had obtained the papers with the Minas Gerais government letterhead from the State's Official Press. Burlamaqui brought the paper to Rio de Janeiro, and Guimar\u00e3es wrote the content, strictly imitating Artur Bernardes' handwriting. Once the letters were ready, Burlamaqui and Lacerda looked for friends and relatives of marshal Hermes da Fonseca to sell them, which did not happen. They then approached Artur Bernardes himself, proposing to sell the letters for 30 million r\u00e9is, but received another refusal. Lacerda then sought out Irineu Machado, a senator for the Federal District and opponent of Bernardes. The letters reached Correio da Manh\u00e3 through the senator, who appointed the newspaper's political writer, M\u00e1rio Rodrigues. The public registry office refused recognition of the letters because it found the signatures \"disparate\", but Correio da Manh\u00e3 still vehemently insisted on their authenticity.\nInvestigations\nArtur Bernardes vehemently denied the authorship of the letters at all times. In November 1921, a committee was formed at the Military Club for the expert examination of the documents. Correio da Manh\u00e3 appointed general Augusto Ximeno as an expert to the commission. Artur Bernardes appointed Afonso Pena J\u00fanior, Afr\u00e2nio de Melo and Raul Soares to provide the clarifications requested by the commission, and they appointed experts Sim\u00f5es Correia and general Alexandre Barbosa Lima to analyze the letters. The Military Club committee tasked Ant\u00f4nio Augusto de Serpa Pinto to carry out expertise analysis on the letters.\nSim\u00f5es Correia published his report, where he classified the documents as a fraud, \"in the circumstance that the paper used in the first letter did not yet exist on 3 June, the date that is in the letter in question, because it had been ordered from the Official Press on 8 June, according to the certificate\"; he also stated that, according to the examination of the spelling and its technical characters, it was a \"forgery by decal\". One of the clues that the letters were fake was in Artur Bernardes' signature, as the \"t\" was not cut in the letters, and all the documents indicated that Bernardes \"cut\" his \"t\". Another clue was the type of paper used, unlined. According to Bernardes, he never used this type of paper in his letters.\nIn January 1922, Edmundo Bittencourt, owner of Correio da Manh\u00e3, went to Europe to talk to experts. In France, expert Locard gave an opinion attesting to the authenticity of the signature. The director of the Institute of Political Science in Lausanne, Bischoff, was also heard and expressed his opinion on the falsehood. In Brazil, on 4 February 1922, Ruy Barbosa declared in his opinion that the letters were fake.\nShortly after the presidential elections, on 24 March 1922, Oldemar Lacerda and Jacinto Guimar\u00e3es confessed that they had forged the letters. In front of those present, they justified the forgery as having only a political purpose, despite trying to charge for them, in order to elect Hermes da Fonseca as president. Only",

Investigating phase separation and phase equilibria in porous materials, his 1999 study highlighted a solid understanding of pure adsorbates in simple geometries, and called for advanced models to address complex geometries, chemical and geometrical heterogeneity, and the largely unexplored phase separation in mixtures. In 2004, he co-authored a paper with T Schlick. The paper used transition path sampling to uncover the atomic and energetic details of the conformational changes in DNA polymerase \u03b2 that precede nucleotide incorporation, identified key residues and cooperative dynamics crucial for the enzyme's function and fidelity, and provided a protocol applicable to other biomolecular reactions. His 2006 collaborative study with C Alba-Simionesco investigated how confinement within various porous materials influenced the freezing, melting, and structural properties of adsorbates, highlighting new surface-driven and confinement-driven phases, as well as the effects on the glass transition.\nRadhakrishnan's 2010 paper investigated ErbB3/HER3 kinase activity, revealing its capacity for autophosphorylation and ATP binding despite structural differences, suggesting its role in signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer. Later, his 2014 study investigated the prevalence, prognostic significance, and therapeutic implications of ALK mutations in neuroblastoma, highlighting their association with poorer survival and potential for personalized treatment strategies based on mutation profiles. Moreover, in 2018, he analyzed how metastatic melanomas utilized exosomal PD-L1, influenced by IFN-\u03b3, to suppress CD8 T cell function, correlating levels with patient response to anti-PD-1 therapy and suggesting exosomal PD-L1 as a potential biomarker. In 2023, he explored how extracellular matrix stiffness promoted tumor progression by stimulating exosome secretion from cancer cells via an Akt-Rab8 pathway, and demonstrated that exosomes derived under these conditions enhanced tumor growth and activated Notch signaling in recipient cells, indicating a pivotal role for mechanical cues in regulating the tumor microenvironment.\nAwards and honors\n2015 \u2013 Fellow, American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering\n2021 \u2013 Fellow, Royal Society of Medicine\n2022 \u2013 Fellow, Biomedical Engineering Society\nSelected articles\nGelb, L.

    "\nThe term \"Western Pseudohistory Theory\" (simplified Chinese: \u897f\u65b9\u4f2a\u53f2\u8bba; traditional Chinese: \u897f\u65b9\u507d\u53f2\u8ad6; pinyin: X\u012bf\u0101ng w\u011bi sh\u01d0 l\u00f9n) is a catch-all term referring to a series of Russian inspired Chinese fringe theories that question the authenticity of Western history, and which generally hold that the histories of ancient Greece, ancient Egypt, and ancient Rome contain a large number of fabrications, or even that all of them are fabricated. Many elements of this theory are borrowed from Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko's new chronology theory, and have thus been traced back to French scholar Jean Hardouin. In 2013, after Chinese art scholar He Xin published his book Greek Pseudohistory Examination questioning the existence of ancient Greece, this theory gradually spread on the Chinese Internet. Chinese historiography and classics community either completely disagrees with this theory or simply does not want to spend time refuting these claims.\nHistory\nAt the end of the twentieth century, Russian mathematician Anatoly Timofeyevich Fomenko put forward some fringe theories in his books that questioned world history, for example, he argued that no artifacts had been found in Russia prior to the 10th century A.D., and therefore world history could not have predated the 10th century A.D. Fomenko's theory was heavily criticized by historians. An article in Xinmin Weekly, an article in Southern Weekly, and an article by Chow Hin in Orange News all cite Fomenko as one of the origins the theory, with the Xinmin Weekly's article going even further back to Jean Hardouin, a French scholar.\nIn 2013, He Xin published Greek Pseudohistory Examination, which claimed that there were a large number of fabrications in the history of Greece. In 2015, Du Gangjian put forward the theory of Out-of-Hunan, which argued that human beings did not originate from Africa, but from Hunan. In 2018, a documentary produced by Gleb Nosovsky made Fomenko's theories spread on the Chinese Internet, and in July 2019, the Chinese-British scholar Zhu Xuanshi said that there was no history of Europe before the 15th century, and that Western civilization had faked the three civilizations of ancient Greece, Egypt and Rome with reference to Chinese culture. The same year, Xiang Qianjing, the CEO of Beijing Tairen Classic Chinese Medicine Technology Co., Ltd, interested in the theory, funded and proposed to hold a \"Western History Falsification and Chinese Culture Renaissance Symposium\" every two years, which led to the further dissemination of the theory in China. In 2021, Huang Heqing, a professor of art history at Zhejiang University, stated in a lecture that the Great Pyramid of Giza and the Great Sphinx of Giza were fakes.\nDetail\nAncient Egpyt\nFomenko asserted that the pyramids were fabricated by the Egyptian government in 1901 using concrete blocks for the development of tourism because of small holes in the construction materials. Huang Heqing said in 2021 that the pyramids were fabricated by the Egyptians using concrete in order to \"belittle the Chinese civilization\".\nAncient Greece\nBilingual Iliad, in Greek and Latin\nIn 2013, He Xin published Greek Pseudohistory Examination. In the book, He Xin argues that Leontius Pilatus and Giovanni Boccaccio tampered with the original text of the Iliad in the course of translating it from Greek to Latin, commissioned by Francesco Petrarch, and that this tampered Latin translation became the reference text for later translations in other languages, and He Xin claims that this series of events was manipulated by the Freemasons. In addition, the existence of Aristotle has also been questioned, as He Xin argues that Aristotle himself did not exist, based on the fact that, due to the problem of transcription, Miao Litian, the author of the Chinese edition of the Works of Aristotle, has stated that some of Aristotle's writings may have been incorrectly copied by later generations. In 2017, Chen Ping, a professor at Fudan University, expressed his agreement with Fomenko and He Xin, and stated that due to the high value of papyrus and parchment, it is impossible for ancient Greek documents to have survived intact into the Renaissance, and therefore \"could only have been fabricated by people hired by Italian bankers during the Renaissance\". In addition, documents in Arabic introduced to Europe during the Renaissance were also thought to be non-existent, and Chen Ping believed that they were fabricated by the House of Medici.\nIn 2024, in an interview with Southern Weekly, Huang Heqing argued that ancient Greek sculpture and architecture were too fine, and also argued that ancient Greece at that time could not have had iron tools, so it was impossible to sculpt; while ancient Greece's rivals in this period were fabricated to play as a rivalry to Western history, for example, the temperature of the Iranian plateau was very high in the spring so that it was not possible to give birth to such a state as the Achaemenid Empir",
    "Danish writer and journalist\nEstrid Ott in girl guide uniform (1918)\nEstrid Ott (14 May 1900, Copenhagen \u2014 19 May 1967, Roskilde) was a Danish writer and journalist. From the 1930s, she published many popular books for girls reflecting  her keen interest in scouting and her extensive travels. Her Bimbi and Chico books for small children (1936\u201347) have been widely translated. In addition to some 80 titles for children, Ott is remembered for her play De Pokkers Unger (1945) which was filmed in 1947 as Those Blasted Kids.\nEarly life\nBorn on 14 May 1900 in Copenhagen, Estrid Ott was the daughter of the newspaper director Hans Christian Johannes Ott (1873\u20131906) and his wife Olga Juliette Marie n\u00e9e S\u00f8rensen (1871\u20131929), a writer. Even before she matriculated from Ingrid Jespersens Skole, Copenhagen, she had begun to gain experience as a professional writer.\nCareer\nKeen on scouting, from 1916 Ott edited the magazine Pigespejder (Girl Scouts). She had already published two children's books in 1917 and while at school she contributed articles of interest to young people to the newspaper Politiken. Her third book, Spejderminder (Memories of a Girl Guide) appeared in 1919.\nOn graduating from high school, she served an apprenticeship with the paper Vestjyllands Folkeblad before joining Berlingske Tidende as a foreign correspondent. She travelled widely but relying on her scouting background, she sought to show that as a girl guide she could always cope wherever she went.\nIn October 1922, she married the wealthy businessman John Knox Seith (1894\u20131959) who for a time worked for the Danish  East Asiatic Company. They had four children together: (BettY (1924), Joan (1928), Barbara (1929) and John (1931). The couple first spent a year in Finland then moved to the United States before returning to Denmark in 1933. They also spent a year in Greenland with their children. Ott also travelled to Africa, Portugal and Spain.\nOtt gained wide popularity for her stories for small children, especially the Bambi and Chico series, and for her books for teenage girls such as Bj\u00f8rne-Kari, which tells the story of the 14-year-old tomboy, Kari, who lives an exciting life in the mountains of Norway. Written for adults, her play De Pokkers Unger (1945) became successful as the film Those Blasted Kids in 1947.\nEstrid Ott died on 19 May 1967 in Roskilde, aged 67.\n",

    "Canadian physician (1963\u20132024)\nEilish Cleary (October 22, 1963 \u2013 March 22, 2024) was an Irish-born Canadian physician, health officer and public health advocate who served as the Chief Medical Officer of Health in New Brunswick from 2007 until her termination in 2015 under a controversial decision by the provincial government. Shortly before her dismissal, she was studying glyphosate, a herbicide that is used in the province and has been characterized as potentially being carcinogenic to humans.\nBorn in Dublin, Cleary became the country's youngest doctor upon graduating from Trinity College. She later moved to Canada where she served as a public health official in Manitoba before moving to New Brunswick to work there. After her termination, Cleary worked as a public health official for other provinces until her death in 2024 from ovarian cancer. She received multiple awards and honors throughout her career, including the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal as well as appointments to various institutions such as the University of Manitoba and the University of New Brunswick.\nEarly life and career\nEilish Cleary was born on October 22, 1963 in Dublin, Ireland, as one of five children born to John and Mary Cleary. At the age of 22, she graduated from Trinity College, becoming Ireland's youngest doctor at the time.\nPublic health career\nCleary and her family moved to Canada in 1998. She initially lived and worked in Manitoba, where she served as the public health officer for the North Eastman Regional Health Authority and afterwards for the province.\nPublic health in New Brunswick\nCleary later moved to New Brunswick, where she began serving as the Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health for the province on August 30, 2007, with the chief at the time being Wayne MacDonald. By August 2008, she was the acting chief, and by January 2009 she was the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Under this role, Cleary played an important role in the province's fight against the 2009 swine flu pandemic. At this time, New Brunswick placed second in the country in the percentage of population vaccinated against H1N1 with a vaccination rate of 40%.\nIn 2012, following growing public advocacy against the shale gas industry in the province, Cleary issued the 82-page Chief Medical Officer of Health's Recommendations Concerning Shale Gas Development in New Brunswick, a report about the negative impacts of fracking on public health, air, and water pollution. In May 2013, Cleary, under the request of then-health minister Ted Flemming, began studying the adverse effects of energy drinks on children. Between 2014 and 2015, Cleary made two trips to Africa to help local health officials deal with Ebola.\n2015 termination\nIn December 2015, it was revealed that Cleary was abruptly placed on leave and later terminated from her position by the provincial government, then under control of the Liberal Party led by Premier Brian Gallant. Shortly before her termination, the herbicide glyphosate had been labeled as \"probably carcinogenic to humans\" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Around this time, Cleary was studying the herbicide, which was used in the province by those working in forestry, farming, and military industries, along with corporations such as NB Power and J. D. Irving, who has voiced opposition against the proposal to ban it. According to John Chilibeck of the Telegraph-Journal, Cleary \"had told people her office was embarking on a study of the health effects of industrial herbicide spraying\".\nOn December 2, 2015, while Cleary was still on leave, Jacques Poitras of CBC News published an article about the incident in which he briefly mentioned that glyphosate, the herbicide which Cleary had been studying before her termination, was used by J. D. Irving and NB Power. Many individuals in the article's comments section insinuated that Irving had been involved with the dismissal. Two days later, J. D. Irving spokeswoman Mary Keith released a \"sharply worded\" statement in response, calling the article a \"sensational story\" and accusing CBC News of presenting \"an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory as fact,\" further claiming that CBC \"falsely implied that J. D. Irving, Limited (JDI) is or was involved in some sort of conspiracy against Dr. Cleary because JDI uses glyphosate\". In their statement, Irving also called for CBC to \"immediately remove the story from their website, publish a full retraction, and apologize for their appalling behavior\". Poitras responded back on Twitter with a tweet stating, \"We stand by our story.\"\nCleary's termination was strongly opposed and criticized by officials and public health advocates across Canada, and individuals from throughout the health sector called for her reinstatement. Officials who expressed their public support to Cleary included David Butler-Jones, Robert Strang, and her successor, Jennifer Russell. Her termination was also criticized by the Green Party of New Brunswick, with the",
    "Malaysian politician (1905\u20131959)\nIn this Malay name, there is no surname or family name.  The name Toh Muda Abdul Aziz is a patronymic, and the person should be referred to by their given name, Abdul Wahab. The word \"bin\" or \"binti\"/\"binte\" means 'son of' or 'daughter of', respectively.\nTan Sri Dato' Seri Haji Abdul Wahab bin Toh Muda Abdul Aziz (4 May 1905 \u2013 15 April 1959), also known by his title Dato' Panglima Bukit Gantang, was a Malaysian nationalist politician and barrister who became the 1st Menteri Besar of Perak from 1 February 1948 to 1 August 1957 and the first Secretary General of UMNO from 1946 to 1947. He was granted the Orang Besar Lapan title of Panglima Bukit Gantang, indicating that he was descended from monarchy and aristocracy in Perak. Notably, when he was admitted to the English Bar in 1930, he became the first Malay lawyer in the United Kingdom.\nEarly life and education\nOn 4 May 1905, Abdul Wahab was born in Sayong, Kuala Kangsar District. Teh Halimah, his mother, is the sole child of Dato Setia Bijaya Jeragan Abdul Syukor by virtue of his first wife. Toh Muda Abdul Aziz, his father, and Haji Mahmud Taib, his grandfather, were both titled Dato' Panglima Bukit Gantang. Of his fourteen brothers and sisters, Abdul Wahab is the second child. He had lived in Ipoh with his grandfather since he was a young boy.\nAbdul Wahab received his early education at the Pekan Baru Malay School in Ipoh from 1912 to 1913. He continued his education at SMK Anderson from 1915 to 1925. He studied English language and literature and completed his Cambridge IGCSE in May 1925. He opted to pursue law while studying abroad at the University of London's Inner Temple, where he was very involved in student societies from 1925 to 1930. He was called to the bar in 1930, becoming the first Malay lawyer in the United Kingdom.\nFrom 1927 to 1929, Abdul Wahab served as the Malay Students' Association (England) Honorary Secretary, and becoming their President in 1930. He was granted access to hear whole trials in English courts. He later passed University of London's bar examination and returned to Federated Malay States (FMS). Tunku Abdul Rahman, Raja Bot bin Raja Jumaat from Selangor, Nik Ahmad Kamil from Kelantan, Abdul Hamid Mustafa, and Syed Sheh Barakbah from Kedah were among his peers who studied in London. The Persatuan Drebar-drebar Melayu Perak (PDMPK) was founded by him in 1930.\nCareer\nAfter returning to British Malaya in 1931, Abdul Wahab started working for the government as a chamber officer in the Malaysian High Court for six months in the FMS. From 1931 to 1947, he was a practitioner in Ipoh. Tunku Abdul Rahman, reportedly referred to him as \"one of the powerful Malay leaders of the day.\" In 1932, he went on to start a private law practice in Ipoh with attorney J. Dunford Wood, and he became a guaman (assistant officer in charge of scheduling court cases).\nIn 1936, Sultan Iskandar of Perak bestowed Abdul Wahab the title Orang Kaya Kaya Panglima Bukit Gantang Seri Amar Diraja (Panglima Bukit Gantang), one of the eight important chiefs of Perak, succeeding his grandpa. Due to his advanced education, he was also nominated as one of the Perak State Council, Ahli Dewan Undangan Negeri (ADUN) Perak, from 1937 and 1941. In addition, he led the Persatuan Melayu Perak from 1939 to 1940. From 1942 to 1945, during the Japanese occupation of Malaya, he presided as a judge. On 27 January 1946, the nationalist Perikatan Melayu Perak (The Perak Malay League) was established in the state of Perak. Abdul Wahab and other members of the traditional-bureaucratic elite dominated the organisation, eventually becoming its president from 1946 to 1947.\nIn order to settle disputes between Malay groups and discuss their future, Pergerakan Melayu Semenanjung Johor President Dato Onn Jaafar suggested calling a congress of Malays on 24 January 1946. Melaka was proposed as the venue for the Malay convention by Abdul Wahab of Perak, Dr. Hamzah Abdullah and Dato Onn of Johor. The event was then moved to The Sultan Sulaiman Club in Kuala Lumpur, under the guidance of the Pergerakan Melayu Semenanjung Melaka. This Malay congress was arranged by Zaaba, who is also connected to the Persatuan Melayu Selangor, and Mohd. Yunus Hamidi, the Editor of the Majlis.\nAlong with Dato Onn Jaafar, he was also a key player in the attempt to create the UMNO political party. After the inaugural Assembly was held in Johor Bahru in May 1946, Dato Onn was chosen to be the UMNO's founder president and given the responsibility of setting up an executive committee. Abdul Wahab became the first UMNO Secretary General from 1946 to 1947, and he led move of the organisation's headquarters to Ipoh, Perak. Perak served as the administrative hub of UMNO until 1949, when Malays all over the Peninsula began to embrace the organisation. He later held other Executive positions, such as Secretary of Legal Affairs. He also led the demonstration against the Malayan Union.\nOn 1 Fe",

    "\nThe Tazalit attack, also known as the Tazalit massacre, occurred on October 6, 2016, when unknown jihadists attacked Nigerien forces at the Tazalit refugee camp in Niger, killing dozens of Nigerien soldiers. The attack was the deadliest attack on Nigerien forces so far during the jihadist insurgency in Niger.\nBackground\nJihadist groups from Mali have travelled through Niger and conducted attacks on Nigerien forces sporadically in the early and mid-2010s. These attacks mainly took place in Tahoua Region, on the Nigerien-Malian border, and took place when jihadists trafficked arms from Libya. Two main groups in the area that have attacked Nigerien forces in the past are Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb led by Abdelmalek Droukdel and Mokhtar Belmokhtar and elements of Al-Mourabitoun and MOJWA led by Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi (the future founder of Islamic State in the Greater Sahara). Sahrawi's forces and AQIM have been in open conflict since 2015, and Islamic State caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi recognized the creation of ISGS in October 2016.\nAt the time of the attack, the Tazalit refugee camp hosted 4,000 Malian refugees. Another area in Tahoua region had come under attack by unknown jihadists earlier that month, with no reaction from the Nigerien government.\nAttack\nThe perpetrators of the attack came from Mali, with 30 to 40 men arriving on board four vehicles and a motorcycle. The attackers arrived at the Tazalit camp at 2:22pm at October 6, and took place very rapidly. The jihadists drove their pickups directly into the camp's security post, machine-gunning the soldiers who had gathered for lunch. The soldiers were taken completely by surprise and were unable to fight back. Nigerien soldiers who survived the initial attack were finished off with a bullet to the head.\nThe attackers remained in control of the Tazalit camp for two hours. Civilians were not targeted in the attack, but the jihadists looted food stores, pharmacies, armories, and set fire to an ambulance before leaving. The jihadists took a Nigerien army vehicle, a UNHCR vehicle, and an ambulance with them when they fled. They fled northwest towards the Malian border.\nAftermath\nPerpetrator\nBoth AQIM and the newly-formed ISGS were suspected of the attack. Survivors of the attack stated that the perpetrators were Tuaregs. On October 7, the Nigerien Minister of Defense claimed that the High Council for the Unity of Azawad (HCUA) had participated in the attack. He attributed the attack to \"narco-terrorist groups\", and said that Nigerien authorities didn't distinguish between AQIM, Ansar Dine, and the HCUA. The Coordination of Azawad Movements, a coalition that includes the HCUA, denied the allegations. Investigations by Nigerien authorities pointed to Malian armed groups' involvement. A few weeks after the attack, local sources reported that armed groups based in Kidal Region, notably GATIA, had some of their militants attack the Tazalit camp. The perpetrators of the attack had a base in Ilamawan, near Midal, Tahoua Region.\nCasualties\nNigerien Prime Minister Brigi Rafini, Nigerien security officials, and UNHCR all stated that 22 Nigerien soldiers were killed in the Tazalit attack. Of the 22, 14 were national guardsmen, five were gendarmes, and three were soldiers. Five soldiers were injured, and only two or three soldiers managed to escape. One civilian was injured in the attack. The Tazalit attack was the deadliest attack by jihadists during the jihadist insurgency in Niger up to that point.  A two-day national mourning was declared by Nigerien president Mahamadou Issoufou on October 7.\nReactions and aftermath of Tazalit\nThe United Nations and African Union condemned the attacks. In November 2016, the Nigerien government dismantled the Tazalit refugee camp in accordance with UNHCR. All 4,000 refugees at Tazalit were moved to the Intikane refugee camp, where 18,000 refugees were already living. The majority of refugees moved to Intikane beginning on January 21, 2017, and ending on January 31, although those that stayed behind would no longer receive aid from UNHCR outside of identification cards and forming self-defense groups.\n",

    "Species of beetle\nCaccothryptus abboti is a species of minute marsh-loving beetle in the subfamily Limnichinae. The species was described alongside five other Caccothryptus species by Natural History Museum entomologist Keita Matsumoto in 2021, using specimens gathered in 1953 by Harry George Champion in Haldwani, India alongside an earlier 1925 specimen collected nearby. Like the other Caccothryptus species described by Matsumoto, it was distinguished from its original classification of C. testudo due to differences in the shape of its genitalia. One specimen collected by Champion was identified as the holotype for C. abboti and named for English radio presenter Nick Abbot.\nTaxonomy\nThe Limnichidae (minute marsh-loving beetle) genus Caccothryptus was first described by David Sharp in 1902. In 2014, the genus was divided into five species groups by Carles Hernando and Ignacio Ribera.\nA group of Caccothryptus specimens were collected in 1953 by forester Harry George Champion in the Haldwani division of the Kumaon Himalayas, India. These were labeled as C. ripicola and C. testudo, species which Champion had previously described in 1923. These were stored at the British Natural History Museum. In 2021, Natural History Museum entomologist Keita Matsumoto identified a number of distinct species from these specimens. One male specimen was labeled as the holotype of Caccothryptus abboti. C. abboti was placed in the species group C. compactus and named for English radio presenter Nick Abbot.\nDescription\nThe Caccothryptus abboti specimen has an elytral length of 3.21\u00a0mm, and an elytral width of 2.62\u00a0mm. Its prothorax measured 1.01\u00a0mm in length and 2.05\u00a0mm in width. C. abboti's body is enlongated oval, dark brown spare for reddish-brown tibia and patches of long setae, yellow along the underside and white on the dorsum. Its tarsi are divided into five segments, of increasing length, with the fifth segment as long as the others combined. It has long, narrow, light brown tarsal claws. The beetle's head, smooth and punctured, is slightly retracted into its pronotum, and features eleven-segment antennae. Little sexual dimorphism exists between the male and female specimens, beyond a longer fifth abdominal ventrite on the female.\nThe beetle's genitals display a number of differences from the original classification of C. ripicola, which enabled its classification as a separate species. C. abboti's aedeagus is long and highly sclerotised. It has an asymmetric apex on the median lobe. Their parameres are deeply curved along the top and slightly curve downwards from a side view. Between the parameres is a deep depression forming a rounded U-shape.\n",
    "Australian rugby league club\nThe Yanco-Wamoon Hawks are a rugby league club based in the town of Yanco, New South Wales, Australia. Founded in 1970, the Hawks compete in the Group 20 Rugby League competition, where they have won eight First Grade premierships, including five in a row from 1992 to 1996.\nHistory\nThe Yanco-Wamoon Hawks were founded in 1970, when the Wamoon RLFC, known as the \"Village\", merged with the Yanco club (who were in the Reserve Grade competition) and moved to the Yanco Sportsground after the ground was vacated by its defunct Australian Rules team the Yanco Penguins.\nWamoon had played in the Group 17 Rugby League competition, winning the premiership in 1947, before joining the Group 20 competition as one of its founding clubs in 1954.\nAfter the move to Yanco, the Hawks won the 1973 First Grade premiership with a 16\u201311 win over Tullibigeal-Euabalong-Lakes United in the Grand Final at the Griffith Exies Oval.\nAfter losing the 1975 final to Griffith, the Hawks won their second title of the decade in 1979 under the coaching of Bill Watson with a 19\u201314 victory over Griffith Waratahs.\nThe 1990s proved to be a golden decade for the Hawks, who won five titles in a row from 1992 to 1996, a Riverina Division record. Three of the deciders, from 1993 to 1995, were against the Griffith Waratahs, with the 1992 match being played against the Griffith Black and Whites and the final title of the run against Narrandera. The club then capped off the highly successful period with an eighth premiership in 2000 against Yenda, their last to date.\nThe Hawks then made one further Grand Final in 2005, losing to West Wyalong, before falling on difficult times. As a result, at the end of the 2011 season, the Hawks amalgamated with the Narrandera Lizards to form the Bidgee Hurricanes. The merged club was quite successful on-field, making the finals in First Grade and even winning an Under 18s premiership, however at the end of the 2014 season, the clubs de-merged, and Yanco-Wamoon returned to being a standalone club, while Narrandera re-formed on their own and joined Group 17 in 2018.\nIn 2024, the Hawks were forced to withdraw their First Grade team after three rounds due to a player number crisis in the district.\nPremierships\nFirst Grade\n1973 \u2013 Yanco-Wamoon vs.  TEL United (at Exies Oval; score: 16\u201311) coached by Bill Watson.\n1979 \u2013 Yanco-Wamoon vs.  Griffith Waratahs (at Leeton; score: 19\u201314); coached by Bill Watson.\n1992 \u2013 Yanco-Wamoon vs.  Griffith (at Leeton; score: 18\u201317); coached by Wayne Everett.\n1993 \u2013 Yanco-Wamoon vs.  Griffith Waratahs (at Narrandera; score: 14\u201310); coached by Wayne Everett.\n1994 \u2013 Yanco-Wamoon vs.  Griffith Waratahs (at Wade Park; score 32\u201310); coached by John Gutherson.\n1995 \u2013 Yanco-Wamoon vs.  Griffith Waratahs (at Griffith Exies; score 28\u201316); coached by Ken Kerr.\n1996 \u2013 Yanco-Wamoon vs.  Narrandera (at Leeton; score 21\u201320); coached by Wayne Everett.\n2000 \u2013 Yanco-Wamoon vs.  Yenda (at score 39\u201314); coached by Roy Jewitt.\nLower Grades\nReserve Grade: 1989, 1998\nLeague Tag: 2019\nUnder 18s: 1989, 1990, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2009, 2018\nUnder 16s: 1987, 1990, 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999\nSource:\nNotable Players\nKerry Hemsley\nKeith Outten\nBrendon Reeves\nSimon Gillies\nSean Watson\nTess Staines\nSee also\nGroup 20 Rugby League\nGriffith Waratah Tigers\nHay Magpies\nWest Wyalong Mallee Men\n",
    "Hungarian nobleman\nGotthard from the kindred Szolnok (Hungarian: Szolnok nembeli Got\u00e1rd; died after 1276) was a Hungarian noble in the middle of the 13th century, who served as vice-palatine in the court of rex iunior Stephen in 1264.\nCareer\nGotthard (or Gothard) was born into the gens (clan) Szolnok, but his parentage is unknown. He had two brothers, Alexander and Pousa. Their branch acquired lands in N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County around their centre B\u00e1gyon. The wider kinship divided their village B\u00e1gyon among themselves in 1260. Gotthard, his brothers and their cousin Teny\u0151 were granted one-third portion of the village near Palot\u00e1s and Gede.\nGotthard and his kinship swore loyalty to Duke Stephen during his internal conflict against his father, King B\u00e9la IV of Hungary. Gotthard was made vice-palatine in the court of the younger king shortly before the outbreak of the civil war between father and son. He is mentioned once in this capacity in 1264, serving under Palatine Denis P\u00e9c. Gotthard seated in Hatvan in Heves County, as Denis P\u00e9c exercised his rights of judging primarily in the southern parts of Stephen's kingdom. Gotthard was styled himself simply \"vice Dyonisio palatino in Hotwan residens\" during his sole surviving verdict. Tibor Sz\u0151cs argued Gotthard's role was not an occasional substitution but a permanent deputy of the palatine in the northeastern part of Stephen's realm.\nHe was still alive in 1276, when, alongside several members of the kindred including his adult sons, agreed to their relative Leustach to hand over the daughters' quarter (portions in B\u00e1gyon and Szabolcs) to his sister Elizabeth. The B\u00e1gyoni family descended from Gotthard, through two (Andrew and Dominic) of his six sons. His daughter was Elizabeth, who was granted her daughters' quarter (portion in B\u00e1gyon) from her brothers, Andrew and Kem\u00e9ny, in 1283. Her husband Ivan, son of Csernete sold the estate to Paul Gutai, thus part of the village was no longer in the hands of the Szolnok kindred. Andrew and Dominic was still alive in 1309. They and their sons were forced to agree to the sale because they could not afford to litigate.\n",
    "200th anniversary of Peru\nThe Bicentennial of Bolivia (Spanish: Bicentenario de Bolivia) is set to occur on 6 August 2025 and is considered in Bolivia to be the beginning of independence due to the Chuquisaca Revolution of 1809. In 2025, the bicentennial of the Bolivian Declaration of Independence will be celebrated in the same way. As part of the events for the bicentennial, on 31 August 2022, the Bolivian Bicentennial campaign was officially launched in the 9 departmental capitals of the country.\nBackground\nAct of independence of the Republic of Bolivia.\nThe Chuquisaca Revolution was the popular uprising against the governor-intendant of the city of Chuquisaca, currently known as Sucre, which occurred on 25 May 1809. The Real Audiencia of Charcas, with the support of the university faculty and pro-independence sectors, dismissed the governor. and they formed a governing board. The movement, loyal in principle to King Ferdinand VII, was justified by suspicions that the government planned to hand over the country to Infanta Carlota Joaquina de Borb\u00f3n, but from the beginning it served as a framework for the actions of the pro-independence sectors that propagated the rebellion to La Paz, where the Tuitiva Junta would be established. This last and most radical uprising was violently repressed, and the Chuquisaca movement was finally dissolved.\nThe independence of Bolivia was officially proclaimed on 6 August 1825 at a Congress held in the city of Chuquisaca (present-day Sucre).\nPreparation\nDuring 2009, the city of La Paz was declared Ibero-American Capital of Culture. La Paz celebrated the second most important festival of the Bolivian bicentennial. On 17 November 2020, President Luis Arce promulgated Law No. 1347, also known as the Bolivian Bicentennial Law. In this law, the years 2020 to 2025 were declared as the five-year period of preparations for the bicentennial of the founding of Bolivia.\nBicentennial legacy\nNotable government works, projects and programs projected for 2025 include:\n5 Houses of Memory in the departments of La Paz, Chuquisaca, Santa Cruz, Cochabamba and Oruro\nSee also\nBolivia portal\nBicentennial of Argentina\nBicentennial of Chile\nCelebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010\nUnited States Bicentennial\n",
    "German physician, geneticist and physical anthropologist\nHeinrich Wilhelm Poll (5 August 1877 \u2013 12 June 1939) was a German physician, geneticist and physical anthropologist. He studied hybridization, fertility, studies of twins, and the applications of genetics to society. He was an advisor for the committee for racial hygiene of the Prussian State Health Council and a member of the society for racial hygiene. He was forced to leave Germany in 1932 as a \"non-Aryan\" and died at Lund.\nLife and work\nPoll was born in Berlin to engineer Moritz and his wife Julie. Although the parents were Jewish he was converted to Protestantism in 1899. He grew up studying in Berlin and became interested in the natural sciences and after school at the Friedrich-Gymnasium, he went to study medicine from 1895 and passed the preliminary examination in 1897. His influences included the anatomists Wilhelm von Waldeyer and Wilhelm Krause. He worked as an assistant to Oscar Hertwig at the Anatomisch-Biologisches Institut in the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. His studies were on the adrenal gland and his doctoral dissertation was titled Veraenderungen der Nebenniere bei Transplantation (Changes to the Adrenal Gland in Transplantation, 1900). In 1902 he studied the structure and variation of the skull of humans (especially a large collection of skulls of the Moriori people from Chatham Island made by Hugo Schauinsland) and expressed doubts on the validity of the anthropometric method. He completed his habilitation in 1904 and have a public lecture titled Ueber die Bewertung anthropologischer Reihen (On the Evaluation of Anthropological Series). Unlike the usual practice of taking degrees in different universities, Poll completed all his studies at the University of Berlin. In 1907 he was a titular professor at Berlin and became an associate professor only in 1922. In 1913 he published a book Die Entwicklung des Menschen (The Development of the Human Being). During World War I he served as a field doctor. In 1924 he was appointed professor of anatomy at the University of Hamburg. In the 1920s he was particularly interested in the studies of twins, looking at the resemblance of fingerprints and other features among twins. Poll believed that fingerprints might reveal conditions such as mental illness. He also studied bird hybridization and fertility under Oscar Hertwig.\nIn 1932 he was reported by Heinz Lohmann as a \"non-Aryan\" and claimed to be incompetent. He was then forced to give up his academic position. He lived for a while in Berlin while his physician wife Clara tried to resume work as a gynaecologist. He had worked with the Rockefeller Foundation and was hoping for support from the US but was unable to receive any emergency assistance. He then moved to Sweden with support from Herman Nilsson-Ehle and Arne M\u00fcntzing to work at the University of Lund in 1939. He died of a heart attack shortly after reaching Lund. His wife Clara Poll-Cords reached Sweden a bit later due to bureaucratic delays and she committed suicide on August 5th, her husband's birthday.\nA stolperstein in front of the University Hospital at Hamburg-Eppendorf commemorates his life.\n",

Schaefer FAIA (April 15, 1925 \u2013 April 26, 2006) was an American architect in practice in Wichita, Kansas from 1957 until his retirement in 1993. Schaefer's practice, known since 2023 as Schaefer Architecture, has had a major role in the spread of modern architecture in Kansas.\nLife and career\nRobert Jules \"Schaef\" Schaefer was born April 15, 1925, in Wichita to Julius Earl Schaefer and Catherine Schaefer, n\u00e9e Rockwell. J. Earl Schaefer (July 11, 1893 \u2013 November 23, 1978) was a long-time Boeing executive who was general manager of Boeing's Wichita division from 1938 to 1957. Schaefer was educated in the Wichita public schools and at the University of Illinois, graduating with a BA in architecture in 1949. During World War II he had served in the air force. In 1950 he returned to Wichita, where he joined the office of Lorentz Schmidt, McVay & Peddie before moving to Ramey & Himes, later Uel C. Ramey & Associates, in 1951.\nIn 1957 Schaefer and another Ramey associate, Henry W. Schirmer, left to establish the independent partnership of Schaefer & Schirmer. Schaefer provided the firm's design leadership while Schirmer managed the office. The early work of the firm was influenced by the International Style and the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1960 they were joined by another former Ramey employee, Robert D. Eflin, and the firm was renamed Schaefer, Schirmer & Eflin. Eflin, who had worked for John Carl Warnecke in San Francisco after leaving Ramey, was enticed with a partnership in place of his plan to enter the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to earn his MArch. After the addition of Eflin, he and Schaefer shared design responsibilities with the lion's share going to Eflin. Schaefer, Schirmer & Eflin was the most assertive firm in Kansas in spreading modernist architectural principles. They introduced Brutalist architecture to Kansas with their Wichita Central Library (1967), which was the first and thus far only building in Wichita to earn a national design award from the American Institute of Architects. In 1970 Schirmer moved to Topeka, where he established a branch office of the firm. In 1971 Eflin made the decision to leave the firm to finally earn his MArch, and in 1972 the firm was reorganized as Schaefer, Schirmer & Associates PA. At this time John L. Greer AIA and Daniel S. Kirby AIA were made principals alongside Schaefer and Schirmer.\nIn 1976 Schaefer and Schirmer dissolved their partnership after nineteen years. Schaefer reorganized the Wichita office as Schaefer & Associates PA and Schirmer continued the Topeka office as a sole proprietorship. Over the next decade Schaefer completed major projects including the Mid-America All-Indian Center (1976) in Wichita and the Kansas Museum of History (1984) in Topeka. In 1984 Joseph A. Johnson AIA, Kenton L. Cox AIA and J. Samuel Frey AIA were made principals and the firm was renamed Schaefer, Johnson, Cox, Frey & Associates. Schaefer retired from his leadership role in 1993 but continued in a consulting role for over a decade.\nSchaefer joined the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1957 as a member of AIA Kansas. He was elected a Fellow of the AIA in 1981. His former partner Schirmer was also elected a Fellow in that year.\nLegacy\nThe firms led by Schaefer were frequently the recipient of design awards by AIA Kansas and other organizations. After 1993, Schaefer, Johnson, Cox, Frey & Associates was continued by Schaefer's fellow principals. It was renamed SJCF Architecture in 2011 and Schaefer Architecture in 2023. Later works of this firm include Exploration Place (2000), designed with lead architect Moshe Safdie.\nIn 2018, the Wichita Central Library was superseded as Wichita's main library by the Advanced Learning Library, leaving the old building vacant and vulnerable to demolition. As part of an effort to preserve the building, it was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places in 2020. The same year, the work of Schaefer, Schirmer & Eflin was the subject of an essay in the Regional Spotlight series of Docomomo US. The city has since solicited bids for the reuse of the library, but as of 2024 its future is undetermined.\nPersonal life\nSchaefer was married in 1949 to Yvonne Wooley, and they had three children, one son and two daughters. He was a parishioner and elder of the Eastminster Presbyterian Church in Wichita, the building of which he completed in 1966. In later life Schaefer suffered",

    "\n2014 studio album by Wand\nGanglion Reef is the debut studio album by American neo-psychedelia rock band Wand, released in 2014. The album has received positive reviews from critics.\nReception\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 3.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Fred Thomas writing that this is \"a nonstop parade of acid-dipped, pop-minded forays into both heaviness and wavy folk detours\" that shows a \"gift for songwriting  guides the endless psychedelic tug of war that is Ganglion Reef, offering listeners something turbulent and strange but deeply rooted in strong tunes\". Nina Corcoran of Consequence of Sound rated this album a B, characterizing this album as \"dressed in garage clothing, letting psych riffs wobble around in a single stained Converse and a muddy Doc Martens\", drawing on Are You Experienced? and Revolver. Editors at Pitchfork Media scored this release 7.4 out of 10 and critic Jason Heller called this release \"euphorically hypnotic\" due to vocalist Cory Hanson's delivery and he continued that the music differentiates itself from the larger field of contemporary psychedelic rock by writing that \"rather than wallowing in inner space, it\u2019s a gateway to other worlds, not so much an escape as an intrepid exploration\". In 2021, upon the release of Hanson's Pale Horse Rider, Uncut's Peter Watts gave a review to Ganglion Reef, scoring it an 8 out of 10 for being an \"excellent psych-rock and sludge debut... drenched in echo and reverb\".\nTrack listing\n\"Send/Receive (Mind)\"\u00a0\u2013 3:07\n\"Clearer\"\u00a0\u2013 3:34\n\"Broken Candle\"\u00a0\u2013 2:40\n\"Fire on the Mountain (I\u2013II\u2013III)\"\u00a0\u2013 5:07\n\"On Ganglion Reef\"\u00a0\u2013 0:19\n\"Flying Golem\"\u00a0\u2013 3:20\n\"Strange Inertia (Ctrl Alt Death)\"\u00a0\u2013 3:21\n\"6661\"\u00a0\u2013 3:42\n\"Growing Up Boys\"\u00a0\u2013 3:46\n\"Generator Larping\"\u00a0\u2013 6:08\nPersonnel\nWand\nEvan Burrows\u00a0\u2013 drums, mixing, audio mastering\nCory Hanson\u00a0\u2013 guitar, vocals, production, mixing, mastering\nLee Landey\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar, production, mixing, mastering\nDaniel Martens\u00a0\u2013 guitar, production, mixing, mastering\nAdditional personnel\nKevin Carle\u00a0\u2013 recording\nMartin Tryon\u00a0\u2013 mastering\nMeghan Tryon\u00a0\u2013 artwork\nAndrew Schubert\u00a0\u2013 recording\nSee also\n2014 in American music\n2014 in rock music\nList of 2014 albums\n",
    "\nMrs Gertrude Ferranti and Miss Caroline Haslett at the World Power Conference 1936British electrical engineer (1869 \u2013 1959)\nGertrude Ruth de Ferranti-Kirkwood (n\u00e9e Ince) (15 April 1869 \u2013 16 November 1959) campaigned for affordable and accessible electricity in the home, through her membership of the Electrical Association for Women and her work with her husband Sebastian de Ferranti. In 1936 she and Caroline Haslett were the only two women to attend the World Power Conference as representatives from the United Kingdom.\nEarly life\nGertrude Ruth Ince was born in Cardiff, Glamorgan on 15 April 1969. She was the second daughter of Zo\u00eb (n\u00e9e Buisson) and Francis Ince, a London based solicitor who co-founded S Z de Ferranti with Sebastian de Ferranti and Charles Sparks in 1885. She attended Hampstead High School with her sisters, coming home for lunch and tea. She was a young girl when her father brought Ferranti home for dinner and introduced her as \"the best looking in the family, but an awful little devil\". Ferranti was a regular visitor to the family home over the next years, and accompanied the family on holidays.\nWhen it was discovered that Gertrude needed to wear glasses, and was given a rather unflattering pair, Ferranti created a pair for her from gold plated piano wire, and then invented a machine to make further pairs and supplied a number of family and friends with similar pairs for many years.\nGertrude married Ferranti on 24 April 1888 at St Dominic's Priory Hampstead and they had seven children: Zo\u00eb Vanda Marie (1889\u20131978); Basil (1891\u20131917); Gerard Vincent (1893\u20131980); Vera Catherine (1898\u20131993); Yolanda (1902\u20131919); Denis (1908\u20131992) and Yvonne Teresa (1913-1988).\nElectrical engineering\nIn the early years of her marriage, Gertrude de Ferranti worked on the plans for Deptford Power Station with her husband.\nThe de Ferrantis installed an electricity plant at their home in Baslow Hall, which had an electric laundry and tennis courts lit by electric light. According to an article in the July 1927 issue of the Electrical Age for Women, Baslow Hall made use of waste heat and used hot water for energy storage. They also converted their seaside home in Deganwy into an all-electric house.\nIn 1928, Gertrude was elected Vice-President of the Electrical Association for Women and in January 1929 was elected President of the newly founded North Wales branch of the EAW. She was elected Chairman of Council in 1930. Gertrude was a member of the Royal Institution of Great Britain.\nAfter her husband's death in 1930, Gertrude supervised the conversion of Woodgreen Farm in Upper Basildon to electricity.\nWhen Gertrude de Ferranti attended the World Power Conference in Washington in 1936, she was described as a \"lady tycoon\" and the press noted that she was half-owner of Britain's largest privately owned electrical engineering organisation.\nLater life\nOn 26 August 1942, Gertrude married Lt Col James Kirkwood in Eldoret, Kenya. She died on 16 November 1959.\nCommemoration\nIn March 2024, Gertrude was commemorated with a virtual blue plaque as a key figure in the history of the Women's Engineering Society and the Electrical Association for Women.\nSee also\nCaroline Haslett\nWomen's Engineering Society\nElectrical Association for Women\n",

    "Indian actress and singer (born 1956)\nAny Piedade Josefa Quadros (n\u00e9e\u00a0da Costa; born 28 April 1956) is an Indian actress and singer known for her work in Konkani films and tiatr productions.\nEarly life\nQuadros was born as Any Piedade Josefa da Costa on 28 April 1956 in Calata, Goa, which was part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire. Her parents, Casmiro da Costa, a mechanic from Majord\u00e1, Goa, and Am\u00e9lia Marcelina Cota e Costa, a homemaker from Betalbatim, Goa, belonged to a Goan Catholic family and had settled in Calata. She was the fifth child among seven siblings: Tonny (born 1959), Maria (born 1953), Bosco (born 1958), Tereza (born 1954), Maria Arita (born 1949), Maria Aquilina (born 1947), and another unnamed child. Quadros embarked on her performing arts career in 1975, shortly after completing her Secondary School Certificate (SSC). During her time as a student, she had actively participated in various school plays, developing a passion for the stage. It was through a personal connection that she was introduced to the traditional Goan theatrical form known as tiatr.\nOn the 15 August 1975, Quadros marked her debut by assuming lead roles in two distinct tiatr productions, delivering them consecutively. During that era, the theatrical productions were commonly denoted as khell tiatrs and typically had a duration of approximately ninety minutes. In the play Darun Ostori, she portrayed a \"vamp\" character, while in the production Doth (Dowry), she depicted a character entangled in the issue of dowry, effectively conveying a range of emotions including sadness and anguish while on stage. Both plays, under the direction of R. Moraes, garnered critical acclaim and became popular among the audience. After her successful role in the acclaimed non-stop tiatr Doiall Kallzacho (Kind Hearted), under the direction of Patrick Dourado and with an all-female cast, she joined Rosario Rodrigues' theater troupe in 1978-79. Her performances in plays like Tum Aslo and Miss Aruna earned her acclaim and recognition during this period.\nCareer\nQuadros is a veteran performer on the Konkani stage, with a career spanning nearly four decades since the mid-1970s. Over the course of her career, she has embodied a diverse array of characters, encompassing roles like a widow, a troubled daughter-in-law, a champion of social causes, a nun, a legal representative, and a woman of wealth and privilege. Despite her versatility, she is known for her portrayal of the character Priti Mendonca in the tiatr (Konkani theater production) Amchea Gharant Tiatr (In Our House Tiatr), written by Prince Jacob in 2012. For more than twenty years, she has been a part of Jacob's ensemble, having become a member in the year 1987. Critics lauded her portrayal of Priti Mendonca, a character depicted as semi-literate, assertive wife, stringent mother, and excessively enthusiastic mother-in-law. Theater critic and writer Daniel F. de Souza lauded Quadros' interpretation of the character. Quadros' commitment to the role went beyond her performance, as she also contributed to designing the character's wardrobe to enhance the overall portrayal.\nQuadros is known for her acting and singing contributions. In 2011, she was cast in the tiatr Teg Bhav Deva Pav (Three Brothers, God Help Us) by Prince Jacob, portraying the character of Asuntin. The Times of India's Pio Esteves praised her portrayal of a mother in this production. She continued her tiatr work in 2013, appearing in two productions. In March of that year, she was cast in Simon Gonsalves' lenten tiatr Government of God, playing the role of the guardian character Sandra. She also sang as part of this performance. Later in December 2013, Quadros was featured in Prince Jacob's tiatr Pap Tujem Prachit Mhojem (Your Sin, My Suffering), where she took on the part of Goretti and contributed vocals. Quadros' tiatr acting resume expanded further in 2015 when she was cast in Simon Gonsalves' lenten production Jezuchem Povitr Rogot (Jesus's Holy Blood). For this work, she portrayed the role of Nacia, which The Times of India's Marcus Mergulhao described as an \"egoistic and unforgiving\" performance that delighted audiences.\nQuadros has appeared in several Konkani theater (tiatr) productions over the years. In August 2015, she was cast in the tiatr Mhojem Kalliz Roddtta (My Heart Cries) by George Dias, portraying the role of a mother. The following year, in April 2016, she was selected to play the role of a widow named Veronica in Prince Jacob's tiatr Kaxanvkar (Coffin Maker). Additionally, she contributed a song performance to the production. The writer and critic Michael Gracias praised Quadros' work in this tiatr. She continued her acting career in the tiatr medium, and in April 2017 she was cast in Jacob's tiatr Padri (Priest), where she played one of the lead roles of a widow named Angela. She also sang a song as part of this production. Most recently, in July 2018, Quadros was featured in the tiatr Tujem ",
    "\nThis is the list of United Kingdom MPs by seniority, 2024\u2013present. The Members of Parliament (MPs), who were elected in the 2024 general election and during the 59th Parliament, are ranked by the beginning of their terms in office in the House of Commons.\nCriteria\nThe seniority criteria used in this article are derived from how the Father of the House and Mother of the House are selected. They are not laid down in Standing Orders but arise from the customary practice of the House of Commons. The modern custom is that the Father and Mother of the House are the male and female MPs who have had the longest continuous service. If two or more members were first elected in the same General Election (or at by-elections held on the same day), then priority is given to the one who was sworn in first. The order of swearing in is recorded in the House of Commons Journal, the official record of proceedings.\nWhen a member has had broken service, that does not affect their seniority (for the purpose of qualifying as the Father of the House) which is based on the latest period of continuous service.\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in members, who abstain from taking their seats at Westminster, have never been sworn in. They are ranked (in this list) after all other members who have taken their seats. Between themselves, they are ranked by the first date of the election, for the current period of continuous service. If they are equal on that criterion, then they are ranked in alphabetical order by surname.\nSummary of members elected by party\nThis table relates to the composition of the House of Commons after the 2024 general election and summarises the changes in party affiliation that took place during the 2024\u2013present Parliament.\nThis table: viewtalkedit\nFor full details of changes during the 2024\u2013present Parliament, see By-elections and Defections, suspensions and resignations.\nList\nThis article assigns a numerical rank to each of the members elected in the 2024 general election and subsequent by-elections, except for those who were elected but never sworn in, who are displayed at the bottom without a number. \nMembers named in italics and shaded in pink are no longer sitting.\nSee also\nList of MPs elected in the 2024 United Kingdom general election\nList of United Kingdom by-elections (2010\u2013present)\nNotes\n^ Includes 43 MPs sponsored by the Co-operative Party, who are designated Labour and Co-operative.\n^ Some media sources, such as BBC News, listed Labour's total as 412, by including the Speaker (who, to demonstrate his neutrality, had resigned his Labour Party membership on taking office).\n^ In the current (2024 - present) Parliament, the seven members of Sinn F\u00e9in are expected to abstain; i.e., they will not take their seats in the House of Commons; the speaker and deputy speakers (expected to be two Conservative and one Labour) by convention exercise only a casting vote.\n",
    "Pakistan Air Force pioneer aerobatic and air commodore (1924-1969)\nAir Commodore Fuad Shahid Hussain SBt TPk (Urdu: \u0641\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0634\u0627\u06c1\u062f \u062d\u0633\u06cc\u0646; 20 July 1924 \u2013 9 April 1969) better known as FS Hussain, F.S., King of Fury, and the Prince of Pilots, was among the pioneering officers of the Pakistan Air Force, a fighter pilot, aerobatic pilot, and one-star rank air officer. During WWII, his squadron was part of the BCOF in Imperial Japan, stationed on an aircraft carrier. While there, FS as an aerial photographer, was tasked with capturing images of the bombed-out cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, unaware of the radiation exposure risks at that time, which eventually led to his death while in service, as Assistant Chief of the Air Staff (Training) at the PAF Headquarters.\nIn his early days as a Flying Officer, Syed Masood Akhtar writes that FS' remarkable mastery of low-level aerobatics became legendary in the RPAF. \u201cWhether he was flying a Hawker Fury just a few feet above the ground, kicking up dust on the runway with his propeller wash, or gracefully executing a B-point roll just above the treetops, he made it \"all seem like child's play.\u201d By the early 1950s, he was rapidly gaining fame throughout Pakistan and internationally as \"F.S.\", becoming a role model for fighter pilots in the RPAF.\nDue to his remarkable flying skills, FS was selected for a course at the Central Gunnery School Leconfield where he topped the Pilot Attack Instructors\u2019 Course as a Category \"A\" Pilot Attack Instructor in April 1949, setting a Commonwealth air-to-air and air-to-ground shooting record. The Commandant of the school lauded him, saying, \u201cThis officer who is a member of the Royal Pakistan Air Force, for combat flying, is outstanding in every way. He achieved the finest result in the air ever experienced in the Central Gunnery School, Leconfield England.\u201d\nOn 12 March 1950 at Risalpur, FS took off in a Hawker Sea Fury and performed an aerobatic display in honor of The Shah of Pahlavi Iran. The Shah who was an amateur pilot, was deeply impressed by Hussain's manoeuvres executed incredibly close to the ground, and requested for a personal meeting with FS and later ordered his court poet to write a poem in honor of FS.\nFS left a lasting impression at the Coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953, where his daredevil solo aerobatics enthralled the crowd. After the performance, former MRAF Arthur Tedder remarked, \u201cA generation of pilots is yet to be born, who will try to achieve the standards already perfected by Flt Lt FS Hussain of the RPAF.\u201d\nFS Hussain rose to fame once more on 22 December 1956, captivating the Karachi crowd with his signature slow roll and inverted pull-up performed at low altitude, flying solo at 600\u00a0mph. In the audience was China's Premier Zhou Enlai, who was on his inaugural official visit to Pakistan. Witnessing Hussain's spectacular aerobatics, Premier Zhou Enlai was so impressed that he requested Prime Minister H. S. Suhrawardy, for a personal meeting with F. S. Hussain to commend him for his extraordinary performance.\nEarly life and education\nFuad Shahid Hussain was born on 20 July 1924 in Lucknow to a noble Muslim family of the Qidwai clan and was the youngest of six children, three sisters and three brothers. His father, Shaikh Shahid Hussain Qadwai (1878-1924) was a respected Taluqdar of Ghadia district in British India and died shortly before he was born. Fuad's mother was Nisar Fatima.\nFuad received his early education from La Martini\u00e8re College, Lucknow.\nFamily history\nPortrait of Shaikh Shahid Hussain Qidwai (1878-1924), taken in 1914.\nFuad's ancestors, the Qidwais, migrated from Rum in the 14th century and colonised 52 villages in Lucknow district and Barabanki districts.\nFuad's father, Shaikh Shahid Hussain Qadwai was a prominent figure in British India and was a close associate of Motilal Nehru. Shaikh Shahid came from one of the oldest Muslim families of Oudh and was the chief representative of the Kidwai clan. After completing his Intermediate Examination at Canning College, Lucknow, Shaikh pursued higher education at the University of Cambridge, earning a B.A. and LL.B. with honors in 1903, and was called to the Bar the same year. Upon returning to India, he established a legal practice.\nIn December 1904, he was involved in organizing the Muslim Educational Conference in Lucknow, for which he received a gold medal. By 1908, he was elected Honorary Joint Secretary of the British Indian Association, a position he held for years. Shaikh represented the Muslims of Oudh in the Local Legislative Council and was a member of various boards, including the Municipal Board of Lucknow, the Boards of Management of Canning College, Colvin Talukdars' School, and Medical College, as well as the Advisory Committee of the United Provinces. Additionally, he served as Director of the Upper India National Bank Limited, and the Baib & Wood Pulp Manufacturing Company, Limited, Lucknow. As a Taluqdar, he made improvements in his role as",
    "Video game\n2024 video game\nOne Million Checkboxes was a free web-based incremental game created and developed by American software engineer Nolen Royalty in 2024. The game consisted of a web page containing one million checkboxes, which visitors could check or uncheck. All visitors saw the same state of the checkboxes, leading them to interact with each other by checking and unchecking the same boxes. \nOn July 11, 2024, Royalty announced on X that all the boxes had been unchecked, but that once a box was checked and left that way for a certain period of time, it would freeze, effectively sunsetting the site. Approximately four hours later, Royalty said that the game was over, as every box had been checked.\nGameplay\nOne Million Checkboxes was a simple website that contained only one million checkboxes, with users able to check or uncheck the boxes by clicking or tapping. Players saw the same checkboxes and could watch as boxes they checked or unchecked changed from the interactions of other players. Some of the boxes had different colored outlines, which served no particular purpose. The page displayed the overall number of checked boxes and the specific player's own count of boxes they had checked and unchecked. Later on, additional statistics were posted to a separate page, albeit without labels and simply called \"some numbers, updated sometimes\".\nGameplay in the Safari browser on an iPhone\nAs thousands of players began to participate, different behaviors emerged. Some players checked as many boxes as they could, while others behaved competitively to uncheck as many boxes as they could. Players also used the checkboxes to write messages or make creative designs. Bots were developed to check and uncheck boxes at high speed.\nDevelopment\nRoyalty developed One Million Checkboxes over two days after a conversation with friend Neal Agarwal, inspired by frivolous websites from the early days of the Internet. He bought the URL for $10 and coded the site in Python. Royalty first shared the game on social network X on June 26, 2024, and it quickly went viral through social networks X and Mastodon, and through website Hacker News. Because of the game's rapid uptake, Royalty had to quickly and repeatedly add server capacity and dealt with multiple website crashes.\nReception\nAs of July 3, 2024, Royalty estimated that 400,000 unique people have visited One Million Checkboxes. Writing for The Washington Post, Shira Ovide called it \"fantastic\" and referred to it as \"the most pointless website on the planet.\" Writing for The New York Times, Callie Holtermann said that it became \"an unintentional case study in internet behavior\" and that it \"cycled rapidly through the stages of internet maturity, serving as something of a microcosm of the joys and horrors of digital life.\"\n",
    "For the cave in Denbighshire, see Ffynnon Beuno and Cae Gwyn Caves.Church in Gwynedd, Wales\nSt Bueno's Church is a place of worship located in the village of Clynnog Fawr, Gwynedd, Wales. It belongs to the Church in Wales, an Anglican denomination, and is one of six churches in the parish of Bueno Sant Uwch Gwyrfai. It is adjacent to St Beuno's Chapel, to which it is connected, and approximately 322 metres (352 yards) north-east of Ffynnon Beuno (Beuno's Well). Beuno was a seventh-century Welsh abbot who founded a clas on the site of the present church and was later buried there.\nThe church is significant for its architecture and fittings, and has been described by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales as \"one of the most notable  in North Wales\". \nAdministration\nThe church is one of six in the parish and benefice of Bueno Sant Uwch Gwyrfai, the other five being Christ Church, Penygroes; St Gwyndaf, Llanwnda; St Aelhaern, Llanaelhaearn; and St Twrog, Llandwrog. The parish is within the synod of Bangor, the archdeaconry of Bangor, and the diocese of Bangor.\nHistory\nThe earliest parts of the current church are the chancel and transepts, which date from c.\u20091480 and must have been completed by 1486, the date which appears on stained glass formerly in the east window. The nave was built soon afterwards, in c.\u20091500, but the fact it is an addition is clear from the fact that the external plinth and string course of the transepts are visible on its interior east wall. The north porch was probably built shortly after the nave, and the vestry, west tower, and St Beuno's chapel probably date from the early sixteenth century. The tower and chapel are similar in style and have uncusped window tracery similar to that of the tower of Bangor Cathedral, which was completed in 1532. The passage between the tower and chapel probably dates from the early seventeenth century.\nFfynnon Bueno\nThe well is located on the outskirts of the village, south-west of the church. It consists of a rectangular pool enclosed by a roughly dressed stone wall.\nSee also\nList of churches in Gwynedd\nList of Church in Wales churches\n",
    "\nMilitary unit\nThe 2nd Gwent Battalion was a Welsh 'Pals battalion' formed as part of 'Kitchener's Army' during World War I. Raised by local initiative in Monmouthshire and Brecknockshire, it became the 11th (Service) Battalion of the local regiment, the South Wales Borderers ('11th SWB'). It served in 38th (Welsh) Division and led the division's costly attack on Mametz Wood during the Battle of the Somme. The battalion continued to serve on the Western Front, including the Third Battle of Ypres. It was disbanded early in 1918, but many of its personnel remained together for a few weeks in a composite battalion that saw action at the Battle of Estaires in April 1918.\nRecruitment\nAlfred Leete's recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army, and the newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward to form the 1st New Army ('K1'). A flood of volunteers poured into the recruiting offices across the country and were formed into 'Service' battalions of the county regiments and the 'first hundred thousand' were enlisted within days. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'. K2, K3 and K4 followed shortly afterwards.\nHowever, these were soon joined by groups of men from particular localities or backgrounds who wished to serve together. Starting from London and Liverpool, the phenomenon of 'Pals battalions' quickly spread across the country, as local recruiting committees offered complete units to the War Office (WO). One such organisation was the 'Welsh National Executive Committee' (WNEC). On 28 September 1914 David Lloyd George addressed a meeting of representatives from all over Wales, at which the committee was formed to seek permission to form a complete Welsh Army Corps of two divisions.  The WO accepted the WNEC's proposal on 10 October and enrolment began. The '1st Gwent' battalion began recruiting in November at Brecon, the regimental depot of the South Wales Borderers (SWB), and the 2nd Gwent on 5 December, when Major Herbert Porter, a retired officer of the Indian Army, was appointed as commanding officer (CO) of the 2nd Gwent with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. By then the SWB had already raised six service battalions for K1\u2013K4, and volunteers were becoming harder to obtain. When the 2nd Gwent, now the 11th (Service) Battalion, SWB, moved to Old Colwyn on 9 January 1915 it was still only 100 strong. Recruiting continued in Monmouthshire and Brecknockshire, and particularly at Pengam, and it began to pick up, 180 men coming in on 19 January, allowing B Company to be formed. The battalion also obtained 100 Welsh recruits from Liverpool.\nTraining\nThe rush of Kitchener recruits had overwhelmed the Army's ability to absorb them, so the Pals Battalions of  the Fifth New Army, 'K5' were left for some time in the hands of the recruiting committees. Until khaki cloth could be supplied, most of the men recruited by the WNEC were clothed in the grey Welsh cloth known as Brethyn Llwyd. At Old Colwyn the 11th SWB joined 130th (3rd Welsh) Brigade of 43rd Division (1st Division, Welsh Army Corps), serving alongside 17th (S) Bn, Royal Welsh Fusiliers (2nd North Welsh) (17th RWF), 10th (S) Bn, SWB (1st Gwent), and 16th (S) Bn, Welsh Regiment (Cardiff City). In April 1915 the Fourth New Army (K4) was converted into reserve units for K1\u2013K3, and the K5 formations took over their numbers: thus 130th Bde became 115th Bde in 38th (Welsh) Division on 29 April; at the same time the over-ambitious plan for a complete Welsh Army Corps was abandoned. By now the 11th SWB had completed its fourth company and had obtained a number of former Regular Army men to serve as warrant officers. Battalion training and selection of specialists such as signallers was proceeding well. But with units scattered across North Wales there was no opportunity for divisional training. However, in the summer the division began to concentrate around Winchester, with 11th SWB joining at Hazeley Down in August. The division trained for open warfare on the Hampshire downland, leaving trench warfare to be learned when the troops reached the Western Front. It was not until November that enough rifles arrived for all the men to undertake their musketry course.\n38th (W) Division was now warned for service on the Western Front. Lt-Col Porter was not fit for overseas service and was transferred to command the 14th (Reserve) Bn SWB. He was replaced as CO by Major J.R. Gaussen, from 3rd Skinner's Horse of the Indian Army. On 3 December 11th SWB left Hazeley Down for Southampton and crossed to Le Havre that night, landing the following day. It then went by train to join the divisional concentration at Aire on 6 December and ma",

    "7.75 Ms earthquake in Yunnan, China\nThe 1733 Dongchuan earthquake affected Yunnan in China on August 2. The earthquake, which had an estimated surface-wave magnitude of 7.75, damaged homes across the province.\nGeology\nThe Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang Fault is a major sinistral strike-slip fault system in China that runs along the southeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. It comprises the Xianshuihe, Anninghe-Zemuhe, Xiaojiang and Daliangshan faults. The Xiaojiang Fault Zone represents the southeastern part of the Sichuan\u2013Yunnan tectonic block's eastern boundary. The Sichuan\u2013Yunnan block's southwestern margin is represented by the Jinshajiang and Red River faults. The Xiaojiang Fault Zone is seismically active, having been associated with over ten earthquakes greater than magnitude 6.0 since 1500. This includes a Ms\u202f 8.0 earthquake in 1833.\nEarthquake\nThe earthquake produced an 82\u00a0km (51\u00a0mi) surface rupture along the eastern segment of the northern Xiaojiang Fault Zone. It extended north\u2013south from Shiliping to Tianba. It was also associated with a depression about 2\u20133\u00a0km (1.2\u20131.9\u00a0mi) long and 200\u2013300\u00a0m (660\u2013980\u00a0ft) across, bounded by vertical escarpments measuring 5\u201310\u00a0m (16\u201333\u00a0ft). Approximately 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) of sinistral offset represented the largest strike-slip displacement from the earthquake. Vertical offsets were exclusively recorded south of the Dongchuan basin. Earthquakes of such magnitudes have an average return interval of 2,000 to 3,000 years.\nImpact\nIn Qiaojia, 16 civilians were killed by rockfalls when the town was destroyed. In a military camp, 50 soldiers escaped unhurt while one soldier died from a toppled beam at another campsite. Cui Naiyong, an official in Dongchuan, said about 40 people died in the larger towns of Bigu, Awang and Xiaojiang. He added that most homes, constructed of wood, rarely killed their inhabitants when they collapsed. In the Tangdan mines near Bigu, Cui reported a staggering death toll as each of the several hundred mines contained hundreds and thousands of workers at the time of the earthquake. These mines likely collapsed, killing those inside. Only a handful of people managed to escape from the mines. At Huize, temples and administrative buildings were razed, nearly all fortification along the north and south city walls were destroyed. Forty percent of the battlements on the eastern and western part of the city were also destroyed. Landslides at Mushulang dammed the Yinghe River for three days.\nSee also\nList of historical earthquakes\nList of earthquakes in China\nList of earthquakes in Yunnan\n",

In 2009 she debuted in the Cosmos Troupe's performance \"Amour, it's something like...\" and was later assaigned to the Star Troupe. She graduated at the top of her class.\nIn 2013, Rei was featured in NEW GENERATION III. Same year, had her first lead role in a newcomer performance (\u65b0\u4eba\u516c\u6f14) \"Rom\u00e9o et Juliette\" as Romeo, after which had another two newcomer leads.

    "Species of beetle\nCaccothryptus arakawae is a species of minute marsh-loving beetle in the subfamily Limnichinae. The species was described alongside five other Caccothryptus species by Natural History Museum entomologist Keita Matsumoto in 2021, using specimens gathered by Martin J. D. Brendell at Kathmandu, Nepal in 1983. Six of Brendell's specimens were distinguished from its initial classification of Caccothryptus testudo due to distinct genital structures. The species was named for Hiromu Arakawa, the creator of manga series Fullmetal Alchemist.\nTaxonomy\nThe Limnichidae (minute marsh-loving beetle) genus Caccothryptus was first described by David Sharp in 1902. In 2014, the genus was divided into five species groups by Carles Hernando and Ignacio Ribera.\nA group of Caccothryptus specimens were collected in 1983 in Kathmandu, Nepal by Martin J. D. Brendell, curator of Coleoptera Department of Entomology at the Natural History Museum, London. These were labeled as C. ripicola and C. testudo, first described by forester Harry George Champion in 1923. These were stored at the Natural History Museum. In 2021, museum entomologist Keita Matsumoto identified a number of distinct species from these specimens. A male specimen from Kathmandu was labeled as the holotype for Caccothryptus arakawae. Five specimens (comprising three males and two females) were labeled paratypes. C. arakawae was placed in the species group C. testudo and named for Japanese manga artist Hiromu Arakawa, the creator of Fullmetal Alchemist.\nDescription\nThe Caccothryptus arakawae specimens identified by Matsumoto have elytral lengths of 3.39\u20133.68\u00a0mm, and elytral widths of 2.32\u20132.52\u00a0mm. Their prothoraces are 0.90\u20131\u00a0mm in length and 2.03\u20132.11\u00a0mm in width. C. arakawae has an elongated oval body, brown in colour except for reddish tibia and long, white setae, which are distributed across both the upper and lower sides of the beetle. Its tarsi are divided into five segments, of increasing length, with the fifth segment as long as the others combined. It has long, narrow, light brown tarsal claws. The beetle's head, smooth and punctured, is slightly retracted into its pronotum, and features eleven-segment antennae. Little sexual dimorphism exists between the male and female specimen, beyond a longer fifth abdominal ventrite on the female.\nThe beetle's genitals display a number of differences from the original classification of C. testudo, which enabled its classification as a separate species. C. arakawae's median lobe narrows to a slightly pointed tip. It has a U-shaped depression between the V-shaped notches on the tip of the genitalia. The genitals' dorsum are wavy, forming two concave curves. Females have a long ovipositor.\n",

    "1974 studio album by Jean Shepard\nI'll Do Anything It Takes is a studio album by American country singer Jean Shepard. It was released in July 1974 by United Artists Records and was her twenty first studio album. The album was a collection of 11 tracks, which featured subjects about romance and devotion. It was reviewed by various music publications following its release, including AllMusic, which rated it three out of five stars. Two singles were included on the album that reached the US country songs top 20: the title track and \"At the Time\".\nBackground, recording and content\nOne of the first women in country music to become commercially successful, Jean Shepard had continued success for 20 years between the 1950s and 1970s. In the early part of the 1970s, she moved from Capitol Records to United Artists Records. The production and story lines found within her music changed from honky tonk towards subjects of devotion. This allowed Shepard's commercial success to continue into the 1970s when country was moving towards pop-inspired trends. Such themes were subjects of songs such as 1974's \"I'll Do Anything It Takes (To Stay with You)\", which inspired her album of the same name. I'll Do Anything It Takes were recorded in sessions held between 1973 and 1974. The album project was produced by Larry Butler. I'll Do Anything It Takes was a collection of 11 tracks. Like the title track, the song \"At the Time\" also had themes centered around devotion. Also included were cover tunes such as \"Silver Threads and Golden Needles\" and \"He Thinks I Still Care\".\nRelease and critical reception\nI'll Do Anything It Takes was released by United Artists Records in July 1974. It was the twenty first studio album in Shepard's career and second with the label. It was distributed as both a vinyl LP and a 8-track cartridge. Six tracks were included on \"side one\" and five tracks were included on \"side two\". It was given reviews from music magazines and websites following its release. Cashbox called it \"A must for all her fans and a definite programming super-package.\" Record World magazine called it \"a superb listening experience\" that \"will be a delight to programmers everywhere.\" Greg Adams of the online website AllMusic rated I'll Do Anything It Takes three out of five stars. He compared the song choices and production to that of Tammy Wynette and found songs like \"At the Time\" to express \"extreme devotion\".\nChart performance and singles\nI'll Do Anything It Takes reached the US Billboard Top Country Albums chart following its release, peaking at the number 21 position in late 1974. It was among her final albums to chart the US country survey during her career. Two singles were included on the album. Its lead single was \"At the Time\", which was issued by United Artists in February in 1974. It rose to the top 20 of the Billboard country songs chart, peaking at number 13 in 1974. It also made Canada's RPM country songs chart, peaking at number 24 around the same time. In May 1974, the title track was issued as the next single. It was Shepard's second top 20 single in a row on the US country chart, climbing to the number 17 position.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAll credits are adapted from the liner notes of I'll Do Anything It Takes.\nMusical personnel\nTommy Allsup \u2013 Bass guitar\nStuart Bascore \u2013 Steel guitar\nHarold Bradley \u2013 Bass guitar\nJimmy Capps \u2013 Rhythm guitar\nChuck Cochran \u2013 Piano\nJim Colvard \u2013 Lead guitar\nJim Isbell \u2013 Drums\nThe Jordanaires \u2013 Vocals\nBob Moore \u2013 Bass\nCarol Montgomery \u2013 Vocalist\nBilly Sanford \u2013 Lead guitar\nJean Shepard \u2013 Lead vocals\nHenry Strzelecki \u2013 Brass\nTechnical personnel\nLarry Butler \u2013 Producer\nHarold Lee \u2013 Engineer\nChart performance\nRelease history\n",

    "Proposed successor state to the current France Fifth Republic\nThe Sixth Republic (French: Sixi\u00e8me R\u00e9publique) is a potential successor to the present republican system in France, proposed as a solution to alleged issues of the current Fifth French Republic.\nFollowing 82.6% of voters supporting Charles de Gaulle's proposal in the constitutional referendum, the Fifth Republic was established on 4 October 1958 under the Constitution of the Fifth Republic. While the Fourth Republic was a parliamentary republic, the Fifth Republic is a semi-presidential republic with a powerful presidency able to force through legislation without the consent of parliament.\nThe Fifth Republic has received various criticisms from some politicians and scholars, such as maintaining a poor or incorrect delineation of powers between the presidency and the legislature, with some describing the system as a presidential monarchy or as hyperpresidential.\nBackgroud of the Fifth Republic\nMain articles: French Fifth Republic and May 1958 crisis\nWithin the late 50's, France was experiencing instability as the Fourth Republic began decolonisation. This resulted in protests among the pieds-noirs and French Army, particularly in the context of the Algerian War, which resulted in the attempted Algiers Putsch of 1958.\nDespite having retired from politics a decade earlier, Charles de Gaulle, placed himself in the midst of the crisis when he called on the nation to suspend the government and create a new constitution. With parliament was unable to choose a government in the midst of popular protest, De Gaulle was carried to power when the last parliament of the Fourth Republic voted for its own dissolution and the convening of a constitutional convention.\nOn 1 June 1958, Charles de Gaulle was appointed head of the government; on 3 June 1958, a constitutional law empowered the new government to draft a new constitution of France. Designed by De Gaulle and drafted by Michel Debr\u00e9, the new constitution saw a greatly empowered president, with the Prime Minister being appointed by the president, and accountable to both them and the Parliament. The constitution was put to referendum in 1958, and achieved 82.6% of voters support.\nThe constitution included various provisions to allow the president to force through legislation, such as Article 49.3 of the Constitution, which has been used 100 times Between 4 October 1958 and 6 May 2023.\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was initially a leading critic of the establishment of the Fifth Republic, likening it to the 1851 French coup d'\u00e9tat by Louis Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte. Mitterrand would publish many of his criticisms of the new constitution, as well as Charles de Gualle, in the Permanent Coup of State\u00a0. Mitterand would later give some legitimacy to the Fifth Republic when he was elected president.\nAdvocacy for a new republic\nLate 20th centuary\nIn 1992, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, Marie-No\u00eblle Lienemann and Julien Dray founded the Convention for the 6th Republic, a group within the Socialist Party (PS) advocating for constitutional reform. M\u00e9lenchon promoted the return of strong legislature by weakening the executive powers held by the president.\nWhile campaigning for the 1995 presidential election, Jean-Marie Le Pen's included National Front's support for a Sixth Republic. Under Marine Le Pen the party has rebranded as National Rally and since distanced itself from the policy.\n2002 election\nIn the 2002 presidential election, part of Christiane Taubira's platform included support for a Sixth Republic, emphasising that it should decentralise power to French territories, and that it should abolish the position of Prime Minister.\nLeft Front and La France Insoumise\nIn the 2012 presidential election, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, having left the PS and formed the Left Party (PG), ran under the Left Front platform, which supported the formation of a Sixth Republic\nIn 2014, Movement for a Sixth Republic released an open letter calling for a Sixth Republic and gained over 100,000 signatures. Both M\u00e9lenchon, as well as \u00c9ric Coquerel Coordinator of PG stated that support for a new republic couldn't come from any singular party, but had to build up broad consensus\nIn the leadup to the 2017 presidential election, M\u00e9lenchon running under his new La France Insoumise (LFI) and endorsed by PG, held a march for the Sixth Republic in Paris during his campaign.\nIn the 2022 presidential election, M\u00e9lenechon ran again as the LFI candidate, and once more supported the formation of a new republic.\nNUPES and the New Popular Front\nFor the 2022 legislative election, the New Ecological and Social People's Union (NUPES) was formed as a joint left-wing slate of candidates between parties such as the PS and LFI. M\u00e9lenchon, the founder of LFI, was considered a leading figure within NUPES, and support for a Sixth Republic was included on the alliance's platform. This policy was carried onto NUPES' successor, the New Popular Front, going into the 2024 legislative election.\n2023 ",
    "\nEvents in 1874 in animation.\nEvents\nDecember 9:  In 1874, Jules Janssen made several practice discs for the recording of the passage of Venus with his series Passage de V\u00e9nus, which he intended to record with his photographic revolver. He used a model of the planet and a light source standing in for the Sun. While actual recordings of the passage of Venus have not been located, some practice discs survived and the images of one were turned into a short animated film after the development of cinematography. The images were purportedly taken in Japan by Janssen himself and the Brazilian engineer Francisco Ant\u00f4nio de Almeida by using Janssen's photographic revolver.The revolver could take several dozens of exposures at regulated intervals on a daguerreotype disc. The Janssen revolver was the instrument that originated chronophotography, a branch of photography based on capturing movement from a sequence of images. To create the apparatus Pierre Janssen was inspired by the revolving cylinder of Samuel Colt's revolver.\nSpecific date unknown\nOne of the earliest examples of three-dimensional scientific visualisation was Maxwell's thermodynamic surface, sculpted in clay in 1874 by James Clerk Maxwell.

    "Novella by Stephen King\nDanny Coughlin's Bad Dream is a novella by Stephen King, first published in 2024 as part of King's collection You Like It Darker.\nPlot summary\nDanny Coughlin is a high school custodian in Manitou, Kansas. He has a vivid dream in which he walks behind a derelict Texaco gas station to find a mongrel dog gnawing on a hand projecting from the ground. While at his job at Wilder High School, Coughlin uses clues from his dream to locate the gas station on the Internet. That Saturday, Coughlin drives to Gunnel in the far north of Kansas, where he finds the gas station, dog, and hand, exactly as in his dream. Coughlin covers the hand with a trash can to protect it from the dog, then purchases a prepaid cell phone, which he uses to anonymously report the body to the Kansas Highway Patrol. The body is discovered by police, who identify it as Yvonne Wicker, a young woman who was raped and murdered.\nThe following Friday, Coughlin is visited by the arithmomaniac veteran inspector Franklin Jalbert and his younger colleague Ella Davis of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, who have traced his call. Jalbert and Davis disbelieve Coughlin's explanation, suspecting him of the murder. They take a cheek swab from Coughlin to compare his DNA with that found on the corpse, and execute search warrants on his truck and trailer. The search of Coughlin's truck finds no evidence of Wicker's body having been in the truck.\nOn Saturday, Coughlin attends a police interview, accompanied by his lawyer, Edgar Ball. During the interview, Davis unsuccessfully bluffs that Wicker's fingerprints were found in Coughlin's truck. Coughlin surrenders his phone to the police to enable them to track his movements over the prior weeks; Ball realizes that the police do not know exactly when Wicker was killed. After Jalbert and Davis again urge Coughlin to admit his guilt, he urges them to find the real killer. Jalbert remains convinced that Coughlin is the murderer, while Davis begins to harbor doubts.\nOn Tuesday, Coughlin is named as the murder suspect in the Plains Truth, a free newspaper. On Wednesday, he is fired from his job at Wilder High School. On Thursday, he is confronted by Jalbert while shopping in the IGA. On Friday, a brick with a threatening note is thrown at Coughlin's trailer. On Sunday, Coughlin's neighbor Bill Dumfries advises him that the other residents of the trailer park want Coughlin to leave; he resolves to move to Colorado near his brother.\nAs Jalbert grows frustrated, his arithmomania becomes more severe; he visits Coughlin during his final day of work at Wilder High School and plants drugs in his truck, then arranges for a Kansas Highway Patrol officer to stop and search Coughlin's truck. Coughlin grows suspicious when Jalbert parks behind the school and removes the drugs before they can be found. Coughlin gives the drugs to Davis and urges her to find out who leaked his name to the Plains Truth. Davis interviews Peter Andersson, editor of the Plains Truth, who plays her a recording of the anonymous tip-off he received; the voice is disguised using a vocoder, but Davis recognises Jalbert when he impulsively utters the word \"fifteen\" during the call. Confronting Jalbert about planting the drugs and tipping-off the newspaper, Davis urges him to step back from the case and retire; Jalbert initially refuses, but eventually announces he will retire.\nAfter more newspapers identify Coughlin as a suspect, he is shot in the abdomen by Yvonne Wicker's brother Albert. While hospitalized, Coughlin is visited by Davis, who tells him that a serial killer named Andrew Iverson has confessed to the murder. Jalbert, unwilling to accept Coughlin could be innocent, rationalises that Coughlin and Iverson were partners-in-crime, and resolves to kill Coughlin himself, distracting the police by calling in an anonymous bomb threat at the high school. Coughlin has a premonitory dream in which Jalbert attacks the hospital, firing shots at the nurses station before shooting Coughlin. He phones Davis, who intercepts Jalbert outside the hospital; the former partners hold one another at gunpoint. After a nurse attempts to restrain Jalbert, he disables her, but then shoots himself. Davis apologises to Coughlin and asks him if he knows why he had the dreams; Coughlin replies that he does not know, and that \"belief is hard\".\nPublication\nKing was inspired to write Danny Coughlin's Bad Dream after thinking \"what would happen if a man had a single psychic flash  that showed him where a body was buried  would they think he was the killer?\" The character of Jalbert was inspired by, and named after, the fanatical police inspector Javert from the 1862 Victor Hugo novel Les Mis\u00e9rables. Danny Coughlin's Bad Dream was published in May 2024 as part of King's collection You Like It Darker. It is the longest story in the collection.\nReception\nReviewing You Like It Darker for The New York Times, Gabino Iglesias described Danny Coughlin's Bad Dream as ",
    "First Moroccan summiter of the Seven Summits\nBouchra Baibanou (born 1969, Rabat) is a Moroccan alpinist and motivational speaker. She is the first Moroccan woman to summit Mount Everest, and in 2017 she became the first Moroccan to complete the Seven Summits.\nBiography\nBaibanou grew up in Rabat, the daughter of a mechanic and a stay at home mother. As a young girl, she loved karate and reading Jules Verne novels. After going trekking at summer camp aged 10, she fell in love with the outdoors. Originally wanting to be an astronomer, she turned to studying physics at Mohammed V University when her visa was refused. She later received a degree in telecommunications engineering at the National Institute of Posts and Telecommunications (INPT) in Rabat.\nIn 1995, when Baibanou was 25, she climbed her first peak, Toubkal (4,167 metres ), the tallest peak in the Atlas Mountains. The experience encouraged her to continue mountaineering.\nIn 1999, she and her husband Lahoucine Ouboumalk climbed Toubkal again for their honeymoon.\nIn 2002, she and her family moved to Canada where she pursued a degree in management from HEC in Montreal, Canada. After returning to Morocco, she worked as a software engineer for the Moroccan Ministry of Equipment, Transport and Logistics.\nIn 2009, she established Delta \u00c9vasion, offering hikes around Morocco for tourists and to support local people. While taking international tourists on treks across Morocco, they would tell her about climbing trips to Mont Blanc, Kilimanjaro and the Himalayas. Their stories piqued her interest, and gave her the thought to begin climbing outside Morocco.\nMountaineering\nIn March 2011, she summitted Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895 metres ) while on an expedition with her husband. At Kiliminjaro, she met Singaporean alpinist, Khoo Swee Chiow, who invited her to climb Mont Blanc (4,810 metres ). After training with Chiow, in June that year, she reached the summit.\nAfter climbing Kiliminjaro and Mont Blanc, at age 42 she decided to pursue the Seven Summits, to reach the highest point on each continent. Next, she climbed Mount Elbrus in June 2012, Aconcagua and Denali in June 2014 and then Puncak Jaya in November 2015.\nWhile climbing, Baibanou's husband Houcine would watch their daughter when on expeditions. Baibanou is a practicing Muslim and wears a headscarf by choice, as well as during her climbs. While advocating for women's and gender equality with her climbs, she does not consider herself a \"feminist\" instead defining herself as a \"free woman\".\nIn April 2017, she launched an expedition to Mount Everest, her second to last peak for the seven summits. On May 21 at 9 in the morning, she reached the summit, becoming the first Moroccan and North African woman to do so.\nIn December 2018, she reached the summit of Antarctica's Mount Vinson, her final peak to complete all seven summits.\nIn reaching the top, she became the first person from Morocco to complete the seven summits, and only the second Arab woman to do so.\nAfter the Seven Summits\nIn 2020, she turned to mountaineering full time, teaching climbing and motivational speaking. She is a member of the Royal Moroccan Federation of Skiing and Mountain Sports and is the president of \u00ab\u00a0Delta Evasion\u00a0\u00bb, a project to develop mountain sports in Morocco.\nIn 2021, Baibanou published My path to the seven summits of the world French: Mon chemin vers les sept sommets du monde).\nAfter completing the Seven Summits, Baibanou continues to climb, in an effort to inspire young Arab girls to achieve their dreams. On April 28, 2022, she reached the summit of her second eight-thousander, Annapurna I (8,091 metres ), one of the most challenging peaks in the Himalayas. She was the first Arab woman to reach the summit.\nIn 2023, she headed back to the Himalayas. In April she summitted Ama Dablam (6,814 metres ) and in May, she headed to her third eight-thousander, Lhotse. She reached the summit on May 21, at age 54.\nAwards and honors\nShe received the Order of Ouissam Alaouite from the Moroccan King Mohammed VI in August 2015.\n",

The museum has many displays of historical artifacts from the city and its surrounding areas, which tells stories about the history of Kyiv.\nHistory\nThe museum was first completed in November 1978, and soon opened its first sections by early 1979. At the time, the museum mainly had archaeological collections from the Institute of Archaeology in Soviet Ukraine, including currency artifacts, cultural objects, old paintings, and postcards.\nIn a few years, the museum's collection expanded to about 36,000 items, and needed a larger space. The museum soon moved to a new location at Klov Palace, and reopened in 1982.\nThe museum remained at the palace for over 20 years, and had a total of 18 halls for exhibitions. The museum became a major cultural institution in Kyiv. On August 11, 2003, the Cabinet of Ukraine passed decree No. 506, which made the palace the new location for the Supreme Court of Ukraine. The museum soon closed by March 2004, and re-opened later that year at the Ukrainian House.\nBy June 2012, the museum was again closed for relocation.

    "Mary S. Owens (September 29, 1808, Green County, Kentucky \u2013 July 4, 1877, Weston, Missouri) was Abraham Lincoln's fianc\u00e9e for a time after the 1835 death of Ann Rutledge. To his surprise and mortification, she rejected his reluctant proposal.\nLife\nMary Owens\nShe was the daughter of Nathaniel Owens, a prosperous planter who owned a plantation in Green County, Kentucky.\nHer sister Elizabeth \"Betsey\" Abell was a friend of Lincoln's in New Salem, Illinois. She introduced Lincoln to Mary Owens when she came to visit in 1833, with an eye to playing matchmaker. After Owens went home, Lincoln said he \"would marry Miss Owens if she came a second time to Illinois.\"\nWhether he was in earnest or merely joking, Owens did return in the fall of 1836, putting Lincoln in an awkward situation. Her appearance had, in his eyes, deteriorated significantly in the intervening years; in an August 16, 1837, letter to Eliza Browning, he described Owens unflatteringly: \nI knew she was over-size, but she now appeared a fair match for Falstaff; I knew she was called an 'old maid,' and I felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the appelation ; but now, when I beheld her, I could not for my life avoid thinking of my mother; and this, not from withered features, for her skin was too full of fat to permit its contracting in to wrinkles; but from her want of teeth, weather-beaten appearance in general, and from a kind of notion that ran in my head, that nothing could have commenced at the size of infancy, and reached her present bulk in less than thirtyfive or forty years; and, in short, I was not all pleased with her.\nIn an attempt to get out of his predicament, he wrote letters to Owens in which he presented himself and Springfield (having moved there in April 1837) in as unfavorable a light as he could.\nFinally, doing the honorable thing, he proposed to her. To his surprise, she rejected him, again and again, as he tried several times. Lincoln had an odd reaction:\nI finally was forced to give it up; at which I very unexpectedly found myself mortified almost beyond endurance. I was mortified, it seemed to me, in a hundred different ways. My vanity was deeply wounded by the reflection that I had been too stupid to discover her intentions, and at the same time never doubting that I understood them perfectly, and also that she, whom I had taught myself to believe nobody else would have, had actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness.\nIn early 1838, Owens returned to Kentucky. She married Jesse Vineyard (1808\u20131862) in 1841. The couple eventually settled in Weston, Missouri. Jesse Vineyard and his brothers John and Bryce were members of the congregation of the Pleasant Ridge United Baptist Church in Weston, and the trio founded Pleasant Ridge College about a half a mile south of the church. (She herself is interred in the church's cemetery.) Mary and Jesse's sons fought in the American Civil War on the Confederate side.\nWilliam Herndon, Lincoln's former law partner and biographer, tracked Owens down. She informed him that \"Mr. Lincoln was deficient in those little links which make up the great chain of woman's happiness\".\nPainting\nReynolds Jones was commissioned by the Chicago & Illinois Midland Railway Company to create an oil painting; it depicts Lincoln sitting on the ground observing Owens arriving in New Salem and walking past him. A print was used for the company's 1951 calendar. The painting was acquired by the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in 2013.\nFilm and television depictions\nShe was played by Catherine Burns in the miniseries Lincoln in the 1975 episode \"Prairie Lawyer\". A much distorted Mary Owens is a character in the 2012 comedy-horror film Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies.\n",
    "Portuguese politician (Born 1934))\nMaria Francelina dos Santos Chambel (born 1934) was one of the first five female mayors of municipalities in Portugal, taking up her position as mayor of Sardoal in the Santar\u00e9m District in early January 1977 and remaining in that position until 1993.\nEarly life\nChambel was born on 4 August 1934 in Miranda do Corvo in the Coimbra District of Portugal. At the age of six her family moved to the Portuguese capital of Lisbon where she would later obtain a managerial position in the Social Security office. In Lisbon, she met and married Jos\u00e9 Chambel Dion\u00edsio, who came from Sardoal. They had four children.\nPolitical career\nFollowing the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974, which overthrew the Estado Novo dictatorship, women had the opportunity to stand for election. Although she was still working in Lisbon, her husband and his father felt that her managerial experience would make her an ideal mayor, and nominated her for the election. She had no expectation of winning as she was up against a candidate who lived in Sardoal, and she has admitted to having given no consideration to the implications for her four children of moving from Lisbon to Sardoal if she won.\nWith no funds for printing of leaflets, she and her supporters carried out door-to-door campaigning. She was successful in the election and became one of the so-called \"Magnificent Five\", the first five women to be elected to lead a local authority in Portugal, the others being Alda Santos Victor, Lurdes Breu, Judite Mendes de Abreu and Odete Isabel. At the time, few women held managerial positions in the country and few went into politics. Unlike Chambel, many of those that did faced considerable sexism. She faced no hostility because of her sex but some criticism because she was an outsider and had defeated someone who came from the town.\nFaced with limited resources and a municipality in poor condition, Chambel initially concentrated on improving the water supply and the sewerage system. Subsequently, she oversaw improvements in the electricity supply, and construction of a fire station, a health centre, social housing and schools. She won five successive elections and held the position as mayor of Sardoal until 1993, first as an independent supported by the Socialist Party (PS). Ten years after her first election she joined the PS after repeated requests by the then president of Portugal, M\u00e1rio Soares. Between 1992 and 1994 she was an advisor to the National Education Council of Portugal, having been nominated by the National Association of Municipalities.\nAwards and honours\nChambel was made a member of the Order of Prince Henry, receiving the award from the president Jorge Sampaio.\n",

She has four siblings: Gabriel, Israel, Laura and Daniel. Due to the fact that her unusual name was not allowed at the time, she did not have a legal name for the first three months of her life until another name was added as per the judge's request. She is of Jewish descent on her father's side.\nShe lived in Argentina until 1982, when her father\u2014a textile engineer and business consultant\u2014moved the family to Peru after an inconvenient with one of his companies in the country changed his plans to move to Israel as he had originally planned. Two of the family's children remained in the country, already married by then. Due to the armed conflict in the country, her parents briefly returned to Argentina, but returned soon after.\nCareer\nGomelsky started her modelling career in Peru, after an Argentine presenter told her mother that she had the looks to start working in the industry. Her mother, a redhead, had once been a model for L'Or\u00e9al, and reluctantly started accompanying her to auditions at casting agencies.\nIn 1990, she auditioned for a children's TV programme at PANTEL after already rejecting three casting calls at the insistence of her friend and fellow Yanbal\u00a0 model, M\u00f3nica Santa Mar\u00eda, who had already been accepted. Due to her insecurities regarding her appearance, she arrived wearing casual clothing and no makeup in order to not be accepted. After reading La Cucarachita Martina, a children's book, and singing a Xuxa song, she was sent to an office to sign a contract for the show, which became known as Nubeluz. One of the show's two original presenters, she was nicknamed the Dalina grande.\nOn March 13, 1994, Santa Mar\u00eda, who had been struggling with depression, committed suicide after an argument with her boyfriend, Constantino Heredia. In an 2024 interview with Ver\u00f3nica Linares, Gomelsky recalled that Santa Mar\u00eda called her phone in Miami the night prior to her death about her sadness over another argument with Heredia. Gomelsky suggested that she fly to the US, where she could relax and go shopping with her and co-star Lilianne Braun, with whom she was vacationing. Santa Mar\u00eda agreed and bought the plane tickets. After becoming aware of her suicide, they immediately returned to Peru through an 11 a.m. flight, arriving at 3 p.m. and attending the wake at the Virgen de F\u00e1tima Church in Miraflores and the funeral in La Molina. Gomelsky was tasked with the announcement of her death in Nubeluz, and remained on the show until March 1995, when a spin-off series, Almendra, began with her as the presenter, airing until October 1997.\nIn 2001, she returned to Peruvian television to star in Red Global's Algo en com\u00fan. In 2006, she opened a beauty salon.\nIn 2010, Gomelsky and Braun starred in \u00a1Gr\u00e1ntico, P\u00e1lmani, Zum!, a live show commemorating the 20th anniversary of Nubeluz. Six years later, another anniversary show took place at the amphitheatre of the Park of the Exhibition, also featuring fellow co-star Xiomara Xibill\u00e9. A final show, Nubeluz, la despedida, was announced in 2024.\nPersonal life\nGomelsky has remained in regular contact with Santa Mar\u00eda's family after her death in 1994, who have continued to grant the rights of M\u00f3nica's image for Nubeluz's anniversary shows.\nHer first marriage was to the Spaniard Marcelo Serrano, which lasted for seven years until their amicable divorce. After her divorce, she dated Tito Awe for eight years until the couple's marriage on June 5, 2004. The couple has two children: Macarena and Rodrigo, having suffered a miscarriage prior to her daughter's birth.\nIn August 2022 she was the subject of a minor controversy after complaining on her Instagram page about the two-hour wait caused by the check-in procedures for foreign arrivals at Jorge Ch\u00e1vez International Airport, which led to calls for her to leave the country despite being a naturalised citizen.\nShe announced that she was cancer-free in 2024 after having had treatment for a carcinoma on her lip. The same year, she was involved in another controversy involving her show Mujeres de la PM when a guest recommended the misuse of a consecrated host for an esoteric love ritual, which led to Archbishop Carlos Castillo Mattasoglio denouncing the programme while an official apology was made soon after.\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nTheatre\n",

    "Species of lichen\nUmbilicaria orientalis is a species of foliose lichen belonging to the family Umbilicariaceae. It is recognized by its distinctive morphological features and unique molecular characteristics that distinguish it from closely related species such as Umbilicaria trabeculata. This lichen is primarily found across a range of localities in East Asia, extending from the Russian Far East to South Siberia, Mongolia, and regions in China including Hebei and Tibet.\nTaxonomy\nDescribed as a new species in 2020 by Evgeny Davydov and colleagues, Umbilicaria orientalis was confirmed via molecular phylogenetics analysis involving three gene regions. This analysis not only highlighted its distinctiveness as a species but also established its sister relationship with Umbilicaria trabeculata within the U.\u00a0vellea group. The species is included in the subgenus Papillophora, which is noted for its mostly Holarctic distribution and contains several other East Asian endemics.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Umbilicaria orientalis is umbilicate, monophyllous, and can vary in size from 3\u201312\u00a0cm (1.2\u20134.7\u00a0in) in diameter. It has a grey to brownish-grey colour, sometimes with a violet tinge and is often pruinose. The thallus is rigid, with a smooth to minutely rimose or areolate upper surface, and undulates with broad folds. The lower surface, which is initially light brown in juvenile thalli, darkens with age to black, becoming lighter towards the margins. It features simple, cylindrical, or strap-like rhizinomorphs, which are specialised structures that can be unbranched or once branched, sometimes appearing sabre-shaped or strap-like, particularly when derived from the central trabeculae.\nHabitat and distribution\nUmbilicaria orientalis thrives on steep siliceous rock outcrops in high mountain belts. It is adapted to wet conditions, though it is generally sheltered from direct precipitation. The species benefits from the humid microclimates provided by periodic fogs, which are typical of its high-altitude habitats.\nThis lichen is widely distributed across East Asia, with its range spanning from the Russian Far East and South Siberia to Mongolia and various provinces in China, including Tibet and Hebei.\n",
    "Thomas Fellows is the founder of Colorado Ped Patrol, a vigilante group that carries out sting operations against adults who send sexual messages to minors on the internet.\nBiography\nFellows had worked at his own window washing company before he started carrying out sting operations in 2021. His confrontations with the suspects are livestreamed on his YouTube channel named Colorado Ped Patrol, and some have led to arrests being made. Fellows' operations are have been aided by online grooming survivor Celeste Hilton, who poses as a teenager on social media websites.\nFellows said in November 2021 that he had traveled as far as to Atlanta to confront his suspects. He said that it usually took from 30 minutes to a couple of days since the time that a conversation started for a meeting with the suspects to take place.\nIn August 2023, Fellows was charged with child abuse, a misdemeanor, under the suspicion of having evicted his two children from his house and telling them not to return. When addressing his arrest on his YouTube channel, Fellows said that \"If you guys sneak out, I'm locking that door. I am locking that door, you will not be allowed back in. If I go to jail, I go to jail; you will not come back in\".\nOn December 1, 2023, a man who described himself as being a former supporter of Fellows' online activities filed a lawsuit against Fellows for allegedly falsely accusing him of child exploitation during a livestream. The lawsuit stated that Fellows had used an unrelated phone number to link the plaintiff to a person who had sent sexual messages to a minor, and that the plaintiff had been immediately released from police custody without charges after being confronted by Fellows. When asked by Fox31 about the lawsuit, Fellows said \"Good luck with that. Bye, bye, bitch.\"\nIn 2024, a Weld County judge granted Fellows a permanent protection order after finding that James Thompson, one of Fellows' online critics, had made a death threat in a satirical video published on the internet. In the same year, YouTube banned Fellows' channel, as well as other channels that he had created for purposes of ban evasion. When asked, a spokesperson for YouTube stated that the website does not allow the broadcasting of sex sting operations on the platform. At the time of his deplatforming, Fellows was facing a misdemeanor charge under the suspicion of having punched a former supporter of his during a livestream.\n",

    "Australian coal miner and trade unionist\nIdris Williams (1895\u20131960) was an Australian politician, political prisoner, trade unionist leader and a member of the Communist Party of Australia. He was notable for being the first communist to serve on the Wonthaggi Borough Council, and for his high-profile role in numerous strikes and labour disputes across Australia.\nWilliams was depicted in the movie Strikebound (1984) by actor Hugh Keays-Byrne.\nEarly life\nWilliams was born on 21 June 1895 at Mountain Ash, Wales, Glamorgan, Wales. He began working in a coal mine at the age of 13 and joined the Powell Duffryn miners' lodge.\nWorld War 1\nHe fought in the World War I and lost his leg at the Battle of the Somme. He then left the UK in 1920 to live in Australia.\nLife in Australia\nSoonafter arriving in Australia he was living in Wonthaggi, Victoria. According to the Australian Dictionary of Biography:He became deeply involved in the cultural and sporting life of the town as a leading choral singer, conductor of the brass band, chairman of the miners' union theatre and secretary of the East Wonthaggi football club.Williams played a significant role in a 5 month long coal strike in 1934, after which he became president of the Wonthaggi District Trades and Labor Council. He was also a prominent member of the communist affiliated organisation, the Minority Movement, and served as the vice-president of the Victorian district of the Miners' Federation. Described as a famous and popular figure in Wonthaggi, his activism led and labour strike tactics led to the town being dubbed \"Red Wonthaggi\".\nIn 1944 Williams became the first communist to be elected to serve on the Wonthaggi Borough Council. He was later imprisoned during a coal miners strike in 1949 for refusing to reveal the location of \u00a315,000 of funds belonging to the union of the strikers.

    "\nThe 1921 Lower Hutt mayoral by-election was triggered by the resignation of the incumbent, Percy Rishworth, just eight months after he had been re-elected for a third term. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method.\nBackground\nPercy Rishworth had been Mayor of Lower Hutt since 1918 after the previous mayor, Henry Baldwin, resigned. His tenure included coordinating the council's response to the Spanish flu epidemic and his response was praised. Consequently, he was unopposed at the next two mayoral elections. In 1921 Rishworth had a disagreement with the Ratepayers' Association and some of the councillors over the erection of a gasworks in Lower Hutt as an alternative to continue paying for the use of the gasworks in neighbouring Petone. The public were supportive of a new gasworks and voted in favour of erecting one in a plebiscite. However the Ratepayers' Association remained opposed it. Councillor Will Strand made a speech in December 1921 to the Ratepayers' Association accusing Rishworth of a 'breach of faith' which was later leaked to reporters and published by local newspapers. At the next scheduled meeting of the council Rishworth addressed the matter and issued a challenge to Strand to resign along with himself and contest an election for mayor. Strand accepted the challenge and the two contested the mayoralty. The election proceeded to resolve itself into one of supporters of the erection of a gasworks and those against it backing Rishworth and Strand respectively.\nResult\nAs Strand resigned his council seat to stand for the mayoralty he triggered a second by-election for one council seat. A further poll was avoided as Allan Macaskill was the only candidate nominated so was elected unopposed.\nNotes\n^ \"Lower Hutt Mayoralty \u2013 Mr. E. P. Rishworth Unopposed\". The Evening Post.

    "Australian railway company (1853\u20131855)\nThe Hunter River Railway Company was a company formed in 1853 to develop a railway from Newcastle to Maitland in New South Wales, Australia. When the company faced financial difficulties during construction, it was bought by the New South Wales Government and the line opened in 1857. The line devised by the company is the oldest section of what became the Great Northern Railway from Sydney to Wallangarra, Queensland.\nHistory\nFoundation\nWilliam Charles Wentworth was one of the prominent figures involved in the company's establishment.\nA public meeting was held at the Royal Hotel in Sydney on 20 April 1853 to propose the creation of a company intended to develop railway between Newcastle and Maitland. The meeting was chaired by the statesman William Charles Wentworth. Among the political figures in attendance were Legislative Council speaker Sir Charles Nicholson, future premier Charles Cowper and Legislative Council members W. Bradley, T.W. Smart, Captain King RN and Dr. Douglas. Also attending was Captain W. Russell, J. Gilchrist, T. Holt, J. B. Darvall, T.S. Mort, J.E. Ebsworth, C. Kemp, S.D. Gordon, David Jones, Dr Mitchell, John Croft and J.F. Josephson, as well as other prominent commercial figures. The Sydney Morning Herald summarised:The chair was taken by Mr William Charles Wentworth, M.L.C., and the meeting was attended by a large number of the leading men of the colony. Intimately acquainted with the district and its resources, the honourable and learned member described, in his usual lucid manner, the favourable results of the careful surveys which had been made; the trifling nature of the engineering difficulties, even if the line were afterwards extended to Scone, to the North, and Sydney to the South; and last, but not least, he reminded the meeting of the well-known fact that the county of Durham, and the Hunter River district generally, were the most productive localities in the colony.The attendees resolved to seek land grants for terminals and stations, and capital funding, from the Government. An Act of the Legislative Council granting the Company authority to build a railway \"in or near Newcastle terminating in or near East Maitland or West Maitland and beyond\" received royal assent on 18 October 1853. The company was based in Sydney. It held its first general meeting of shareholders on 8 November 1853. The first meeting of directors was held on 11 November, electing Charles Kemp as chairman.\nConstruction\nA Mr Lundie who had surveyed the route ten years prior devised plans which were purchased and utilised by the company. Chief engineer James Wallace of the Sydney Railway Company was attained as Consultant Engineer. A surveyor and a resident engineer were also appointed. The appointments took place during the directors' meeting on 11 November.\nThe ex-Southampton ship Ellenborough arrived on 31 October 1853 with a hundred labourers contracted by the railway. There were arrangements for 500 labourers to be procured for construction. A tender for the construction of a line from Merewether Street in Newcastle to Hexham was accepted. The company chairman, Charles Kemp, turned the first sod on the project on 8 November 1854.\nDissolution and sale\nA meeting of shareholders in early January 1855 determined \"That it is expedient to dissolve the railway company, and to sell and dispose of the railways, and all other property, works, and effects, belonging to the company, to her Majesty's Government.\" The company was sold to the New South Wales Government on 23 April 1855. A circular republished by the Maitland Mercury the prior month stated that:Every year will add to the length of its line, and as it is contemplated by the Hunter River Railway Company to run the line to the utmost extent of the northern districts, to New England, it will add to the means of our shipping the whole of the pastoral produce at our port.The line was opened on 30 March 1857 by Governor Denison.\nLegacy\nA passenger service at Warrabrook on the original section of the Main North line.\nThe line devised by the Hunter River Railway Company is the oldest section of what became the Great Northern Railway, or Main North line, which at its maximum extent ran from Sydney to Queensland, terminating at Wallangarra station.

Hrub\u00fd climbed eight eight-thousanders and was one of the most successful Czech mountaineers of his era.\nMountaineering\nHrub\u00fd climbed his first eight-thousander, Cho Oyu in 1994. Over the next two decades, he would return to climb in the Himalayas multiple times for climbing expeditions.\nIn 2004, he was awarded the ascent of the year for his alpine-style summit of Shishapangma via the McIntyire route, alongside Radek Jaro\u0161, Martin Mina\u0159\u00edk, and Petr Ma\u0161ek. He was awarded his next ascent of the year for his polar crossing of Antarctica and his climb of Mount Vinson.\nWhile climbing Dhaulagiri, he and Radek Jaro\u0161 were awarded a fair play award for rescuing three climbers during their ascent. as well as received a diploma from the European Fair Play Movement.\nHis most frequent climbing partners were Radek Jaro\u0161 and Marek Hole\u010dek. In 2009, Hrub\u00fd and Hole\u010dek's climbing partnership was tested after an attempt to be the first ascent of the southwest face of Gasherbrum I. During the climb, Hrub\u00fd's stomach ulcers ruptured. He begged his climbing partner to leave him on the mountain, however they successfully made the descent. They were only 500m from the summit.\nIn 2011, they attempted the first ascent of the southern Rupal face of Nanga Parbat, which Hrub\u00fd had to abandon mid-attempt due to an injured hand and Hole\u010dek had to turn back due to poor weather conditions. The next year, they returned to Nanga Parbat, this time successfully summiting via that Kinsofer route. The Czech Mountaineering Association awarded the climb an honorable mention for the year, given the difficult conditions of the summit.\nNever Stop Exploring expedition series\nHrub\u00fd and Hole\u010dek planned three expeditions for 2013, as part of their Never Stop Exploring expedition series, two in the Himalayas and Mount Foster in Antarctica. They were all mountains they had not successfully conquered before.\nThe first trip, named Thumba Party resulted in the first successful alpine style summit of the North West pillar of Talung (7349 m) on May 19. The ascent was later awarded the climb of the year by the Czech Mountaineering Association.\nThe second expedition brought the pair back to attempt the as yet unclimbed southwest face of Gasherbrum I once again.\nDeath and legacy\nA day before his 57th birthday, Hrub\u00fd died from a fall during the descent of the eight-thousander, after unsuccessfully reaching the summit. Hrub\u00fd was fatally injured after a technical mistake, he mistakenly used the wrong type of carabiner while abseiling and fell several hundred meters to his death.\nAfter his death, Hrub\u00fd was commemorated with a memorial at the Hrub\u00e1 Sk\u00e1la climber's cemetery.\nIn 2017, his climbing partner Marek Hole\u010dek, successfully climbed the Southwest face of Gasherbrum I on his fifth attempt. He dedicated his summit to Hrub\u00fd.\nCareer\nAt the time of his death, he was the chairman of the Czech Mountaineering Association, a teacher in the Faculty of Social Science of Charles University in Prague, and a visiting professor for Australian National University.  Hrub\u00fd studied cybernetics at Czech Technical University in Prague and later economics in Germany and England. After graduation, he had a successful career in education and administration. \nFrom 2002 to April 2005, he was a Czech deputy minister of finance, responsible for EU integration and the coordinator of EU aid. He additionally served as a government representative for meetings of the International Monetary Fund, and as member of the board of directors of \u010cesk\u00fd Telecom. Outside of climbing, he pursued 100 hour skiing races and ultramarathons.\nClimbing history\n1994 Cho Oyu (8201 m), successful summit\n1996 Mount Everest, no attempt at summit due to weather\n1997 Gasherbrum I (8068 m), successful summit\n1997 Gasherbrum II (8035 m), successful summit\n1998 Mount Everest reached 8600 m\n1999 Lhotse (8516 m), successful summit\n2002 Kangchenjunga reached 8050 m\n2002 K2 reached 5200 m\n2004 Shishapangma (8013 m), successful summit\n2007 K2, unsuccessful\n2007 Broad Peak (8047 m), successful summit\n2008 Dhaulagiri (8167 m), successful summit\n2008 Makalu, reached 7200 m\n2009 Gasherbrum I, unsuccessful summit attempt via Southwest face\n2012 Nanga Parbat (8125 m), successful summit\n2013 Talung (7349 m) \u2013 first ascent in alpine style with Marek Hole\u010dek.\n",
    "Jimmy Godden (died 2012) was one of the most high-profile businessmen in Kent, England prior to his death from cancer. He was famous for his involvement in a range of high-profile venues and projects including Dreamland Margate, the Rotunda Amusement Park in Folkestone, and Ramsgate Pleasure Park.\nPersonal life\nGodden was born in Folkestone, Kent. He was married twice and had three sons.\nHe started a career as a builder, prior to marrying into a family heavily involved in Folkestone Rotunda.\nBusiness interests\nHis business interests were primarily in the entertainment sector, owning a large number of businesses including amusement arcades across the South of England under his JG Amusements brand.\nHe was the owner of the Folkestone Rotunda amusement park which was a high-profile entertainment site on the seafront, prior to Godden closing the park and selling it for redevelopment.\nGodden purchased the Feathers Funfair in Dymchurch in 1992.\nThe listed 18th century Ark cafe in Folkestone was pulled down by Godden after claims of hurricane damage, against the wishes of local conservationists.\nIn 1995, Godden purchased Dreamland Margate from the Bembom family. After his purchase of the park, Godden was able to secure European and regional grant aid to assist in an initial \u00a33m redevelopment. However, during Godden's tenure many of the rides were sold off, including the big wheel which had dominated the Margate skyline for two decades which was dismantled and sold to a park in Mexico, and the looping swingboat Mary Rose.\nA number of Godden's assets were lost or badly damaged in fires, some of which were though to be arson. This included the listed Scenic Railway at Dreamland which was damaged in an arson attack on 7 April 2008. as well as fire destroying his Pleasurama fun park in Ramsgate, and the Mr G arcade on Margate seafront in front of his Dreamland park, leaving a space between buildings known by locals as \"Godden's Gap\".\nFailed projects\nGodden was involved in a number of projects which failed to materialise. In the mid-1990s Godden's Chamelion Group proposed a major leisure complex on the derelict Ramsgate Hoverport with 250 holiday apartments, an indoor ski slope, swimming pool, and other amenities, which was proposed to be part-funded with European Union development grants, and developed by Jimmy Godden who owned Dreamland Margate the scheme led to the demolition of the old terminal, but negotiations broke down with Thanet District Council in 1996.\nAt his Pleasurama park on Ramsgate seafront, on the site of the former Ramsgate Harbour railway station, Godden had permission for the development of a shopping centre, but it was destroyed by fire before this could be brought to fruition, and was compulsory purchased by Thanet District Council.\nCriminal conviction\nGodden plead guilty to bribery of a councillor on Thanet District Council in March 1991, and was given a six-month suspended jail term, as well as a \u00a325k fine.\nKidnap\nGodden and one of his sons were kidnapped by men in balaclavas in December 1991, with the aim of extracting a ransom. The kidnapping was abandoned when a police patrol happened upon the kidnap in progress, and the kidnappers fled. Property worth \u00a3100,000 was taken and Godden's insurance company offered a \u00a310,000 reward for information leasing to the conviction of the gang.\nMembership\nGodden was chairman of the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Amusements (BALPPA) from 2000 to 2002.\nDeath\nHe died from cancer at the Royal Marsden Hospital in March 2012.\n",
    "Document of the All-India Muslim League\nThe Delhi Resolution (Urdu:\u062f\u06c1\u0644\u06cc \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0627\u062f; Bengali:\u09a6\u09bf\u09b2\u09cd\u09b2\u09bf\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4\u09be\u09ac), was a Resolution of the All-India Muslim League, written by an All-India Muslim League sub-committee and moved by Prime Minister of Bengal Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, passed during the All-India Muslim League legislators convention in Delhi in April 1946. It is noted for calling for the establishment of a United Pakistan comprising Northwest India and Northeast India.\nHistorical Context\nUntil the mid-1930s and 1940s, the Muslim League's approach to the Muslim question was to advocate for political and constitutional safeguards for India's Muslims within a federal India. The 1935 Government of India Act provided separate electorates and provincial devolution, paving the way for the 1937 Indian provincial elections that resulted in the formation of Congress ministries in six out of eight provinces with a Krishok Proja Party-Muslim League coalition ministry formed in Bengal and a Unionist Party ministry formed in Punjab. During the rule of Congress ministries between 1937 and 1939, the Muslim League would direct its propaganda towards highlighting atrocities against Muslims under Congress rule. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 would lead to the resignation of Congress ministries, leading to Jinnah to call for Deliverance Day in December 1939 to celebrate this. In March 1940, the Lahore Resolution, which called for the establishment of a separate homeland for the Muslims of India, would help popularise the Muslim League and the Pakistan Movement among the Indian Muslim masses whilst sparking debates around the shape of a hypothetical Pakistan. The meaning of the Lahore Resolution is contested given its vagueness and whether it called for a unitary state or two states is highly contested, with those in Bengal particularly advocating that the Lahore Resolution called for the establishment of two states whilst others stating it called for one state. During WW2, the British made several attempts to solve the communal question and deadlock between the All-India Muslim League and Indian National Congress as exemplified by the Cripps Mission of 1942 and 1945 Simla Conference, leading to the holding of elections in 1946. The 1946 Indian provincial elections would come as a plebiscite on Pakistan in favour of Pakistan, proving that Pakistan had mass support among India's 80 million Muslims and it would be after the conclusion of these elections that a legislators convention would be held. After the elections, the Labour Government of Clement Attlee dispatched the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India led by Viceroy Wavell to solve the communal deadlock and the question of transfer of power. The Cabinet Mission called for the creation of a federal India where the Muslim majority zones in the Northwest and Northeast of India were autonomous. However, the Cabinet Mission was unsuccessful due to Jawaharlal Nehru (who was elected President of the INC in July) rejecting it in a press conference in Bombay in spite of Congress President Maulana Azads and AIML President Jinnahs acceptance of the Mission.\nDelhi Legislators Convention\nThe Session was held on 7\u20139 April 1946 at the quadrangle of the Anglo-Arabic Hall in Delhi. The convention started with a speech by Muslim League President Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Then Liaquat Ali Khan announced the creation of the Subject Committee in each province of India. The next day on Monday 8 April, the Subject Committee approved the Delhi Resolution moved by Suhrawardy, which called for \"the Zones comprising Bengal and Assam in the North East and the Punjab, the North West Frontier Province, Sindh and Baluchistan in the North West of India, namely the Pakistan Zones, where the Muslims are a dominant majority, be constituted into one sovereign independent state and that an unequivocal undertaking be given to implement the establishment of Pakistan without delay\". Suhrawardy and others would then assert the need for Muslim India to rally around and fight for Pakistan and Jinnah would make a concluding address at the end affirming this.\nFull Text\nThe full text of the Resolution reads as follows:\n\"THE DELHI RESOLUTION\"\nWhereas in this vast subcontinent of India a hundred million Muslims are adherents of\na Faith which regulates every department of their life\u2014education, social, economic and\npolitical\u2014whose code is not confined merely to spiritual doctrine and tenets or rituals\nand ceremonies, and which stands in sharp contrast to the exclusive nature of the\nHindu Dharma and Philosophy which has fostered and maintained for thousands of\nyears a rigid caste system resulting in the degradation of sixty million human beings to\nthe position of untouchables, creation of unnatural barriers between man and man,\nsuper-imposition of social and economic inequalities on a large body of the people of\nthe country, and which threatens to reduce Muslims, Christians and other minorities to\nthe status of irr",

    "\nConscription in Mozambique refers to the military service in the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces. It includes a mandatory registration for all male and female citizens at the age of 18 years old. The army then selectively chooses the amount of citizens it drafts for a 5-year mandatory military service.\nHistory\nThe mandatory conscription law was passed in 1978 during the Mozambican Civil War (1977\u20131992) in order to have a stronger governmental military force at the time. RENAMO conscripted also child soldiers to the army during the Civil War.\nIn 1997, after the transition of Mozambique into a democracy, the law was modified as ''Law of Obligatory Military Service''. The minimum age was set at 18 and the period of recruitment was set for January and February. Also a medical examination was introduced as an obligatory condition for recruitment.\nIn 2009, the law was amended and now called ''Law of Military Service''. Conscription was not obligatory for all citizens anymore. However, the new law made it mandatory for all citizens between 18 and 35 no matter their gender to register with the military.\nIn November 2023, the parliament of Mozambique approved a law to extend compulsory military service from two years to five years.\u00a0 One of the reasons was the ongoing Islamist insurgency in the Cabo Delgado region. Defence Minister Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Chume claimed this step was necessary, as the military \"needed to be modern and more professional to be able to face challenges against national security and sovereignty.\"\nCurrent situation\nMozambican citizens, no matter their gender, have to register with the army when they turn 18 years old. Citizens can be exempt from mandatory military service, if they have health issues, studies or career or government needs. Mozambique doesn't allow soldiers under the age of 18 years old to enlist; it is one of the parties to the multilateral treaty of Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. However, according to a 1997 law, the minimum age of conscription could be lowered in time of war.\nAccording to Article 20 of the 1997 Military Service Law (Lei do Servi\u00e7o Militar), individuals eligible for exemption from military service include pre-enlistees who are children or brothers of those deceased due to military obligations, sole dependents of mentally or physically incapacitated parents, and individuals solely responsible for their spouse, ascendant, descendant, sibling, or nephew under 18 years of age. They can obtain exemption by paying an exemption fee.\nA selective amount of citizens between the ages of 18 and 35 are summoned by the Mozambican army to do a mandatory 5-year military service. In 1999, one government official, in an interview, stated that only 1,000 young people a year would be called up for military service.\u00a0 This number has increased a lot in recent years: The Mozambican Defense Ministry announced plans to recruit 221,141 individuals aged 18 to 35 for military service in 2024. Of these recruits, 147,114 will be men, with the remainder being women.\nConscientious objection\nIn 1997, Mozambique recognized the right to conscientious objection to military service for religious reasons in the \"Obligatory Military Service Act\". This right may temporarily be suspended or restricted in the event of a declaration of a state of war, siege, or emergency, in accordance with the terms of the constitution.\nHowever, other sources claim that conscientious objection is not being recognized. Based on a 2006 UN Commission on Human Rights report Civil and Political Rights, Mozambique, at that time, did not recognize conscientious objection. In 2023, BBC reported that people who refuse to show up to their military service face criminal liability.\nThere are international calls to grant police officers the right to conscientious objection in situations where they may be forced to commit human rights violations, as well as to exempt individuals from paying taxes that fund military budgets.\nCriticism\nA 2012 study by a Mozambican youth organisation, Parlamento Juvenil, showed that the conscription process was penetrated with racial and economic discrimination, affecting poor youth disproportionally. These individuals were often unable to avoid conscription by bribing officials.\n",
    "From Vendela's roll book, 1831.\nVendela (also spelled Wendela) was an East Indiaman of the Danish East India Company. In 1732, she was sold to the Danish Asiatic Company.\nCareer\nThe origins belonged to the Danish Rast India Company. After the Danish East India Cmpany was discontinued in 1729, she was put at the disposal of the interin Ostindiske Societet (mater merged with the Kinesiske Societet as the Danish Asiatic Company).\nShe was sent to Tranquebar in 1731. She was under the command of captain J\u00f8rgen Mathisen Foss (c. 1780   \u2013 1838). She departed from Tranquebar on 3 November 1733, bound for Copenhagen. Former governor of Danish India Diderich Miihlenfort returned to Copenhagen on board the ship.\nIn 1732, together with three other DEIC ships, she was sold to the new Danish Asiatic Company. With a price of 6,000 Danish rigsdaler , she was fifty percent more expensive than the cheapest of the four ships, Grev Laurvig, while the two other ships, Kronprinsen af Danmark and Fridericus Quartus, at 7,000 rigsdaler and 7,500 rigsdaler, were slightly more expensive.\nCapt. J\u00f8rgen Mathisen Foss sailed from Copenhagen on 10 November 1735, bound for Tranquebar. The ship carried a cargo with a total value of 110,000 Danish rigsdaler of which 94 04% (103,813 rigsdaler) was silver. She arrived at Tranquebar on 10 April 1736.\nShe departed from Tranquebar on 13 October 1736. Her return cargo consisted mostly of black peber. She saluted Kronborg Castle on 7 June 1737, marking her safe return to Danish waters.Rhe DAC's share of the cargo was sold at auction for 167.042 rigsdaler. The allowance of the captain and the other senior crew members was sold for 11.419 rogsdaler.\nFate\nVendela embarked on a new expedition to Tranquebar in Nove,ber 1737. During a storm, during the night between 29 and 30 December (18 and 19 December old time), she wrecked off Heilinabretta, on the east side of Fetlar, Sgetlabd Islands. All crew members  died. 17 drifted ashore and one was identified sitting on an inaccessible reef. Only part of the cargo was salvaged. 32 silver bars and 12 bags with coins were returned to Copenhagen. 5/12 of the salvaged cargo went to the locals' salvage claim.\nOn 10 January 1738, Wreckmen, William Irvine informed Earl George Dougas Morton that the remains of a wreck had been found. A Danish book indicated the provenance of the ship. Local authorities concluded that \u201dshe has sunk in a very barbarous place\u201d. \nvis alle\nJ\u00f8rgen Mathi\n",

    "Professional boxing match contested on March 2, 1975\nRoberto Dur\u00e1n vs. Ray Lampkin was a professional boxing match contested on March 2, 1975, for the WBA and The Ring lightweight titles.\nBackground\nIn January 1975, arrangements were made that would see reigning WBA and The Ring lightweight champion Roberto Dur\u00e1n face top ranked lightweight contender Ray Lampkin. Original plans called for the fight to take place in Miami Beach, Florida, in what would have been Dur\u00e1n's first defense in the United States, however the fight ultimately took place in Dur\u00e1n's native Panama instead.\nLampkin came into the fight holding the NABF lightweight title, having won the vacant title by defeating Nick Alfaro, becoming the number-one ranked lightweight in the process. Though the fight with Dur\u00e1n was already signed, Lampkin chose to accept a tune-up fight, putting his title shot on the line in an WBA lightweight title \"eliminator\" bout against Miguel Mayon, the #7 ranked lightweight. Lampkin won the fight in unimpressive fashion, besting Mayon by a relatively close unanimous decision. Said Lampkin about the fight \"Yeah, the win was nice, but I'll have to do a lot better to bring home the title. This was my first fight in 3 1/2 months, and I wasn't sharp, but it was a good workout. Some people asked me why I took this fight, but if I can't beat him, why would I go to Panama at all?\" Dur\u00e1n also took a tune-up bout in preparation for his title defense, knocking out Andres Salgado in the first round two weeks before facing Lampkin.\nThe fight\nLampkin held his own with Dur\u00e1n, becoming his longest lasting opponent at the time. Though Lampkin started off strong, Dur\u00e1n's constant pressure coupled with the intense heat and humidity of Panama's climate tired Lampkin and Dur\u00e1n controlled the fight during the mid to late rounds. 39 seconds into the 14th round Dur\u00e1n would finally end the fight after a big left hook sent Lampkin down for the count with his head smacking hard against the canvas and rendering him unconscious.\nFollowing the fight, Lampkin remained unconscious for over 80 minutes and was rushed to the hospital after attempts to revive him by administering oxygen were unsuccessful. 30 minutes after his hospitalization Lampkin regained conscious and his condition was upgraded to \"delicate and not serious\" several hours later.

Owner Billy Wilson opened the original location in Northwest Portland's Pearl District in 2009; subsequent locations opened in Northeast Portland's Vernon neighborhood in 2010, in downtown Portland's Hamilton Building in 2012, and in Northwest Portland's Northwest District in 2013. Barista also operates a fifth shop in Pine Street Market called Brass Bar.\nHistory and locations\nExterior of the Northeast Portland, Oregon location, 2022Exterior of Pine Street Market (pictured in 2017) in Old Town Chinatown, which houses the fifth location, Brass Bar\nOwner Billy Wilson opened the original location in Northwest Portland's Pearl District in early 2009.\nA second location opened on Alberta Street in Northeast Portland's Vernon neighborhood in 2010. The 1,200-square-foot space has a service counter with copper, walnut-stained mahogany furniture and panels, and a La Marzocco Mistral espresso machine. The outpost began serving bottled beers and microbrews in June, and remained the only Barista location to serve alcohol as of 2013. In 2011, Independence Day (July 4) fireworks damaged the building that housed Barista and now-defunct Aviary. Stumptown Coffee Roasters offered a cart so Barista could continue operating. The Barista shop re-opened in November 2011.\nIn February 2012, Wilson announced plans to open a third location on Third Avenue in downtown Portland's Hamilton Building. The 500-square-foot outpost opened in July 2012. In July 2013, Wilson announced plans to open a fourth location on Northwest 23rd Avenue, in Northwest Portland's Northwest District. For part of August, Barista served only Coava Coffee Roasters to support the brand's retail packaging launch. The fourth location had opened by late 2013. In 2015, Barista announced plans to operate in Pine Street Market, a food hall in the United Carriage and Baggage Transfer Building in the Southwest Portland part of the Old Town Chinatown neighborhood. The fifth location, called Brass Bar, opened in 2016.\nMenu\nBarista has served coffee by Coava and Stumptown.\nIn 2014, Barista shops operated on Christmas, serving a special menu. All locations offered espresso with black walnut bitters, nutmeg, and whipped cream, as well as blonde mochas and hot chocolate with nutmeg and white chocolate by Valrhona. The drinks could be topped with peppermint marshmallows. Having the ability to serve alcohol, the Northeast Portland and Northwest District locations offered: a hot toddy with toddy syrup and sherry; a black velvet with raspberry syrup, Guinness, espresso, and cava; and Guinness with a shot.\nReception\nIn 2013, Erin DeJesus included the Northeast Portland location of Barista in Eater Portland's list of twelve establishments for getting drunk before noon in the city. Barista also ranked third in The Daily Meal's overview of the nation's best coffee shops, and was included in Grub Street's overview of 58 \"extraordinary\" coffee shops in the U.S. Hanna Neuschwander included Barista's mocha in The Oregonian's 2013 list of seven \"must-try\" winter lattes; she said the drink was \"for purists -- big on flavor, light on sugar, letting both the chocolate and the coffee shine through\". Barista was included in Eater's 2014 \"Coffee 38\" list of coffee shops and roasters \"creating a new narrative in the national coffee scene\". The guide noted that Feast Portland co-founder Mike Thelin called Barista a \"revolutionary shop\".

    "Species of lichen\nLepraria bergensis is an uncommon crustose lichen in the family Stereocaulaceae. It occurs in Northern and Central Europe, where it grows on siliceous (silicon-rich) rock walls, particularly under small overhangs, and on mosses on vertical to slightly sloping rock surfaces. The lichen thallus forms as a pale bluish-grey crust-like growth  on rocks and mosses. The lichen begins as small, rounded patches a few millimetres wide, which may eventually coalesce into larger areas exceeding 1 centimetre in diameter. The thallus has a powdery texture, consisting of minute granules known as soredia and consoredia, which facilitate the lichen's asexual reproduction. The chemical composition of Lepraria bergensis is distinguished by the presence of several secondary metabolites: atranorin, rangiformic acid or jackinic acid, trace amounts of their respective derivatives, and a variety of anthraquinones. These chemical components cause the lichen to fluoresce a dull yellow under long-wave ultraviolet light.\nTaxonomy\nThe species was formally described as a new to science in 2002 by the Norwegian lichenologist Tor T\u00f8nsberg. The type locality was documented by T\u00f8nsberg in March 2002. This lichen was found in the municipality of Bergen (Hordaland region, Norway). The type specimen was collected in \u00c5sane, at an elevation of 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) meters above sea level. Here, Lepraria bergensis was found growing on mosses covering west-facing rock surfaces ranging from nearly vertical to slightly sloping. The species epithet refers to the municipality of Bergen where it was discovered.\nSubsequent genetic analysis showed that Lepraria bergensis is basal to a clade consisting of the species L.\u00a0isidiata and L.\u00a0santosii.\nDescription\nLepraria bergensis has a thallus that is pale bluish-grey and can form small, rounded rosettes up to a few millimeters in diameter. As the lichen matures, these rosettes often merge with other thalli, creating patches up to 1 centimeter or more in diameter. The thallus can be up to 220 micrometres (\u03bcm) thick, excluding loose soredia and consoredia.\nThe lobes of Lepraria bergensis are distinct, especially in young specimens growing on rocks. These lobes can be a few millimetres wide and have sharply raised margins that reveal a white lower surface with colourless hyphae projecting outward. The upper surface is powdery and composed of loosely packed soredia (tiny reproductive granules) and consoredia (larger aggregations of soredia). The lower surface is whitish, at least along the margin, and can be pale yellowish or brown. The hypothallus, which forms the lower layer of the thallus, is inconspicuous and either absent or brown in colour.\nSoredia are up to 25\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter, and consoredia can be up to 200 (sometimes up to 340)\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter. Both are densely packed with crystals and may have short, projecting hyphae. The medulla (the inner layer of the thallus) is white and distinct only in patches. The photobiont (the photosynthetic partner) is trebouxioid and measures up to 16\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter.\nThe chemical profile of Lepraria bergensis includes several compounds: atranorin, fragilin, 7-chloroemodin, parietin, A01-athrone, emodin, and a mixture of rangiformic/jackinic acid along with trace amounts of their derivatives norrangiformic/norjackinic acid. The thallus surface is K\u2212, C\u2212 and PD\u2212, but the lower surface is K+ (purple).\nSimilar species\nThe thallus of Lepraria bergensis shares similarities with Leproloma membranaceum, as both form small rosettes with well-defined, rounded lobes and elevated margins. However, it is morphologically distinct due to its bluish-grey surface colour and inconspicuous hypothallus, which is well-developed and cottony in L.\u00a0membranaceum. Chemically, L.\u00a0bergensis is different as it produces a set of anthraquinones, atranorin, and a fatty acid from the rangiformic/jackinic acid pair, whereas L.\u00a0membranaceum produces dibenzofuran pannaric acid and roccellic acid.\nIn muscicolous specimens, the marginal lobes of Lepraria bergensis are less distinct, forming small rosettes similar to L.\u00a0borealis and L.\u00a0caesioalba. However, it is chemically distinct from these species due to the presence of anthraquinones and the absence of fumarprotocetrariac acid and roccellic acid.\nLepraria bergensis may be closely related to Leproloma sipmanianum, which is found in Africa and South America. Both species have distinctly lobed thalli with raised margins and produce the same set of anthraquinones. However, L.\u00a0sipmanianum has a yellowish thallus surface, produces the dibenzofuran compound pannaric acid 6-methyl ester, and lacks atranorin and fatty acids.\nHabitat and distribution\nLepraria bergensis is primarily saxicolous (rock-dwelling), found under shallow overhang on siliceous rock walls. It also grows on moss-covered, nearly vertical to slightly sloping rocks. In its type locality, Lepraria bergensis is relatively common, frequently intermingling with Leproloma membranaceum to create",
    "Villa Franconi was an 18th-century residential building in Floriana, Malta which was repurposed as a mental hospital known as the Franconi Asylum from 1835 to 1861. The building was demolished in the late 19th century.\nHistory\nVilla Franconi was constructed as the residence of Bali' Fra Fabrizio Franconi, a knight of the Order of St John who served in the Hospitaller fleet. Franconi made a petition for obtaining a free plot of land in Floriana on 24 January 1739, on which he initially built a small house with a garden. This was later expanded into a villa with a main facade along Strada Magazzeni.\nThe property later passed to the Mattei family, before being acquired by the British government on 30 September 1802. In 1835, the Commissioners of Charity made a proposal to establish a new mental asylum to replace the Ospizio, which had been deemed unsuitable for the care of mentally-ill patients. Villa Franconi was chosen as the site of the asylum, and structural alterations were made to the building including the addition of a padded cell.\nThe Franconi Asylum began to operate in September 1835 when 80 patients were transferred from the Ospizio; the number increased to 116 by the beginning of 1836. Patients with more severe cases of mental illness initially remained at the Ospizio but were also transferred in 1838, and during the same year the property was enlarged when an adjacent house was incorporated into it. By 1848, the asylum had reached its full capacity of 170 inmates.\nVilla Franconi was located within a residential urban area, and neighbours reportedly teased and taunted the patients who were confined inside. Efforts to relocate the asylum began in 1851, and a proposal by Francesco Cianciolo was selected following a design competition. The new Asylum for the Insane (later renamed Mount Carmel Hospital) was subsequently constructed in the limits of Attard between 1853 and 1861, and the 253 patients housed in Villa Franconi were moved to the new asylum in July 1861.\nVilla Franconi had been repurposed as an officer's mess by 1871, but it was demolished a couple of years later. Its site was split into twenty plots which were rebuilt as residential buildings.\nThe asylum gave rise to the metonym ta' Frankuni, which entered the Maltese vocabulary as a reference to mental hospitals.\n",

    "U.S. Army major general\nThomas D. Finley (June 2, 1895 \u2013 December 19, 1984) was a career officer in the United States Army. A veteran of the Mexican Border War, World War I, and World War II, he served from 1916 to 1946 and attained the rank of major general as the Second World War commander of the 89th Infantry Division. Finley's U.S. awards included the Army Distinguished Service Medal, two awards of the Legion of Merit, and the Bronze Star Medal. His foreign awards and decorations included the French Legion of Honor (Chevalier) and Croix de Guerre with palm.\nFinley was born in Annapolis, Maryland and was educated at various army posts as the Finley family traveled for his father's career. He graduated from high school at the Pennsylvania Military College in 1911, and from the United States Military Academy (West Point) in 1916. Assigned to the Corps of Engineers, he served in Texas during the Mexican Border War. During World War I, he commanded 2nd Battalion, 7th Engineer Regiment and the I Corps Engineer School in France. After the war, he transferred to the Infantry Branch, and he carried out staff and command assignments throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including member of the faculty at the Infantry School and professor of modern languages at West Point.\nDuring World War II, Finley was assistant division commander of the 89th Infantry Division as a brigadier general, followed by promotion to major general and assignment as commander of the division. He led the 89th Division during combat in Europe during 1944 and 1945. After the German surrender, he commanded XVI Corps, then returned to the United States, where he was retired for disability in 1946.\nIn retirement, Finley resided in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He died in Colorado Springs on December 19, 1984. After cremation, some of his ashes were scattered at nearby Fort Carson and some were buried at West Point Cemetery. \nEarly life\nFinley as a West Point Cadet in 1916\nThomas DeWees Finley was born in Annapolis, Maryland on June 2, 1895, a son of Colonel Walter Lowrie Finley and Louise S. (DeWees) Finley. Clement Finley was his grandfather and Clement Flagler was his first cousin. In addition, U.S. Representative Samuel Moore was his great-grandfather. Finley and his twin brother James Randlett Finley were educated at various military posts as their family moved for Walter Finley's career, and they completed high school at the Pennsylvania Military College (now Widener University) in 1911. At graduation, Finley received the Theodore Hyatt Medal for Scholarship in recognition of his academic achievements.\nFinley obtained an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point and began attendance in 1912. In 1913, he was among several cadets who were disciplined following discovery of several incidents in which upperclassmen were found to have hazed underclassmen. In 1916, West Point fielded its first-ever tennis team; Finley was selected as a member and subsequently chosen to serve as the team captain. Finley graduated in June 1916 ranked eighth of 125, and among his classmates who also became general officers were Fay B. Prickett, Horace L. McBride, Louis E. Hibbs, William M. Hoge, Dwight Johns, Calvin DeWitt Jr., Robert Neyland, and Wilhelm D. Styer. His high class standing enabled him to obtain a second lieutenant's commission in the Corps of Engineers, the branch choice of most top tier graduates.\nStart of career\nAfter receiving his commission, Finley was assigned to the 1st Regiment of Engineers, which performed duty at Eagle Pass, Texas during the Mexican Border War. He was promoted to first lieutenant in July 1916, and remained with the 1st Engineers until May 1917, when he was promoted to captain and assigned to command Company D, 7th Engineer Regiment at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. With the army preparing for U.S. entry into World War I, in September 1917 Finley was appointed regimental adjutant, and he served in this position during the regiment's training for combat and movement to France. The 7th Engineers arrived in Rimaucourt in April 1918, and in May Finley was promoted to temporary major and assigned to command the regiment's 2nd Battalion.\nIn August 1918, Finley was appointed to command the I Corps Engineer School at Gondrecourt-le-Ch\u00e2teau. He directed this school until the Armistice of November 11, 1918 ended the war, and remained in this position during the early stages of the Occupation of the Rhineland. From January to February 1919, Finley commanded 2nd Battalion, 112th Engineer Regiment. From March to June 1919, he performed staff duty with the Advance Section of the Services of Supply in Neufch\u00e2teau, Vosges. He was then posted to Rumelange, Luxembourg, where he resumed command of 2nd Battalion, 7th Engineers, which he led through its return to the United States and demobilization at Camp Gordon, Georgia in June 1920. He returned to his permanent rank of captain on June 30, 1920.\nContinued career\nFrom June to Septembe",
    "European mobile payment service\nWero is an european mobile payment system intended to replace Giropay. The service was launched in July 2, 2024 by the European Payments Initiative. The service has the goal to being a competitor for PayPal and similar services, but from the beginning as a real-time payment system and later with extended online payment function.\nThe name is made up of English we(we) and Euro, but is also based on Italian vero (true).\nBackground\nGiropay had a market share of 0.4 percent in 2023 and is no longer expected to be profitable due to high fixed costs. It was decided to discontinue the payment service together with the provider Paydirekt at the end of 2024 and to gradually build up the new payment service in several stages.\nThe aim of EPI's project is to achieve greater independence from the market power of American payment service providers. According to the management consultancy Capco, wero's market entry may come too late for many, but the train has \"not yet completely left the station, but is already in motion.\" The Center for Financial Studies believes that the end of 2021 will be the \"last opportunity for Europe to establish a payment system that can keep up with global competition\" (especially against US competitors).\nPlanned functions\nBy mid-2025, payment in online stores should be possible and thus compete with PayPal and credit cards. The final step planned is the integration of stationary payment at the checkout, including the integration of the Girocard.\nOne flaw of the old payment service was the complicated and time-consuming setup for customers and merchants alike. Wero is supposed to be linked to the user's current account and can be used immediately without setup.\nEPI, to which 16 of the original 32 financial service providers still belong, launched a pilot operation between Sparkasse Elbe-Elster and the French Banque Populaire in December 2023 based on the fully developed SCT-Inst SEPA payment solution. Paydirekt accounts are to be terminated at the end of 2024.\nEPI wants to start the \"digital wallet\" wero Wallet with mobile-to-mobile payments in Belgium, Germany and France and offer its own app so that, according to the provider, almost all bank customers in these countries will most likely be able to use wero. It should be comparable to Twint (Switzerland) and MobilePay (Denmark).\nIn Germany, Sparkassen, Postbank, Deutsche Bank and ING want to make a start. EPI member banks also want to implement the services in their own apps based on SEPA and on the basis of the mobile phone numbers registered with the banks, including Deutsche Bank, DZ Bank and the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe.\nIn the Netherlands, the central bank has made success a condition for the migration of iDEAL to the European platform.\nBy mid-2025, payment in online stores should be possible and thus compete with PayPal and credit cards. The final step planned is the integration of stationary payment at the checkout, including the integration of the Girocard.\nCurrent supported banks\nOther countries\nOther banks that want to offer the service are Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Postbank (Germany), BNP Paribas, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Groupe Banque Populaire and Worldline (France), ING (Netherlands) and Nexi (Italy).

    "Belgian economic geographer\nJacques-Fran\u00e7ois Thisse is a Belgian economist, author, and academic. Thisse is Professor Emeritus of Economics and Regional Science at the Catholic University of Louvain and at the \u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech. Thisse\u2019s work is related to location theory and its applications to various economic fields in which the heterogeneity of agents matters. This includes industrial organisation, urban and spatial economics, local public finance, international trade, and voting. He has published more than 200 papers in scientific journals, including Econometrica, American Economic Review, Review of Economic Studies, Journal of Political Economy, and Operations Research.\nBiography\nThisse got a Licence in Mathematics with distinction in 1968, a Licence in Economics with the highest distinction in 1972, and a Doctorate in Economics with the highest distinction in 1975, all from the University of Li\u00e8ge (Belgium). Thisse's interest in urban studies dates back to the early 1970s when only a few scholar, mainly geographers, were interested in the subject. In a 2020 interview to the European Regional Science Association (ERSA), Thisse said that the main question that had sparked his interest was \"What could be the economic justification for the existence of cities? Why do have cities?\".\nThisse worked for the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain first as a lecturer in regional science (1975-1983) and then as a professor of economics (1983-1992). In 1991, Thisse became a Full Professor at Paris-I Sorbonne and stayed until 1996. He then returned to Louvain where he became Full Professor until 2010. He has been Visiting Professor at McMaster University, Virginia Tech, ENSAE, Kyoto University, and Columbia University.\nThisse was Progamme Chairman of the European Meeting of the Econometric Society in 1992 and President of the Scientific Council of the Economists of La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Grands Projets (formerly La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Grand Paris) from 2012 to 2016. He was Director of CERAS, Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es (Paris) from 1992 to 1996 and President of the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics, UCLouvain, from 2000 to 2006. He has also obtained several research grants from the Belgian Science Foundation.\nResearch\nThisse was among the first to analyse oligopolistic markets when firms supply products having different qualities (vertical product differentiation) in the late 1970s. He was at the origin of several decisive advances in product differentiation theory, in particular the study of firms\u2019 behavior when consumers' choices for goods is described by choice probabilities (logit model) and of firms\u2019 product positioning in multi-dimensional characteristics spaces. Thisse\u2019s research in industrial organization was synthesized and extended in Discrete Choice Theory of Product Differentiation, a book co-authored with Simon P. Anderson and Andr\u00e9 de Palma and published by MIT Press in 1992. The book shows how models of product differentiation may be integrated within the framework of discrete choice theory and provides theoretical foundations for the different modelling strategies used in this domain. After more than 30 years, Discrete Choice Theory of Product Differentiation remains a classical reference.\nThisse was one of the precursors of spatial economics through his analysis of the agglomeration of firms in location theory, as illustrated by his papers published in Econometrica in 1979 and 1985. He also worked in new economic geography with G.I.P. Ottaviano and Takatoshi Tabuchi with whom he published several papers. In \u201cAgglomeration and trade revisited,\u201d they developed the first analytically solvable core-periphery model.\nThisse is also known for his contributions to the role of increasing returns to scale in production, and commuting costs and amenities in urban economics. His work explores how cities organize themselves based on the interactions between these economic factors, with a special emphasis on environment, metropolitan areas, and market integration. Thisse's research often involves quantitative spatial models and stylized geographies, aiming to provide a comprehensive analytical characterization of urban equilibrium and stability across various parameter spaces.\nHis 2002 book, Economics of Agglomeration, co-written in collaboration with Masahisa Fujita, was devoted to the formation of different types of agglomerations. Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman commented on the book saying it is \u201cbetter than any book so far, this volume integrates concepts that range from \u2018edge cities\u2019 to global divergence into a single grand view.\u201d\nHonors, awards, and fellowships\nHonors\nHonorary Doctorate from the University of Montr\u00e9al (2005)\nHonorary Doctorate from Paris-Panth\u00e9on-Assas University (2010)\nHonorary Doctorate from the Jean Monnet University (2011)\nThe Francqui Chair by the by the Francqui Foundation (1999-2000)\nAwards and prizes\nE.

It is the largest children's hospital in Ukraine.\nMain capabilities\nUp to 18,000 children are treated in the hospital's 720 beds every year, and about 20,000 receive emergency care at the hospital's trauma center. The hospital performs about 7,000 operations annually. The departments perform all types of surgical interventions except cardiac surgery.\nHistory\nThe history of the National Children's Specialized Hospital OKHMATDYT began in 1894 when the Kyiv Free Cesarevych Mykola Hospital for Laborers and the Poor was opened in Kyiv at the expense of the prominent businessman and philanthropist Mykola Tereshchenko\u00a0.\nIn 1891, the Kyiv City Public Administration allocated a land plot along Kadetske Highway between the suburb of Shuliavka and the city barracks. The architect, academician Volodymyr Nikolaiev began developing a project for a future hospital with 50 beds. For the construction of the hospital's premises, Tereshchenko allocated 100 thousand rubles of his own capital and 15 thousand more to purchase the necessary property for the arrangement of the medical institution.\nOn December 17, 1893, in Gatchina, Emperor Alexander III approved the charter of the Kyiv Free Hospital for Laborers, named after Tsesarevich Nikolai.\nAfter the revolutionary events of 1917, the hospital housed, in addition to therapeutic beds, a tuberculosis dispensary, a 30-bed maternity hospital, and a consultation center for mothers and pregnant women. The organization of healthcare in Kyiv at that time was handled by the District Health Inspectorate, which included the protection of motherhood and childhood inspection department, which dealt with maternal and child health care. The protection of motherhood and childhood infrastructure included children's hospitals in the city, milk kitchens, baby homes, and counseling centers. These medical institutions also trained medical students and nurses.\nIn October 1927, the health inspectorate sent a memo to the district executive committee, proposing to combine the disparate maternal and child healthcare institutions and create the OHMATDYT Institute. It was proposed that the institute be located in a hospital for the poor, where a maternity hospital, a women's consultation, and a children's tuberculosis clinic were already operating at the time. On November 11, 1927, the Collegium of the People's Commissariat of Health of Ukraine approved a resolution on the organization of the Institute for the Protection of Motherhood and Childhood in Kyiv, which was officially opened in March 1929. Since then, the hospital's development as a major children's medical institution has been closely linked to the institute's activities.\nNowadays\nSince 1998, the Center for Pediatric Oncohematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation has been operating within the hospital's structure, providing state-of-the-art diagnostics and treatment of oncohematological diseases and bone marrow transplants to sick children. The center's active work on the study and adaptation of highly effective foreign technologies in treating childhood leukemia and lymphoma has increased the positive results of chemotherapy programs in the center's departments fivefold.\nIn 2002, the hospital began performing laparoscopic surgeries and surgical treatment of scoliosis using the Bridge system, as well as using bio-implants in newborn surgeries. The center has started accepting victims with polytrauma. In recent years, the number of sick children with complex surgical pathology from different regions of Ukraine has increased significantly, some of whom were operated on for the first time at their place of residence, according to the report.\nIn 2011, construction of new hospital buildings began. In December 2017, the first stage of the renovated complex was put into operation. In July 2020, the second phase of the new hospital building was opened.\nRussian missile strike\nDamaged Okhmatdyt after a 2024 missile attack\nDamaged main (new) building of the hospital Okhmatdyt after a 2024 Russian missile attack\nOn July 8, 2024 a massive missile attack on Ukraine occurred and the hospital's premises suffered from a Russian missile strike, where over 60% of the facility was destroyed.\nThe Toxicology building with the Chronic and Acute Intoxication Unit (where children undergo dialysis) of the Okhmatdyt National Children's Hospital was destroyed. In the new, recently opened building, 12 departments were damaged, including 8 surgical, 5 oncology, two intensive care units, an operating room, and a radiology and radiation therapy department.

Mia's father was sent to Theresienstadt, where he eventually died. In December 1938, Giulia moved to Switzerland; her mother fled to England the following year. Susanne fled to Kenya. While in Switzerland, Giulia lived with various families while she completed school then worked as a maid. In 1946, both Mia and Giulia moved to New York, after which Giulia began working as a lab assistant in the Rockefeller Center for Medical Research. In 1947, she married nuclear physicist Gerald J. Hine. Her daughter Madeline was born the following year, after which she discontinued work.

    "19th century American businessman and politician\nJohn Stewart (August 10, 1825\u00a0\u2013 March 26, 1915) was a Scottish American immigrant, businessman, Republican politician, and pioneer of Wisconsin and Illinois.  From humble beginnings chopping lumber, he founded a lumber business with his brother which made them both millionaires.  He also served three terms in the Illinois House of Representatives.  \nHis brother and business partner, Alexander Stewart, served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nEarly life\nJohn Stewart was born in Fredericton, New\u00a0Brunswick, in Canada.  At the time of his birth, Canada was still a colony of the United\u00a0Kingdom.  He was raised on his father's farm in York\u00a0County, New\u00a0Brunswick, and received a common school education.  The area was heavily forested, and Stewart learned about logging and rafting timber in his teenage years.\nLumber business\nIn 1848, Stewart emigrated to the United\u00a0States, settling first at St. Charles, Illinois. He worked there for about a year before he was joined by his younger brother, Alexander.  Hearing of logging prospects in Wisconsin, the two of them hiked north.  They walked from Milwaukee to Stevens\u00a0Point, then from Stevens Point north to what is now Wausau, Wisconsin, arriving on May\u00a04, 1849.\nAt the time this was a wild frontier, part of Portage County, Wisconsin, which then comprised a vast swath of northern Wisconsin.  Shortly after his arrival, Marathon County was carved out of the area surrounding Wausau.\nHe and his brother went to work in a saw mill, cutting lumber that had been harvested from the nearby forests.  Like many other lumbermen of that era, they took their wages in lumber and ran the slabs down the Wisconsin River to the Mississippi River, and on to St. Louis, to sell it at market.  They built up enough savings from these trips that they were able to begin purchasing lumber from other lumberworkers in Wausau, which they would then raft down the river with their own lumber to sell for a profit.  Through this process, they accumulated enough money to start their own logging company, known as the A. & J. Stewart Lumber Co.  Their company grew and prospered.  In their earlier years, they formed a close friendship with Walter\u00a0D. McIndoe, and frequently cut their lumber at his mill.  After his death in 1872, they purchased his mill and incorporated it into their growing enterprise.  In that transaction, they also took on a third partner, McIndoe's nephew Walter Alexander.\nJohn Stewart eventually left Wisconsin and settled a farm in Illinois, though he maintained his share of ownership in their business.  Alexander remained in Wausau and managed the company for the rest of his life.  In 1884, the firm re-incorporated as the Alexander Stewart Lumber Company, with Alexander Stewart as president, John Stewart as vice president, and Walter Alexander as secretary and treasurer.\nIn Illinois, he became invested in a bank under the firm name Bowman, Warne & Stewart.  In 1899 he bought out his partners, in partnership with his son and another partner, E. F. Goodell.  The bank was afterwards run as John Stewart & Co.\nPolitical career\nJohn Stewart was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives on the Republican Party ticket in 1884 and was re-elected in 1886.  He was subsequently elected to a third term in 1898.\nPersonal life and family\nJohn Stewart was the eldest of six children born to Thomas and Jane (n\u00e9e Moody) Stewart.  Both of Stewart's parents were born in Scotland, they also emigrated from Canada to the United States, settling in Kane County, Illinois.  John Stewart's younger brother and business partner, Alexander Stewart, served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and also became a millionaire through their business.\nOn October 20, 1857, John Stewart married Martha A. Thomas.  They had five children together, though one died in childhood.  Their son, Thomas B. Stewart, managed his father's bank.  Their youngest daughter, Nellie, married John's a brother of John's business partner Walter Alexander.\nAfter his brother's death in 1912, John began giving away a large amount of his money.  He gave away more than $1,500,000 in charitable donations between 1913 and his death in 1915 (more than $46 million adjusted for inflation to 2024).  John Stewart died at his daughter's home in Aurora, Illinois, on March\u00a026, 1915.\n",

    "2010 single by Jovanotti\n\"Tutto l'amore che ho\" (transl.\u2009\"All the love I've got\"]) is a song by Italian singer-songwriter Jovanotti. It was released on 3 December 2010 through Universal Music Italy as the lead single from his twelfth studio album Ora.\nComposition\nThe song was written by Jovanotti, Riccardo Onori, and Michele Canova, who is also the music producer of the song. In an interview with La Stampa the singer explained the meaning of the song:\"It was the word \"love\" that reinforced my desire to sing this song. After hearing this word spoken at a party rally, I felt strongly the need to take it back, to put it back where it belongs, in songs and in real life.\"\nMusic video\nThe music video for the song, directed by Paolo Soravia was released on December 3, 2010, through the singer's YouTube channel. Soravia explained the production behind the music video, which was inspired by works of John Woo, Crank by Neveldine/Taylor, Waltz with Bashir by Ari Folman, John Hillcoat, Danny Boyle and Francis Lawrence:\"The video originated from an idea of Lorenzo's and is the result of much work and research. It is an epic tale in a contemporary key in which Lorenzo struggles against a series of adversities. On his side is the love of life, the love of everything, all the love possible. We thought of a raw, even violent video in strong contrast to the song. We watched dozens of movies analyzing them, looking for references, quotes and images to tell our story.  The setting is inspired by movies with the kind of science fiction that leaves cities and architecture intact but turns them into deserted scenarios, ready to host our worst nightmares.  It gives an original interpretation to the meaning of the song and offers a brand new version of a Jovanotti as dreamy as ever, but willing to do anything in the name of love. For us, who worked on its making, it remains a powerful experience and a distinct case in Italian videography, especially mainstream videography.\"On the social network the video clip has been accompanied by some controversy because of similarities to the video of the song \"Solitude is Bliss\" by Tame Impala.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nYear-end charts\nCertifications\n",
    "2010 fight in Palmetto, Florida\nScreenshot from a video of the fight. The girl in the purple shirt is April Newcomb's daughter.\nOn September 17, 2010, a fight between two 16-year-old female students at Palmetto High School in Palmetto, Florida occurred in a field near the school. It was watched by a crowd of students, many who videotaped the incident. Three such videos were uploaded to YouTube, where they went viral.\nApril Newcomb, the mother of one of the girls, attended the brawl, where she cheered her daughter on. She was charged with child abuse, but later pleaded no contest to the charge in 2011.\nFight\nOn Friday, September 17, 2010, at approximately 2:30\u00a0p.m., April M. Newcomb, 39, drove her daughter to the 5400 Block of 17th Street West, in a vacant field so she could fight a fellow student. 50-60 students had gathered at the field to attend the fight, which many recorded on their cell phones and video cameras. Videos of the incident show Newcomb walking her barefoot daughter with her entourage through the field to confront another student, who was larger than Newcomb's daughter. The girls begin trading blows, with the other girl tumbling on top of Newcomb's daughter. As her daughter is taking punches to the face, Newcomb can be heard yelling: \"Throw it! Throw it! Throw that bow!\" The girls soon get off the ground, throwing slaps and punches and pulling hair, before knocking each other to the ground again. One of the students videotaping the brawl can be heard shouting, \"Go for the headshot. The headshot.\" As the girls are rolling and grappling in the grass and Newcomb's daughter is being beaten and throttled by the other girl, Newcomb repeatedly encourages her daughter to fight, shouting words such as \"don't fucking stop\", \"punch her in the fucking body\" and \"kick her ass\". Near the end of the fight, the mother of the other girl arrived at the scene and approached Newcomb, asking her why she was not stopping the fight and conversing with her. The fight lasted for about five minutes and was broken up when the deputies arrived and the teenagers scattered.\nInvestigation\nThree videos of the brawl were posted on YouTube, all of which have since been taken down. Further investigation revealed the girls, both 16 years old, were fighting over an old boyfriend. On September 20, 2010, the Manatee County Sheriff's Office interviewed the two girls and their mothers. Newcomb's daughter, who had told her mother she was planning to fight the other girl prior to the altercation, stated via phone that she and the girl had spoken at school that day, and that they apologized to each other and made amends. She also said the fight was mutually motivated. The other girl stated during an in-person interview that she had a previous confrontation with Newcomb's daughter on September 16, 2010, following which they decided to fight the next day via text messaging. On September 17, she went to school but Newcomb's daughter did not, and went to the field after school, where Newcomb drove her daughter to. In addition, she felt that she and Newcomb's daughter were forced to fight due to peer pressure from the students at school and that once they told everyone they were going to fight, they could not back down. The girl also said that when her mother, who later told police that she drove to the place where the fight was happening after hearing about it, had arrived, she yelled at the students to stop videotaping the fight and tried to break it up, but either she or Newcomb's daughter kicked her and she backed away. Just then, the fight ended as the police arrived. After the fight, the girl went home and called Newcomb's daughter, telling her that she would shake her hand at school on the next school day.\nOn September 22, 2010, April Newcomb was arrested for child abuse and jailed in Manatee County on a $15,000 bond, facing five years of prison. Dave Bristow, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, remarked that \"The entire incident is disturbing, especially because the parent did not intervene\" and \"We're basically in shock a parent can sit there and watch their child and not intervene. \u2026 It's pretty obvious this is child abuse.\" He also said, \"We've all seen videos of kids fighting, but to have a parent there, that's what pushed us over the edge. She egged on her daughter, did nothing to stop it.\" During questioning by police, Newcomb stated that her daughter had suffered from a skull fracture in a previous incident approximately two years before and she had attended the fight to make sure she was not hit in the back of the head. When asked why she did not break up the fight, she said \"Of course, we're both wrong and I understand that, and I understand where y'all are coming from. I think unfortunately it was going to happen, no matter what.\"\nOn September 24, 2010, Palmetto Police Department officers interviewed two students who had witnessed the fight. Both reported that Newcomb had kept her daughter home from school that day to \"",

    "Italian serial killer\nBartolomeo Gagliano (1958 \u2013 January 22, 2015), known as The Valentine's Day Monster (Italian: Il mostro di San Valentino), was an Italian serial killer who murdered two transvestite prostitutes after escaping from prison, where he was serving time for a murder conviction.\nInitially confined to a psychiatric hospital, Gagliano escaped and committed further crimes, and shortly after his final capture, he committed suicide in the detention center he was housed in.\nEarly life\nGagliano was born in Nicosia, Sicily in 1958, as one of Antonio Gagliano and Giuseppina Di Grazia's two sons. A few years after his birth, the family moved to Savona, Liguria, where he was raised in a humble but stable family. As time went on, however, Gagliano began to exhibit behavior that suggested that he had some sort of mental illness.\nCrimes\nFirst murder and imprisonment\nOn the night of 16 January 1981, the 22-year-old Gagliano was approaching the date of his wedding, but was instead threatened by 32-year-old Paolina Fedi, a prostitute addicted to heroin, who said that she intended to reveal to his fianc\u00e9e that he had cheated on her. In order to prevent her from doing so, Gagliano killed her inside his Fiat 124 by smashing in her head with a stone along the Autostrada A10 near a toll booth in Celle Ligure. He then abandoned the car and traveled on foot to Savona, where he immediately turned himself in to the carabinieri. Gagliano was deemed incompetent to stand trial and was soon after interned at a psychiatric hospital in Aversa for ten years.\nFirst escape and acquaintance with Francesco Sedda\nOn 12 June 1983, a family vacationing in Massa-Carrara had their car blocked by Gagliano, who had been released on furlough. He forced them to drive him to Savona, where he disembarked, disarmed a traffic policeman and kidnapped a schoolgirl at gunpoint. Gagliano then barricaded himself in a store, but eventually surrendered to police after several hours. This time, he was interned at a psychiatric hospital in Villa Medicea L'Ambrogiana, in Montelupo Fiorentino.\nWhile interned there, Gagliano befriended another inmate, Francesco Sedda, a native of Nuoro who was raised in Genoa. Sedda was an HIV-positive drug addict incarcerated for robberies, and like Gagliano, was violent towards prostitutes.\nEscape from Montelupo and crime spree\nOn 11 January 1989, Gagliano and Sedda exacted a plan to escape from the facility, climbing over the boundary wall, stealing a car and fleeing to Liguria. On 8 February, the two killed 32-year-old Nahir Fernandez Rodriguez, an Uruguayan transvestite living in Milan, by shooting him with a 7.65 caliber pistol at point-blank range. Fernandez's body was later found in a thicket at the Cantalupa service area along Autostrada A7.\nSix days later, in Genoa, Gagliano and Sedda came across Francesco \"Vanessa\" Panizzi, another transvestite prostitute who was having sex with a 34-year-old client in the man's car. Gagliano pulled out his pistol and shot Panizzi in the face, while the client received minor injuries.\nOn the following day, the pair attacked another prostitute, \"Laura\", who survived her injuries. A witness would later give a description of the killer and an identikit would be made, which would lead to the arrest of an innocent man who was released on the same day. On 16 February, the editorial staff of Il Secolo XIX received an anonymous phone call from a man, possibly Sedda, who claimed to have contracted AIDS from one of the murdered prostitutes and wanted to five others he had sex with.\nCapture\nFour days later, a mobile squad stopped an Opel Corsa in downtown Genoa, with the driver and passenger being Sedda and Gagliano, respectively. Sedda managed to flee into a nearby alleyway, but Gagliano - who was carrying a Walther P38 and had 7.65 mm caliber shell casings - was immediately arrested and reinterned at the hospital. A few days later, Sedda turned himself in and was also sent to a psychiatric hospital. Coincidentally, both men ended up at the same facility in Reggio Emilia, but were in separate areas.\nAftermath, final escape and death\nSometime after his incarceration, Sedda managed to escape on his own and fled to Genoa, where he was caught after committing another robbery. He was returned to Genoa and died of AIDS in 1994, aged 36. In the meantime, Gagliano attempted to unsuccessfully escape on at least two occasions - once between December 1990 and January 1991, and another in June 1994. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, his mental condition improved and he was placed in regular prison facilities.\nIn 2006, Gagliano was convicted of robbery, assault and weapons possession, upon which he was transferred to Marassi Prison in Genoa, but continued committing robberies when released on furlough. His nephew Andrea also ended up in prison for unrelated convictions, and shared a prison cell with his uncle from June 2011 to September 2013.\nOn 18 December 2013, Gagliano used another furlough to ",
    "2020 book by Daniel Marwecki\nGermany and Israel: Whitewashing and Statebuilding is a 2020 book by Daniel Marwecki covering seven decades of Germany\u2013Israel relations after World War II.\nContent\nThe book covers the 1952 reparations agreement, the growing cooperation between the countries before the Six Day War in 1967, and Konrad Adenauer's Vergangenheitspolitik (\"policy for dealing with the past\") to gain Israeli recognition for the official position of Germany that West Germany represented a clean break from Nazi Germany. This included Israel's cooperation in not criticizing the \"wall of silence\" that was constructed around the Nazi period, including the integration of ex-Nazi's into political offices.\nThe controversial thesis of the book is that Germany's material support for the fledging Israeli state was offered in exchange for the whitewashing of its Nazi past. Marwecki characterizes the diplomacy between the two countries as rational and morally nihilistic, based on Israel exchanging a post-Holocaust \"whitewashing\" and normalization of Germany's international standing for military and economic assistance in support of its statebuilding project, noting the differences in the terminology used by the countries to describe the 1952 reparations agreement (Israel called it Shilumim, a debt paid but unforgiven, while Germany used the term Wiedergutmachungsabkommen meaning 'to make good again').\nMarwecki says that Germany acted in its own sovereign interest and \"never assumed the role of the penitent\".\nMarwecki's book includes discussion of closer ties with unified Germany including Angela Merkel's 2008 declaration in the Knesset that Germany had a \"special historical responsibility for Israel's security\" as part of its Staatsr\u00e4son.\nReception\nSome scholars have disagreed with Marwecki's characterization of Adenauer's support for Israel. Roni Stauber notes that Israeli historian Yeshayahu Jel\u00ednek \"emphasized Adenauer's complex motivations\". Agreeing with Jelinek, Stauber says that realpolitik alone \"cannot explain the extraordinary decisions that Adenauer made in 1960 to provide military and financial support to Israel\". Lorena De Vita notes that a growing body of work on German-Israeli relations undercuts the author's claim of \"academic negligence\".\n",
    "Kosovar social service provider and relief organisation\nCaritas Kosovo (Albanian: Caritas Kosova) is a Kosovar Catholic not-for-profit organisation. It is a member of both Caritas Europa and Caritas Internationalis. \nBackground\nCaritas Kosova was founded in 1992 as a Catholic initiative to support the local population experiencing rampant poverty, primarily through the distribution of humanitarian aid. At the time, it was not officially registered as an NGO. After the Kosovo War (1998-1999), various agencies from the global Caritas confederation became active in the country. Caritas Kosova then developed as an emergency relief actor, receiving funding and technical support from Caritas agencies in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the United States, and other countries.\n\nOver the years, Caritas Kosova expanded its presence across the country and broadened its range of activities. As of 2024, the organisation has its headquarters in Ferizaj, with regional offices in Pristina, Prizren, Gjakova, Mitrovica, and Leposavic, while implementing activities in numerous other cities and villages. Despite being a Catholic organisation, Caritas Kosova works with various communities in the country without ethnic or religious discrimination. It is one of the few organisations active in both Albanian and Serbian-dominated parts of Kosovo, as well as with other minorities such as Roma, Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Kosovo war, multiple other member organisations of the Caritas Internationalis confederation operated in Kosovo, often supporting Caritas Kosovo. At the height of the emergency response, the American Catholic Relief Services had more than 400 staff in Kosovo.

    "\nZhabinka Ghetto (1941 \u2014 October 21, 1942) was a Jewish ghetto and a place of forced relocation for the Jews of the town of Zhabinka in the Zhabinka district of the Brest region during the persecution and extermination of Jews under the Nazi occupation of Belarus during World War II.\nHistory\nBefore the war, there were 820 Jews in the town of Zhabinka, making up 57.8% of the population. The town was captured by German troops on June 23, 1941, and remained under occupation for over three years, until July 21, 1944. Upon occupying the town, the Nazis destroyed the synagogue with a tank on the same day. Implementing Hitler's plan for the \"Final Solution\" to the Jewish question, the Germans immediately began killing Jews. The head of the police in Zhabinka, appointed by the Germans, was \"Gudyma\", a former officer of the Red Army. The Nazis then herded 1,500 Jews (locals and refugees from other places) into the Zhabinka ghetto. The territory of the Zhabinka ghetto was an area fenced with barbed wire near a swamp on Kobrin Street (now Communist Street), where there were two old synagogues and several semi-destroyed houses without windows and doors.\nP. K. Ponomarenko, the party leader of Belarus, reported on the situation in the occupied regions of Belarus on August 19, 1941, informing the Soviet leadership: \"The Jewish population is being mercilessly exterminated... In Zhabinka, 16 Jews were harnessed to a gun and, driven with whips, forced to drag the gun along a sandy road... Such facts are numerous.\" The Germans and police killed almost all the inmates of the Zhabinka ghetto. 339 Jews were taken and exterminated in the Malorita ghetto, and some Jews were killed in the village of Otechizna (now the settlement of Leninsky). On October 21, 1942, the last approximately 100 Jews of Zhabinka were shot in the Mukhina Yama tract on the outskirts of the town. Among the Jews killed in Zhabinka was Malka Shliomovna Vysotskaya (married name Duksina), the sister of Vladimir Vysotsky's paternal grandfather.\nCases of rescue and Righteous Among the Nations\nLocal resident, Polish woman Floria Budishevskaya, hid two Jews in her house for almost two years \u2014 12-year-old Roma Levin and her friend Sonia Fefer. In 1944, on the eve of the liberation of the town from the occupiers, a policeman discovered Sonia and killed her. The boy managed to escape and survived. Floria was shot after brutal torture for hiding Jews. She was awarded the honorary title \"Righteous Among the Nations\" by the Israeli memorial institute Yad Vashem \"in deepest gratitude for the help given to the Jewish people during World War II.\"\nThe Grinberg family, from the moment the Zhabinka ghetto was established, managed to hide in the basement of a school. They made an arrangement with a neighbor that she would supply them with food for a fee. When the Grinbergs ran out of valuables, the neighbor began adding arsenic to the food she brought to get rid of the now \"useless\" and dangerous burden. Grinberg's wife, a pharmacist by profession, realized this, and her son Jack, then a teenager, slapped the woman. The \"savior\" was warned that if she betrayed them, she would also have to die for helping Jews. Many years later, after the war, Jack visited Zhabinka and met the woman, who, recalling the incident, said that the slap \"still burns.\"\nMemory\nIn total, about 800 Jews were killed in Zhabinka during the Holocaust. A monument was erected for them in 1956.\n",

However this was not the case and in June 2023, Jain left Millennium Management to found his own firm, Jain Global. Jain had an agreement with  Millennium Management not to solicit any of its clients until the next year.\nJain Global drew comparisons to ExodusPoint Capital Management, another hedge fund that was also set up by former Millennium Management senior employees under similar circumstances. ExodusPoint Capital Management had largest launch in history for hedge funds and Jain Global was speculated to have a launch of $10\u00a0billion that would surpass it.\nTo attract clients for fundraising, Jain Global offered discounts in fees. In January 2024, Jain Global stated that investors that those who commit at least $250\u00a0million that month will pay performance fees of just 10% which was down from 18% in 2023. Investors hat invested between $100\u00a0million to $250\u00a0million would pay performance fees of 13% and those who invested less than $100\u00a0million would pay performance fees of 15%. It also offered an annual redemption right for every investor where after the 18 months the firm starts trading, investors would be able to get their cash back within a year. However the'll pay performance fee increase of 3% and a 5% redemption fee on the capital they're withdrawing.\nHowever, despite incentives, Jain Global fell short  of its original $8\u201310\u00a0billion fundraising target.  In January 2024 Jain told clients that the firm would be aiming to raise  $5\u20136\u00a0billion and would launch in July that year.  It was speculated that Multi-manager funds had to spend of a lot money hiring employees which would eat into its returns and reduce attractiveness among investors who felt they were paying for all of the costs.\nTo prepare for its launch, Jain Global went on a hiring spree acquiring staff from peers such as Citadel LLC, Balyasny Asset Management and Brevan Howard as well as large investment banks. While the firm had multiple strategies, its main strategy would be in fundamental equities. Jain Global also set up offices in Europe and Asia\u2013Pacific. Its Asia\u2013Pacific operations would operate as separate business unit and would pursue different strategies compared to the other offices.\nOn July 1, 2024, Jain Global officially launched and started trading. It launched with $5.3\u00a0billion making it the biggest launch since ExodusPoint Capital Management in 2018. It raised funds via a drawdown fund with investors including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley and UBS. At launch, the firm had 215 employees of which 42 were portfolio managers and would trade in six strategies.

    "2015 book\nWhy You Can't Teach United States History without American Indians is a 2015 book by Susan Sleeper-Smith, Juliana Barr, Jean M. O'Brien, Nancy Shoemaker, and Scott Manning Stevens. The book is about adding discussions of Native Americans into United States history courses.\nContent\nThe book is divided has 19 essays and those essays are further divided into three parts titled \"U.S. History to 1877,\" \"U.S. History since 1877,\" and \"Reconceptualizing the Narrative.\" The sixteen essays that makes up the first two parts show how central Native Americans where to the history of the United States. \"Reconceptualizing the Narrative\", consisting of three essays, are about how readers can reinterpret settler colonialism, federalism, sovereignty, and globalism in the framework of Native American studies. All of the essays include suggested readings, citations, illustrations, and maps.\nReception\nBrenden W. Rensink of the Journal of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association said, \"Native peoples, especially Native voices, often do not appear in documentary records and archives, but their influence over the course of American history is undeniable. This makes it all the more frustrating when broad national American narratives are repeated generation after generation with wholly insufficient attention paid to the Native actors and forces that were often at the center of historical events. This volume is a tool to rectify this wrong.\". Orian Svingen of American Indian Culture and Research Journal wrote, \"Admittedly, the academy and public education are both playing \"catch-up\" with American Indian history, and a number of American history survey texts are improving their coverage of American Indians. This volume will become increasingly relevant as more states take up the mandate of ensuring that high schools include coverage of American Indian history, tribal government, and culture.\"\nAndrew Denson of the Journal of Southern History praised the book, but said that \"the volume would benefit, however, from greater discussion of teaching methods, which only a few of the contributors address directly.\"\n",

    "Ecuadorian anthropologist and feminist activist\nThal\u00eda \u00c1lvarez Carvallo (1962\u20132011) was an Ecuadorian anthropologist and feminist activist. She was a member of organizations such as Proyecto Transg\u00e9nero and Corporaci\u00f3n Humanas Ecuador, and was co-founder of the latter. She was also one of the country's first openly lesbian women to be candidates for elected office.\nAfter her death in 2011, her partner, activist Janneth Pe\u00f1a, successfully petitioned the Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security (Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social; IESS) to grant her \u00c1lvarez's widow's pension benefits, marking a milestone for Ecuadorian same-sex couples.\nEarly life and career\nIn 2002, \u00c1lvarez joined the organization Proyecto Transg\u00e9nero, where she supported the creation of Casa Trans. Within the organization she was also a teacher of transfeminist activism.\nIn 2005, she and fellow feminists founded Corporaci\u00f3n Humanas Ecuador. She also worked on several projects on sexual and reproductive health with the Ecuadorian Center for the Promotion and Action of Women. She was a member of Ecuador Adolescente until 2007.\nFor the 2007 Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly election, \u00c1lvarez was a candidate for assembly member for the alliance between the \u00a1Alfaro Vive, Carajo! and Pachakutik movements, as a representative of lesbian populations, which made her one of the first openly LGBT people to run for elected office in the country. During the work of the Constituent Assembly, she was an LGBT advisor on the preparation of the constitutional text, along with activists such as Elizabeth V\u00e1squez and Sandra \u00c1lvarez\u00a0. Specifically, Thal\u00eda \u00c1lvarez was an advisor to Assemblywoman Mar\u00eda Augusta Calle on the workers' rights panel.\nDeath\nThal\u00eda \u00c1lvarez died from pancreatic cancer in Quito on 22 March 2011. Her romantic partner, the activist Janneth Pe\u00f1a, whom \u00c1lvarez had met in 2005 and with whom she registered a domestic partnership in 2010, had difficulties completing the procedures to be able to cremate her. These were due to discriminatory policies against lesbian couples, including in the removal of her body from the morgue and the signing of family authorizations at the funeral home.\nIn August 2011, Pe\u00f1a made a request to the IESS for the montep\u00edo (worker's fund) and severance pension that was owed to her as the domestic partner of \u00c1lvarez. After a months-long process in which she received several refusals, on 14 December of that year, it was announced that Pe\u00f1a would receive these benefits, marking the first time in the history of the country that a same-sex couple received this recognition. As a result of the case, the IEES announced that from that moment on, other same-sex couples could also benefit.\nSee also\nSame-sex marriage in Ecuador\n",

    "Norwegian civil servant\nCornelius Paus (born October 29, 1726 \u2013 1799) was a Norwegian civil servant. Around 1760 he was appointed by the King-in-Council as the forest inspector of Upper Telemark, one of Norway's most important forestry regions. As forest inspector he had the authority of a judge. He was Henrik Ibsen's great-grandfather. Towards the end of his life, he lived with his daughter Hedevig Paus and son-in-law Johan Andreas Altenburg in the Altenburg House in Skien, where he died. His life has been extensively studied in the context of Ibsen studies.\nBiography\nCornelius Paus belonged to the Paus family and was the son of the lawyer and former acting district judge Paul Corneliussen Paus and Martha Blom. Andreas Blom states that the parents had to obtain royal permission to marry, but Jon Nygaard found no documentation that this was the case. He was named after his grandfather, district judge Cornelius Povelsson Paus, who himself was named after his grandfather, timber trader in Skien Cornelius Jansen Trinepol. Cornelius Paus was the brother of Johanne Paus, married to the provost of Raabyggelaget Johan Christopher von Koss, and Cathrine (Medea Maj) Paus, married to justice counselor Anthon Jacob de Coucheron. He himself married Christine Olsdatter (Falch) (1732\u20131798) from a mining family in Kongsberg in 1761. At the marriage, he was referred to as \"monsieur,\" a title used for persons of rank, and they were allowed to be married at home without prior betrothal. He was the father of Martha Paus, married to shipowner and timber trader Hans Jensen Blom; ship captain and shipowner Ole Paus, married to Johanne Plesner; and Hedevig Paus, married to shipowner and merchant Johan Andreas Altenburg. His daughter Hedevig was the mother of Marichen Altenburg and grandmother of Henrik Ibsen.\nThe specifics of his education are not known in detail, but the family had hired a tutor from 1737 to 1741. In 1745, at the age of nineteen, Cornelius Paus was employed as an assistant to the county governor of Bratsberg, Johan Frederik von L\u00f8venhielm, who was described as a benefactor of his father. He probably stayed with L\u00f8venhielm for several years, but exactly what he did until around 1760 is not known. In 1760, the royal office of forest inspector was reinstated, and about 30 such royal officials were appointed throughout Norway. Cornelius Paus then received the position of forest inspector of Upper Telemark, one of the economically most important forestry regions. As inspector, he was responsible for overseeing the forests in the district on behalf of the government and had the authority of a judge. He also took over the old district judge's farm H\u00e5tveit in L\u00e5rdal after his father. Hans Jacob Wille describes him as \"a man of the greatest mechanical genius imaginable.\" At H\u00e5tveit, he built an advanced and experimental sawmill and mill for its time. In 1788, he sold H\u00e5tveit and moved with his wife to Kongsberg, where she had family. He likely retired as inspector at this time and lived thereafter as a pensioner. The sale of the family farm in L\u00e5rdal must, according to Nygaard, be seen in connection with all the children having established themselves as burghers in Skien by that time. After his wife's death in 1798, he moved in with his daughter Hedevig and son-in-law Johan Andreas Altenburg in Skien and died in the Altenburg House in 1799. His son-in-law's sister, the then 39-year-old \"Aunt Ploug,\" moved in with them the same year that Cornelius Paus died. Cornelius Paus is described by B. Blom as \"an exceptionally skilled woodcarver and a rarely kind and good man.\"\n",

His dynamic stage presence and the ability to integrate jazz influences significantly shaped the genre.\nHe also explored music production under the alias Con*Natural and established the label Resonance, which further solidified his impact on electronic music. Thompson's collaborations spanned internationally, profoundly influencing the drum and bass scene.\nPersonal life\nIn 2010, Thompson moved to Birmingham, where he became an integral part of the community. He spoke warmly of Birmingham's spirit and diversity. Later in life, he reconnected with his father, a notable figure in the city's Caribbean community.\nDeath and legacy\nMC Conrad died on April 30, 2024, aged 52. His death was confirmed by his agency, Clinic Records, who highlighted his role as a pioneer in the drum and bass genre. Tributes from across the music world recognized him as one of the most innovative and respected vocal performers in drum and bass.\nConrad's advocacy for artists' rights and work continues to influence new generations of artists and fans, cementing his legacy as a pioneer of drum 'n' bass and an enduring voice in music history.\nMC Conrad Foundation\nIn honour of Conrad's enduring legacy and commitment to nurturing young talent, the MC Conrad Foundation was established in June 2024. The foundation aims to support young and emerging artists within the challenging landscape of the music industry.\nThe MC Conrad Foundation was launched by Conrad's niece Esther and his friend Lisa through a GoFundMe campaign, intended to equip young musicians with essential knowledge and skills. The foundation focuses on teaching intellectual property rights, PRS registration, and the basics of setting up as a self-employed artist, areas that Conrad was passionate about during his lifetime.\nThe foundation's mission is to provide a robust support system for young and marginalized artists striving to make their mark in a competitive industry. It is led by a specialised team dedicated to fulfilling Conrad's dreams and aspirations for the next generation of artists.\n",

In the aftermath of the battle, the rebels would be severely crippled, having suffered heavy casualties, and it would take many months for them to fully recover from the defeat.\nContext\nMain article: Landing of the Granma\nIn 1953, beginning their first attack against the Batista government, Fidel Castro gathered 160 fighters and planned a multi-pronged attack on two military installations. On July 26, 1953, the rebels attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago and the barracks in Bayamo, only to be defeated decisively by the far more numerous government soldiers. Numerous important revolutionaries, including the Castro brothers, were captured soon afterwards. Fidel was sentenced to 15 years in the prison Presidio Modelo, located on the Isla de la Juventud, while Ra\u00fal was sentenced to 13 years. However, in 1955, yielding to political considerations, the Batista government freed all political prisoners in Cuba, including the Moncada attackers, after which Fidel and Raul left for Mexico in exile.\nFrom Mexico, Fidel began to formulate a plan to return to Cuba to start a guerilla revolution on the island. After meeting the Argentine doctor Ernesto Guevara in Mexico City, Castro travelled to the United States, raising money from Cuban Americans and also from the toppled President of Cuba Carlos Pr\u00edo Socarr\u00e1s, who helped pay for the yahct Granma, which would be used to transfer the rebels to Cuba. After training members of the M-26 who had been sent to Mexico to assist in the coming landing, they set off from Tuxpan, Mexico in the night on November 25, 1956. To assist the landing, a rebellion organized by the 26th of July movement and planned by Hayd\u00e9e Santamar\u00eda, Celia S\u00e1nchez, and Frank Pa\u00eds occurred in Santiago de Cuba. The rebellion happened on November 30 and was meant to take place in conjunction with the landing of the Granma, which was expected to land in Cuba five days after departing from Mexico. A reception party was assigned to wait for the rebels during the uprising at the lighthouse at Cabo Cruz, with trucks and 100 men. After this, the plan was that they would raid the towns of Niquero and Manzanillo together, after which they would escape into the Sierra Maestra to conduct guerilla warfare. However, due to choppy weather, the Granma had landed two days late on December 2, and as a result, the supporting uprising was left isolated and was quickly destroyed. As a result of this, the rebels had lost the element of surprise, and the military was put on high alert in the region.\nPrelude\nThe Granma had approached the Playa las Coloradas in the early morning of December 2, 1956. Trying to spot the Cabo Cruz lighthouse, the navigator fell overboard, after which he had to be rescued. With the night quickly departing, Fidel ordered for the ship to land at the nearest point of land. However, they had crashed into a sandbar, a mile short of the intended point of rendezvous, in a mangrove swamp. The reception party had departed from the lighthouse the night prior after waiting for two days. As the morning approached, they departed the boat and were forced to leave much of their food, ammunition and medicine behind, landing on shore in the mid-morning. During the landing, they had been spotted by the Cuban coast guard, after which news of the landing was relayed to the armed forces.\nAfter splitting into two groups upon reaching dry land, the rebels were forced to gradually abandon more equipment as they navigated the bush. During this period, Batista predicted correctly that the landing would occur, and his troops were ready. Consequentially, the landing party was harassed by planes firing sporadically into the jungle, however they were unable to accurately pinpoint their location. After two days on December 4, the separate groups had found each other and trekked further inland in the direction of the Sierra Maestra with the help of a local peasant guide.\nAmbush at Alegr\u00eda de P\u00edo\nShortly after midnight on December 5, the rebel column had halted to rest for the night at a sugarcane field on a plantation the rebels would later find was owned by the sugar baron Julio Lobo, feasting on the sugarcane from the field to replenish their hunger caused by the lack of food, revealing their precense to enemy forces. The rebels, tired from the seasickness on the overcrowded Granma voyage and with blisters on their feet from marching, decided to rest for the night in an adjacent forest. As the rebels rested, their guide had abandoned them, telling nearby soldiers of the presence and location of the rebels. By this point, the rebels had abandoned nearly all of their medical supplies, r",
    "1971 studio album by Jean Shepard\nHere & Now is a studio album by American country singer Jean Shepard. It was released in March 1971 by Capitol Records and was her seventeenth studio album. The album consisted of ten tracks, most of which were covers of songs from the era. Among them were recordings first made popular by Conway Twitty and John Denver. Its only single was a new recording titled \"Another Lonely Night\". The single reached the top 20 of the US country chart in 1971. Here & Now received positive reviews from both Billboard and Cash Box magazines. \nBackground, recording and content\nJean Shepard rose to fame in the 1950s and was one of the first female country singers to find success as a solo act. For more than 20 years, her singles and albums made the country popularity charts. Beginning in the 1960s, Shepard became known for singing songs about romance from a feminine perspective. One of them was the 1971 top 20 single \"Another Lonely Night\", a song about a woman who stays with a partner despite her reluctance about him. \"Another Lonely Night\" was featured on Shepard's 1971 studio album Here & Now. The album was recorded with producer Larry Butler at the Jack Clement Studio in Nashville, Tennessee between August and December 1970. The album's ten tracks were covers of \"contemporary\" material, according to Billboard magazine. Covers on the album included Kris Kristofferson's \"For the Good Times\" and Conway Twitty's \"Hello Darlin'\".\nRelease, critical reception and singles\nHere & Now was released by Capitol Records in March 1971. It was the seventeenth studio album of Shepard's career and with the Capitol label. The label distributed the album as a vinyl LP, with five songs on either side of the disc. Billboard magazine praised the disc's production and found Shepard's covers to be \"strong items\". Cash Box magazine gave praise to Shepard's artistry on the disc, \"There's more to singing than just singing. There's feeling and sincerity. Choice of material and audience appeal. There's Jean Shepard. Tops in every category.\" The album's only single was \"Another Lonely Night\", which Capitol originally issued in October 1970. The single reached the top 20 of the US Billboard country songs chart, rising to the number 12 position in early 1971.\nTrack listing\nRelease history\n",
    "\nAmerican talent management company\nParagon Booking Agency was a musical talent management company based in Macon, Georgia, United States. It was one of the largest booking agencies in the Southeast. In the late 1970s, Ian Copeland, a music promoter, and Bill Berry, future member of R.E.M., worked for the company. \nHistory\nParagon took advantage of the success of Capricorn Records, which was founded in Macon, Georgia, in 1969 by Phil Walden and Frank Fenter. Alex Hodges, who founded Paragon, met Walden at Mercer University. Hodges saw new wave music arriving and said, according to Mike Mills, future bassist with R.E.M., 'We don't have anybody here who understands that. Find my somebody that knows this stuff.'\" It is believed that Buck Williams found Ian Copeland, who was managing bands in the United Kingdom at the time. After joining Paragon in 1977, Copeland arranged to have Squeeze tour the U.S. by booking them into small venues, with the hope of word-of-mouth doing the leg work for their popularity. He did the same for the B-52s and the Police, for which his brother Stewart was the drummer.\nArtists represented by Paragon included the Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Charlie Daniels Band. They also booked shows for the Climax Blues Band, who were managed by his other brother, Miles.\nR.E.M. drummer Bill Berry, who worked for Paragon in the late 1970s\nIn the late 1970s, Bill Berry, later the drummer with R.E.M., became employed by Paragon as a gopher.\nCopeland and Berry left Paragon in 1979; Copeland to form Frontier Booking International (F.B.I.) with Buck Williams and Berry to move to Athens, Georgia, to begin at the University of Georgia.\nThe company's office was at 560 Arlington Place in Macon. A plaque on the building denotes it as the \"booking agency for R.E.M., the Police, the B-52s and other New Wave bands. The former home of Bill Berry and Mike Mills, next door at 572 Arlington Place, also has a plaque.\nPersonnel\nRodgers Redding, brother of Otis, ran the company's rhythm and blues department, while John Huie, a Davidson College alumni, ran the college-music division of Paragon.\n",
    "American musician and producer (1954\u20132022)\nJoseph \u201cJoe\u201d Frank Chambers (July 27, 1954 \u2013 September 28, 2022) was an American musician, songwriter, record producer, A&R executive, musical stores entrepreneur, and co-founder and CEO of the Musician's Hall of Fame and Museum (MHOFM) in Nashville, Tennessee.\nIn 1978 while pursuing a record deal for his band in Nashville, he met and was befriended by producer, songwriter, and President of Epic Records at the time, Billy Sherrill. This friendship led to a career change from playing in a rock and roll band to writing and producing Country songs and working in A&R at CBS Records. Joe was introduced to the world of studio musicians and got to know and become friends with some of the greatest musicians in the world. In addition, Chambers opened a chain of music stores in 1985 (Chambers Guitars) where, in dealing with vintage guitars, he was introduced to world-renowned musicians of all genres of music. This combination of being an entrepreneur, a musician, working in the music industry, songwriting and producing gave Joe the ability and heartfelt desire to conceive the idea of a Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.\nEarly life\nChambers was born on July 27, 1954, in Columbus, Georgia. His father was Frank Chambers (October 30, 1910 - August 17, 2004) and his mother was Eugenia Brooks Chambers (December 8, 1920 - September 20, 2004). \n1969 - 1978 Musician\nIn the summer of 1969 Joe played guitar in the rock and roll band he founded (The Soul Proprietors) at age 14 in Columbus, Georgia. The band won the local Jaycees-Sponsored Battle of the Bands in his senior year in high school, and went on to win first place at the Nationals Battle of the Bands in September 1973. Chambers started writing songs at this time. The band continued to play around Georgia and nearby states.\nThe band occasionally visited the keyboard player's uncle who managed country singer Conway Twitty. Twitty was good friends with Dick Clark, and the band hoped Clark could be a path to a rock and roll career. Around 1976 Twitty offered to oversee the band recording a demo tape in Oklahoma City, Twitty's home at the time. Twitty then sent Clark the demo. Clark listened to the tape and chose one song as the best. That song was written by Chambers (music and lyrics) and this gave him confidence to continue writing.\nJoe Chambers Founder and Guitarist for The Soul Proprietors Band c. 1973\nIn 1978 the band recorded another demo in Atlanta. By this time Twitty had moved to Nashville, TN. He told the band they needed to be in Nashville if they wanted to be in the music business. Chambers and two other band members took the demo to Music Row. They stopped at CBS Records and by chance encounter in the lobby, met Billy Sherrill who was president of Epic Records (a unit of CBS). Chambers did not realize at the time how influential Sherrill was, but Joe asked him to listen to the demo. Sherrill agreed on the spot and invited the three musicians to his office. Sherrill liked the demo and, in a week, the whole band was in Nashville recording with CBS at Columbia A studio. This meeting and connection with Sherrill changed Chambers' life. Billy Sherrill and Conway Twitty took Chambers under their wings. Chambers said \"Billy ended up being my second dad\".\n1978 - 1985 Songwriter and Producer\nSherrill became his mentor and tutor, allowing Chambers to shadow him in the recording studio. Joe learned Billy's technique of producing and became friends with Nashville's A-Team studio session musicians.  As Chambers watched Sherrill conduct recording sessions for Charlie Rich, Johnny Paycheck, George Jones, Elvis Costello, Ray Charles, Marty Robbins, Tammy Wynette and others, he became fascinated by the skills of the session musicians.\nTwitty and Sherrill also listened to Chambers' songwriting and when his songs were good, they started to record some of them. Sherrill also gave Joe a job at CBS Records and signed him as a staff songwriter for his publishing company. His songs were recorded by Twitty, George Jones, Joe Diffie, Ronnie McDowell, Johnny Paycheck, Mel McDaniel, Lacy J. Dalton, The Bama Band, Terri Gibbs, Leon Everette, B.J. Thomas and others. His notable copyrights included \u201cI Meant Every Word He Said\u201d (Ricky Van Shelton, 1990), \u201cIt\u2019s Hard to Be the Dreamer (When I Used to Be the Dream)\u201d (Donna Fargo, 1982), \u201cOld 8\u00d710\u201d (Randy Travis, 1988), \u201cBeneath a Painted Sky\u201d (Tammy Wynette & Emmylou Harris, 1988) and \u201cSomebody Lied\u201d (Ricky Van Shelton's first number one record, 1987).\nChambers said in an interview \"When my songs started to be recorded, CBS hired me and I got to start producing records. I used the same session musicians Billy Sherrill used ; Pete Drake (pedal steel guitar), Kenny Buttrey (drums), 'Pig' Robbins (piano), Bob Moore (bass), Henry Strzelecki (bass), and Charlie McCoy (harmonica and guitar). Just all the great players.\" Chambers produced recordings that charted in the top 100 for various artists, on CBS Recor",

The Feelies count the Velvet Underground as a major influence and also toured with Lou Reed in the 1980s. It has received positive reviews from critics.\nReception\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 4 out of 5 stars, with critic Mark Deming writing that the decision to cover the Velvets is \"a calculated risk\" with the inevitable comparisons to the original material, especially since both bands share \"adoration of the rhythm guitar... eager embrace of simple, hypnotic percussion, and... status as East Coast individualists with an aversion to creative compromise\" and this album is successful as \"a party where five fans dive deep into some cherished songs and attack them with an ideal balance of reverence and abandon\". Bill Pearis of BrooklynVegan attended the live show on this album and calls this release \"a delight and a document of their continued love and acknowledgement of their biggest inspiration\". Editors at Pitchfork scored this release 7.7 out of 10 and critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised it for choosing songs that show the positive side of the Velvets' catalog that results in a celebratory recording that is \"a roaring rock\u2019n\u2019roll record because the Feelies play with such enthusiasm\". Jeff Tamarkin of Relix called this \"a vital addition to The Feelies\u2019 own canon\" with the band taking \"each song\u2019s essence and turn it into a Feelies tune\". Mark Berlyant of Under the Radar gave this release 8 out of 10 stars for being \"more loose, free, and just flat-out fun\" than the band's studio work.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Lou Reed, except where noted.\n\"Sunday Morning\" (John Cale and Reed)\u00a0\u2013 3:34\n\"Who Loves the Sun\"\u00a0\u2013 2:48\n\"There She Goes Again\"\u00a0\u2013 2:45\n\"What Goes On\"\u00a0\u2013 4:14\n\"Sweet Jane\"\u00a0\u2013 4:22\n\"Head Held High\"\u00a0\u2013 2:51\n\"I\u2019m Waiting for the Man\"\u00a0\u2013 4:12\n\"White Light/White Heat\"\u00a0\u2013 2:41\n\"I Heard Her Call My Name\"\u00a0\u2013 3:27\n\"New Age\"\u00a0\u2013 5:29\n\"That\u2019s the Story of My Life\"\u00a0\u2013 2:09\n\"All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties\"\u00a0\u2013 6:30\n\"Rock & Roll\"\u00a0\u2013 4:23\n\"We\u2019re Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together\"\u00a0\u2013 3:33\n\"Run Run Run\"\u00a0\u2013 4:06\n\"I Can\u2019t Stand It\"\u00a0\u2013 4:02\n\"After Hours\"\u00a0\u2013 2:08\n\"Oh!

    "\nThe presidency of Thabo Mbeki began on 14 June 1999 when he, as leader of the African National Congress, was elected by the National Assembly and sworn into office following that year's national elections. Previously, in December 1997, the ANC's 50th National Conference elected Mbeki unopposed to succeed Nelson Mandela as ANC president. On some accounts, the election was not contested because the top leadership had prepared assiduously for the conference, lobbying and negotiating on Mbeki's behalf in the interest of unity and continuity. Mbeki was re-elected to office in the 2004 general election, but resigned from office after being recalled by the ANC National Executive. His resignation took effect 25 September 2008, and he was replaced as national president by Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri for 14 hours, who was then succeeded by Kgalema Motlanthe, who had been elected ANC deputy president at the Polokwane conference, for the remainder of Mbeki's term.\nCabinet\nMain articles: First Cabinet of Thabo Mbeki and Second Cabinet of Thabo Mbeki\nPolicies\nOurs is a capitalist society. It is therefore inevitable that, in part \u2013 and I repeat, in part \u2013 we must address this goal of deracialisation within the context of the property relations characteristic  a capitalist economy.\n\u2014 Mbeki in 1999\nEconomic policy\nMbeki had been highly involved in economic policy as deputy president, especially in spearheading the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) programme, which was introduced in 1996 and remained a cornerstone of Mbeki's administration after 1999. In comparison to the Reconstruction and Development Programme policy which had been the basis of the ANC's platform in 1994, GEAR placed less emphasis on developmental and redistributive imperatives, and subscribed to elements of the liberalisation, deregulation, and privatisation at the centre of Washington Consensus-style reforms. It was therefore viewed by some as a \"policy reversal\" and embrace of neoliberalism, and thus as an abandonment of the ANC's socialist principles. Mbeki also emphasised communication between government, business, and labour, establishing four working groups \u2013 for big business, black business, trade unions, and commercial agriculture \u2013 under which ministers, senior officials, and Mbeki himself met regularly with business and union leaders to build trust and explore solutions to structural economic problems.\nMbeki speaks to District Six land claimants in Cape Town, 2001.\nConservative groups such as the Cato Institute commended Mbeki's macroeconomic policies, which reduced the budget deficit and public debt and which according to them likely played a role in increasing economic growth. According to the Free Market Foundation, during the Mbeki presidency, average annualised quarter-on-quarter GDP growth was 4.2%, and average annual inflation was 5.7%. On the other hand, the shift alienated leftists, including inside in the ANC and its Tripartite Alliance. Zwelinzima Vavi of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) was an outspoken critic of Mbeki's \"market-friendly\" economic policies, claiming that Mbeki's \"flirtation\" with neoliberalism had been \"absolutely disastrous\" for development, and especially for the labour-intensive development required to address South Africa's high unemployment rate. The discord between Mbeki and the left was on public display by December 2002, when Mbeki attacked what he called divisive \"ultra-leftists\" in a speech to the ANC's 51st National Conference.\nHowever, Mbeki clearly never subscribed to undiluted neoliberalism. He retained various social democratic programmes and principles, and generally endorsed a mixed economy in South Africa. One of the ANC's slogans in the campaign for his 2004 re-election was, \"A people's contract for growth and development.\" He popularised the concept of a dual or two-track economy in South Africa, with severe underdevelopment in one segment of the population, and, for example in a 2003 newsletter, argued that high growth alone would only benefit the developed segment, without significant trickle-down benefits for the rest of the population. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, he explicitly advocated state support for the creation of a black capitalist class in South Africa. The government's black economic empowerment policy, which was expanded and consolidated under his administration, was criticised precisely for benefitting only a small black elite and thereby failing to address inequality.\nForeign policy\nMbeki with American President George W. Bush at the White House, June 2001.\nAccording to academic and diplomat Gerrit Olivier, during his presidency Mbeki \"succeeded in placing Africa high on the global agenda.\" He was known for his Pan-Africanism, having emphasised related themes both in his famous \"I am an African\" speech in 1996 and in his first speech to Parliament as president in June 1999, when he foregrounded his trademark ideal of an \"African renaissance.\" He advocated ",

He was a well-known jurisconsult, legal theoretician, hadith master, Qur'anic exegete, historian, ascetic, theologian and muhaqqiq (researcher). Shah Waliullah Dehlawi categorized al-Rafi'i as one of the scholars who attained absolute ijtihad mujtahid mutlaq\u00a0. Al-R\u0101fi'i, along with al-Nawawi, are leading jurists of the earlier classical age, known by the Shafi'i school as the Two Shaykhs (al-Shaykhayn). As per Taj al-Din al-Subki, the purpose of this title is to indicate their superior standing within the school, as al-R\u0101fi'i and al-Nawawi were the primary sources for the later school's legal doctrines. Furthermore, al-Rafi'i was chosen by a host of scholars to be the mujaddid of the sixth/twelfth century.\nLineage\nImam al-R\u0101fi'i said, the basis of his name to al-R\u0101fi'i refers to al-R\u0101fi'iyyah, that is, the Arabs who settled in Qazwin during era of the Tabi'un or Tabi' al-Tabi'in. He also stated that his lineage is linked to Rafi Ibn Khadij a companion of the Islamic Prophet.\nEarly Life\nBirth\nAl-R\u0101fi'i was born in the year of 555 AH / 1160 AD in the city of Qazvin which is the capital of the Qazvin province, which is located approximately 130 kilometres west of Tehran, the national capital of Iran.\nEducation\nImam al-R\u0101fi'i was born into a family of scholars.

Imam al-Rafi'i's father was known to have studied under al-Ghazali's disciples. While his mother is also a very pious person who is a reference in Qazwin, especially in matters related to women. Since childhood, Imam al-R\u0101fi'i has dabbled with knowledge by learning through his father in 569H when he was 14 years old. The preparation to seek knowledge has been planted as early as childhood.\nThis can be observed through what Imam al-R\u0101fi'i himself said about his father's concern by saying: \"He (al-R\u0101fi'i's father) loved his children very much and was concerned about their affairs. Very strict in disciplining and educating them. Among his greatest kindnesses to me was his careful attitude in my education matters from the aspect of food and clothing\". In fact, his father was very careful in the matter of the sustenance given to his children where he did not give food and clothing to al-R\u0101fi'i and the other children except from something good. This shows how al-R\u0101fi'i's father cares about providing an atmosphere that can stimulate his children to follow in his footsteps as an heir of knowledge and continue his father's legacy as a Qazwin scholar. Al-R\u0101fi\u2018i is not the only one who inherited his father's knowledge, even his other brother Ab\u016b al-Fa\ue016ail was also born as a jurist and hadith expert.\nAl-R\u0101fi'i constantly attend all of his lessons since from a very young age and meet many knowledge seekers who would flock to his father. Under his father, he would study the branches of Fiqh including its principles. He would study Tafsir, Hadith, and Arabic sciences until he mastered them.\nTeachers\nHis most prominent teachers include:\nAbu al-Fadl (his father)\nAhmed bin Ismail (his mothers uncle)\nAbu Mansur al-Daylami, author of Musnad al-Firdous\nAb\u016b al-\u02bbAl\u0101\u02bc al-Hamadh\u0101n\u012b\nAb\u016b al-Fat bin al-Ba\ue017ti\nAb\u016b Sulayman al-Zubairi\nImam Ab\u016b Sulaiman Ahmad bin Hasnawih\n'Abdullah bin Abi al-Futuh\nScholarly life\nScholastic expertise\nImam Al-R\u0101fi'i was regarded as the most learned person of his era because of his proficiency in both science and Sharia law. He was the Shaykh of Shafi'is of his time and was favoured over others. If the title two Shaykhs are mentioned, it only pertains to al-R\u0101fi'i and al-Nawawi. He was a prominent Hadith scholar in his day, renowned for his sharp memory and mastery of several branches of the Hadith, including its rules, principles, defects, weak and authentic narrations, abrogated narrations, its forms, jurisprudence, and meanings. He was a diligent legal theorist, a highly motivated jurist who mastered all branches of jurisprudence, and an unparalleled investigator among the great scholars of the Shafi'i masters, his fame spread among Arabs and non-Arabs. He was knowledgeable in the Arabic philological, linguistic, and grammar fields. He was well-known for his piety, asceticism and had mastered Tasawwuf. He had a flawless recitation and was an accomplished debater and orator. He was very skilled in Quran exegesis and history. With his various scientific accomplishments, he was bestowed with the esteemed ti",
    "\nThe first UPA attack on Mizocz - an attack by Ukrainian Insurgent Army units on the town of Mizocz, located in the Zdolbunov district of Volhynia province, and battles with a Hungarian army unit and police, combined with the murder of more than 100 Poles and the burning of most of the village buildings. The attack took place on the night of 24 to 25 August or 31 August to 1 September 1943, during the German occupation. The consequence of the attack was the evacuation of the surviving Polish civilians to Zdolbunov.\nBefore attack\nFrom the beginning of the German occupation, the Ukrainians of Mizocz began to show hostility towards the Poles, but according to W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Ewa Siemaszek, the presence of a company of Germans on the site prevented them from making more anti-Polish appearances until the summer of 1943. There were murders of individuals and, in July 1943, the murder of 15 people grazing cattle. During the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia , Polish refugees from villages exterminated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) were drawn to the town; burials of brought bodies took place in the cemetery every day. Some of the new arrivals, seeing no possibility of survival, volunteered for forced labour in the Third Reich or left for larger centres. Among the refugees, the Germans recruited 40 men for the police. From 1943, a Hungarian company was also stationed in the town and helped the Poles by feeding them and giving them weapons.\nIn the summer of 1943, a company of Germans left Mizocz and the Hungarian garrison was also reduced. The Hungarians and the police were stationed in the buildings of Count Dunin-Karwicki's palace and the sugar factory, which were located in the western part of the town.\nIn August 1943, the Miso people lived in anticipation of an attack by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army; just before the attack, the Ukrainians moved out of the town. Stanis\u0142awa Kowalska was warned of the attack by the Ukrainian Dawidiuk.\nAttack\nPlaque at the Monument to the Victims of the Crimes Committed against Polish Citizens by the OUN-UPA mentioning Mizocz\nAt the end of August 1943 (on the night of 24-25 August or 31 August/1 September), shortly after midnight, two Ukrainian Insurgent Army's kurenas (Dubiensk and Krzemieniec) attacked Mizocz from the east and started exterminating Poles and burning buildings. They were murdered mainly with white weapons (sickles, axes, knives). The fight against the attackers was undertaken by Polish policemen and armed civilians, as well as a Hungarian company. The fighting and slaughter of the population lasted all night. The number of casualties W. and E. Siemaszek estimate at over 100, although higher estimates also exist. The victims were mostly refugees from the villages. According to the Siemaszko family, the underground AK platoon that existed in Mizocz played no role in the defence of the Poles.\nMaksym Skorupski's \"Maks\" sotnia captured the sugar factory, but did not manage to take the sugar, as it was ordered to retreat due to the appearance of German forces in the area. According to the Siemaszko family, the reason for the aborted attack may have been the Hungarian relief from Zdolbunov, which arrived in Mizocz in the morning.\nSubsequent events\nOn the second day, the Poles collected the dead from the streets, buried them in a mass grave and almost all of them left the 80% burned town evacuating by rail to Zdolbunov. Along the way, the refugees were constantly fired upon by the Ukrainians, to which the armed Poles responded with fire. Those who remained, in time, left on their own. The Czechs, who had not yet been attacked by the UPA, also left the village.\nThe second UPA attack on Mizoch occurred on 3 November 1943.\n",
    "In 1844\nJohann Georg Christian Kapp (March 18, 1798 \u2013  December 31, 1874) was a German philosopher and political activist. He taught Hegelian philosophy at the University of Erlangen and later at the University of Heidelberg. A friend of Ludwig Feuerbach, he was known for his political activism for the cause of the democratic left.\nLife and work\nCaricature of Kapp c. 1848. He called the assembly members as corpses.\nKapp was born in Bayreuth where his family included Franconian theologians and philologists. His father Johann Kapp was a councillor married to Henriette n\u00e9e M\u00fcller. His relatives Johann Erhard Kapp and Christian Erhard Kapp were historians. His uncle Johannes Kapp was a high school preacher. His brother Alexander Kapp became an educator.\nFrom 1816 to 1819 he studied theology at Berlin with Friedrich Schleiermacher, August Neander and Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette, but shifted to philosophy under the influence of Hegel. His doctorate (1819) and habilitation (1823) were in Erlangen. He then taught and wrote. His early writings led to criticism from Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling who claimed that Kapp had plagiarised. In 1824 he became a professor of philosophy at Erlangen. He met Ludwig Feuerbach with whom he maintained regular correspondence. In the 1830s he moved to Heidelberg, shortly after marrying Emilie Friederike who came from a wealthy family, allowing him to work privately. The move followed his dismissal from Bavarian service in 1839 and he accepted an honorary professor position at the University of Heidelberg. In 1840 he became a full professor and his lectures were popular. In 1842 he campaigned for the habilitation of Moritz Carriere who was Hegel's student and had been rejected by the University of Berlin. The Heidelberg theology professors Ullmann and Umbreit also rejected Carriere.\nFeeling that the University did not have enough freedom he started having discussions at his home and gave lectures at the Heidelberg town hall. The meetings became a regular place for Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Theodor Welcker, Berthold Auerbach, Gottfried Keller, Hermann Hettner, Bernhard Fries, Jacob Moleschott, Heinrich Bernhard Oppenheim, and others. Kapp was increasingly seen as an outsider in the university and in 1842 he objected to the introduction of half-yearly examinations. In 1843 there were formal complaints from other faculty members about him. He considered the objections to be primarily political in their foundation and he offered to resign and the resignation was finally accepted in 1844. Feuerbach wrote to him congratulating him on his release from the prison of the university and \"...the Neckar valley is indeed magnificent, but the narrower the valley, the wider the court councilors and other university poodles make themselves.\"\nKapp then entered politics and was elected to the Baden Chamber of Deputies for Offenburg in 1845. Kapp was involved in the production of the \"Offenburg manifesto\" in 1847. Kapp sought the subordination of the church to the state which he saw as the only guarantor of civil order and progress. He noted the history of France since the fall of Napoleon and claimed that the police state was doomed to fail. After the March Revolution of 1848 he claimed that it had been caused by the state's blockade of reform. He took part in the assemblies on 12 September 1847 and 19 March 1848 led by the radical republican groups of Gustav von Struve and Friedrich Hecker as well as in meetings of constitutional-moderate liberals in Heppenheim in October 1847. After being elected into an assembly he tried to remain non-partisan but was forced to resign from the Frankfurt National Assembly. He considered the assembly to be made up of corpses.\n",

She will represent the United States at the 2024 Summer Paralympics.\nEarly life and education\nRaleigh grew up playing several sports, including playing in the boy's leagues for basketball and baseball, where she was the only girl on the team. In middle school she made the decision to focus on swimming, with dreams of making the Olympic team. At Toms River High School South, she was a state champion and became the second freshman in state history to become the state record-holder in any swimming event. She moved to Florida when she was 15 to attend Pine Crest School, where she was a four-time high school state champion in Florida.\nAfter graduating from Pine Crest, she received a scholarship to swim for Florida State University. She competed there for two years, earning multiple accolades including Athletic Coast Conference (ACC) Freshman of the Year, and two back-to-back National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All-American honors. An opportunity arose to finish out her NCAA career at Auburn University. Instead, she got married, and three months later was pregnant with her first daughter. She then transferred to Rowan University where she won an NCAA Division III national title in the butterfly.\nCareer\nOn March 12, 2023, at the Citi Para Swimming World Series, Raleigh Crossley set a world record in the 50 metre backstroke S9 event with a time of 32.01.

In 2008 she was involved in another accident where she was hit by a car as a pedestrian. The blunt force trauma triggered a non-cancerous tumor to start developing in her brain, and as a result she began to lose function on the left side of her body.\nOn December 12, 2018, while on a ski trip with her family, her son picked up what he thought was a snowball and struck her in the head. The snowball was actually a ball of ice, and when it knocked her in the head she sustained a traumatic brain injury. She experienced paralysis on her left side due to the bleeding of a previously unknown blood tumor in her brain. On January 7, 2019, she had the tumor removed.\nRaleigh Crossley is married and has three children. They are non-binary using she/her and they/them pronouns.\n",
    "Genus of dogfish shark that existed during the Cretaceous\nProtosqualus (\"Primitive Squalus\") was a genus of dogfish shark that existed during the Cretaceous. Fossils have been found in Europe (mainly in France, Germany, Lithuania, The United Kingdom and Ukraine), India and South America. The type species is Protosqualus sigei, which was found around an Albian aged deposit in France.  Some species show some level of heterodonty, for example Protosqualus barringtonensis shows a rather high level of heterodonty within its teeth. The oldest specimens are from the Speeton Clay Formation. Protosqualus teeth are quite common in the Grey Chalk deposit of England. The genus went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous during the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, with the last species in the genus being Protosqualus argentinensis from southern Argentina as well as possibly being from earlier deposits in India.\nDescription\nProtosqualus, like most fossil sharks, is known from mostly dental remains. Protosqualus had an undulated ventral margin of the dental crown that was distal to the apron. Unlike modern members of the genus Squalus, Protosqualus had dental crowns which did not have a great degree of labiolingual compression. The holotype of P. sigei featured a tooth with small gaps between them, each with a clearly defined slanted tip. Its front ledge was well-developed and slightly raised, culminating in a rounded shape firmly attached at the base of the crown. The back of the tooth appeared flat, with a slight depression near the ledge. The root was low and thick, angled slightly in relation to the crown, and exhibited minor protrusions on both its front and rear sides. The bottom of the tooth was flat and gently curved, with the holes on the sides either separated or, less commonly, connected by a groove. The teeth of P. pachyrhiza were more bulky. Protosqualus glickmani had a broad cusp. Protosqualus argentinensis had defined serrated cutting edges and was probably the largest member of the genus. Protosqualus barringtonensis may have shown some sexual dimorphism in the teeth, however all teeth show a short cusp. P.albertsi had a broad, labial protuberance.\nThe extant spiny dogfish is one of the many modern relatives of Protosqualus\nClassification\nProtosqualus is a member of the Squalidae within the Squaliformes group. Today, only two extant genera of squalids exist. Squalids tend to note have the teeth in their lower jaw not being any larger than the teeth seen in the upper jaw. Below is a cladogram showing where Squalidae sits in the Squaliform clade.\nIn 2001, Adnet & Cappetta found the following position for Protosqualus.\nPaleoecology\nProtosqualus lived alongside other chondrichthyans as well as other types of fish. It also lived alongside mosasaurs and plesiosaurs.\nThe mosasaur, Clidastes hunting ammonites\n",
    "Irish goat mascot on USS Vermont\nKing Skellig M\u00f6r (Irish: Sceilig Mh\u00f3r ; \u2013 July 7, 1909) was an Irish goat who served as the mascot of the USS Vermont battleship. Following the goat's importation from Killorglin, Ireland, he was involved in a length ownership dispute between various Irish-American fraternal organizations in Massachusetts.\nImportation\nBorn in Killorglin, Ireland, King Skellig M\u00f6r was purchased by the Knights of Saint Brendan in 1905 after member Michael Shea saw the goat among his father's herd while visiting Ireland's Puck Fair. Upon arriving in the United States, the foreign goat was seized for deportation by the federal government, but the Knights of Saint Brendan successfully lobbied President Theodore Roosevelt to intervene and allow King Skellig M\u00f6r to remain.\nOwnership dispute\nIn 1906, Colonel Roger F. Scannell resigned as President of the Knights of Saint Brendan to start the Kerryman's Association as a competing organization. Citing his designation to oversee the goat, Scannell claimed ownership over King Skellig M\u00f6r and prohibited the goat from being displayed at fairs, prompting a lawsuit that initially granted a writ of replevin returning ownership to the Knights of Saint Brendan.\nIn a series of court cases, Scannell cited payments for the goat's purchase, transportation, presentation, and trademark made in his name, which the Knights of Saint Brendan disputed as subsequently reimbursed by the organization. Explaining that the reimbursement committees acted in violation of the organization's bylaws, Scannell argued that such activities did not prove a transfer of ownership. Following appeals, the parties compromised by donating the goat to serve as a mascot for the USS Vermont.\nIn March 1909, Arthur D. Hill, District Attorney for Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and Scannell's lawyer, dedicated King Skellig M\u00f6r's arrival on the USS Vermont. Following the goat's death in July 1909 from indigestion, the Museum of Science in Boston, Massachusetts, acquired King Skellig M\u00f6r's taxidermied remains in 1910.\nLegacy\nIn June 2024, artist Duke Riley staged an exhibition at the Praise Shadows Art Gallery in Brookline, Massachusetts, titled The Repatriation of King Skellig M\u00f6r. The exhibition featured scrimshaw engravings on consumer goods as a form of plastic recycling. The engravings depicted scenes of nautical history, such as a sailor grieving over King Skellig M\u00f6r's death. To promote the exhibition, Riley purchased an advertisement in The Boston Globe newspaper seeking information on King Skellig M\u00f6r's remains, as the Museum of Science could not locate them.\n",

The organisation was officially registered with the Ministry of Social Affairs on 15 June 1968. Since its inception, Caritas Jordan has continued to work with refugees and people from Jordan experiencing poverty.\nIn the aftermath of the Gulf War (1990\u20131991), Caritas Jordan assisted individuals arriving from Iraq. The organisation also supported Iraqi refugees following the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and during the Iraqi civil war (2006\u20132008). The Syrian civil war, which began in 2011, led to a significant influx of Syrian refugees, and Caritas Jordan provided essential aid to many of them. Additionally, during the War in Iraq (2013\u20132017), the organisation helped Iraqi refugees arriving in 2014 from the Nineveh Plains and Mosul.\nWork\nIn 2020, Caritas Jordan operated 17 centres across the country to provide services for people in need.

    "\nSegula Cemetery is the first cemetery in the city of Petah Tikva, Israel. The cemetery is located in the Segula industrial area of the city and is considered one of the oldest active cemeteries in Israel.\nThe cemetery spans an area of approximately 270 dunams and contains around 80,000 graves, the vast majority of which belong to residents of Petah Tikva and Bnei Brak. The other plots have been sold for a fee.\nThe first headstone in Segula Cemetery\nHistory\nThe cemetery was established in 1888, ten years after the founding of the city of Petah Tikva. The tombstone of the first deceased person is inscribed with the date 19 Tishrei 5649 (1888), as well as the Jewish phrase \"A covenant is made with the lips,\" indicating that words spoken by a person have the power to change reality.\nOne of the first notable individuals buried in the cemetery was Rabbi Mordechai Gimpel Yaffe. The cemetery also contains the graves of the city's founders and pioneers, including members of the Stampfer family, the Raab family, Avraham Shapira, Sender Haddad, and mayors Pinchas Rashish and Yosef Sapir. Additionally, local rabbis such as Rabbi Yechiel Mordechai Gordon, Rabbi Reuven Katz, the dayan Rabbi Yeshayahu Moshehrer, Rabbi David Salomon, and his son, the city's rabbi Baruch Shimon Salomon, are buried there.\nInitially, the cemetery covered an area of three and a half dunams, and over the years it expanded to its current size of around 250 dunams.\nThe cemetery contains various sections, the oldest being the \"Founders' Section,\" where the city's founders, guardians, mayors, rabbis, and yeshiva heads who lived and worked there are buried. There is a special section dedicated to the fallen members of the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi organizations, as well as a section for IDF soldiers from the War of Independence. In the center of the cemetery is a new military section. The cemetery also contains a section for the victims of HaBonim disaster and four of the victims of the hikers' disaster in Ein Gedi.\nFrom the 1950s to the 1980s, the cemetery was managed by Ben-Zion Galis, a Jerusalemite. During his tenure, the cemetery developed and expanded, and a funeral home was built (now named after him \"Ohel Ben-Zion\"). After his death, the city of Petah Tikva commemorated him by naming the main street leading to the cemetery after him.\nThe cemetery is managed according to the customs of Jewish Jerusalem, as Petah Tikva was established by Jerusalemites. Accordingly, funerals are held at night to avoid the prohibition of \"delaying the burial,\" and the chevra kadisha tries to prevent the planting of trees within the cemetery grounds.\nRebbes Buried in Segula Cemetery\nSeveral rebbes who passed away and were buried abroad have been reinterred in Segula Cemetery. The most famous among them is Rabbi Joseph Meir Weiss, the \"Imrei Yosef,\" the first rebbe of the Spinka Hasidic dynasty, who passed away in 1909. In 1972, his remains were brought from Romania at the initiative of his grandson, Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Weiss of Spinka, Bnei Brak. An ohel (tent) was built over the grave of the \"Imrei Yosef,\" and later Rabbi Yaakov Yosef himself, along with several family members, was buried there.\nAnother rebbe whose remains were brought to Israel and buried in Segula is Rabbi Natan David Rabinowitz of Partziva. His reburial in 1977 was initiated by his son, Rabbi Baruch Yehoshua Yerachmiel Rabinowitz, the rebbe of Munkacs, who was also buried in Segula Cemetery.\n",
    "\nOfficers from the 28th Battalion of Ca\u00e7adores (28th BC) of the Brazilian Army launched two tenentist revolts in Sergipe in 1924 and 1926. The first, inspired by the S\u00e3o Paulo Revolt of 1924, removed state governor Maur\u00edcio Graccho Cardoso on 13 July and dominated the capital Aracaju until its defeat by loyalist troops on 3 August. The second, inspired by the passage of the Prestes Column through Piau\u00ed, was launched on 18 January 1926 and suppressed in four hours of combat. The uprisings marked a combative political spirit in the battalion, and one of its leaders, Augusto Maynard Gomes, was appointed governor of Sergipe after the Revolution of 1930.\nThe first revolt\nIn response to the tenentist revolt that began on 5 July 1924 in S\u00e3o Paulo, several battalions from Brazil's Northeast region received orders to embark for S\u00e3o Paulo, where they would join the loyalist forces. But the 28th BC, in Sergipe, was full of supporters of the revolt, and until a year earlier it was commanded by lieutenant colonel Bernardo de Ara\u00fajo Lima, head of the garrison in uprising in Rio Claro, S\u00e3o Paulo. Based in the central area of Aracaju, its officers were immersed in street conversations, especially among the middle class.\nConspiracies soon began for an uprising in solidarity with that in S\u00e3o Paulo. For logistical reasons, an uprising in the Northeast was not in the plans of the rebels in S\u00e3o Paulo, and even they would be surprised by the news of its outbreak. The conspirators' goal in Sergipe was to prevent the 28th BC and other battalions from boarding for S\u00e3o Paulo, either by convincing them to join the revolt or by attracting them into a confrontation. In this way, the loyalist pressure on the S\u00e3o Paulo rebels would be relieved.\nIn the early hours of 13 July, captain Eur\u00edpedes Lima and lieutenants Maynard and Soarino took charge of the battalion. The soldiers present were divided into three platoons: one stayed with captain Euripedes in the barracks and the others left at 2:30 with the lieutenants. Soarino attacked the Government Palace, and Maynard, the most difficult target, the Police Battalion barracks. The Palace's guard, all lit up, was stunned by the shots of the attackers, hidden in the garden. After they fled, Soarino reinforced Maynard. The police barracks were surrounded and surrendered when the ammunition ran out. The rebels had no casualties, while the loyalists had two dead and two injured. Major Jacintho Dias Ribeiro, commander of the 28th BC, went to the battalion and tried to impose his authority, but was arrested by captain Eur\u00edpedes. Other officers who disagreed with the revolt were also arrested.\nAt 5:00 the state governor was surrounded in his residence, where he had only six guards. The rebels' objective was not statewide, but national, the deposition of president Artur Bernardes. So they invited the governor to join. When he refused, he was arrested. At dawn, the uprising was already much more successful than the one that occurred in S\u00e3o Paulo, which did not manage to depose the state government. The rebels offered the government to general Calazans, who also refused. The solution was to establish a military junta. There were no significant changes in public administration, and most authorities remained in their posts. Civil servants received no benefits or reprisals. Captain Euripedes exercised command of the battalion, but the charismatic leadership was that of lieutenant Maynard.\nMany volunteers presented themselves to the battalion; when their numbers dwindled, captain Euripides mobilized the reservists on 26 July. From an initial force of 316 men, the rebels numbered 770. They had the sympathy of various social classes, but rumors about the loyalist reaction resulted in an exodus of Aracaju's population to the countryside. The rebels sought a deal with the local oligarchs, but these, in turn, saw the uprising as a threat to their power and mobilized their \"patriots\" to stop the revolt.\nIn order to defend Aracaju from an amphibious invasion, the rebels turned off the lighthouse, liad mines on the shore, removed the signaling buoys and dug trenches on the beaches. Captain Eur\u00edpedes remained in Aracaju, while lieutenants Maynard and Soarino organized land defenses, respectively on the northern (Ros\u00e1rio do Catete and Carmo) and southern (S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o and Itaporanga) fronts. The loyalist reaction was led by general Mar\u00e7al Nonato de Faria, commander of the 6th Military Region. He had at his disposal the destroyer Alagoas, which appeared on the horizon in Aracaju on the 23rd, creating a stir.\nThe real offensive came from land. The 20th, 21st and 22nd battalions, which also had orders to board for S\u00e3o Paulo, remained in the Northeast. On 27 July, these three units and another contingent of the police were of Bahia were in Salgado, in the south, totaling 1,267 men.

    "\nThe volcanic clastic Ohanapecosh Formation is an early state of cascade volcanism.  It has been dated to the middle Oligocene .  The strata are as much as 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi) thick, with exposures visible in more than 400 square kilometres (99,000 acres) of a total area exceeding 700 square kilometres (170,000 acres).  It is found throughout Mount Rainier National Park and the surroundings mountains.  It is the foundation on which the Mt Rainier volcano was built. The formation has been identified in the Snoqualmie area to the north and as far south as the Columbia River Gorge including Mount St. Helens and  Mount Adams.  It extends from the west at Mt Rainier and Lake Tapps east to Little Naches River valley.\nDescription\nThe contact of the Ohanapecosh Formation on the Puget Group is everywhere conformable and m the Spiketon Formation and Renton Formation reflect a continuous process without a break in time. In contrast, the contact with the Naches Formation is an unconformity as seend in th Summit Creek Sandstone  in the areas from White Pass east to the Naches River. In the Mt Rainier National Park area, the Ohanapecosh Formation is overlain by the Oligocene (25-27 Ma) Stevens Ridge Member, that is the lower part of the Fifes Peaks Formation. At Backbone Ridge, southeast of Mt Rainier, clasts of the Ohanapecosh Formation and tree trunks are found in the base of the lowest Stevens Ridge Member.\nVarious late Oligocene and Miocene eruptive centers are preserved in central Washington. The Mount Aix caldera (late Oligocene), Tieton volcano (Miocene) and Columbia River Basalt Group (Miocene) are late Oligocene and Miocene eruptive centers east of the Mt Rainier National Park. Fifes Peaks volcano is to the northeast of the national park, and the Tatoosh pluton is to the south.  The Eocene-Miocene formations are covered by thick Quaternary volcaniclastic deposits and lavas.\nLithology\nThe Ohanapecosh Formation is composed of volcanic clastic rocks and lava flows. The lava flows are interbedded with the coarse volcanic clastic rocks which are mostly mudflow deposits. Locally they can be thick, grading into finer clastic rocks. The ash flows and rhyolite flows are a small portion, less than 1 percent, of the formation. The Ohanapecosh Formation has been divided into three parts: (1) lava flow mudflow complexes, (2) adjacent accumulations of volcanic clastic rocks, and (3) ash flows and rhyolites. \nLava Flow-Mudflow Complexes\nTwo major complexes of lava flows and associated mudflow deposits have been identified. The smaller one is in an irregular north-trending belt east and southeast of Mount Rainier. It is best exposed in the steep cirque walls of the Sarvent Glacier, i.e., Banshee Peak. The larger lava complex is in the Mount Wow-Satulick Mountain area, the southwestern part of the park.  It can also be found in the valley of the North Puyallup River on the western park boundary.  The Ohanapecosh formation of these areas is separated by extensive outcrops of the Tatoosh pluton and by deposits from the Mount Rainier volcano.  The lava flows and interbedded mudflows are seen on Stevens Peak. These complexes lens shaped. The maximum thickness of the Sarvent complex is about 3,800 feet (1,200\u00a0m), and the Mount Wow complex is at least 7,000 feet (2,100\u00a0m).  Lava flows and coarse mudflow deposits form more than 70 percent of these units. Fresh exposures of Ohanapecosh lava are dark brownish gray, greenish gray, or maroon; most weathered surfaces are brown or maroon. Individual flows are from 10 to 100 feet (3.0 to 30.5\u00a0m) thick. All the Ohanapecosh lavas have been pervasively altered. \n",
    "2024 album by Cola\nThe Gloss is the second studio album by Canadian post-punk band Cola. It was released on June 14, 2024, via Fire Talk Records.\nThe Gloss received positive acclaim upon its release, with a Metacritic score of 79/100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Critics praised the album's blend of '80s and '90s melody, rhythm, and straightforward production, while less favorable evaluations decried the record's lack of progression beyond the band's established songwriting sensibilities.\nBackground\nOn April 4, 2023, Cola released the song \"Keys Down If You Stay\", the group's first studio release since their debut record, Deep in View. The song was released as a single without an accompanying album announcement.\nAnother single, \"Bitter Melon\", followed nearly a year later on March 13, 2024, but The Gloss wasn't formally announced until the release of \"Pallor Tricks\", a third single, on April 9. \"Albatross\" followed on May 9, with \"Pulling Quotes\" serving as the final pre-album single before the record's release on June 14.\nComposition and songwriting\nBand members Tim Darcy, Ben Stidworthy, and Evan Cartwright characterized the songwriting process for The Gloss as a product, in part, of their experiences making Deep in View. \"A band\u2019s first record is always going to be an experiment,\" Cartwright said. \"You bring things to the table without knowing what the band sounds like yet. Once you play the material, tour, and record, you realize what the band actually sounds like.  is always more relaxed because you know what you\u2019re writing for.\u201d\nDarcy contextualized the record's contrast to not only Cola's previous record, but to his and Stidworthy's previous work with Montreal post-punk band Ought: \u201cOught songs used to be carved out of these gargantuan jams ... Cola is a refreshing change of pace. To go into a room together and have the songs already be fairly apparent was great.\u201d\nStidworthy spoke to a similar pursuit of directness in contributing to The Gloss, which he jokingly referred to as a \"rustic\" quality arising in part from the pentatonic scales around which he crafts his bass parts. \u201cSpeaking for myself, I wanted at times \u2013 because I was comfortable with my role as a bassist \u2013 for my musical voice to be heard more,\" Stidworthy said. \"Specifically with this record, I tried hard to make the bass more interesting, which I know sounds like a big statement. \u2026 So I decided to do something even more simple \u2026 although 'simple' is in this case quite a loaded word.\u201d\nCritical reception\nThe Gloss received modest acclaim upon its release. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score out of 100 to ratings from publications, the album received a mean score of 79 based on 9 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nRolling Stone's Jon Dolan called the album \"top-shelf minimalist guitar racket,\" highlighting its \"propulsive and jumpy\" rhythm and the \"self-interrogating attitude\" of its lyrics: \"Laying bright, bracing guitars over taut, tetchy, minimalist drums and bass, their sound brings to mind Wire and the very earliest Cure and Echo and the Bunnymen. Yet where those bands had the decaying post-industrial England of the 1970s as a backdrop, Cola are products of our own more ambiently dehumanized times.\"\nWriting for Pitchfork, Stuart Berman called the album \"a model of focus, precision, and economy \u2014 the sound of players who know exactly who they are and what they want to do\" and praised its \"nervous, claustrophobic tension\". Matt Young's 7/10 review for The Line of Best Fit indicated assent, highlighting \"a mix of winsome romanticism and righteous anger\" he noticed on The Gloss \u2014 but admitting that within that interplay, \"it\u2019s occasionally difficult to see which are tongue-in-cheek or genuine.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Timothy Darcy, Ben Stidworthy, and Evan Cartwright\nPersonnel\nMusicians\nTim Darcy \u2013 lead vocals, guitar\nBen Stidworthy \u2013 bass, guitar (track 3), mellotron (track 3), organ (track 2)\nEvan Cartwright  \u2013 drums, supercollider (track 7, track 9), lead guitar (track 9)\nTechnical\nValentin Ignat \u2013 recording and mixing\nNezar Keplatskyy \u2013 assistant engineering\nSteph Dutton  \u2013 cover artwork and design\n",
    "Closed Behavioral Modification Center in Southern Utah, US \nSecond Chances in Southern Utah, also known as \u201cSCINSU,\u201d was a private, all-girls behavioral youth modification facility and part of the troubled teen industry. The facility was located in La Verkin, Utah, the program ceased operations in 2022 for reasons that have not been publicly disclosed.\nHistory\nAdam AhQuin, the founder and director of Second Chances in Southern Utah (SCINSU), previously served as a gymnastics coach and the principal of Mana Academy, a K-12 charter school. He was a co-founder and program director of the now-defunct Maximum Life Skills Academy, a behavioral modification center, whose license was revoked in 2004 after a 31-year-old aide was beaten to death by two 17-year-old residents. SINSU's registered start date is October 9, 2014. SCINSU, a residential treatment center, reportedly originated from a facility owned by Robert Lichfield called \u201cCross Creek Manor\u201d. Before founding Second Chances, Adam AhQuin reportedly worked at other WWASP programs, such as Olympus Academy and Horizon Academy. Prior to founding SCINSU, AhQuin was involved with other WWASP programs, including Olympus Academy and Horizon Academy. Further tying the family to the industry, his brother Clayton AhQuin Jr. and their father, Clayton Sr., were also reportedly associated with SINSU.\nThe last publicly available licensing approval for Second Chances of Southern Utah was valid from May 1, 2021, to April 30, 2022. Conflicting information exists about the program's closure date. Most sources indicate it closed in 2022, but at least one source suggests it may have closed in 2023.\nProgram\nAccording to the now-defunct website of Second Chances in Southern Utah, the program offered three treatment packages. The first package, called \"Open Mind/Passion Interest Mapping/Add To Self Principles,\" lasted for three months. The second package, named \"Hard Work & The Aloha Principles,\" extended for six months. The third package, \"SCINSU Growing Principles! Positive Attitude/Integrity/Passion Interest Mapping Home & Beyond,\" was a comprehensive one-year program. Prior to closing, the last publicly available enrollment information listed a total of 20 students.\nAlthough Adam AhQuin denied any affiliation with WWASP Programs, SCINSU reportedly adopted program structures similar to those of the controversial World Wide Association of Specialty Programs (WWASP). There is conflicting online sentiment about the actual nature of the programs structure and there is little publicly available information. Certain individuals claiming to be former residents online allege the program's structure was rife with abuse.\nControversy\nCorrective Action Plan\nSecond Chances in Southern Utah was given a corrective action plan for multiple violations, as detailed by the Utah Department of Human Services' Office of Licensing in a letter dated September 10, 2019. The noted issues included a delayed report of a critical incident involving a staff member and five clients from May 5, 2019, which was not reported until August 26, 2019. Additionally, it was reported that during this incident, a staff member took five clients off-campus without proper authorization and provided at least four of them with a vape to smoke. Another violation noted was the inadequate staff-to-client ratio observed on September 4, 2019, which did not meet the required administrative standards. These infractions required the implementation of a formal corrective action plan to address and rectify the compliance failures.\n",

    "\nPrincess Isabelle of Salm-Salm (German: Isabelle Maria Rosa Katherina Antonia, Prinzessin zu Salm-Salm) (13 February 1903 \u2013 10 January 2009) was the child of Emanuel, Hereditary Prince of Salm-Salm and member of the House of Salm-Salm. She was the longest lived royal European centenarian to have ever lived.\nBaroness of Lo\u00eb\nLife\nShe was born as Princess Isabelle Maria Rosa Katherina Antonia of Salm and Salm-Salm as the eldest of five siblings. Her parents were Emanuel, Hereditary Prince of Salm-Salm and the Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria. She spent her childhood with her siblings in Potsdam, where her father served in the bodyguard of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia. Her mother was close friends with Crown Princess Cecilie. She had two sisters and two brothers: Princess Rosemary of Salm-Salm, Prince Nikolaus of Salm-Salm, Princess C\u00e4cilie of Salm-Salm and Prince Franz of Salm-Salm. The youngest brother died of diphtheria at the age of four.\nAfter the death of the father in the First World War on the Eastern Front, the family moved to their ancestral home in Anholt Castle in Isselburg. Isabelle spent her youth there and met Count Felix von Lo\u00eb of Wissen Castle and fell in love with him. The wedding of the 22-year-old princess with the 29-year-old Count von Lo\u00eb took place on September 2, 1925 in Anholt. Through her marriage to Felix von Lo\u00eb, Isabell became Countess of Lo\u00eb in 1925 and moved into Wissen Castle. The couple had seven children.\nAfter the wedding, she devoted herself to the preservation and reconstruction of Wissen Castle and the Wissen businesses. But in 1939 Felix von Lo\u00eb was called up into the Wehrmacht and had to go to the front. Isabelle looked after the property and took over the management of the Wissen businesses. She only saw her husband during the short front leave. In 1944 he died at the front in Latvia. In the same year, her eldest son Fritz was drafted into military service and lost an eye to a grenade splinter.\nCommitted to her faith and Christian virtues, she took part in the Resistance against National Socialism. She used her contacts with the noble families and members of the Catholic Action to save numerous people from the concentration camp and to rescue innocent prisoners from the penitentiaries, including a priest from Leipzig, whom she smuggled past the Gestapo into the Netherlands. The actions were not without danger. Many of the Catholic bishops were too willing to compromise with the National Socialist state. Even Cardinal von Galen rejected their support for the persecuted and the inconvenient as being inappropriate. In Emilie von Lo\u00eb from Budberg (Rheinberg), a close relative, Isabelle found a trustworthy comrade-in-arms.\nWhen the area on the left bank of the Lower Rhine was to be evacuated in the last months of the war, Isabelle von Lo\u00eb refused the order of the SS and founded the Wissen Emergency Community together with her colleagues and neighbors. A medical station was set up at Wissen Castle, where numerous wounded soldiers were treated, including the VDK founder Siegfried Emmo Eulen. When the German Wehrmacht retreated, the Niers bridge at the castle was blown up, which affected the electricity and drinking water supplies on the estate. The Emergency Community held out and survived the bombing raids on Weeze, Goch and Kleve with numerous refugees in the cellars of the outer bailey. In gratitude for having survived the dark times, the community made a pilgrimage to the Gnadenkapelle in Kevelaer. A memorial cross was erected at the entrance to the castle.\nAfter the liberation, British soldiers moved into the castle and in April 1945 set up a POW release camp on a field on the estate. They paid no attention to the countess's worries that the moated castle could collapse if the moat dried up. Only after warning of a dangerous plague of mosquitoes was she able to persuade the occupiers to repair the water pump. This not only saved the castle, but also the drinking water and electricity supplies.\nShe later learned about the conditions in the prisoner of war camp there from a pastor from Rheinberg and, together with people from her church community, organized food donations.  The packages had to be thrown over the camp fence. In doing so, she exposed herself to the danger of being shot by the Americans. Her sister Rosemarie took part in the actions. It was only under British military administration that food deliveries could be delivered to the supply camp without great risk. The neighboring communities were even obliged to ensure supplies.\nThe war on the Lower Rhine claimed numerous victims, who could only be recovered during the reconstruction period. For the construction of the Weeze war cemetery, Isabelle von Lo\u00eb donated a 2-hectare plot of land on the Sandberg from her property to the German War Graves Commission.\nAfter the death of Felix von Lo\u00eb, she did not marry again. Her main focus was on raising her children and looking after Wissen Castle and the Wissen ",
    "Ukrainian activist and politician\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is  Serhiiovych and the family name is  Donii.\nOleksandr Serhiiovych Donii (Ukrainian: \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0456\u0301\u0439\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0456\u0301\u0439; born 18 August 1969) is a Ukrainian activist and politician who served as a People's Deputy of Ukraine from 2007 to 2014, first on the proportional representation list of Our Ukraine\u2013People's Self-Defense Bloc and later from Ukraine's 88th electoral district in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. Prior to his election, Donii was one of the leaders of the 1990 Revolution on Granite that called for free and fair elections in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nEarly life and Revolution on Granite\nOleksandr Serhiiovych Donii was born on 18 August 1969, in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. He first acquired a sense of Ukrainian identity in school, and he later recounted that he hoped to learn Ukrainian while in university. While he was a student at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv in the late 1980s, Donii began organising students in support of Ukrainian Soviet dissidents and the 1989\u20131991 Ukrainian revolution.\nFollowing the 1990 Ukrainian Supreme Soviet election, Donii was the leader of a series of protests seeking the resignation of Vitaliy Masol. Known as the Revolution on Granite, the protests achieved broad support from Ukrainian society, including dissident leader Viacheslav Chornovil and Leonid Kravchuk, the leader of Ukraine's communists. As the head of the protests' Central Ukrainian branch, Donii was one of three formal leaders of the revolution, alongside Markiian Ivashchyshyn\u00a0 (Western Ukraine, based in Lviv) and Oleh Barkov (Eastern Ukraine, based in Dniprodzerzhinsk). Donii was appointed deputy chairman of the People's Movement of Ukraine in 1990, a role he held until 1991. He was also co-leader of the Ukrainian Student Union from 1991 to 1992, and served as head of the Centre for Extreme Politics from 1992 to 1994.\nPolitical career\nDonii was elected to the Kyiv City Council in 1994. He was deputy head of the council's Committee on Humanitarian Issues. Taking an interest in cultural issues, Donii was leader of the Young Ukraine movement, as well as Last Barricade\u00a0, a movement promoting urban culture. He participated in the 2004 Orange Revolution, and by 2005 was head of the electoral committee of the Socialist Party of Ukraine in the western Lviv Oblast. Donii mulled a campaign for the Lviv Oblast Council, but ultimately decided to become a candidate for People's Deputy of Ukraine from the proportional representation list of the SPU. He was placed 99th on the party's list during the 2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election.\nDuring the election campaign, Donii pledged to reform the SPU into a \"patriotic centre-left structure\", and he credited the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, during which the SPU had gathered a greater portion of the vote than the Communist Party of Ukraine for the first time in their history, as placing the party as leaders of the Ukrainian left. He was ultimately not elected, as the SPU won only 33 seats, and returned to work as a political scientist. Following the 2006 Ukrainian political crisis, in which SPU leader Oleksandr Moroz formed an alliance with the Party of Regions, Donii critically compared him to Ivan the Fool.\nPeople's Deputy of Ukraine\nDonii was again a candidate in the 2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election, this time from the Our Ukraine\u2013People's Self-Defense Bloc (NUNS). During the campaign, Donii continued to profess his support for a left-wing Ukrainian nationalist party. He was successfully elected as part of the Civil Movement \"People's Self-Defense\", which was a member of NUNS, though he was an independent at the time. He was head of the Verkhovna Rada subcommittee on humanitarian education, science, and information.\nDonii expressed support for the establishment of NUNS as an ideological party, rather than one based around the personal appeal of President Viktor Yushchenko. He called for members of the bloc who were ideologically close to the Party of Regions to be expelled, and additionally criticised the government for favouring Ivan Plyushch as the bloc's candidate for Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada rather than Vyacheslav Kyrylenko.\nDonii was re-elected as a People's Deputy during the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election. He was elected in Ukraine's 88th electoral district (located in and around Kolomyia, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast) as an independent candidate with 43.95% of the vote, defeating six other candidates. He partook in Euromaidan and described himself as affiliated with more radical activists who were suspicious of Petro Poroshenko, saying \"people died  so that Roshen could open a new store\".\nKharkiv Pact beating\nDuring a vote on the 2010 Kharkiv Pact in the Verkhovna Rada, a significant fight broke out between deputies of NUNS and the Party of Regions. During the fight, Donii was beaten by six Party of Regions deputies",
    "2019 film by Yaron Shani\nLove Trilogy: Reborn (in Hebrew: \u05d8\u05e8\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05d2\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d4: \u05dc\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4) is a 2019 Israeli drama film, and the third installation of the Love Trilogy film series, following the second of the trilogy, Chained (2019). Reborn was written, directed, and edited by Yaron Shani. The film's world premier took place at the Busan Film Festival. It then won Best Film, Best Actress (shared between the three leads), and Best Cinematography awards at the Haifa International Film Festival.\nPlot summary\nAvigail (Stav Almagor) is undergoing fertility treatments, and stands helplessly between her husband's bullying and her daughter's rebelliousness. She meets two sisters who share a complex relationship: Yael (Ori Shani) accompanies women through pregnancy and performs as a doula in childbirth, while her own trauma caused by her mother's abandonment prevents her from becoming a mother; and Na'ama (Leah Tonic), already traumatized by her stepfather's abuse in her childhood, who loses control of her life when she becomes his caretaker when he's placed in a nursing home due to dementia. The women find solace and meaning in their connections, and discover that they can help each other change, break their figurative chains, and be reborn.\nCharacters\nYaron Shani works with a cast of non-actors, who work without a script, improvising the scenes on-camera. The film is shot in single takes, without rehearsals.\nAvigail Malka (Stav Almagor): Works to be a perfect nurse, mother to Yasmine, and wife to Rashi, a police officer who is desperate for a child of his own. While appearing happy to self-sacrifice on the outside, Avigail actually internalizes her anger in punitive ways. On the verge of a breakdown, she finds comfort and guidance from Yael, a childbirth counselor.\nYael Efrati (Ori Shani): Having been abandoned by her parents, Yael makes it her life mission to accompany other women in their journey to motherhood. But Yael herself can't find her way on that path, and is, instead, ruled by her fears of becoming a mother. Though considered a kind of spiritual guru to expectant mothers, Yael finds herself unable to provide care for her own sister, Na'ama.\nNa'ama Efrati (Leah Tonic): Na'ama is also juggling life crises \u2013 she's dealing with mental health issues, while also caring for her abusive stepfather who is in a care home due to severe dementia. At night, Na'ama acts out in degrading ways as a sex worker.\nAlice Turgeman (Laliv Sivan): An author whose first book achieved great success, making her a rising star in the Israeli literary scene. She has experienced a mental health crisis following tormenting visions of rape.\nRashi Malka (Eran Naim): A cop whose life is spiraling out of control, as he deals with critical issues both at work and in his marriage.\nYasmine (Stav Patay): Avigail's daughter from a previous relationship. She acts out, refusing to accept her new family situation, turning the home into a war zone.\nProduction\nThe film is an Israel-German co-production. Producers were Naomi Levari and Saar Yogev of Black Sheep Film Productions, in cooperation with Michael Reuter of The Post Republic. The movie was made with the support of the Israeli Film Fund, Arte, and yes satellite television, and is distributed by Alpha Violet, a French-based independent film distribution company.\nReviews\nIsraeli news site ynet praises Shani's project, calling it \"intriguing\" and \"meant to blend the line between reality and fiction\". In her Haaretz review, Nurit Enderman comments on how, though each of the films in the trilogy being able to stand on its own, the third installation exposes the trilogy's \"fascinating complexity.... Revealing the obvious and hidden connections that link them\". She predicted that Reborn might well take the Best Picture award at the Jerusalem Film Festival, writing that \"It certainly deserves it\u2014both as an independent work and as part of one of the most interesting, ambitious, original, and complex cinematic projects ever created.\" Writing for Srita, an Israeli online cinema magazine, Ofer Libergal also calls the film project \"one of the most ambitious in the history of Israeli cinema\". He positively remarks that while the first two films in the series focused heavily on the exploitative and violent sides of love, with a primary lens upon the male characters, Reborn deals with connection and empathy between women.

He was a member of Churchill's Special Operations Executive (SOE), and Commandant of Camp X, where he trained the men and women who would become the leaders of the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI), which became the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He is considered one of the fathers of modern American central intelligence, and gained the admiration of William J. Donovan and Allen Dulles, and even is mentioned as being a great instructor of spies in the memoirs of Kim Philby.\nEarly life\nBrooker was born on 23 December 1909 in Paris, France. In the years before World War II, he was a traveling salesman for Nestl\u00e9. Those who knew him gave him the title of a \"born salesman.\"\nPrior to the war, Brooker joined the Force Service Protectorate.\nWorld War II\nOn March 18, 1941, Brooker joined the SOE's training section, and trained scores of SOE operatives at Beaulieu on espionage and tradecraft prior to their departure to fight the Axis.\nIn December 1941, Brooker was sent to Canada aboard the SS Pasteur with Lieutenant Colonel Roper Caldbeck to become the second in command of STS 103, or what is more commonly known today as Camp X.\nIn August 1942, Brooker succeeded Roper Caldbeck as Commandant of Camp X. He is said to have been the school's most popular commanding officer to this point.\nBickham Sweet-Escott wrote:\n\"I have no doubt that OSS (Office of Strategic Services) got much more out of our training school in Canada, (Camp X) than from all the efforts of our party in Washington... What was unique about Oshawa was the personality of the commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Brooker.\u00a0 Bill Brooker was a born salesman.\u00a0 He was a brilliant and convincing lecturer, and he had an immense wealth of stories from the real life of a secret agent to illustrate his points.\"\nBrooker was noted as an unconventional instructor - he would occasionally interrupt his classes with exercises, including gunfire and other scenarios, and would ask his students to recall details like the number of shots fired and the caliber of the weapon. He also gave them much sage advice: \u201cIf there\u2019s anything loose in the intelligence business, you\u2019re dead!\u201d \nBrooker also trained OSS executives on the weekends on the fundamentals of training, creating \"trained trainers\" out of them.\nIn the Winter of 1942, Brooker helped Garland H. Williams to completely redesign the training curriculum of the COI/OSS.\nBrooker also assisted, along with British Navy Commander N.G.A. Woolley, Millard Preston Goodfellow and William J. Donovan at the COI in creating an amphibious warfare training unit, that would become the OSS Maritime Unit training center.\nIn March 1943, Brooker was reassigned to the OSS in Washington, D.C.\nLater in the year, William Donovan had Brooker deployed to Algeria to participate in joint SOE/OSS operations there.\nIn 1944, Brooker would spend more time in Washington and New York, dividing his time in half between the two OSS operations, helping both to instruct students and build secret interception systems of German intelligences.\n",
    "Military unit\nShayetet 7 is the only submarine flotilla of the Israeli Navy. It is based in Haifa naval base and operates Dolphin-class submarines. It was established in 1959 and is considered an elite unit due to the nature of its services.\nNature of service\nThe service in the submarine fleet is difficult, challenging and often far from the country's borders, so the submarine crews have to be very cohesive. Another derivative of the great distance from the country's borders is that the submarine crew is operationally competent and ready for war at any time.\nEvery operational mission of the submarine has a military doctor and a medic on board who have undergone special training to treat the wounded, including dealing with a multi-casualty incidents, deep under the surface of the water. In the absence of an emergency, the doctor who joins any operational mission also carries an intelligence role for everything, in which he is engaged throughout the mission as one of the combatants.\nThe unit's objectives include \nAttacking enemy vessels\nCovert intelligence gathering\nDeployment and recovery of Shayetet 13 naval commandos\nActing as a support unit for other units\nBelieved to be part of the country's nuclear weapons capability.\nFleet\nHistory\nPrevious logo of the flotilla till 2023\nEstablishment\nTwo used S-class submarines were purchased from the Royal Navy . These submarines were built in World War II, and refurbished in England for the Israeli Navy. An Israeli team that went through a training period in France and the United Kingdom under British supervision was the crew for the first submarine. The flotilla was established on December 16, 1959, when INS Tanin (C-71) entered the port of Haifa. The second submarine, INS Rahav (C-73), arrived at the shores of Israel in July 1960.\nSix Day War\nDuring the Six Day War, the flotilla participated in the Operation Alexandria in which Tanin led six fighters from Shayetet 13 into action in the port of Alexandria . While waiting to collect the divers, the submarine was attacked by an Egyptian vessel and damaged. The next day she returned to the meeting place to collect but the divers had already been captured by the Egyptians. Multiple civilian ships were destroyed in this operation.\nArrival of T submarines\nIn 1965, Israel purchased three T-class submarines from the Royal Navy: Leviathan, Decker, and Dolphin. The T-class submarines were larger and more sophisticated than the S-class submarines, but they were also outdated submarines from the World War II period that had undergone a process of upgrade and renovation. The submarines arrived after the Six Day War.\nSinking of INS Dakkar\nA submarine of the flotilla, INS Dakkar, sunk on January 25, 1968, on its way from Britain to Israel and all 69 members of its crew perished. The remains of the submarine and the place where it sank were only discovered in 1999.\nYom Kippur War\nThe flotilla did not take part in the Yom Kippur War due to maintenance issues.\nIntroduction of Gal-class submarines\nThe Gal-class submarines entered the service in the flotilla in the late 1970s, these small but agile and sophisticated submarines were continuously upgraded with newer systems to maintain their technological edge. They were somewhat unusual in that all boats of the class were at equipped with six-tube retractable Blowpipe surface-to-air missile launchers controlled from inside the boat, though these were later removed.\n1982 Lebanon War\nThe flotilla participated in the 1982 Lebanon War and carried out Operation Dreyfus which was a military operation to locate and identify enemy ships using submarines . In June 1982, during the operation, an Israeli Navy submarine hit a civilian ship carrying refugees, due to the suspicion that they were terrorists. 25 people were killed in the incident.\nIntroduction of Dolphin-class submarines\nStarting from 1999, the Dolphin-class submarines have continued to serve the Israeli Navy as a part of the flotilla and are expected to continue their service till 2030.\nSudan airstrikes\nIn November\u2013December 2011 two Israeli air raids against Gaza-bound weapon smugglers in Sudan were accompanied by Israeli submarine activity off the Sudanese coast.\nSyrian civil war\nOn July 5, 2013, during the Syrian civil war, an Israeli missile strike against the Syrian port of Latakia was made in coordination with the United States, with long-range missiles launched from a Dolphin-class submarine. The attack targeted newly unloaded Russian-made Yakhont long-range high-performance anti-ship missiles and associated radars.\nCommanders\nMeeting of the former commanders of the flotilla in 2019\n",
    "Malayic language spoken in Indonesia\nBelitung Malay (base Belitong, Jawi: \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0644\u064a\u062a\u0648\u06a0), or Sedentary Belitung Malay, is a Malayic language spoken in Indonesia, specifically on the island of Belitung in the Bangka Belitung Islands of Sumatra. The language is primarily spoken by the native Malay people of Belitung, as well as by ethnic Chinese who have inhabited Belitung for centuries, using it as a second language alongside their native Hakka. This language is distinguished from Loncong language, another Malay variety spoken by nomadic sea gypsies from Belitung. Additionally, it is spoken by migrants from other parts of Indonesia residing in Belitung, including Javanese and Sundanese, as well as by the Belitung diaspora living in various regions across Indonesia. Belitung Malay serves as the lingua franca among the people of Belitung, encompassing not only Malays but also other ethnic groups living in the island. It is predominantly used in informal settings such as family gatherings or marketplaces. In contrast, standard Indonesian is preferred for formal situations, including government offices and schools, reflecting its status as the official and national language of Indonesia. Code-switching between Belitung Malay and standard Indonesian is common in the Belitung community, particularly in informal and semi-formal contexts. Other ethnic groups, such as the Chinese, also frequently code-switch and code-mix between Hakka and Belitung Malay. \nBelitung Malay is a vernacular Malay variety that shares linguistic features with peninsular Malay, Eastern Sumatra Malay, and the Malay variety of West Kalimantan. Belitung Malay exhibits a closer resemblance to the Malay spoken in Sumatra and Kalimantan than to standard Jakarta Indonesian, particularly in terms of phonology and lexicon. The language has received significant influence from other languages, such as Hakka, Dutch and Arabic, as well as Javanese and standard Indonesian. Belitung Malay has absorbed Javanese loanwords due to Belitung's historical rule by the Palembang Sultanate, where the court language, Palembang Malay, was influenced by Javanese. Additionally, Indonesian, as the official language, has also become a source of loanwords. While Belitung Malay includes words not found in standard Indonesian, the two languages are generally mutually intelligible.\nClassification\nBelitung Malay is a Malayic language. Speakers of Malayic language are spread from Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Southern Thailand, to the southernmost part of the Philippines. Malay is a member of the Austronesian family of languages, which includes languages from Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean, with a smaller number in continental Asia. Malagasy, a geographic outlier spoken in Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, is also a member of this language family. Although these languages are not necessarily mutually intelligible to any extent, their similarities are often quite apparent. In more conservative languages like Malay, many roots have come with relatively little change from their common ancestor, Proto-Austronesian language. There are many cognates found in the languages' words for kinship, health, body parts and common animals. Numbers, especially, show remarkable similarities.\nBelitung Malay is closely related to other Malayic languages spoken in neighboring regions, such as Bangka Malay and Palembang Malay, as well as various Malay varieties found in West Kalimantan, the eastern coast of Sumatra, and outlying islands. Since Indonesian is a standardized form of Malay, Belitung Malay is also related to it, and the two are generally mutually intelligible. However, Belitung Malay possesses unique characteristics, particularly in its phonology and lexicon, that distinguish it from Indonesian and other Malay varieties.\nGeographic distribution and usage\nBelitung Malay is exclusively spoken on Belitung and its outlying islands. Administratively, this area consists of two regencies in the Bangka Belitung province: Belitung Regency and East Belitung Regency. It is also spoken by Belitung diasporas living in other parts of Indonesia. Belitung Malay is the mother tongue of the Malay people on the island. The Chinese people primarily use Hakka and Mandarin as their native tongues, though many also understand Belitung Malay as a second language and use it to communicate with Malays and other ethnic groups. On the other hand, migrants in Belitung from other parts of Indonesia speak Belitung Malay in addition to their native languages, especially in the market.\nBelitung Malay is a spoken language used by Belitung speakers when talking with family members, friends, and co-workers on informal occasions in markets, shops, stalls, and so forth. It also functions as a lingua franca; non-Malay people, such as Chinese and Bugis, among others in the area, often choose to speak Belitung Malay between people from different ethnic groups. Belitung Malay is not used in formal situations ",

It works to realise a vision of socially and economically inclusive growth and to ensure dignity, equality and justice for all. Their special concern has been for the Dalits of Bihar, where this society has worked more on the education of their children, ownership rights on land and problems of employment.\nThe organisation was started in 1995 by a group of educationists, journalists and young researchers. Initially, it was aimed to bring out a Hindi magazine focused on liberal and logical thinking.\nThis NGO has worked with UNICEF Bihar, NITI Aayog, MHRD, Ford Foundation, IGNCA, and Nalanda University.\nHistory\nIn 1995, Deshkal India was started as a Hindi magazine. Initially, it aimed to expand a liberal and thoughtful society. The founder of this society is Sanjay Kumar, a scholar and practitioner who shaped this society to work for the social diversity, inequality, and education for all.\nThis society has worked for rights of marginal sections, education for all and inequality. Under Dr Sanjay Kumar, this society had worked for educational framework of Dalit child community(2002\u20132005) with the aid from MHRD, Govt of India. It also worked with UNICEF in Bihar (2015\u20132016).  A report from this society, which received assistance from the NITI Aayog, in 2014 suggested modifying the Bihar Privileged Persons Homestead Tenancy Act 1947 in -order to establish a housing policy that is both sustainable and egalitarian.\nWorks\nHomestead Rights\nThis has worked for access to land and secure ownership rights over it for the marginalised community in the Gaya region of Bihar. In this regard, they filed 2,492 applications that included 425 applications for raiyati land, 1,536 for ghairmazarua khas land (common land for special use), and 531 for ghairmazarua aam land (common land for general use).\nInclusive Education\nDeshkal Society strives to support inclusive education in Bihar by raising the academic attainment and school attendance rates of kids from rural areas. They guarantee the efficacy of schools by implementing inclusive teaching and learning methodologies. By facilitating children from marginalised communities' enrolment, retention, and involvement and attending to their various needs, they contribute to their social inclusion.\nDalit Studies\nDeshkal society pushed the idea of 'Dalit Studies' in the Indian university education system. This society made a point of \"how unaware the general public is of Dalit culture and living circumstances. Different subject curricula fail to address issues that stem from Dalit people's unique historical experiences\". In this course, the Ford Foundation helped them to create a forum where the discussion related to a new need for content material, nature, scope and method related to Dalit culture and studies.\nBodh Gaya Global Dialogue\n\"Bodh Gaya Global Dialogues\" is an event organised by the Deshkal Society regularly. The global dialogues cover a mosaic of parallel sub-events, including plenary sessions, panel discussions, children's programs, cultural events, film shows, award functions, book launches, and heritage walks, to bring the many themes of sustainable development, rich history, culture, and heritage of the place into the public discussion.\nPublications\nThe Social Context of Learning in India Achievement Gaps and Factors of Poor Learning, 2023; Routledge(London), ISBN 9781032646091.\nMarginalized Self: Tales of resistance of a Community, 2020; Primus Books, ISBN 978-9389933802.\nDynamics of Inclusive Classroom: Social Diversity, Inequality and School Education in India, 2017; Orient Black Swan, ISBN 9789352870134.\nSchool Education, Pluralism and Marginality, 2012; Orient Black Swan, ISBN 9788125045311.\nInterrogating Development: Insights from the Margins, 2010; Oxford University Press, ISBN 9780198066415.\nDeshkal Publication\nDeshkal has its own publication unit from which dozens of books related to social and cultural issues have been published.

    "\nFor albums released by Lamar, see Kendrick Lamar albums discography.\nThe American rapper Kendrick Lamar has released 71 singles and five promotional singles. 28 of those singles were as a lead artist, while 43 were as a featured artist. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Lamar's digital singles registered 41 million certified units, based on sales and on-demand streaming, as of June 2024.\nAlthough it was well received by music critics, Lamar's debut studio album Section.80 (2011) failed to produce any commercially successful singles. His first showing on international record and radio airplay charts came with his succeeding efforts, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012) and To Pimp a Butterfly (2015). \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\", the lead single from the former album, marked Lamar's first entry on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City also contained the moderately successful singles \"The Recipe\", \"Poetic Justice\", \"Backseat Freestyle\", and \"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe\". To Pimp a Butterfly was supported by five singles\u2014\"I\" (which reached the top 40 in the U.S. and several European countries), \"The Blacker the Berry\", \"King Kunta\", \"Alright\", and \"These Walls\". Lamar's remix of Taylor Swift's single \"Bad Blood\" marked his first number-one song in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Scotland, and the U.S.\nWith his fourth studio album Damn (2017), Lamar became the fifth artist in history to chart at least 14 concurrent titles on the Billboard Hot 100. The album was preceded by \"Humble\", Lamar's second number-one track (and first as a lead artist) in New Zealand and the U.S. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) declared the single as the sixth best-selling song of 2017. Further bolstered by the international top 20 singles \"Loyalty\" and \"Love\", Damn became the first album by a rapper or solo artist to have every song featured be certified gold or higher by the RIAA. All eighteen tracks from Lamar's fifth studio album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), charted on the Billboard Hot 100; its successful singles comprise \"The Heart Part 5\", \"N95\", \"Silent Hill\", and \"Die Hard\". During his 2024 feud with Drake, Lamar released five commercially successful diss records. Two of them, \"Like That\" and \"Not Like Us\", debuted atop the American, Canadian, and South African charts.\nLamar has worked with numerous artists on collaborative singles. His most successful endeavors include ASAP Rocky's \"Fuckin' Problems\" (2012), Robin Thicke's \"Give It 2 U\" (2013), Maroon 5's \"Don't Wanna Know\", and Travis Scott's \"Goosebumps\" (both 2016).

    "Indian film producer, writer, orator, and politician\nChinna Annamalai (18 June 1920\u00a0\u2013 18 June 1980) was an Indian film producer, writer, orator, and politician known for his contributions to Tamil literature.\nEarly Life\nChinna Annamalai, originally named Nagappan, was born on 18 June 1920, in O. Siruvayal Village near Karaikudi to Nachiyappa Chettiar and Meenakshi.\nEarly Activism\nChinna Annamalai was expelled from Devakottai NSMVPS school for organising a strike to mourn the death of Kamala Nehru, which prevented him from taking his final exams. Concerned about his anti-government activities, his parents sent him to Penang, Malaysia. There, as a teenager, he led estate workers in a protest against local liquor shops, resulting in arson. He was deported back to India after being brought before the Penang magistrate.\nFreedom Struggle\nBack in India, Annamalai joined the freedom struggle in the late 1930s. Influenced by Kalki's writings, he became a popular speaker, drawing large crowds. On 9 August 1942, the day of Gandhi\u2019s arrest, he was scheduled to speak at Jawahar Maidan in Devakottai. The police detained him at midnight and imprisoned him in Thiruvadanai Jail, 22 miles away from Devakottai.\nNews of his arrest spread quickly, inciting anger among the nationalists and young people of Devakottai who marched to Thiruvadanai Jail. They forcibly released Chinna Annamalai, carried him on their shoulders, and returned to Devakottai.\nAs the crowd approached Devakottai, the British police opened fire. Many volunteers sacrificed their lives to protect Chinna Annamalai. He remained in hiding for a month before surrendering. He was subsequently sentenced to four and a half years of rigorous imprisonment. With the intervention of Rajaji\u2019s arguments and appeals, Chinna Annamalai was released within six months.\nLiterary Contributions\nFollowing his release, Annamalai moved to Chennai on Rajaji's advice and pursued his interests in Tamil literature and music. He founded Tamil Pannai, a publishing firm, to promote books on Congress leaders and Tamil writers, including Rajaji, Kalki, T. S. Chokkalingam, T. K. Chidambaranatha Mudaliar, Namakkal Ramalingam Pillai, Kannadasan, and Vali. He also organized events to support struggling writers, such as a 1944 function for Namakkal Kavignar, where he presented him with \u20b920,000.\nAnnamalai's Tamil Pannai published a book on the Bengal famine, which led to his imprisonment. He ran the weekly magazine Sankap Pantha and published Gandhi's Harijan paper in Tamil.\nFilm Industry\nIn the film industry, Annamalai wrote scripts for films such as \"Thangamalai Ragasiyam\", \"Naan Yaar Theriyuma\" and \"Dharmaraja\". He founded Vetrivel Films, producing movies like \"President Panchatcharam\", \"Aayiram Roobai\", \"General Chakravarthi\", \"Dharmaraja\" and \"Kadavulin Kuzhandhai\". In August 1969, Chinna Annamalai formed and coordinated the All India Shivaji Fans Club.\nPublished Works\nKandarriyathana Kanden (ta\u00a0: \u0b95\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0ba9 \u0b95\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc7\u0ba9\u0bcd)\nSarkkaraip Pandhal (ta\u00a0: \u0b9a\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb0\u0bc8\u0baa\u0bcd \u0baa\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bcd)\nSindhikka Vaikkum Sirippu Kathaigal (ta\u00a0: \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95 \u0bb5\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0ba4\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd)\nSonnal Namba Maattirgal (ta\u00a0: \u0b9a\u0bca\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bae\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc0\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd)\nThalaiezhuththu (ta\u00a0: \u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bc8\u0b8e\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1)\nRajaji Uvamaigal (ta\u00a0: \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bbf \u0b89\u0bb5\u0bae\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd)\nBooks Published by Tamil Pannai\nBharathi Pirandhar by Kalki\nV.

    "Former independent Bookstore in Los Angeles, California\nPickwick Book Shop was an independent bookstore located at 6741-6745 W. Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California. The store was popular with many film and literary figures, and was known as the \"supermarket of books.\"\nHistory\nLouis Epstein purchased his first bookstore, a tiny bookshop attached to a gunsmith shop in Long Beach, California, in 1925. He soon moved his business to downtown Los Angeles, renaming it Epstein's Used Books. The store focused on literature and poetry.\nIn the early 1930s, a movie studio inquired with Epstein about renting 5000 books to be used as props, to which they agreed to a price of $0.05 per book per day for thirty days. The books were returned about a year later, and when the studio attempted to pay for only the original thirty days, Epstein phoned his lawyer who extracted the full amount. Epstein's lawyer then refused to give Epstein the money, fearing Epstein would \"spend it foolishly buying more books and having a good time.\" Instead, he told Epstein to find a building to buy and he would release the money into escrow for it. In 1938, Epstein used this account to open Pickwick Book Shop, which he named after The Pickwick Papers.\nPickwick Book Shop was a three-story bookshop located at 6743 W. Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California, and was immensely popular with film and literary insiders, as well as the general public. During its heyday, notable figures such as F Scott Fitzgerald, Raymond Chandler, William Faulkner, Humphrey Bogart, and Marlene Dietrich frequented the shop, and Orson Welles, Peter Finch, Marlon Brando, and Ray Bradbury were known to visit as well.\nPickwick Book Shop eventually expanded into the building west of it, and fifteen additional locations also opened around southern California.\nIn 1968, Dayton Hudson, founder of B. Dalton, bought the Pickwick chain, and in 1979, he consolidated the names of all his stores.\nBuilding\nAt its greatest expanse, Pickwick Book Shop occupied two neighboring buildings in Hollywood, at 1708 N McCadden Place and 6741-6745 Hollywood Boulevard. The buildings, built in 1917 and 1925, collectively feature three distinct architecture styles, each one associated with Hollywood in its heyday. The McCadden facade features commercial brick vernacular, the McCadden Pl./Hollywood Blvd. corner features an art deco facade with stylized concrete designs, and the Hollywood facade features Churrigueresque detailing.\nIn 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, with the two buildings and three architectural styles detailed above, collectively named \"Pickwick Books\", listed as a contributing property in the district.\nAs of 2024, the Pickwick Books building is home to a Starbucks, souvenir shop, and Taco Bell Cantina.\n",
    "Sikh online encyclopedia\nSikhiWiki is a Sikh-centric online encyclopedia operated by the 3HO organization under its SikhNet umbrella.\nHistory\nThe idea of creating an online Sikh encyclopedia is attributed to Ash Singh after he had a television interview where the importance of documenting Sikh history, from both the distant past and present, was discussed. Ash Singh partnered with Gurumustuk Singh Khalsa, then webmaster of SikhNet, to create SikhiWiki. SikhiWiki was launched in 2005. The website was inspired by Wikipedia and claims to cover \"Sikh philosophy, history, culture and lifestyle\". The website is open to the wider community who can freely edit its pages. The operators used the term 'encyclomedia' to describe their website. SikhiWiki is maintained by SikhNet and most of the individuals maintaining it are volunteers.\nStatistics\nAs of March 2012, there were nearly 6,000 articles hosted on SikhiWiki. As of July 2024, the website contains 6,359 articles and 10,123 uploaded files, with 93,526 registered members.\nCommentary\nAccording to Conner Singh VanderBeek, SikhiWiki provides \"... the most comprehensive resource on basic terms, tenets, and histories of the Sikh faith\". SikhiWiki does not absolve Sikh separatists as guiltless in its article covering the Khalistan movement. Doctrinal discussions and debates also occur on SikhiWiki, such as on the practice of vegetarianism.\nSikhiWiki promotes a mainstream, normative, orthodox, Khalsa-orientated narrative of the Sikh religion. An example of this is on their article covering the heterodoxical Namdhari sect, which contains a disclaimer warning about sects and cults that evolved after the timeline of the Sikh gurus. This disclaimer is followed by a further explanation warning about sects, cults, \"fake\" babas, deras, \"fake\" Nihangs, Sanatan Dharmis, \"pseudo\" Akalis and Mahants, \"pseudo\" intellectuals and historians, leftists, and agnostics, which it claims are \"not considered a part of Sikhism\". SikhiWiki asserts that these above groups are distortions of Gurmat (the true teachings of Sikhism) created to damage Sikhism. It further claims that none of the above groups were created by a guru or bhagat. This leads to Sikhs belonging to heterodoxical, non-normative Sikh sects to go elsewhere for information.\n",
    "Poorhouse in Floriana, Malta\nThe Ospizio (Maltese: L-Ospizju), originally known as the Casa di Carit\u00e0, was a poorhouse in Floriana, Malta which cared for destitute elderly men and women, poor young women, and mentally ill patients during the 18th and 19th centuries. It also served as a women's prison. It was housed in a complex of buildings along the Floriana Lines overlooking Marsamxett Harbour, which are currently being restored and incorporated into the Malta International Contemporary Art Space (MICAS).\nHistory\nIn 1665, the Congregation of War of the Order of St John began making plans to construct a gunpowder factory along the Floriana Lines overlooking Marsamxett Harbour. The factory was designed by military engineer Mederico Blondel and it was completed by 1667, with several casemates being added in the vicinity in later decades. The factory continued to produce gunpowder until the early 1720s.\nIn 1729, the former factory was repurposed as a hospice where elderly patients were cared for. On 6 December 1732, Grand Master Ant\u00f3nio Manoel de Vilhena established a Casa di Carit\u00e0 which was constructed to designs of Charles Fran\u00e7ois de Mondion adjacent to the factory; the former factory was subsequently closed as it was not deemed suitable for housing patients. The Casa di Carit\u00e0 was administered by a ten-member commission which included four elderly Hospitaller knights, a priest, a vicar, two jurats and two prominent Maltese. It housed approximately 380 people each year, including destitute elderly, poor women, and people with mental illnesses. It was segregated with elderly men being housed in an upper floor and with the lower level being reserved for women. The latter was subdivided into separate sections: a Ginecco for elderly women, a Conservatorio de' Vergini for young women, and a Reclusorio for female prisoners. Mentally ill patients were chained to walls in casements.\nThe young women at the Conservatorio de' Vergini worked by producing thread from cotton, the proceeds of which were divided between the women and the institution. The income this generated allowed for the Casa di Carit\u00e0 to be financially independent, although at times this was insufficient and its income was later supplemented by a tax on notarial acts and by annual contributions of 1500 scudi by the Universit\u00e0 of Valletta. Each year, four of the women were given a dowry of 40 scudi which enabled them to marry. The Casa di Carit\u00e0 was reformed by Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc with a set of new regulations in 1785, and at this point its name was changed to the Ospizio. By the end of the 18th century, it had a capital of 12,606 scudi.\n The Ospizio as depicted on an 1831 map, labelled as an \"Asylum for Lunatics\"\nThe Ospizio continued to operate during the French occupation and the early years of British rule. Reformed prostitutes and mentally-ill female patients were transferred from the Casetta in Valletta to the Ospizio during the French occupation, while from 1804 to 1832 and 1848 to 1894 the site also housed an orphanage for illegitimate children. On 15 January 1815, Governor Thomas Maitland issued a Charitable Institutions Reform which transformed the Ospizio into a poorhouse and by the following year, its Hospitaller-era administrative structure was abolished and the tax on notarial acts which had provided funding had been repealed. Meanwhile, mentally-ill male patients from the Civil Hospital in Valletta were also transferred to the Ospizio in 1816. In around the 1820s, nearby buildings were taken over and incorporated into the complex. Between September 1835 and 1838, all mentally ill patients in the Ospizio were moved to Villa Franconi, a large residential building in Floriana which was repurposed as an asylum. In June 1837, a cholera epidemic began at the Ospizio and subsequently spread throughout the Maltese Islands.\nIn 1892, the elderly were transferred from the Ospizio to the newly established St Vincent de Paul residence in Luqa. The women's prison was housed at the Ospizio until 1895. Its buildings were subsequently transferred to the Army Ordnance Department of the British Army, and during World War I it was used as a workshop where hospital furniture and medical devices were manufactured. During World War II, gun emplacements were installed on the fortifications around the area, which were then targeted during enemy air raids. The Ospizio complex suffered significant damage due to aerial bombardment during the war.\nAfter Malta became independent in 1964, the British forces handed over the complex to the Government of Malta, and it housed an Enemalta store and a trade school by the early 1970s. Parts of the site were being used as an Immigration Office and a Security Branch in 1975. The Restoration Directorate established its offices in the nearby Polverista Curtain in 1997.\nThe Malta International Contemporary Art Space (MICAS) established its offices within the Ospizio complex in 2017, and a project involving the",
    "\nCasa Pellandini was a Mexican company that manufactured and imported art and luxury items, founded by the Swiss stained glass artist of Italian origin Claudio Pellandini, in 1893, at the 2a. Calle de San Francisco No. 10, currently Madero 33 (Banco Santander Select), four blocks East of the Palacio de Bellas Artes, in Mexico City.\nHistory\nClaudio Pellandini arrived in Mexico in 1860. Since 1893, in its showroom and store, at 2a. Calle de San Francisco No. 10, the Casa Pellandini used to sell: marble, bronze and terracotta sculptures; French and Mexican stained glass windows, lamps, Venetian mirrors, artistic engravings, marble and alabaster busts, frames, moldings, glass, imported wallpaper; porcelain figures, white and painted ones; prints, facsimiles of watercolors, chromos, oleographs, griffins, planters, materials for artists, supplies for engineers, cases of oil and watercolor colors, and ornamental objects, which ended up in the National Palace, state government palaces, the Municipal Hall of Puebla, the Chapultepec Castle, where President Porfirio D\u00edaz resided up until 25 May 1911, churches, residences, public buildings, etcetera.\nTwo years later, in 1895, Claudio Pellandini opened the first large art supplies factory in the country. Its workshops, located at Comonfort 48 on the corner of Jaime Nun\u00f3, in the Santa Ana neighborhood of Colonia Morelos, Mexico City, occupied an area of 129\u00a0167 square feet (12\u00a0000 m2), and had machinery imported from Europe and the United States.\nIt employed approximately 200 people, and had 27 electric machines for beveling, grinding, engraving, and polishing glass. At the end of the 19th century, the French stained glass factory Saint-Gobain named the Casa Pellandini its sole representative and depositary in the Mexican Republic. The high society of the Porfiriato, partially Frenchified, liked to purchase the products that the Swiss Claudio Pellandini imported or manufactured. The Mexican Revolution had no adverse effects on the operations of the prestigious company or on the marketing of luxury goods.\nBuilding that housed Claudio Pellandini's stained glass workshops, at Comonfort 48, Santa Ana neighborhood, Mexico City\nStained glasses created by master Claudio Pellandini, placed in windows of the facade of the Government Palace of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, in Monterrey, showed images of various Mexican national heroes. Seven pieces by Pellandini were vandalized on 5 January 2017, during riots at the Plaza de los H\u00e9roes in the capital city of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. They were transferred to the Taller Casa Monta\u00f1a, in Torre\u00f3n, Coahuila, for restoration.\nRuins of the interior of Claudio Pellandini's workshops\nThe Casa Pellandini had a branch in the Downtown of Guadalajara, founded in 1901 on premises numbers 43 and 45 on L\u00f3pez Cotilla Street. On Wednesday, 14 September 1927, a fire broke out minor consequences in said branch of that commercial house. By 1946, it had moved to Avenida Corona 129, also in Guadalajara Downtown. In 1971, it was at Prisciliano S\u00e1nchez 175, also in Guadalajara Downtown. This branch was managed by Otto B. Kiener. This was its last location in that city.\n",

    "1967 book by Dr Isma'il Raji al-Faruqi\nChristian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas (1967) is a scholarly work by Isma'il Raji al-Faruqi, first published in 1967. It explores  Christian ethical thought from both historical and systematic perspectives, analyzing its development and key ideas. This work is part of a broader series by al-Faruqi that examines religious and ethical principles across different faiths. The book is noted for its critical stance on the development of Christian theological doctrines and its advocacy for a rational, coherent ethical framework. The publisher emphasized the unique value of this work as the first major Muslim attempt to examine Christian dogma and ethics on their own terms. The book has been reviewed and critiqued by various scholars, including a notable review from a Christian perspective.\nBackground\nAl-Faruqi was a scholar in Islamic studies and comparative religion. His work in Christian ethics aimed to understand and critique the foundational moral concepts within Christianity from a comparative perspective. The book was developed during his time at McGill University, influenced by scholars such as Wilfred Cantwell Smith and Stanley Brice Frost. He believed that reason was the primary basis for academic dialogue, which led him to affirm Islamic principles, and saw ethics as a suitable area for this discussion. His goal was to provide a comprehensive critique of Christian ethics, positioning it within the broader context of religious and ethical studies. The work is noted for being a significant critique by a modern Muslim of Christianity and Christian ethics. Al-Faruqi's critique includes an argument that Christianity evolved away from Jesus' original teachings, incorporating various influences that he considered corruptive.\nContents\nThe book is divided into several chapters, each addressing different aspects of Christian ethics and its evolution through history.\nThe Jewish Background\nThis chapter sets the stage by exploring the Jewish context in which Jesus' teachings emerged. Al-Faruqi discusses Hebrew racialism, the political and social circumstances of Jesus' time, and the ethical norms prevalent among the Jewish people. He highlights how the Jewish emphasis on the sinfulness of man influenced Christian thought, particularly the concept of original sin, which he argues was developed in the exilic and post-exilic periods. Al-Faruqi criticizes these developments as part of his broader critique of \"peccatism\" and \"saviourism.\"\nThe Ethical Teachings of Jesus\nAl-Faruqi examines the ethical teachings of Jesus, focusing on how they diverged from Jewish norms. This chapter covers Jesus' approach to politics, social issues, family, personal conduct, and cosmic concerns. Al-Faruqi emphasizes Jesus' focus on the intention behind actions rather than merely following the law.\nChristian Legalism and Ethical Breakthrough\nThis section contrasts the teachings of Jesus with later Christian legalism. Al-Faruqi critiques the development of Christian doctrine that, according to him, diverged significantly from Jesus' original message. He draws parallels between the ethics of Jesus and Sufi traditions, highlighting similarities and differences.\nThe Christianist Transvaluation\nAl-Faruqi explores how Christian ethics were transformed and adapted through history, particularly during the Reformation and in modern Christianity. He discusses the changes in the understanding of sin, salvation, and the concept of the imago Dei (image of God). This chapter critiques the evolution of these ideas and their impact on Christian thought. He argues that the idea of original sin is in direct contradiction to Jesus' teachings, which emphasized that ethical worth is a function of the conscious self's will alone.\nSin and Salvation\nThis chapter delves into the concepts of peccatism (the idea of inherent human sinfulness) and saviorism (the belief in Jesus as the redeemer). Al-Faruqi contrasts these with Islamic views, arguing for a more rational and coherent approach to understanding sin and salvation. He critiques the Christian view of sin as a universal and necessary phenomenon, suggesting it was a later development that Jesus did not originally teach. Al-Faruqi called for a new Reformation to restore the pristine faith of Jesus, suggesting that Islam could be an ally in this process.\nMeta-Religion and Logical Consistency\nAl-Faruqi introduces the concept of meta-religion, a set of principles for evaluating religious systems. He emphasizes the importance of logical consistency and coherence in religious thought, critiquing Christian theological paradoxes and advocating for a rational approach to religious doctrine. This concept involves disengaging from one's own beliefs and traditions to fully understand the beliefs and religions of the subject being studied.\nThe Role of Epoch\u00e8\nAl-Faruqi uses a methodology called Epoch\u00e8, or religio-cultural disengagement, which involves ",
    "American businessman (d. 1832) \nSowell Woolfolk (d. January 23, 1832) was a 19th-century American businessman and politician known for serving as a Georgia state legislator and U.S. state militia officer, working as a slave trader, and dying in a duel at Fort Mitchell, Alabama in 1832.\nBiography\nThe major source on Woolfolk is a family history published 2004. A reviewer in the Journal of Southern History commended the 2004 Woolfolk book as an \"exemplar of modern genealogical work\" but criticized the author's \"hagiographic slant...Moreover, Woolfolk subtly presents the Civil War in the 'Lost Cause' mode...In one of several instances of this, she writes: 'Woolfolk family members...supported the Confederate cause for states' rights' as if states' rights was the cause of the Civil War. And, although passing references are made to the Woolfolk family slaves, their participation in the narrative is minute compared to the contribution they made to the family's fortunes.\"\nSowell Woolfolk was originally from Augusta, Georgia. He bought land for himself and family members in the vicinity of Columbus, Georgia beginning in 1827. In March 1827 \"a gang of white men, negroes, and Indians, made an attack on the premises of Mr. Sowell...burned all the buildings, seven in number, comprising one of the best settlements on the property of the state in the newly acquired territory...the cause of it was that  had publically rented property from the State's Agent contrary to their wishes\". He served in the Georgia House of Representatives in 1827 and in the Georgia Senate in 1830 and 1831. He was a brigadier general in the Georgia militia from 1828 to 1832, and thus is sometimes named in histories as Gen. Sowell Woolfolk. A letter reprinted into The Liberator abolitionist newspaper in 1831 advised Gen. Sowell to be alert for an insurrection conspiracy between \"the negroes\" and \"the Indians\" of Georgia and North Carolina.\nIn 1832 Woolfolk twice dueled Joseph T. Camp, another Columbus city official (Woolfolk was intendant, Camp a commissioner). The first duel ended with no shots fired; the second duel ended with Woolfolk's death within minutes. According to a history of Columbus published by the University of Georgia Press, \"The two ambitious men had aligned with opposing political factions, the Troupites and the Clarkites, parties bound by personal loyalty rather than ideological differences. The Niles Register remarked, 'We do not know what they differ about\u2014but they do violently differ.'\"\nSowell Woolfolk was a cousin of Austin Woolfolk, \"one of Baltimore's major slave dealers\" who rose to prominence \"assisted by kinsmen and allied traders...Initially, the Woolfolks transported coffles overland to Augusta, Georgia, for resale, along with the occasional shipment to Savannah or Charleston.\" The Woolfolks \"took advantage of the 'Alabama fever' by providing young slaves to farmers moving to the new gulf coast states. In this business they were strategically well situated, for Augusta, their headquarters, straddled the federal road. To the west lay the rich Tennessee River valley, and beyond, the town of Natchez, soon to become a major slave trading depot.\" Nine years after Woolfolk was killed in the duel, The Mississippi Free Trader newspaper of Natchez listed \"Gen. Woolfolk of the Georgia Senate\" as one of the honorable gentleman of the slave trade, responding to an assertion that the business was conducted by \"desperate, dangerous, and tyrannical men\" by stating:\nThese desperate fellows conduct themselves very peaceably, here, and seem to be great favorites any how. We have seen Col. Bingaman arm in arm, an hundred times, with an old trader, Eli Odom; and we know a certain Isaac Franklin, John L. Harris, Thomas Rowan, Gen. Woolfolk of the Georgia Senate, to say nothing of others, that are recognized here and elsewhere, as gentlemen of the first water. We know a certain Rice Ballard, whose associates, in Virginia, are equal to any man's, and there is also one John Armfield, whose splendid mansion in Alexandria, with its refined hospitalities, is the resort of the most distinguished public men at Washington. A desperate set of ruffians these, with old Andrew Jackson at their head!\"\nSee also\nHistory of slavery in Georgia\nList of slave traders of the United States\nSlave markets and slave jails in the United States\nBibliography of the slave trade in the United States\nNotes\n^ In August 1833, another Clarkite-Troupite shootout took place.  A man named John Milton, who claimed to have been a friend of Sowell Woolfolk, shot Camp dead in the streets of Columbus with a double-barreled shotgun fired from inside a store. Milton claimed self-defense and the politically sympathetic jury accepted the claim. Milton later became Confederate governor of Florida.\n",

    "\nThe Brazilian state of Mato Grosso was the focus of tenentist military conspiracies and the stage of a series of revolts in the 1920s: by the command of the Military Circumscription of Mato Grosso (CMMT), in Campo Grande in 1922, by the 10th Regiment of Independent Cavalry (10th RCI) of Bela Vista in 1924, and the 17th Battalion of Ca\u00e7adores (17th BC) of Corumb\u00e1 in 1925. Tenentist forces from other states also made incursions: the column from the S\u00e3o Paulo Revolt, in 1924, and the Prestes Column in 1925 and again in 1926\u20131927. A state of emergency was in force in the state from August 1924 until the end of 1925, and again from October 1926 to February 1927.\nThe government's traditional practice of transferring disobedient military personnel to Mato Grosso, added to the poor working conditions in the region, favored the support of its younger officers to the country's armed opposition to president Artur Bernardes, elected in 1922. Mato Grosso's political elite remained aligned with the federal government. In parallel with the Copacabana Fort revolt in Rio de Janeiro, on 5 July, general Clodoaldo da Fonseca gave in to pressure from his subordinates to form a \"Provisional Revolutionary Division\", but not all subordinate units joined, and there was no civilian support. Government forces concentrated on the other bank of the Paran\u00e1 River, but the news of the revolt's defeat in Rio de Janeiro made the general hand over command without a fight.\nThe planning of the S\u00e3o Paulo Revolt two years later included parallel revolts in Mato Grosso, and one of them took place among the lieutenants of the 10th RCI on 12 July 1924, under the leadership of Riograndino Kruel and Pedro Martins da Rocha. The regiment's own sergeants staged a counter-revolt and arrested the lieutenants, at the cost of two wounded. The following month, rebels from S\u00e3o Paulo tried to occupy southern Mato Grosso and were repelled at the Battle of Tr\u00eas Lagoas, continuing with the Paran\u00e1 Campaign. Sergeants Antonio Carlos de Aquino and Adalberto Granja revolted the 17th BC on 27 March, resulting in two dozen injuries in fighting against loyalists from the Brazilian Army, Navy and civilians. The rebels in Paran\u00e1 formed the Prestes Column and crossed Mato Grosso twice, on their way to Goi\u00e1s, in May and June 1925, and from Goi\u00e1s to exile, from October 1926 to February 1927.\nThe military environment in Mato Grosso\nAt the beginning of the 1920s, armed struggles between local oligarchs in the state of Mato Grosso (which included current Mato Grosso do Sul at the time) had already passed; the distribution of public offices and political favors had appeased rival factions in the political elite. Internal conflicts were now of another category, promoted by the military. Mato Grosso was a traditional destination for disobedient military personnel. The punitive transfers and terrible working conditions favored the participation of the soldiers who served there in the broader tenentist movement. From 1922 onwards, southern Mato Grosso became a focus of tenentist conspiracy. Ideas comparable to those of the tenentists had already been visible in the revolt of the federal detachment of Ponta Por\u00e3, in January 1921; Its leader, lieutenant Heitor Mendes Gon\u00e7alves, declared himself against \"political excesses and the practice of electoral fraud by the oligarchies in power\".\nSince 1921, the Brazilian Army units in the state were subordinate to the 1st Military Circumscription, better known by the population and press as the Military Circumscription of Mato Grosso (CMMT). The circumscription was based in Campo Grande and commanded by a brigadier general. Its units comprised a Mixed Brigade whose commander was the same as the circumscription's. The strength of all complete units would reach around 4,500 soldiers, but only the 16th, 17th and 18th Battalions of Ca\u00e7adores (BCs), a group from the 11th Regiment of Horse Artillery (RAM) and the 10th Independent Cavalry Regiment (RCI) were minimally organized, and even so, with a lack of personnel.\nLarge sums of public money were spent on building new barracks, but the region's defense suffered from personnel and equipment shortages and routine payment delays of five months, sometimes as long as thirteen months. The development of the Brazilian nation-state in the region was visible in the use of telegraph and railway during the conflicts: reinforcements could arrive via the Northwestern Brazil Railway (NOB), but there were still branches to build and transport continued to depend on trucks and freighters. Until 1924, CMMT did not have its own military trucks, and depended on private vehicles. The fighting brought investment to the CMMT, and in the following year both sides in the conflict used trucks, but they were still not enough to carry all the soldiers. Horses remained the fastest means of transport for large numbers of troops.\n1922\nRevolt of the Military Circumscription\nSee also: Copacabana Fort revolt\nMap of the 1922 revol",

    "Traditional dance of Malawi\nThe Gulewamkulu Traditional Dance is a traditional dance performed by the Chewa people of Malawi, and Zambia. Its history dates back to the 17th century, when it was performed by the Nyau societies, secret fraternal organizations that played a significant role in the social and political lives of the Chewa people. The Chewa ancestors started the dance to talk to the dead's souls, their predecessors and gods.\nThe dance was for honoring the spirits and satisfying them so that they could protect and guide those performing the dance as they asked for blessings from them. It served as a way for Chewa people to show their cultural principles, faith as well as traditional practices which include their bond with environment plus things beyond human understanding.\nWith elaborate costumes, masks and energetic movements, The Gulewamkulu dance is symbolized by life's struggles and victories. Men are amongst the performers of this dance adorning themselves with complex animal and ancestral masks and costumes. The dancers usually move in rhythmic patterns with drumming and singing thus creating a kind of spiritual communion between them.\nHistory\nOrigin\nThe Gulewamkulu Traditional Dance has its roots in the rich cultural heritage of the Chewa people, who trace their origins to the great Bantu migration from central Africa. The dance is believed to have originated in the 17th century, during the reign of the legendary Chewa king, Kalonga Chidzonzi. Kalonga Chidzonzi, also known as the \"Great Python\", was a powerful and wise ruler who united the Chewa people and established the Nyau societies, secret fraternal organizations responsible for maintaining social order, resolving conflicts, and preserving cultural traditions. One of the key figures credited with developing the Gulewamkulu dance is a renowned Chewa chief and spiritual leader named Mwali Chipingu. Mwali Chipingu is said to have received divine inspiration from the spirits to create a dance that would honor the ancestors and communicate with the spirit world.\nCollaborating with other prominent Chewa leaders, including Chief Kaduya and Chief Mkoko, Mwali Chipingu choreographed the dance, designed the masks and costumes, and composed the accompanying music and songs. The dance was initially performed by the Nyau societies, who would don the elaborate masks and costumes to represent various spirits, animals, and ancestors. Over time, the Gulewamkulu dance spread throughout the Chewa territories, with different regions developing their unique styles and variations. Despite the impact of colonialism, Christianization, and urbanization, the dance has remained an integral part of Chewa culture, with efforts made to preserve and promote this rich cultural heritage.\nMeanings\nThe dance holds deep meanings and significance, representing the Chewa people's connection with their heritage, culture, and the spiritual realm. It embodies their values of respect, honor, and gratitude towards their ancestors and the natural world. Through the Gulewamkulu dance, the Chewa people continue to honor their traditions, pass down their cultural knowledge, and strengthen their community bonds.\n",
    "Sylvia Glasser (born 1940) is a South African dancer and choreographer known as a pioneer of Afrofusion, a dance genre that combines African culture with Western modern dance. She served as founding director of the influential dance company Moving into Dance from 1978 to 2013.\nEarly life and education\nSylvia Glasser was born into a white Jewish family in Pietersburg, now Polokwane, South Africa, in 1940.\nShe moved to England to study dance at the London College of Drama and Dance, where she graduated in 1963. She later obtained a bachelor's degree from the University of the Witwatersrand, in 1973; pursued further studies in anthropology at Witwatersrand in the late 1980s; and graduated with a master's in dance from University of Houston\u2013Clear Lake in the United States in 1997.\nCareer\nReturning to South Africa from the U.K., Glasser established herself in the local dance scene with the Experimental Dance Theatre, an annual platform she founded in 1967. By the late 1970s, she had become a prominent figure in the modern dance community of South Africa. Beginning in 1978, she was the founder and longtime director of the influential company Moving into Dance, whose dancers affectionately call her Magogo, meaning \"mother\" or \"grandmother.\" Notable artists who trained with Glasser include Vincent Mantsoe, Gregory Maqoma, Moeketsi Koena, and Portia Mashigo.\nHer choreography blends South African and Western traditions and techniques, which came to be known as Afrofusion, a style that would come to be adopted by many dancers and musical artists. Her seminal work of choreography Tranceformations, inspired by the art of the San people, was first staged in 1991.\nDuring the apartheid period, Glasser used dance to demonstrate opposition to the regime's oppression of black South African culture. From its founding, her company was the first in the country to racially integrate, which was still illegal at the time. She also emphasized the power of education through dance, which she dubbed \"Educdance.\"\nIn 1996, Glasser was given an FNB Vita Special Achievement Award for her work as a choreographer and dance educator. In 2000, she was named a National Living Human Treasure and Foremost Pioneer of South Africa. She was also given a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Tunkie Arts and Culture Trust in 2005. She holds both a Dutch knighthood (2014) and the Order of Ikhamanga Silver from South Africa (2016).\nSince her retirement in 2013, Glasser has published a book, Contemporary Dance and Southern African Rock Art: Tranceformations and Transformations.\nExternal links\nFootage of Tranceformations (1991)\nA sample of Contemporary Dance and Southern African Rock Art: Tranceformations and Transformations\n",

    "Television channel\nTPA 2 is an Angolan over-the-air television channel owned by Televis\u00e3o P\u00fablica de Angola. The channel was directly responsible for the playout and its programming until 2017 and since January 2018.\nHistory\nEarly years\nTPA started broadcasting its second channel on 15 August 2000, limited to Luanda, and broadcasting in an experimental phase. Its programming was limited to repeats of programs seen on TPA 1, as well as a limited number of imported programming. In 2001, TPA announced a plan to expand the channel's coverage area to the entirety of Angola, continuing to relay some of TPA 1's programming, but enriching its offer with a wider array of original programming, to be achieved by the first trimester of 2002.\nIn 2004, the coverage area expanded to new provinces, among them Cabinda, Benguela, Huambo and Hu\u00edla.\nUnder Semba\nTPA 2 was put under Semba's administration in 2008, with assistance from Portuguese production company At\u00e9 ao Fim do Mundo, which would also assist in the creation of TPA Internacional that same year, with many of its original productions being seen on the new channel. Under Semba, TPA 2 was managed by Tchiz\u00e9 dos Santos, daughter of the president of the time, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos. Much of the programming was produced by his brother Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa. TPA 2 broadcast Windeck, the first Angola telenovela to be exported oversease (excluding RTP \u00c1frica) and was even given an Emmy nomination. In 2014, it premiered Jikulumessu - Abre o Olho, another Semba telenovela.\nAt the beginning of May 2013, TPA 2, which had been on air 24/7 for years, was reduced by half (12 hours), following a determination announced by the executive producer and administrator of Semba Comunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Jos\u00e9 Paulino dos Santos (Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa).\nIn the statement, Jos\u00e9 Paulino attributed the reduction in airtime to an alleged non-compliance, on the part of the Ministry of Social Communication and the TPA, with the agreements signed in 2007 relating to payment for services provided, which caused great losses to his company which lives of its own revenue and does not own any of the three TPA channels (1, 2 and International), as they maintain them as state broadcasters.\nSantos has denied numerous times the accusations made by the local press and MPLA and opposition politicians, of taking advantage of the TPA administration for his personal enrichment, at the expense of the public treasury, as he is the son of the President of the Republic.\nThe reduction of the TPA grid generated numerous criticisms. Journalist Makuta Nkondo condemned the silence of the Ministry of Social Communication and the Board of Directors of the TPA and considers the attitude of the son of the President of the Republic as revealing that the country has reached the \u201cpeak of jokes\u201d. \u201cNot even in the worst dictatorships in the world did this happen. Even the Ministry of Social Communication remained silent in the face of these facts because its members do not want to lose the place they occupy and their bread\u201d, he said.\nLoss of Semba control and return of TPA\nFollowing the election of Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o as president of Angola, the new government started a \"witch hunt\" against members of the dos Santos family.\nFollowing the new government's very public decision to end the content production and brand consulting agreements between public station TPA with Cor\u00e9on's company Semba Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, they invoked several false and contractually inaccurate allegations. The main allegations were that the channels were returning to the \"public ownership\" when they were always publicly owned and only using Semba's services. Semba never owned any of the three TPA channels, and has had to clarify for many years its position as a service provider.\nAfter public dismay of the new programming and cancellation of some favourite television shows in January 2018 the Angolan Government's new leadership tried to save face and approval ratings by throwing Cor\u00e9on and his company under the bus. The company responded with a public statement clarifying its role and even how much it was earning for its content services in comparison to the publicly published yearly national television budget (Semba produced most of the entertainment and promotional content for two of the three TPA channels reportedly charging under fees approximating only one-fifth of the budget spent on the main TPA channel). To excuse their poor image quality and the embarrassment of being exposed the new government used all the national public media to announce that Semba had stolen the HD equipment previously used to make TPA's channel 2 and international channel programming, however many well known employees of the channel have all throughout the year posed and posted pictures boasting about exactly the same HD equipment having always been in TPA's studios and currently in use.

    "Termitotrox cupido\nTermitophiles are macro-organisms adapted to live in association with termites or their nests. They include vertebrates, invertebrates and fungi and can either be obligate termitophiles (those that cannot live without the termites) or non-obligate termitophiles (those that can live independently and make use of the termite nests facultatively or opportunistically). Termitophiles may spend a just a part or the whole of their lifecycle inside a termite nest. The term termitariophily has been suggested as a term to describe the situation where a foreign organism merely uses the termite nest.\nTermites live in colonies and construct nests whose environments are controlled. The temperature, humidity, and other conditions inside the nests may be more favourable than the outdoor environment for the termitophiles while potentially also making use of the food resources within the nest, including the fungi grown by the colony or the eggs or larvae being reared. \nTermitophilous insects avoid the defenses of the termite colony through one or more of a number of adaptations including having a rounded and smooth body, having bristles (often yellow) on their body surface, masking their odor to avoid detection, exuding chemicals from their body that the termites find pleasing, or by appearing like inanimate objects or mimicking termites.\nInsects\nCorotoca melantho, a termitophilous rove beetle\nA number of species of staphylinid beetles are known to be termitophiles. Cretotrichopsenius burmiticus has been described from 99 million year old Burmese amber and shows termitophilous adaptations. Some like Trichopsenius frosti and Xenistusa hexagonalis are known to follow the trail pheromones of their termite host Reticulitermes virginicus. Trichopsenius frosti also has a cuticular hydrocarbon profile closely matching that of its host. Staphylinid termitophiles mostly in the subfamily Aleocharinae curl their abdomen over their body. The abdomen may also show enlargement of physogastry and in a few species there are protruding appendages that mimic the body structure of a termite. The Australian species Austrospirachtha mimetes and Austrospirachtha carrijoi have abdomen resembling termites. Similar adaptations are seen in the South American Thyreoxenus alakazam and the African Coatonachthodes ovambolandicus.\nA subfamily of scarab beetles, the Termitotroginae, are small, blind, and with reduced antennae. The genus Termitotrox (includes Aphodiocopris) is known from the fungus combs of termites in India and Africa. They are thought to be obligate termitophiles.\nSome flies in the family Phoridae are termitophilous and grow as larvae within the termite nests. Some species have larvae that feed on the fungus comb while others are termite endoparasites or predators.\nFungi\nTermite nest specific fungi include the Basidiobolus, Antennopsis, and some species of Xylaria. Several species of Termitomyces are grown intentionally as food by termites within their comb.\nSee also\nMyrmecophiles\nSymphiles\nInquiline\n",

    "Prejudice against transgender people in Norway\nTransphobia in Norway has evolved over time. Since the late 20th century and into the early 21st century, acceptance of transgender people has greatly increased. Norway has made significant progress in transgender rights, with strong support from political parties ranging from the most left-wing to the Conservative Party. In the 2020s, Norway has however faced a backlash from anti-gender movements linked to the far right and trans-exclusionary radical feminists. Recently, hate crimes against transgender people have increased, and several anti-trans groups campaign against transgender people. The 2024 Extremism Commission's report cited sources that pointed to \"the connections between radical feminism and Christian conservatism\" in relation to anti-trans activism, noting that \"these are groups and individuals who use violent and dehumanizing language and are also threatening and extremely active.\"\nHistory\nIn Norway transphobia has become less common over time as social acceptance of transgender people has greatly increased and as Norway has made significant progress in transgender rights, with strong support from political parties ranging from the most left-wing to the Conservatives. In the early 21st century anti-LGBTIQ+ activism focused on opposition to marriage equality for lesbian and gay couples, and was largely confined to the Christian right, who were a dwindling minority even in the Christian landscape as the Church of Norway also moved in a more inclusive direction.\nSince around 2020 Norway has seen a resurgence of anti-LGBTIQ+ activism, focused on opposition to transgender people and their rights. This wave of transphobia has been linked to anti-gender movements. In 2022 a terrorist attack targeted the Oslo LGBTQ pride event, which was hosted by the local branch of the Norwegian Organisation for Sexual and Gender Diversity. The head of the Norwegian government's Extremism Commission, Cathrine Thorleifsson, as well as Amnesty International, linked the attack to a pattern of increased attacks on LGBT+ people in Norway and Europe, both on extremist online forums and open social media platforms. In 2024 the Extremism Commission's report highlighted anti-LGBTIQ+ extremism and also cited sources that pointed to \"the connections between radical feminism and Christian conservatism\" in relation to anti-trans activism, noting that \"these are groups and individuals who use violent and dehumanizing language and are also threatening and extremely active.\" Feminist scholars have described these anti-gender movements operating in the name of radical feminism in the Norwegian context as part of a \"complex threat to democracy.\" In 2023 the University of Bergen's Centre for Women's and Gender Research hosted its annual debate on international women's day, that focused on the anti-gender movements in Norway, where panelists highlighted how anti-gender actors had managed to get a foothold in the radical feminist milieu in Oslo and become anchored in the local 8 March committee. In 2022 non-binary people were stripped of their voting rights at the parole meeting for the March 8th march in Oslo, leading to accusations of transphobia. Gender studies scholar Janne Bromseth\u00a0 argued that \"the anti-gender movement has (...) shifted boundaries in the public debate in Norway in recent years,\" resulting in \"a harsher climate of debate where primarily organized TERFs have been given space to set the agenda for the 'debate on gender' and the alleged threat of 'gender ideology' to the natural order.\" Far-right websites such as Document.no promote anti-trans views. Key anti-trans groups formed in the 2020s are the Norwegian branch of Women's Declaration International and Kvinneaktivistene. WDI has collaborated with far-right actors, and its spokespeople have appeared on both Document and Tucker Carlson Tonight. Another group, Sigerdriva, promotes anti-LGBTIQ+ pseudoscience and is closely linked to WDI.\nConspiracy theorist Kari Jaquesson, a member of the Women's Group Ottar, has stated publicly that she considers herself to be a trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) and insisted that \"a man can never become a woman.\" Jaquesson has engaged in doxxing of trans women, publishing pre-transition photographs. She has also accused individual trans people of being sexual predators. Minister of Equality Linda Hofstad Helleland condemned Jaquesson's statements, stating that \"trans people are subjected to hate, violence, and harassment.\" Both Jaquesson and other Ottar members have promoted the false idea that trans people pose a threat e.g. in bathrooms. Researchers have described such claims as baseless and part of a transphobic moral panic that is promoted primarily by the far right, and that harms both trans and cis women. Ottar has also objected to the term \"cisgender,\" which Rogers describes as a common theme in TERF discourse.\nMedia\nMedia play a role in promoting transphobia and anti-ge",
    "Polish coat of armsPotocki coat of arms\nPotocki (Potocki Count I) is a Polish count's coat of arms, a variant of the Pilawa coat of arms. The coat of arms of the Potocki family.\nDescription of the coat of arms\nHistorical description\nJuliusz Ostrowski blazons the coat of arms as follows:In the blue field - a half-three silver cross without the right lower arm. Above the helmet in the crown - five ostrich feathers. Blue robes lined with silver.  - Juliusz Ostrowski, Ksi\u0119ga herbowa rod\u00f3w polskich\nModern description\nThe description constructed contemporaneously reads as follows:\nOn a shield of blue field a silver half-cross.\nAbove the shield a count's crown.\nIn the jewel five ostrich feathers.\nThe crest mantling of blue, lined with silver.\nGenesis\nThe coat of arms belongs to the Hetman line of the Potocki family of the Pilawa coat of arms. Belonging to this line, Alfred Potocki, founder of the \u0141a\u0144cut Ordinance in Galicia, received the title of Count in Austria in 1866. Franciszek Potocki, descended from the same line, received the title of Count in Russia from Tsar Nicholas I Romanov in 1824 (the ceremonial conferment of the title took place in 1838), but died without leaving a male descendant.\nHerbalists\nThe information contained in the article on coats of arms is based on reliable sources, both classical and modern heraldry. However, it is worth noting that it is common to attribute incorrect coats of arms to noble families. This phenomenon intensified especially during the period of legitimisation of the nobility before Partition heraldry and continued in later heraldic publications. It should be borne in mind that the identity of a surname does not always imply belonging to a particular heraldic family. Only thorough genealogical research can unambiguously establish such affiliation.\nToday, it is not possible to reconstruct complete lists of coats of arms, also due to the destruction and loss of many files and documents during World War II (e.g. during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, over 90% of the holdings of the Central Archives in Warsaw, where most Old Polish documents were kept, were burnt down). The surname appearing in the article comes from the Herbarz polskiego, by Tadeusz Gajel. The occurrence of a given surname in an article does not necessarily mean that a particular family sealed with the Potocki coat of arms. Often the same surnames are owned by many families representing all states of the former Republic, i.e. peasants, burghers, nobility. The Potocki coat of arms is a personal coat of arms, so only one family is entitled to use it\nSee also\nPotocki family\nBibliography\nOstrowski J., Ksi\u0119ga herbowa rod\u00f3w polskich, cz.

    "Swim club in Yeadon, Pennsylvania, U.S.\nThe Nile Swim Club is a historically African American swim club located in Yeadon, Pennsylvania, a western suburb of Philadelphia. Continuously open to all races since July 1959, the Nile Swim Club was the first private swimming pool owned and operated by African Americans in the United States. The club provided the growing Black middle class with an alternative to the region's racially segregated swimming pools.\nHistory\nBy the late 1950s, middle-class African Americans, including physicians, ministers, businessmen, teachers, and journalists, formed a majority of homeowners in western Yeadon. White residents nevertheless established the Yeadon Swim Club as a de facto racially segregated facility. Membership applications from African Americans mysteriously disappeared or faced outright rejection.\nIn 1957, the Black community led by Carson Puriefoy, Elmer Stewart, and Zoe Mask rallied to crowdfund its own swimming pool, with 326 original bondholders from Yeadon and nearby communities contributing $250 each. The Nile Swim Club officially opened on July 11, 1959, welcoming a thousand people to its large outdoor pool on the first day. The swim club expanded over time, adding basketball and tennis courts to its 4.5 acres. Carnivals, parties, musical performances, and other events took place there.\nNamed after the African river, the Nile Swim Club rapidly became integral to the African American community in Yeadon. West Philadelphia native Will Smith worked as a DJ at pool parties there. Visitors often spotted Black celebrities such as Johnny Mathis, Harry Belafonte, the Supremes, DJ Cash Money, and others at functions. It was a popular and respected establishment, as a 1959 issue of Jet Magazine observed that \"the $250 fee and a good background are required to keep out the riffraff and undesirables.\"\nThe club struggled financially as early as the 1970s, and its facilities fell into disrepair. It was nearly sold at auction to pay back taxes in 2018 before a crowdfunding campaign averted closure. The all-white Yeadon Swim Club had already closed in 2000. The Nile stabilized and then rebounded in the late 2010s, growing from 200 to 1000 members, each of whom paid $300 a month.\nIn May 2021, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a roadside marker outside the Nile Swim Club entrance on 513 South Union Avenue, recognizing the club as the nation's first swim club owned and operated by African Americans.\n",

    "2004 rape-murder of a teenage girl in Malaysia\nOn 26 February 2004, at Sijangkang in Kuala Langat, Selangor, Malaysia, 18-year-old See Sheau Fang (\u5f90\u6653\u82b3 X\u00fa Xi\u01ceof\u0101ng) was last seen boarding the car of a male acquaintance by her sister. See's family reported her missing and the police investigated her disappearance.  They traced the car registration numbers to a man named Kher Tian Hock (or Kher Thien Hock; \u5bc7\u5929\u798f K\u00f2u Ti\u0101nf\u00fa), who knew the victim, the police questioned him but he denied knowing See's whereabouts. However, when the police questioned Kher's younger brother Kher Then Heng (\u5bc7\u5929\u5174 K\u00f2u Ti\u0101nx\u012bng), he informed them that he witnessed his brother killing See and burying her body in front of his friend's house. Upon receiving this information, the police went to the friend's house, where they found See's corpse beneath a concrete floor.\nThe Kher brothers were subsequently arrested and charged with murder, and Kher Tian Hock confessed that he requested to have sex with See, who rejected his advances and he therefore raped and strangled See. However, before he could stand trial, Kher escaped from the police lockup in March 2004, while Then Heng was left pending trial for murder. Then Heng was later acquitted due to insufficient evidence to convict him, and Kher Tian Hock himself remained on the run for more than seven years before he was arrested by the police in October 2011 for a vehicle theft case, and charged for See's killing. In May 2015, about 11 years after raping and murdering See, Kher was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death.\nBetween 2016 and 2024, Kher appealed to the higher courts against his death sentence and murder conviction. However, none of his appeals succeeded, and Kher is on death row awaiting his execution.\nDisappearance of See Sheau Fang\nOn the night of 26 February 2004, at Sijangkang in Kuala Langat, Selangor, Malaysia, 18-year-old Form 5 student See Sheau Fang, who had just completed her Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) examinations and waiting for her exam results, went out for tea with a male friend. After her sister saw her entering a white car.\nWhen See had not return home by the following day, her family searched for her. See's father See Soon Thiam (\u5f90\u987a\u6dfb X\u00fa Sh\u00f9nti\u0101n) filed a police report to report his daughter's disappearance, and had also sought help from Datuk Seri Michael Chong of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) to search for his daughter. About 500 residents took part in the search for See around the neighbourhood.\nNot long after reporting his daughter missing, See's father received a phone call from an unknown caller, who informed him that he had kidnapped See and demanded a ransom of RM40,000 in return for her release. The father dropped off the ransom at a location in Klang but she did not return home. Background checks revealed that See had been harassed by a man on the phone and stalked by the same harasser.\nInvestigations\nDuring the police's investigations, See's sister told the police that she saw the license plate numbers - \"5678\" and \"Max 3\" - on the car See left in.  The police traced the car registration numbers to a 29-year-old car repairman named Kher Tian Hock, who was brought in for questioning. Kher, who was detained for one week, denied that he was involved in the disappearance of See. The car license numbers were later found to be forged.\nSimultaneously, the police also found the car that bore the registration numbers, and detained its driver, who was 26-year-old Kher Then Heng, the younger brother of Kher Tian Hock. After he was brought in for questioning, Then Heng informed the police that See was already dead, and that her body was buried in front of a friend's house under concrete.\nOn 8 March 2004, two weeks after See went missing, the police were led by Then Heng to a house in Kuala Langat, where they detected a strong odour, and began to dig at the concrete floor. The police spent 14 hours to excavate the concrete floor and dug up a decomposed body of a female. The deceased's head was wrapped up in a plastic bag tied with rope around her neck, her body was covered with a blue blanket and plastic, and her hands were tied. The body was buried at the hole for at least four days, and the deceased was speculated to have died at least five days previously.\nThe corpse was transported to the Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital, Klang, for post-mortem examinations. DNA testing later confirmed that the body belonged to 18-year-old See Sheau Fang, and her father See Soon Thiam similarly identified his daughter after seeing the clothes and earpin worn by the deceased. An autopsy established strangulation as the probable cause of death, and it was confirmed that there were semen on See's private parts, suggesting that she had been raped by her killer(s) before her death. The news of See's death caused distress to her family, especially her mother who stated she lost the will to live when hearing of her daughter's death. Neighbours stated they did think an",
    "\nHumour in Sikhism refers to the relationship between Sikhs and humour. In Sikhism, devotion is not seen as being antithetical to comedy but rather the two can be conjoined together.\nHistory\nMany hagiographical Sikh stories involve humour. One sakhi (tale) linked to Sikhs having a sense of humour is when Guru Nanak visited Haridwar. In the morning, whilst people were tossing water in the direction of the Sun, instead Guru Nanak took some water and began tossing it toward his field in Kartarpur, located very far away. Onlookers, including the pundits, questioned Guru Nanak on what he was doing, with Guru Nanak rebuking that his fields in Kartarpur were much closer than the Sun and that if tossing the water at the Sun would reach it, then tossing the water at Kartarpur would definitely help irrigate his crops. The reasoning behind this action was to rebuke the prevailing belief that throwing water to the east would reach ancestors beyond the grave. Modern Sikhs find humour in this story but it is unknown if the pilgrims and local clergy who met Guru Nanak and were exposed to this incident at the time found humour in it.\nWhilst at Mecca, another tale narrates that Guru Nanak pointed his feet toward the Kaaba whilst laying down at night. When he was reprimanded for doing so by the local Islamic clergy, he replied that they should then turn his feet in the direction where God is not present. A story of Guru Nanak visiting Baghdad says that in the morning time, the Guru wanted to gather his own congregation, so he created his own Azaan call and performed it by yelling at a high-altitude location. People became curious upon hearing this new kind of call to prayer and came to see him. Another legend narrates that once Guru Nanak came upon happy children who were playing, jumping, and having fun in the street whilst he was travelling. Upon seeing the children, Guru Nanak also began to jump, shout, and sing like them.\nA funny story also involved Guru Nanak and a pundit named Kalyug. Kalyug claimed to have the power to see the spritiual realm of Shivapuri, Brahmpuri, and other Indic mythological abodes. Kalyug would instruct devotees to meditate with him by closing their eyes, claiming to guide them through a celestial astral projection. At one of these meditation events whilst everyone's eyes were closed, Guru Nanak told Bhai Mardana to take Kalyug's donation bowl and hide it behind a bush. When Kalyug's meditation event finished, he exclaimed that someone had taken his donation bowl and asked where it was, until a large crowd had gathered. Guru Nanak then told him that he claims to be able to see celestial realms yet he cannot meditate and search the Universe for where his donation bowl had gone.\nA story, involving miracles, related to Guru Angad and Amar Das, on the topic of tolerating things seen as offensive, tells that Amar Das once became irritated at a perceived transgression against Guru Angad by farmers and a holyman. In the midst of a drought, a holyman convinced a group of farmers that they should abandon their following of Guru Angad and instead follow him if they hoped for their crops to receive rain. The farmers started following this man instead of Angad, yet the drought did not cease as they had hoped for. Amar Das heard of what was happening and instructed the farmers to drag the holyman wherever they wished to receive rain. The farmers dragged the holyman to their fields, where it then rained. Guru Angad found out about this and rebuked Amar Das for performing a miracle and that even grave insults to Sikhs, such as one targeting a Sikh guru, should be tolerated by Sikhs.\nAnother tale tells of Guru Amar Das, in his elderly years, being kicked whilst seated by an upset relative of his predecessory guru. Instead of getting upset, Guru Amar Das started massaging the relative's foot and said the old bones in the foot must have hurt when he kicked him. This tale instructs Sikhs to even take serious and offensive actions in a light-hearted manner.\nGuru Arjan, knowing the power and effectiveness of humour, inserted a humourous hymn attributed to Bhagat Dhanna into his compilation of the first edition of the Adi Granth:\nO God, I, Thine afflicted servant, come to Thee. Thou arrangest the affairs of those who perform Thy service. I beg of Thee to give me flour, ghee, and pulse, so that my heart may rejoice for ever. I want shoes and fine clothes, and corn grown on a field ploughed seven times over. I want a milch cow and a buffalo, and a good Turkustani mare, and a good wife. These things Thy servant Dhanna begs of Thee.\u2014\u200aBhagat Dhanna, Dhanasri Raga, Guru Granth Sahib\nAnother amusing verse in the primary Sikh scripture is attributed to Bhagat Kabir in Sorath Raga, which states that he cannot keep praying to God if he continues to keep him hungry, he then lists foods he desires to eat.\nBhai Bidhi Chand was said to have been a funny man during his numerous exploits.

    "Mountain in Washington, United States\nKennedy Peak is an 8,381-foot (2,555-metre) summit in Snohomish County, Washington, United States.\nDescription\nKennedy Peak is located 24 miles (39\u00a0km) east-southeast of Darrington in the heart of the Glacier Peak Wilderness on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. It is set 1.5\u00a0mile (2.4\u00a0km) immediately north-northwest of Glacier Peak in the North Cascades. Kennedy ranks as the fifth-highest peak in Snohomish County and 95th-highest in the state. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains west to the White Chuck River via Kennedy Creek, and north into Milk and Vista creeks which are tributaries of the Suiattle River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 6,400 feet (1,951 meters) above the Suiattle River in six miles (9.7\u00a0km) and 2,400 feet (732 meters) above the Kennedy Glacier in one-quarter mile (0.4\u00a0km). The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the peak's west slope. The mountain's toponym was officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1963 which was the year that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.\nGeology\nSubduction and tectonic activity in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about 90\u00a0million years ago. The area was previously an oceanic environment, consisting mainly of sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about 35\u00a0million years ago. However, mountain building in the area did not begin until the Miocene, approximately 10\u00a0million years ago. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is south-southeast of Kennedy Peak, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene. Kennedy Peak is composed of Quaternary andesite of the volcanic lava flows from Glacier Peak.\nThroughout the ice age, the North Cascades were mostly covered in thick glaciers, extending to near Puget Sound. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately 18,000 years ago, and most valleys were ice-free by 12,000 years ago. As a result, valleys in the area are deep and U-shaped, and mountains tend to be rocky, with steep slopes and narrow summits.\nClimate\nKennedy Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originating in the Pacific Ocean travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) or above 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C). This climate supports the Kennedy Glacier, Vista Glacier, and the Ptarmigan Glacier surrounding the peak.\nGallery\nKennedy Peak from Miners Ridge\nWest aspect of Kennedy Peak to the left, with Kennedy Glacier\nSouth aspect of Kennedy Peak (foreground) seen from Glacier Peak summit\nKennedy Peak (upper right) and Glacier Peak\nKennedy Peak centered at top\nSee also\n Mountains portal\nGeography of the North Cascades\nGeology of the Pacific Northwest\n",
    "American planter, patriot and politician\nEdmund Booker (October 17, 1719 \u2013 January,  1793) was an American planter and politician in Amelia County, Virginia that he represented in the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788, as well as held local offices.\nEarly life and education\nHe was born to Jane Booker (circa 1697-after 1758) and her husband Edmund Booker (1693\u20131758) probably in Tidewater Virginia's Essex County. His grandfather Richard Booker (1642-before 1711) had emigrated from Amsterdam, Holland, where his English religious dissenter parents had fled, and immigrated to the Colony of Virginia where he settled in Abingdon Parish of Gloucester County. Grandfather Richard had married at least twice, but only one son Frances Booker (1695\u20131752) survived of his last marriage, to Hannah Hand (1670\u20131720) of Elizabeth City County (also in the Tidewater region). This man's father was the youngest of five sons (and two daughters) born in Richard's marriage to Rebecca Leake of Tidewater York County. Most of the siblings, including this man's father, moved their young families westward to Amelia County, then being settled in Virginia's Piedmont region. This man's uncle Edward Booker (1680\u20131750), was living in Henrico County when he received a land grant of 2050 acres south of the James River in what was then Prince George County around 1732, two years before the legislature split off Amelia County. Edward and his brother (this man's uncle) Richard Booker (d. 1760) were two of the earliest justices of the peace in Amelia County (the justices in that era collectively governing the county, as well as handled smaller judicial matters) and Edward, Richard, and Edward Booker Jr. would ultimately represent Amelia County in the House of Burgesses, as well as held other local offices. The other uncles were Richard Booker (1688-1743, named after a brother of the same name died as an infant, and who one genealogist believed remained near Williamsburg in York County) and John Booker (1690-?). Both this man's father and Edward Booker Sr. named one of their sons Edward, and other common names in the family were Richard, John, William and Frances, which complicated genealogies. In any event, this son received a private education appropriate to his class.\nCareer\nBooker won his first election in 1749, to the vestry of Raleigh Parish. In 1758, he and Richard Booker won election to the House of Burgesses, although Richard Booker died and was replaced by John Winn in the 1761 session. During his term, Edmund Booker took the oath of office as justice of the peace for Amelia County on June 26, 1760. He either did not stand for re-election, or was defeated, as was Winn, for voters replaced both seats in 1761. In 1761, during the French and Indian War, this man was a captain in the local militia, and by October 1772 became sheriff of Amelia County.\nIn that era, sheriffs were ineligible to serve in the state legislature (hence his probable successor David Greenhill gave up his seat before 1765, when he became sheriff and was replaced by Robert Munford who continued to win re-election until 1768). Although merchant John Tabb and John Winn represented Amelia County during Virginia's revolutionary conventions and first session of the  Virginia House of Delegates, the seats appear to have become competitive, with Revolutionary era county clerk John Pride serving for several sessions alongside different men before John Booker Jr. was elected in 1784 and this man's son Davis Booker won one of the two seats in 1787 and again in 1788. His cousin William Booker (son of William Booker) lived in the area which became Prince Edward County, Virginia, which he represented in the last Revolutionary convention (1776) and in the House of Delegates.\nBetween Davis Booker's elections to the House of Delegates, this man and John Pride won election to the Virginia Ratifying Convention as Amelia County's representatives. Both men apparently sided with their neighbor (and former Virginia governor) Patrick Henry, a leading Antifederalist, but made no speeches that were recorded. Both voted to require amendments to the proposed new federal constitution, and then voted (unsuccessfully) against ratification.\nIn the Virginia tax census of 1787, Edmund Booker owned 18 teenage slaves and 13 adults, as well as 14 horses and 34 cattle. Edmund Booker Jr. lived in the county's other district, near Samuel Booker, and paid taxes on four teenaged slaves, four enslaved adults, five horses and nine cattle. He died still owning eleven slaves and 568 acres of land.\nPersonal life\nBooker married three times. On May 17, 1746 he married Edith Marot Cobbs (1725-after 1765), who had been born in Williamsburg but moved to Amelia County when her father Samuel Cobbs became the new county's first clerk of court. Before her death, she bore four sons and three daughters. Edmund's will named his surviving daughters as Jane, Rachel Morton and Francis Hill, and sons Edmund Jr., Samuel, Davis and",
    "Danish folktale about swan maidens\nMaid Lena (Danish: Jomfru Lene af S\u00f8ndervand; German: Jungfer Lene von S\u00f6ndervand; English: \"Maiden Lene from Sondervand\") is a Danish folktale collected by author Svend Grundtvig. It features versions of the swan maiden, a mythic female character that alternates between human and animal shapes.\nThe story is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as tale type ATU 400, \"The Man on a Quest for the Lost Wife\", in a form of the narrative that, according to scholars, appears in Northern Europe, namely, in Scandinavia and in the Baltic Sea.\nTranslations\nThe tale was alternatively translated into English as Maid Lena and as The Lass of S\u00f6ndervand, in Danish Fairy Tales.\nSummary\nA farmer has three sons: Poul, Peder and Esben, who is considered a fool for spends his days near the fireplace playing in the ashes (thus earning the name Esben Ashenfiest or Askefis; Esben-Ash-rake in Stith Thompson's translation). The family plants wheat in a meadow, but on St. John's Night, they find the fields are completely trampled. This goes on for the next year, and they decide to plant flax and to keep watch on their fields for three nights: Poul and Peder fail in their vigil, but Esben Askefis keeps watch on the third night.  Esben finds three white swans coming to the fields, tunring into human maidens by their feather cloaks, wings and gossamer veils, and dancing in the meadow. While they are distracted with the dance, Esben steals their clothes. The maidens then try to find their garments and see Esben, begging him to return their clothes, but Esben asks each of them to be his wife. The first two decline, but the third, named Lene, agrees to be his wife, and gives him her ring as a token. She also reveals that Lene and her sisters are princesses, cursed by a witch, and used to live in castle where the field is now located. For their wedding, Esben must build a castle in that same place, and Lene teaches him a spell he can use on a rock. Lene and the others depart. Esben knocks on a rock with a twig, chants the spell, and finds money, gold and ornaments under the rock. He hires carpenters and masons to build him a castle, which is concluded on Walpurgis Night.\nEsben invites the whole village to the wedding, but the king invites himself. On the eve of the summer solstice. Esben waits at the castle doors and sees the swans flying towards him. Then a magnificent carriage appears, carrying Lene. Esben goes to greet her, but she notices the king's presence and warns Esben the king desires her. She then tells Esben to find her in her own castle, located \"south of the sun, west of the moon and in the middle of the world\", and departs. Thus, Esben begins his journey toward the distant castle. On the road, he meets three pairs of goblins fighting over magical objects: a hat of invisibility, seven-league boots, and a Swiss knife that both revives the dead and kills people. Esben steals the objects for himself.\nLater, he finds the huts of three old women: the first rules over the animals of the forest, the second all the fishes in the sea and the third all the birds of the air. The first and the second old woman summon all her subjects to ask for the location of the castle, but none of the animals of both forest and sea know. In the third woman's home, in Vogelberg ('Bird Mountain'), an old eagle comes late and announces it has come from that exact place, and offers to take Esben there. After a long journey, Esben finally reaches Lene's castle. He sees a maidservant and asks for a cup of wine. The servant brings him a cup, he puts Lene's ring inside and the servant takes the cup back to her mistress. Lene recognizes the ring and rushes to Esben to hug him, but fears for his safety, since a witch lives in the castle and may turn him to stone with but a glare. Esben put on the invisibility hat, enter the witch's quarters and kills her with the Swiss knife. Now free at last, Lene and Esben marry.\nAnalysis\nTale type\nThe tale is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as type ATU 400, \"The Man on a Quest for the Lost Wife\": the hero finds a maiden of supernatural origin (e.g., the swan maiden) or rescues a princess from an enchantment; either way, he marries her, but she disappears to another place. He goes after her on a long quest, often helped by the elements (Sun, Moon and Wind) or by the rulers of animals of the land, sea and air (often in the shape of old men and old women).\nThe middle episode of the hero acquiring magic objects that help in his journey is classified as tale type ATU 518, \"Men Fight Over Magic Objects\": hero tricks or buys magic items from quarreling men (or giants, trolls, etc.). Despite its own catalogation, folklorists Stith Thompson and Hans-J\u00f6rg Uther argue that this narrative does not exist as an independent tale type, and usually appears in combination with other tale types, especially ATU 400.\nMotifs\nRomanian folklorist Marcu Beza recognize",
    "Finnish Catholic aid organisation\nCaritas Finland in English and Swedish or Suomen Caritas in Finnish is a Catholic aid organisation from Finland. It is part of the European network of Caritas organisations Caritas Europa, as well of the global Caritas Internationalis confederation.\nHistory\nIn October 1960, Caritas Finland emerged from the Katrina Association, which had been founded in 1927. Its values and work are rooted in Catholic social teaching. \nIn 2011, Bishop Emeritus Teemu Sippo began to integrate Caritas Finland into the Catholic diocese. This initiative followed Pope Benedict's decision to appoint Caritas as the official aid and development cooperation organisation of the Catholic Church. Caritas Finland was reformed and established in its current form in 2015 with new statutes to meet the management standards of Caritas Internationalis. Larissa Franz-Koivisto was appointed as the first Secretary General.\nCaritas Finland is a partnership organisation of the Finnish Ecumenical Council, a member of the Finnish development NGO network FINGO, and of the Blue Ribbon Foundation (Sininauhaliitto), a network of experts in homelessness and substance abuse services. The Blue Ribbon Foundation is also a member of the European Anti Poverty Network.\nWork\nIn Finland, Caritas primarily works with immigrants in cooperation with Catholic parishes. In recent years, Caritas Finland has expanded its operations. It is part of Helsinki's Stadin Safka network, which utilizes food that would otherwise go to waste. In 2022, through events organised every other week at the Caritas office, more than 500 food aid bags were distributed to persons in need. Caritas also offers guidance and counselling services on issues such as residence permits, employment, and housing. Additionally, it organises \"friendship caf\u00e9s\" and excursions aimed at creating social links between people.\nAt the international level, Caritas Finland supports development cooperation projects in Latin America, Asia and Africa with local partners and other European Caritas organisations.\nCaritas Finland receives financial support from individuals through membership fees and donations, communities, and public sector actors in Finland. It does not receive any financial support from the Catholic Church of Finland. The organisation also works with volunteers.

    "Shadow Cabinet of the United Kingdom since 2024\nRishi Sunak has been Leader of the Opposition as Leader of the Conservative Party since 5 July 2024, following his resignation as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the aftermath of the Conservative Party's defeat in the 2024 general election. He formed his shadow cabinet on 8 July 2024. Sunak will serve as Leader of the Opposition until his successor is elected in the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election.\nOverview\nIn his resignation speech, Sunak announced that he would resign as Conservative leader, but not immediately, resigning once the arrangements are in place for his successor to be elected. He formed his shadow cabinet on 8 July 2024. This was the party's first shadow cabinet since the Shadow Cabinet of David Cameron, which was disbanded in 2010 after Cameron formed a coalition government with Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats following that year's general election.\nMost members of Sunak's cabinet heading into the 2024 general election were given the same portfolios in the shadow cabinet, including former chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who became shadow chancellor, and former home secretary James Cleverly, who became shadow home secretary.

On 20 May 2018 he made his senior professional debut in an away Botola fixture against Chabab Rif Al Hoceima at the Fez Stadium, in which Ittihad Tanger lost 2\u20130.\nHe signed his professional contract with Ittihad Tanger in 2020.\nHe scored his first professional goal on 7 April 2021, at 81st minute in a 2\u20131 away win against Nahdat Berkane, replacing Taoufik Ijrouten after 77 minutes.\nDeath\nOn July 6, 2024, Abdellatif Akhrif tragically went missing at sea along with his newly promoted to the first team Salman Harraqi during a yacht excursion off the coast of Tangier. The incident occurred when strong currents and heavy winds swept their small yacht away while the players were swimming near Playa Restinga, located between the towns of M'diq and Fnideq.\nThe players, part of a group of five from Ittihad Tanger, had rented a yacht for a recreational outing. They were initially stopped by the coastguard, who confirmed their papers were in order and that they had life jackets on board. However, the players did not have buoys when they jumped into the water. According to survivors' accounts, the sea conditions suddenly changed, with heavy winds and strong currents pushing the yacht far from the swimmers.\nEmergency services launched a rescue operation, saving three individuals: Oussama Aflah, a club employee; Soulaimane Dahdouh; and Abdelhamid Maali, a Morocco under-17 international. These survivors were at sea for several hours before being rescued. Despite exhaustive search efforts by the Royal Navy and marine gendarmerie, which included the use of helicopters and boats, Akhrif and Harraqi remained missing.\nAlthough their bodies have not been found, it is presumed that both Akhrif and Harraqi have died. The search and rescue operations continued, but hopes diminished as days passed without locating the missing players.\nThe incident caused a wave of distress and anxiety among the families, teammates, and Moroccans in general. Ittihad Tanger's president, Mohamed Cherkaoui, urged caution in sharing information, emphasizing the emotional toll on the families. Local media and the club called for respect and patience as the search continued. Despite some misinformation and rumors, the authorities and the club maintained that there was no evidence suggesting an attempt at illegal migration, focusing instead on the tragic accident and the ongoing efforts to find the missing players.\n",
    "\nThe following list is of Ferries and boats that have been operated by Red Funnel. \nBetween 1840 and the 1960s, Red Funnel line and its predecessors operated 40 different classic passenger ferries, many of these being paddle steamers. Later ferries sometimes had space allocated for carrying cars but it was not until 1959 that the first purpose-built car ferry was introduced. Classic passenger vessels continued in service until the Balmoral was sold in 1969.\nPaddle steamers\nPS\u00a0Princess Elizabeth\nTwin-screw steamers\nMotor vessels\nThe Balmoral in Waverley Excursions ownership\nCar ferries\nMV Cowes Castle approaching Town Quay\nMV Norris Castle, in the Solent\nAlthough some earlier ferries provided space for cars, Red Funnel introduced its first purpose-built car ferry in 1959. Besides the Raptor-class vessels that are still in service, the following car ferries have been used by Red Funnel:\nFast passenger ferries\nThe first fast ferry introduced by Red Funnel was the Sea Coach Island Enterprise, a motor cruiser capable of carrying 11 passengers at 20 knots. She was built by the British Power Boat Company in Hythe, and operated from 1933 to 1938.\nHovercraft\nIn 1968 the company ran trials with an HM2 sidewall hovercraft, number 002, in order to compete with the Seaspeed service which used an SRN6 between Southampton and Cowes. Due to the unreliability of the craft it never entered passenger service. In 1981 Red Funnel acquired a pair of HM2 MkIIIs, GH2019 & GH2024, which were primarily used on the charter service for Vosper Thorneycroft transporting workers from the Isle of Wight to the Woolston yard and back each day. These two craft were disposed of in June 1982 and the charter was subsequently operated by the augmented hydrofoil fleet.\nHydrofoils\nShearwater 3 at speed on Southampton Water\nThe first hydrofoils to operate on the Southampton to Cowes route, and the first in commercial service in the United Kingdom were the Italian-designed Shearwater and Shearwater 2. These were introduced by Red Funnel in 1969, and each seated 54 passengers. They were replaced in 1973 by two 67-seat RH70 hydrofoils, built by Canti\u00e8re Navale Rodriguez, named Shearwater 3 and Shearwater 4. The latter was delivered some five months after the former and in the interim, a PT20 craft, Fleccia di Reggio, was chartered to stand in. In 1982 Shearwater 5 and Shearwater 6 were added to the fleet. In 1991, with the introduction of the first Red Jet catamarans, the hydrofoils were demoted to backup duties until they were finally withdrawn in 1998.\nRed Jets\nRed Jet 1 at Town Quay\nTugs and tug tenders\nSome tugs also had passenger accommodation to enable them to serve as tenders to liners not berthing in Southampton and to augment the excursion fleet on occasion.\nPreserved tug-tender Calshot moored at Southampton\nRed Funnel tug Chale turning the Queen Elizabeth 2\nSir Bevois (III) tug\nMedina crossing\nHythe Crossing Ferries\nIn 2023, the Hythe Ferry was acquired by Red Funnel, previous ferries to have operated on the service include:\nMV\u00a0Hythe Hotspur ex Gosport Ferry, Southsea Queen bought in 1978 to operate cruises and act as a standby vessel for the ferry.\nMV\u00a0New Forester introduced in 1982.

As a result of the collision the Maritime and Coastguard Agency withdrew the vessel's passenger safety certificate and vessel was later sold.\nHotspur IV was built in 1946 and served on the service until 2014. Hotspur IV was the last in a line of similar ferries. One of her earlier half-sisters, Hotspur II of 1936, saw further service as a ferry on the Firth of Clyde under the name Kenilworth.\n",
    "D\u00f6beritz military training area\nTraining area in D\u00f6beritz, postcard from 1900\nThe D\u00f6beritz military training area (German: Truppen\u00fcbungsplatz D\u00f6beritz or Heeresschule D\u00f6beritz), was a major military training area near Dallgow-D\u00f6beritz, in Brandenburg to the west of Berlin. D\u00f6beritz was one of the largest training areas in Germany. The area was used for more than 300 years. until 1992 by the Prussian Army, the Reichswehr and the Wehrmacht as well as the Soviet occupation forces. The area was used for troop training of the army, for non-commissioned officer and officer training, from 1910 also the training of pilots, for testing new aircraft, and in the 1930s as a training area for motor vehicles.\nHistory\nThe area of the D\u00f6beritzer Heide, which was still forested until 1896, was used as a military maneuver area for around 300 years until 1992. It became a training area in 1896. This was located west of Berlin in the Havelland between Dallgow in the north, Krampnitz in the south, Priort in the west, and Seeburg in the east. In this area, King Frederick\u00a0I's regiments were occasionally trained in practical warfare. The first military use of the area around the village of D\u00f6beritz was recorded in 1713 under Frederick William\u00a0I. In September 1753, under Frederick\u00a0II, the first large maneuver followed, which was misleadingly depicted in literature during the Seven Years' War, with 44,000 soldiers already participating.\nUntil 1890, the Berlin and Potsdam troops conducted shooting exercises at the shooting range in Tegel. Due to the shortcomings of the place, the Prussian military leadership demanded a permanent training ground. The then Chief of the General Staff of the Guard Corps decided on the area around D\u00f6beritz. In 1892, the then General Staff Officer von Bredow was commissioned to inspect the area and determine the boundaries. The land surveys and the negotiations of the military treasury with the affected communities began in 1893, and by 1894, the military treasury requisitioned an area of about 4400\u00a0hectares around D\u00f6beritz.\nAfter the purchase negotiations were completed, three-quarters of the forested area was cleared. Some of the resulting wood was used for the construction of the officers' mess, the barracks, and the stables of the Guard camp. This was done with regard to the expected troop deployment in colonies (e.g., the Boxer Rebellion in China) to simulate steppe and desert-like geographies. Since 1895, the permanent establishment was carried out by setting up and constructing a commandant's office and garrison administration. The original location of the commandant's office was in Spandau until 1910 and was only moved to D\u00f6beritz during the summer months \u2013 during the time of the exercises.\nTheodore Roosevelt (center) with his son Kermit (left) and Emperor Wilhelm\u00a0II. (on the white horse) at a military parade in D\u00f6beritz, May 1910\nThe training area was named after the former village of D\u00f6beritz, which lay in the middle of the area. In 1895, the village of D\u00f6beritz was cleared of its last inhabitants. After the evacuation, the guard and work command moved into the buildings in the village. In the presence of Emperor Wilhelm\u00a0II., the D\u00f6beritz Training Area and the Guard camp were opened for use on April 1, 1895. The area initially served as a training ground for the Guard Corps. In the first decade of the 20th century, the Heerstra\u00dfe (today's B\u00a05) was expanded at military request. This served as a direct connection between Berlin and the training area. In 1901, the Observation balloons of the Luftschiffertruppen (Airship Troops) received the first airship battalion.\nFrom 1910, the D\u00f6beritz Airfield with flying school was established, which was to become significant for the first military use of aircraft in Germany. Initially not a separate branch of the armed forces, it was subordinated to the Army until 1916. D\u00f6beritz is thus the birthplace of the German Air Force.\nThe obelisk on the training area, erected by Emperor Wilhelm\u00a0II, was heavily damaged by vandalism.\nPrisoner of war caricature\nAt the beginning of the First World War, a provisional prisoner of war camp was set up at the western edge of the camp, which was expanded in 1915 to two newly built camps by prisoners of war at Rohrbeck and Dyrotz. By October 1918, more than 30,000 prisoners from seven nations were interned there\nAfter the First World War, the Reichswehr, associations of the Black Reichswehr, and nationalist military associations used the training area and its facilities.\nIn November 1919, the Freikorps-Brigade Ehrhardt (Marinebrigade Ehrhardt Volunteer Corps) was relocated from Upper Silesia to the D\u00f6beritz camp. In March 1920, the order was given to disband the brigade. Its leaders \u2013 determined to resist disbandment \u2013 appealed to General Walther von L\u00fcttwitz in Berlin. L\u00fcttwitz, one of the organizers of the Freikorps in 1918 and 1919, turned to Reich President Friedrich Ebert and Reichswehr Minister Gustav Noske to stop the disb",
    "Former lifeboat station in Norfolk, England\nCaister Lifeboat Station is located in the village and seaside resort of Caister-on-Sea, on the east coast of the county of Norfolk.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Norfolk Association for Saving the Lives of Shipwrecked Mariners (NASLSM) in 1845. Management of the station was transferred to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1857.\nThe RNLI station closed in 1969. The station was reopened as an independent station, managed by the Caister Volunteer Lifeboat Service.\nHistory\nIn the late 1700s, a group of men, mainly fishermen, formed the \"Caister Company of Beachmen\", in order to find extra employment offering additional boat services, ferrying passengers and pilots, retrieving discarded anchors to re-sell, and in times of shipwreck, to rescue people, and more importantly, salvage boats and cargo. When lifeboats started being placed along the coast, these would be the men to crew the lifeboat. This company would survive until 1941, when a motor-lifeboat was placed at Caister. During this time, the company would also provide their own boats, and carry out rescues, sometimes in conjunction with the lifeboat.\nThe first Lifeboat was placed at Caister in 1845, by the Norfolk Association for Saving the Lives of Shipwrecked Mariners (NASLSM) (or Norfolk Shipwreck Association). The boat was transferred from its previous service at Bacton Lifeboat Station in Norfolk, but on arrival, it was found to be in very poor condition. The Caister boatmen refused to use the boat.\nThe NSA then provided a new boat, a 42-foot Norfolk and Suffolk-class non-self-righting 'Pulling and Sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with Oars and Sails, built of oak, by Branford of Yarmouth, which arrived in Caister in 1846. A store and lookout were constructed at the end of Beach Road with the permission of the Lord of the manor, Thomas Clowes. The lookout was the top of a ship's mast, purchased for \u00a33-10s-0d, and standing 60 feet (18\u00a0m) tall.\nIn 1857, management of the Caister lifeboat was transferred to the RNLI, who provided a new lifeboat in 1865. A gift of the Birmingham Lifeboat Fund, the boat was named James Pearce Birmingham No.2. In the following 18 years on service at Caister, the boat would save 484 lives.\nThe RNLI would provide an additional second lifeboat in 1867, Caister No.2 Lifeboat, a smaller 32-foot lifeboat named Boys, thanks to a donation from the Routledge magazine for boys. In 1875, Caister No.2 boat Boys would be renamed Godsend, following a donation by Lady Jane Barbara Bourchier (1810\u20131884) of Hampton Court Palace. Lady Bourchier had previously funded a boat, also the Godsend, at Chapel Lifeboat Station in Lincolnshire. In 1878, donations from the Covent Garden Lifeboat Funds would be appropriated to the Caister No.1 lifeboat, it being renamed Covent Garden. This would then be the first of three Caister lifeboats to carry that name.\nCovent Garden was launched on 25 March 1879 to the aid of the brig Cato, wrecked on Haisborough Sands whilst on passage from Arendal to Calais. All eight crew were rescued. On 6 November 1880, sixteen crew were rescued from the steamship Swan, aground on Haisborough Sands. 10 days later, on 16 March 1880, 17 survivors were rescued from the steamship Ringdove, which had run aground on Cross Sand.\nIn 1887, a new lifeboat building was built, located approx. 1\u20444 mile (0.40\u00a0km) to the south of Beach road, and known as the \"white shed\". The shed was used just for equipment storage, with the lifeboats standing on the beach.\nLaunching just after 4:00am on 8 November 1899, Caister No.2 lifeboat Beauchamp (ON 327) would save the lives of eight men from the lugger Palestine, stranded on Cockle Sand. Setting anchor and veering down, the lifeboat was washed on top of the partly sunken vessel, causing considerable damage to her bow. With waves crashing over both boats, the master and a boy from the vessel had a lucky escape, being pulled from the water, after having jumped and missed the lifeboat. With all eight aboard, the lifeboat moved clear, and then waited until daybreak, at which point the tug Gleaner was signalled, and she towed the lifeboat back to Caister. In her 9-years of service, Beauchamp would be launched 81 times, and save 146 lives. \nCaister No.1 lifeboat James Leath (ON 607) at Chatham Historic Dockyard\nLaunched on 29 January 1919 to the aid of the barquentine Nimrod, aground on Barber Sands, Coxswain John Haylett of the Covent Garden (ON 431) was injured, and died some weeks later. Only two crew of the Nimrod survived, making it ashore in the ships boat.\nIn 1929, the Caister No.1 lifeboat was withdrawn, and that 'station' was closed. James Leath (ON 607) was transferred to Aldeburgh, serving there until 1936. The boat is now preserved as part of the RNLI Heritage Collection at Chatham Historic Dockyard.\nIt would be 1941 before Caister got their first motor-powered lifeboat, a single-engine Liverpool-class lifeboat.

It corresponds to the site of Khasm al-Minayh in modern Egypt. It was named after its twin protector gods, Castor and Pollux.\nThe fortlet was founded by Lucius Julius Ursus in the ninth year of the Emperor Vespasian, corresponding to AD 76\u201377.  It was built around a well. Construction was overseen by Trebonius Valens, prefect of Berenike. The garrison consisted of a few dozen cavalry and infantry charged with securing the highway. It was commanded by a curator responsible to the prefect of Berenike. In the late first century, Didymoi was garrisoned by Thracian cavalry. In the early third century, there were Palmyrene soldiers, including archers, stationed there. The fortlet remained occupied until the middle of the fourth century.\nArchaeologists have found and published over 400 texts from Didymoi, the majority on ostraca, but also inscribed objects, epigraphy, graffiti and papyri. The texts are mostly in Greek, but also in Latin. Four Palmyrene soldiers left a bilingual inscription in Greek and Palmyrene Aramaic. There is a collection of nine published Latin ostraca from the hand of a certain Thracian soldier named Cutus, which may contain traces of the Thracian language.\nNotes\n^ Lougovaya 2021, p.\u00a0130.\n^ Cuvigny 2021, p.\u00a048.\n^ Stauner 2016, p.\u00a0796.\n^ a b Adams & Ast 2021, p.\u00a0243.\n^ a b Sch\u00f6rle 2024, pp.\u00a0255\u2013256.\n^ a b Dickey 2012.\nBibliography\nAdams, James N.; Ast, Rodney (2021). \"The Latin of the Thracian Soldier Cutus\".

    "\nSacred trees in Sikhism\nMai-Di-Beri tree situated at the historical site of Lal Khoohi in Lahore, Pakistan, where Guru Arjan was tortured.\nThere are a number of sacred trees considered sacred in the Sikh religion. As many as fifty-eight Sikh shrines are associated with particular trees of importance, with up to nineteen tree species being represented amongst these sacred trees. Many of the sacred trees are associated with miraculous sakhis or historical events.\nBackground\nIn India, the ber (Indian jujube) tree and its fruit is widespread and has played a prominent role in Indic culture since ancient times. The tree and its fruit finds mention in Sanskrit literature, such as in religious texts where the tree is sanctified. The name given to the tree varies by the local Indian language. The Sikh gurus themselves favoured the planting of jujube trees at locations of religious significance, such as gurdwaras. At the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar, one can find jujube trees which hold religious importance to Sikhs. Whilst jujube trees tend to live for around 100 years, three prominent ones located within the confines of the Golden Temple complex have lived four-times the expected lifespan of jujube trees.\nProminent sacred trees\nSacred trees of the Golden Temple complex\nDukh Bhanjani Ber\nThe Dukh Bhanjani Ber (meaning \"the tree which removes sorrows\") is a jujube tree (belonging to the Ziziphus jujuba species) located within the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar. Specifically, it is located on the eastern-side of the parikarma. Sikhs believe a leper, who was the husband of Bibi Rajani, was cured after bathing in the small body of water near this tree. Sikhs believe the tree was named \"Dukh Bhanjani\" by Guru Ram Das. The small body of water that once existed near the tree was believed to have existed since ancient times. This body of water was later expanded, becoming the basis for the sarovar of the current temple complex. The tree is commonly used as a prayer site for petitionary prayers, such as ones asking for cures regarding severe, unknown, and untreatable diseases and infertility. Many pilgrims believe that taking a dip in the water near the tree will heal ailments.\nPainting depicting Guru Ram Das and the story of Dukh Bhanjani - the leper husband of Bibi Rajani was cured by taking a dip in the pond.

The Ber Baba Budha Sahib tree is over 440-years-old (dating back to circa 1573). The tree is associated with a prime religious figure of early Sikhism, Baba Budda.\nPhotogravure of the Baba Buddha jujube tree within the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar, ca.1910's\nLachhi Ber\nAnother jujube tree within the Golden Temple complex is known as the Lachhi Ber.\nBhai Sukha and Bhai Mehtab Singh confront Massa Ranghar after tying their horses to the Lachhi Ber tree, circa 19th century\nPhotograph of the Lachhi Ber, Golden Temple, circa 1920-30's\nBer at Sultanpur Lodhi\nA Ziziphus jujuba tree associated with Guru Nanak can be found at Gurdwara Ber Sahib in Sultanpur Lodhi.

At the location of the beri, Guru Gobind Singh, whilst disguised in Islamic garbs, met with Rai Kalha, the chief of Raikot, who then escorted the Guru to Raikot. The building (specifically known as a Manji Sahib) at this site was originally a small, domed room, which was transformed into a larger structure later-on. Three iron girdles have been installed to support the ageing tree as well as stilts by the local gurdwara management committee.\nBabe-Di-Ber at Sialkot\nA Ziziphus jujuba tree can be found at Gurdwara Babe-Di-Ber Sahib in Sialkot, Pakistan. It is believed Guru Nanak had visited Sialkot multiple times during his life. As per lore, Guru Nanak is said to have visited the location of the tree on one of his visits to Sialkot when he was arriving via Saidpur from Talwandi (present-day Nankana Sahib). The tree was located in the south-east of the town of Sialkot at the time and Guru Nanak is believed to have taken rest under it. Later, a gurdwara was constructed at the site. The gurdwara was renovated and restored by the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) of Pakistan in 2014.\nGarna Sahib at Bodal\nA sacred, 350-year-old garna tree is located at Gurdwara Garna Sahib in Vill, Bodal village, Dasuya, in Ho",
    "\nThe background to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war has received widespread coverage following its eruption on 7 October 2023.\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict\nIsraeli and Palestinian deaths preceding the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, of which most were civilians.\nIn 1967, following the Six-Day War fought between Israel and a coalition of Arab states (primarily Egypt, Syria, and Jordan), Israel occupied the Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip which had formerly been occupied by Egypt. A process of Arab-Israeli normalization began in the 1970s, with the fourth and final war between Arab states and Israel ending in 1973 and an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty signed in 1979. In 1987, the First Intifada, a popular uprising by the Palestinians against the Israeli occupation, began. Following the failure of the subsequent peace talks at the Camp David Summits in 2000, violence once again escalated during the Second Intifada, which ended with the Sharm El Sheikh Summit and Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and subsequent blockade. The Israeli closures, together with repeated conflicts, resulted in high levels of poverty, unemployment, and low economic development.\nHamas, an Islamist militant group, won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and a subsequent battle in the Gaza Strip between it and Fatah, which led to Hamas taking over governance of Gaza in 2007, and further escalating tensions with Israel. Israel, along with Egypt, imposed a blockade that significantly damaged Gaza's economy, citing security concerns as the justification. International rights groups have characterized the blockade as a form of collective punishment, while Israel defended it as necessary to prevent weapons and dual-use goods from entering the territory. The Palestinian Authority has not held national elections since 2006.\nSince 2007, Israel has been involved in numerous military confrontations with Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza. There have been four previous major hostilities, including two full-scale wars, between Israel and Hamas: in 2008\u20132009, 2012, 2014, and 2021. Hamas's tactics included tunnel warfare and firing rockets into Israeli territory, whereas Israel generally conducted airstrikes in Gaza. Israel also conducted ground invasions of Gaza in the 2008\u20132009 and 2014 wars. In 2018\u20132019, there were weekly organized protests near the Gaza-Israel border involving thousands of Gazan participants. The protests were met with violence by Israel, with hundreds killed and thousands injured by sniper fire. Surveys in 2023 of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank before the war indicated that a majority supported the use of \"armed struggle\", the creation of \"militant groups\", and an intifada (\"uprising\") against the Israeli occupation. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported roughly 6,400 Palestinians and 300 Israelis were killed in the wider Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict from 2008 through September 2023 before the start of this war.\nDue to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, UNRWA reported that 81% of people were living below the poverty level in 2023, with 63% being food insecure and dependent on international assistance. According to an analysis in The Independent, the Gaza blockade created hopelessness among Palestinians, which was exploited by Hamas, convincing young Palestinian men that violence was their only solution.\nHamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by a number of Western states and regional blocs, including the US, the UK, Japan, Australia and the EU. China and Russia do not regard Hamas as a terrorist organization, and a 2018 motion to condemn Hamas for \"acts of terror\" at the UN failed to pass.\nIn February\u2013March 2021, Fatah and Hamas reached agreement to jointly conduct elections for a new Palestinian legislative assembly, in accordance with the Oslo Accords, and for Hamas to enter the PLO. Hamas committed to upholding international law, transferring control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority and to allowing it to negotiate with Israel to establish a Palestinian state along the 1967 ceasefire lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. According to Menachem Klein, Israeli Arabist and political scientist at Bar-Ilan University, Mahmoud Abbas subsequently cancelled the elections under pressure from Israel and the United States. Soon after the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis exploded, the Al-Qassam Brigades started planning the 7 October 2023 operation.\nHamas motives\nFurther information: Hamas government in the Gaza Strip\nHamas officials stated while announcing the attack that it was a response to the Israeli occupation, blockade of the Gaza Strip, Israeli settler violence against Palestinians, restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians, whom Hamas sought to release by taking Israeli hostages.\nMohammad Deif, the head of Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades (their militant wing), said on 7 October ",
    "\nReid Allan Hamer-Jackson (born October 27, 1958) is a Canadian politician. He has served as mayor of Kamloops, British Columbia since 2022. His tenure as mayor has been marred by controversy regarding his relationship with city council and staff. \nEarly life\nHamer-Jackson was born at the North Vancouver General Hospital in North Vancouver, the son of Maurice \"Hamer\" (n\u00e9 Chasney) and Diana Hamer-Jackson (n\u00e9e King).\nHamer-Jackson first moved to Kamloops in 1973, where he attended Brocklehurst Middle School. His father kicked him out of the home, a move which Hamer-Jackson later claimed did him a favour. He lived on the streets in Edmonton before his family offered a job at a ranch in the Cariboo. He began working as a car salesman in the early 1980s,  and has owned TRU Market Truck and Auto Sales since 1994.\nElection\nIn March 2022, he announced his intentions to run for mayor of Kamloops following the announcement that mayor Ken Christian would not run for re-election. Prior to his announcement, he had been outspoken on the city's vulnerable population, suggesting a wellness centre be built away from the core of the city.\nHamer-Jackson was elected in the 2022 mayoral election, winning 32 per cent of the vote, defeating city councillor Dieter Dudy by 1,648 votes. Hamer-Jackson ran on a platform \"emphasizing safety and accountability\". He was especially concerned with the city's shelter system, suggesting \"hey're not as full as we think\". Prior to his election, he had no political experience. His election was part of a wave of centre-right mayors being elected in the province, which was seen as a response to rising crime and homelessness in the province.\nMayoralty\nIn just his first month of office, Hamer-Jackson was asked by local homeless shelters to stop visiting them unannounced. He had been showing up to them, sometimes in the middle of the night, with people in need of shelter. BC Housing issued a statement saying his visits were \"'disruptive' to staff', suggesting his future visits be pre-arranged.\nIn December 2022, Hamer-Jackson recused himself for an entire ciy council meeting, never returning for the day. He cited \"potential conflicts of interest\". The move was seen as unusual as typically someone with a conflict of interest would only recuse themselves for a particular agenda item. Members of council stated that he had not followed proper protocols.\nIn March 2023, city council voted to pause standing committees after Hamer-Jackson began replacing city councillors on the committees with members of the general public, including two people who unsuccessfully ran for city council. Council called his move \"chaotic and unpredictable..  to confusion and misinformation\". A special committee was later formed with Hamer-Jackson and three councillors to determining the make up of standing committees in the city.\nIn June 2023, Hamer-Jackson filed a defamation lawsuit against city councillor Katie Neustaeter. He alleged that she made comments about him having a political relationship with her father, Kevin Krueger, a former MLA. Hamer-Jackson stated that the comments had led to people in the community speculating that he had committed crimes against her, such as sexual harassment or assault. City council voted that Neustaeter would be eligible to have her legal costs paid by the city, which Hamer-Jackson was disappointed with.\nIn August 2023, following complaints of \"inappropriate conduct\" at city hall, it was deemed that Hamer-Jackson would not be allowed to meet with the city's chief administrator officer or city staffers without the presence of a third party. The investigation was conducted by a Vancouver firm which had been hired by the city of Kamloops. It had deemed that his conduct \"violated the code of conduct numerous times\".\nIn September 2023, Hamer-Jackson had to shelve a motion to provide transport vouchers to the city's homeless population so that the could return to their \"home communities\", a proposal he had campaigned for during the mayoral election. He had hoped the federal government's \"Reaching Home\" grant would help fund the initiative, but the city indicated that funding would not be available.\nAlso in September 2023, city council voted to investigate the mayor for recording a private conversation with the city's chief administrative officer, breaking a rule against recording private conversations with city staff. Hamer-Jackson stated that it was only recorded for \"note-taking purposes\".\nIn October 2023, city council voted unanimously to ask the provincial government to help the city deal with \"lawsuits, investigations and concerns\" relating to Hamer-Jackson's conduct.\nIn December 2023, Hamer-Jackson's burn-out SUV was removed from his property by the city's police chief while Hamer-Jackson was on vacation. The mayor had been repeatedly asked by the chief to remove it as it was seen as a fire hazard, but Hamer-Jackson refused.\nIn March 2024, Hamer-Jackson suspended the city's chief administra",

    " German grammar school in Schleswig-Holstein (founded in 1527)\nSchool in Husum, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany\nThe Hermann Tast School (German:Hermann-Tast-Schule) is a humanistic high school in Husum. It was founded in 1527 and named after the theologian Hermann Tast (1490\u20131551), who was born in Husum. Before 1914, it was called the Husum Grammar School (German:Husumer Gelehrtenschule).\nHistory\nThe school was founded when Husum was still part of Denmark. The initiative for the Husum Grammar School, the predecessor of today's Hermann Tast School, came from the Reformation leader Hermann Tast and his supporter, the rich Husum merchant Matthias Knutzen, in whose private house the lessons were initially held by a teacher. It was not until 1533, when several donations were made by the Danish king Frederick I of Denmark, that there was enough money for a second teacher.\nThe first school building was built on S\u00fcderstrasse in 1586. From the very beginning, this building was designed to be so spacious that students could be taught in it for almost 300 years. This building was demolished in 1876. It was located next to St. Mary's Church on the corner of S\u00fcderstrasse. After the end of the Second Schleswig War in 1867, southern Schleswig, including the city of Husum, became part of the Schleswig-Holstein province of Prussia. The school moved into a new building. A building was later built on S\u00fcderstrasse that was the home of students until 1974. This building, which was subsequently used as a secondary school, is now a five-star luxury hotel (Hotel Altes Gymnasium). During the summer holidays in 1974, the school moved to the current Am Bahndamm building.\nSchool program\nThe Hermann Tast School is an open all-day school. In a new school program launched in 2004, a mission statement was developed which is intended to express the following pedagogical self-image. First and foremost, the educational goal is to strengthen the students' personal development through in-depth general education. The school feels obliged to promote the cultivation of this tradition (including the ancient languages), also with regard to the centuries-old tradition. The school therefore has an ancient language branch with Latin as the first foreign language and the possibility of taking Greek as an elective subject. Another focus, especially in the extracurricular area, is seen in an opening towards the environmental area. This orientation finds its expression, among other things, in a business internship and in various excursions.\n",

After his wife vanishes, leaving him to care for their two young children, he is bereft \u2013 barely able to cook a decent meal or keep the household running. So when a recently arrived Italian colleague suggests that his sister, Maria, act as surrogate homemaker, Leo reluctantly accepts. But can one woman's warm, nurturing presence fill the void left by another, and can Leo yield to the winds of change?\nThe film distils the many upheavals of 1970s Australia \u2013 from immigration and post-war resettlement, to anti\u2013Vietnam War protests and the women's liberation movement \u2013 into a narrative about one man's struggle to adapt and a new immigrant endeavouring to find her place in a foreign land. Little Tornadoes is a portrait of a country at a turning point and the human desire for connection.\nCast\nMark Leonard Winter as Leo\nSilvia Colloca as Maria\nRobert Menzies as Jim\nFabio Motta as Tony\nAnya Beyersdorf as Camille\nMinnie Liszukiewicz as Maudey\nFreddy Liszukiewicz as Jack\nJulie McGregor as Mrs Baker\nEdwina Wren as Betty\nBrian Simpson as Howard\nKhan Chittenden as Younger Jim\nProduction\nThe film was shot over a number of years, with principal photography commencing in late 2009 and additional filming carried out in 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2021. Its story follows on from Canopy (the director's first feature), set 30 years after that film.\nBackground\nWilson has described it as second film in his regional PTSD trilogy. The film, set in 1971 rural Australia, deals with the impact of post-traumatic stress disorder on a family.\nWilson said that he explores themes of masculinity, vulnerability and isolation (physical and emotional) in both Canopy and Little Tornadoes. His paternal grandmother, who lived on the family farm during his childhood, became a strong influence in Wilson's life and his storytelling.\nRelease\nLittle Tornadoes had its world premiere at the 2021 Melbourne International Film Festival (albeit online only due to Melbourne's COVID-19 pandemic lockdown), and went on to screen at Brisbane International Film Festival, CinefestOZ and the Antipodean Film Festival in St Tropez.\nThe film was released in Australian cinemas on 12 May 2022.\nReception\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, the film has a score of 71% based on 7 reviews.\nThe Guardian's Luke Buckmaster gave the film 4-stars, saying \u201cWilson builds an intensely thoughtful space to contemplate mental health among Australian men, particularly those living in rural communities where there are higher rates of anxiety, depression and suicide. Absorbing period drama.\u201d \nThe ABC Screen Show's Larissa Behrendt called the film \u201cOne of my favourites of the year. I love this depiction of a small town swept up in change.\u201d The Today Show's Richard Wilkins calls Little Tornadoes \u201ca fabulous film. A film that pushes a lot of buttons.\u201d\nAnnika Morling writes in Metro Magazine: \u201cIn its portrayal of two women who choose to vanish from a town, Little Tornadoes offers a subtle inversion of the colonial myth of the bush as treacherous labyrinth and the town as sanctuary.\u201d While Screenhub's Stephen A Russell says the \"emotionally complex feature explores the long shadow of war in 1970s Australia.\u201d \nIt received an honourable mention as one of ACMI's Best Films of 2021, and was selected as one of The Guardian\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Australian Films of 2022\u201d.\nAccolades\nBest Direction in a Feature Film < $1M (2022 Australian Directors' Guild Awards)\nSoundtrack\nFilm\nThe film's soundtrack features a mix of Original Score by composer Robert Mackenzie and period Australian and Italian songs. Prominent tracks include Love Song by Olivia Newton-John, A World of Our Own by The Seekers, The Olive Tree by Judith Durham, Vitti 'na Crozza by Amalia Rodrigues,  Santa Lucia by Robertino Loreti, and new track Little Tornadoes by Sal Kimber and Simon Lewis.  \n",
    "Television related events in the USA during 1941\nThis is a\u00a0list of\u00a0American television-related events in 1941.\nEvents\nJanuary - The NBC-owned radio network Blue Network has completed a phase of expansion. While it had 33 stations in 1937, this total had nearly tripled by January 1941, when the network had 92 stations coast to coast.\nMay -  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued formal rules to break up what it perceived to be monopolies in radio. One of these rules specifically barred a network from operating more than one hookup. The rule aimed directly against NBC's ownership of two radio networks.\nJuly 1-\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed full-fledged commercial television broadcasts to begin on July 1, 1941. NBC station W2XBS in New York City received the first commercial license, adopting the call letters WNBT. The first official, paid television advertisement broadcast by any U.S. station was for watch manufacturer Bulova, which aired that day, just before the start of a Brooklyn Dodgers baseball telecast on WNBT. The ad consisted of test pattern, featuring the newly assigned WNBT call letters, which was modified to resemble a clock \u2013 complete with functioning hands \u2013 with the Bulova logo (featuring the phrase \"Bulova Watch Time\") in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern (a photograph of the NBC camera setting up the test pattern-advertisement for that ad can be seen at this page). Among the programs that aired during the first week of WNBT's new, commercial schedule was The Sunoco News, a simulcast of the Sun Oil-sponsored NBC Radio program anchored by Lowell Thomas; amateur boxing at Jamaica Arena; the Eastern Clay Courts tennis championships; programming from the USO; the spelling bee-type game show Words on the Wing; a few feature films; and a one-time-only, test broadcast of the game show Truth or Consequences, sponsored by Lever Brothers.\nFor a one-time experiment, the radio game show Truth or Consequences is televised on the first day of New York station WNBT's commercial program schedule. It was the first game show to air on broadcast television. However, the series did not appear on television again until 1950, when the medium had caught on commercially.\nJuly 2 - Debut of the televised game show CBS Television Quiz on the CBS television station in New York City, WCBW Channel 2 (the forerunner of WCBS-TV). It was the first game show to be broadcast regularly on television.  It was an in-house production and broadcast in black and white. The host was Gil Fates, with Frances Buss as scorekeeper.The CBS Television Quiz followed an answer-and-question format: contestants were given a clue and were asked to provide a question that the clue would answer. Beyond this, little is known about the show's mechanics.\nDecember 31- The antitrust division of the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust action against NBC and CBS, seeking to break up the networks' methods of operation. Mutual, at the same time, filed an antitrust suit of its own, in the amount of $10.275 million, according to the January 12, 1942, edition of Time.\nTelevision programs\nDebuts\nBirths\nMain article: 1941 in television \u00a7\u00a0Births\nDeaths\nMain article: 1941 in television \u00a7\u00a0Deaths\n",

    "Canadian policeman (1945-2016)\nTerrance Levi Hall (13 September  1945 \u2013 1 January 2016) was a Canadian policeman who served as an officer of the Toronto Police Service and the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP). Hall was the commander of the OPP's Special Squad, which targeted outlaw biker gangs, and was the lead investigator in the Port Hope 8 case, in which six members of Satan's Choice Motorcycle Club were controversially convicted of murder.\nEarly police career\nHall was born in Tillsonburg, the son of Frank and Ethel Hall. He joined the Toronto Police Service in 1962 at the age of 17. In 1967, he transferred over to the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP). As a policeman, he stood out because he was 6'5 tall. Paul Bailey, a policeman with the York Regional Police, said of him: \"He was a consummate professional and a great friend to many police officers\". Baily stated that he had a great hatred for outlaw bikers and when the police raided the clubhouses of biker gangs: \"He would be the first one in the door and the last one to leave. I raided a number of them with him.\"\nThe Special Squad\nIn 1973, Hall was appointed commander of the Special Squad of the OPP dedicated to pursuing outlaw bikers. Hall was informed by his superiors that he need not observe \"legal niceties\" in his line of work. Hall's appearance with his long hair, long beard and casual way of dressing in T-shirts and jeans made him appear more like an outlaw biker than a policeman. Hall waged a campaign that he called \"reverse intimidation\" as he used the violent methods that the  bikers used against them. The American journalist Mick Lowe wrote: \"Since 1973, Hall had inhabited a strange nether region on the fringes of Canadian law enforcement\", making him into a \"black legend among Canadian bikers\" who feared him as a policeman who did not follow the law. Hall was notorious for his threat: \"Just remember one thing, punk\u2014my gang's bigger than your gang!\" In 1975, Hall, while working undercover with the Queensmen biker gang in Windsor, went riding with the Windsor chapter of Satan's Choice, during he was injured in a minor traffic incident. One of the bikers thought they saw a police ID badge fell out of his wallet. The sergeant-at-arms raided Hall's apartment and found detailed notes on all of the other members of the Queensmen along police phone numbers, which revealed that Hall was an undercover policeman. The Queensmen were aligned with Satan's Choice, and it was Hall's intention to join the Queensmen as a stepping stone to joining Satan's Choice. Bernie \"The Frog\" Guindon, the president of Satan's Choice, said of Hall: \"He was pretty smart. I'm positive there was other  guys in all the clubs\". The most important informer working for Hall was Garnet \"Mother\" McEwen, the president of the Satan's Choice St. Catharines chapter.\nHall was the prime source for journalists about outlaw bikers in Ontario, and he was the main source for a source in the Kitchener-Waterloo Record by John Kessel and John Schenk on 10 March 1977 that began with the by-line: \"Waterloo Region, the home of Mennonites, Oktoberfest and the farmer's markets a breeding ground for organized crime? Impossible! Terry Hall, an OPP intelligence officer who rode undercover with many of Ontario's motorcycle gangs for two years, say it's so\". Hall accused the Kitchener chapter of Satan's Choice of \"the manufacture and sale of illegal drugs, prostitution, gambling, murder and other violence for pay, counterfeit money and bogus-check rings, and the fencing of valuable stolen goods\". The story in the Kitchener-Waterloo Record was part of a media offensive waged by the Special Squad intended to secure a larger budget as Hall served as the primary source for a number of articles that appeared in newspapers in Ontario in 1977 and 1978 that painted a lucid picture of the outlaw biker gangs. Hall obtained even more success with a story in Maclean's magazine in July 1977 by Kessell and Schenk entitled \"Born to Raise Hell Inc\", which he again served as the main source for, which started with the by-line: \"The outlaw motorcycle gangs are North America's newest and most overlooked form of organized crime\". Hall called the Maclean's story \"our first big break\", which led to the Ontario government drastically increasing the budget for the Special Squad. In the late 1970s, Hall would attend Satan's Choice events wearing a T-shirt with the patch of the Outlaws along with the slogan \"Support Your Local Outlaws\", and at Outlaw events he would wear a T-shirt with the patch of Satan's Choice and the slogan \"Support Your Local Satan's Choice\", which was considered provocative.\nOn the night of 18 October 1978, Hall led a police raid on the clubhouse of the Kitchener chapter of Satan's Choice on Weber Street, of which he knocked down the door and damaged the lock. During the raid, words were exchanged with the treasurer of the Kitchener chapter, David Hoffman, whom Hall was to charge with conspiracy to commit mur",
    "\nThe Holocaust in the Byaroza District was the systematic persecution and extermination of Jews in the Byaroza District of the Brest Region by Nazi Germany and its collaborators from 1941 to 1944 during World War II. This atrocity was part of the broader \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\", which aimed at the complete annihilation of European Jewry and formed an integral part of the Holocaust in Belarus.\nGenocide of Jews in the District\nThe Byaroza District was fully occupied by German troops in June 1941. The Nazis incorporated the district into the Reichskommissariat Ukraine, under the General District of Volhynia-Podolia. The district was governed by the Nazi military occupation administration, which operated through field and local commandant's offices established by the Wehrmacht. Local Belarusian collaborators were appointed to district (volost) administrations and police garrisons in all major villages.\nTo implement their genocidal policies and conduct punitive operations, the Nazis deployed SS punitive units, Einsatzgruppen, Sonderkommandos, the Secret Field Police (GFP), the Security Police and SD, the gendarmerie, and the Gestapo to the district immediately following the occupation. Concurrently, the Nazis and their collaborators began the total extermination of the Jewish population. Euphemistically referred to as \"actions,\" these mass murders were repeated multiple times in various locations. Jews who were not killed immediately were confined to ghettos until they were eventually exterminated.\nJews were subjected to brutal forced labor under inhumane conditions, leading to numerous deaths from overwork, starvation, and lack of medical care. During the occupation, nearly all Jews in the Byaroza District were killed. The Germans and police relentlessly hunted down every Jew, regardless of the effort and time required. For instance, in 1942, a Jewish teenage girl was discovered in the village of Lisichitsy (Belozersky Village Council). A group of policemen led by Yuzefovich I. N., who later became the deputy commandant of the Peskovskaya volost police, was sent to capture her. She was apprehended, taken to Peski, and subsequently sent to the ghetto in Bereza. Near the village of Peshki, local policemen tracked down and eventually killed a Jewish family of eight who had escaped from the Drogichin ghetto. Their remains were discovered and reburied in 2012 at the Jewish cemetery in the village of Motykaly.\nBronnaya Gora monument \nThe most significant massacres of Jews in the district occurred at:\nBronna G\u00f3ra: By November 1942, over 50,000 people, the vast majority of whom were Jews, were killed at Bronaya Gora.\nByaroza ghetto: Over 8,000 Jews were killed.\nNear the village of Smolyarka (Sokolovsky Village Council): More than 3,000 Jews were killed.\nAnti-Jewish Regulations\nThe following is an excerpt from Administrative Order No. 1 issued by General von Schenckendorff, commander of the rear of Army Group Center, on July 7, 1941. This order mandated specific identification marks for Jews and imposed severe restrictions on their interactions and movements:\nFrom Administrative Order No. 1 by General von Schenckendorff, Commander of the Rear of Army Group Center, dated July 7, 1941:\n III. Identification Marks for Jews\n All Jews and Jewesses residing in the occupied Russian territory who are 10 years old and above are immediately required to wear a white band, 10 cm wide, with a painted Zionist star, or a yellow band, 10 cm wide, on the right sleeve of their outer garment or dress. Jews and Jewesses must provide these armbands themselves. It is strictly forbidden to greet Jews. Violators will be severely punished by the local commandant at their place of residence.\nGhetto\nGhetto Byaroza \nThe occupation authorities imposed strict regulations on Jews, forbidding them, under threat of death, from removing yellow patches or six-pointed stars from their outer clothing, leaving the ghetto without special permission, changing their place of residence within the ghetto, walking on sidewalks, using public transport, entering parks and public places, and attending schools. The Germans, following Hitler's program of extermination, established three ghettos in the district:\nIn the two ghettos in the town of Bereza (July 1941 - October 15, 1942), more than 8,000 Jews were killed either on the spot or taken and killed elsewhere.\nIn the ghetto in the village of Malech (summer 1941 - October 1941), 750 Jews were held before being transferred and killed in the Bereza ghetto.\nRighteous Among the Nations\nIn the Byaroza District, three individuals were honored with the title \"Righteous Among the Nations\" by the Israeli memorial institute Yad Vashem for their assistance to Jews during World War II: Pyotr, Maria, and Yevgeny Senkevich, who saved Adam Epelbaum in the village of Yasevichi.\nMemory\nSeveral monuments and memorials have been erected to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust in the Byaroza District:\nA monument at ",
    "Landau\u2013Peierls instability refers to the phenomenon in which the mean square displacements due to thermal fluctuatuions diverge in the thermodynamic limit and is named after Lev Landau (1937) and Rudolf Peierls (1934). This instability prevails in one-dimensional ordering of atoms/molecules in 3D space such as 1D crystals and smectics and also in two-dimensional ordering in 2D space such as a monomolecular adsorbed filsms at the interface between two isotrophic phaes. The divergence is logarthmic, which is rather slow and therefore it is possible to realize substances in practice that are subject to Landau\u2013Peierls instability.\nMathematical description\nConsider a one-dimensionally ordered crystal in 3D space. The density function is then given by . Since this is a 1D system, only the displacement  along the -direction due to thermal fluctuations can smooth out the density function; dispalcement in the other two directions are irrelevant. The net change in the free energy due to the fluectuations is given by\nwhere  is the free energy without flcutuations. Note that  cannot depend on  or be a linear function of  because the first case corresponds to a simple uniform translation and the second case is unstable. Thus,  must be quadratic in the derivatives of . These are given by\nwhere ,  and  are material constants; in smectics, where the symmetry  must be obeyed, the second term has to be set zero, i.e., . In the Fourier space (in a unit volume), this is just\nFrom the equipartition theorem, we can deduce that\nThe mean square displacement is thus given by\nwhere the integral is cut off at a large wavenumber that is comparable to the linear dimension of the element undergoing deformation. In the thermodynamic limit, , the integral diverges logarthmically. This means that the an element at a particular point is displaced through very large distances and therefore smoothes out the function , leaving constant  as the only solution and destroying the 1D ordering.\nSee also\nPeierls transition\n",

His descendants include the playwright Henrik Ibsen.\nBiography\nCornelius Povelsson Paus belonged to the Paus family and was the son of the parish priest of Hjartdal and signatory of the 1661 Sovereignty Act, Povel Pedersson Paus, and Ingrid Corneliusdatter Trinepol from Skien. He was born shortly after midsummer in 1662 and was baptized on 17 August of the same year by his father's colleague, provost Sakarias Jonsson Skancke. He was named after his maternal grandfather, the timber merchant in Skien, Cornelius Jansen Trinepol, and was the brother of the priest Hans Povelsson Paus. He married Valborg J\u00f8rgensdatter Rafn (1673\u20131726), daughter of the district judge of Upper Telemark, J\u00f8rgen Hansen Rafn, and Margrethe Fredriksdatter Blom.\nHe received his initial education from his father, who was considered a very learned and thoughtful personality. He later attended Oslo Cathedral School and then studied at the University of Copenhagen. He began as an assistant judge for his father-in-law and was appointed by King Christian V as his father-in-law's successor as governor and district judge on 21 August 1696, upon recommendation from his father-in-law and Bratsberg governor Henrik Nilsen Adeler. He held the office until his death in February 1723. In 1714 he and his governor colleague in Lower Telemark Marcus Hanssen had Eastern Upper Telemark district shared between them, thus enlarging his jurisdiction significantly. He was the second in line in \"one of the most prominent district judge dynasties\" in Norway and was succeeded in office by his nephew Peder Hansson Paus.\nCornelius Paus bore a coat of arms featuring a wild man with a club; a drawing of the coat of arms by Hans Krag is published in the book Norsk heraldisk m\u00f8nstring 1699\u20131730.\nCornelius Paus was the father of the judge Paul Paus (1697\u20131768).

    "Municipal building in Bosham, West Sussex, England\nThe Old Town Hall is a historic building on Shore Road in Bosham, a town in West Sussex, in England. The structure, which has been converted into a private house, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe current structure consists of several properties overlooking Chichester Harbour, including a couple of workman's cottages and an early town hall, which individually date back to 1694. The properties were built in rubble masonry with red brick dressings. The old town hall was used as a local meeting place, possibly by the feudal representatives of the lords of the manor, who, in the 18th century, were the Earls of Berkeley. The properties were later amalgamated to form an integrated structure. To the left of the old town hall, there was a raised walkway, known as the \"Trippit\", which was built of stones from all over Europe and which had arrived in Bosham as ship's ballast.\nBy the early 19th century, the building was being used as a private house. A pumping station, in the form of a rotunda, designed in the William and Mary style, was erected in the garden in the early 1930s. The house then remained in the hands of the Mackenzie family, from 1934 until well into the 21st century. It was marketed for sale for \u00a34.5 million in April 2021.\nArchitecture\nThe design of the house involves an asymmetrical main frontage of six bays facing onto Shore Road. It has two storeys and an attic. It features a doorway designed in the neoclassical style and formed by a pair of brick pilasters supporting a segmental pediment. The other bays on the ground floor and all the bays on the first floor are fenestrated by casement windows. There are three dormer windows at attic level and there is a tiled roof. Internally, it contains five bedrooms, three reception rooms and five bathrooms, plus a home office with sail loft. There are exposed wooden beams throughout. The house also has boat moorings. The building, which has been heavily restored, was grade II listed in 1986, at which time it was known as Chandler's House.\n",

    "Military unit\nThe 14th Air Squadron (Indonesian: Skadron Udara 14) is a Fighter Squadron of the Indonesian Air Force (TNI-AU) under the command of the 3rd Air Wing, headquartered in Iswahjudi Air Force Base, Maospati, Magetan Regency, East Java.\nThe 14th Air Squadron once operated MiG-21F-13 Fishbed (1962 - 1970), F-86 Avon Saber (1974 - 1980) and F-5E/F Tiger II (1980 - 2017), Sukhoi Su-27/Su-30 Flanker aircraft in (February 2020 - September 2022).\nOn 13 October 2022, the 14th Air Squadron has been equipped with F-16C/D Fighting Falcon, and has been the squadron's fighter aircraft since.\nHistory\nGeneral\nIndonesian MiG-21\nThe history of this Air Squadron cannot be separated from Iswahjudi Air Force Base which was built during the Dutch East Indies era around 1940 under the name Maospati Air Force Base (PAU Maospati). This airfield was built with dimensions of 1,586 X 53 meters. When the Pacific War broke out, this base was used as a base for Allied forces on the island of Java. When the Allies surrendered to the Japanese army in 1942, this base was controlled by the Japanese Navy (Kaigun Kokusho). After independence, this base was controlled by Indonesian troops. Since 4 November 1960, and based on the Decree of the Minister/Commander of the Air Force Number 564, this air base has changed to the Iswahjudi Air Force Base (Indonesian: Pangkalan TNI Angkatan Udara (Lanud) Iswahjudi).\nIn 1950 - 1960, Maospati Air Force Base did not experience many changes. This airfield had the same condition when it was abandoned by Japan in 1945. Flight operations were only carried out by other aircraft that stopped there. The condition of the runway was also bad and not maintained. The size of the runway is still the same as when it was first built by the Dutch. Starting in September 1957, the Air Force carried out a program to build a new runway related to preparations for Operation Trikora. Where the AURI will place Tu-16, Tu-16KS and MiG-21 aircraft at this base. The construction was carried out by John Building Company (JBC), a national company based in Jakarta. The work experienced many obstacles so that the construction process was frozen by the AURI. Furthermore, the work was carried out by the Air Force in collaboration with local contractors in Madiun and was completed in 1960.\nThe construction that was successfully carried out was the extension of the runway to 2,350 X 60 meters, where both ends of the runway were made of concrete with dimensions of 60 X 60 meters. Other developments include a taxiway measuring 3,300 X 23 meters and the construction of a platform measuring 200 X 100 meters. In this development, a 12\u00a0km long water channel was also built.\nThe event related to the formation of this squadron was Operation Trikora. In this operation, Indonesia attempted to reclaim West Irian from the hands of the Dutch colonialists. This was based on the fact that West Irian was a Dutch colony and since Indonesian independence was proclaimed, all Dutch colonies had to be handed over to Indonesia, including West Irian. However, the Dutch ignored this, instead declaring the area part of Dutch territory. This made Indonesian President Soekarno launch Operation Trikora to seize West Irian after various diplomatic efforts through the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement failed.\nMeanwhile, in mid-1958, Indonesia brought in 30 MiG-15UTI jet aircraft which arrived at Kemayoran Air Force Base (PAU Kemayoran). These planes arrived in Indonesia on 14 August 1958 and entered the 11th Air Squadron. Indonesia also brought in 22 Ilyushin Il-28 bombers which arrived on 4 October 1958 from Russia, and were assigned to the 21st Air Squadron, and 22nd Air Squadron PAU Kemayoran. Apart from that, in early 1949, 49 MiG-17 aircraft arrived from Czechoslovakia and were assigned to Air Squadron 11. When the confrontation peaked in the early 1960s, the government brought in 10 MiG-19 aircraft to be assigned to Air Squadron 12 at PAU Kemayoran. Apart from that, Indonesia also purchased 20 MiG-21 aircraft in 1962 and placed them in Air Squadron 14. This was done to increase the Air Force's air power so that it could deter opponents.\nBirth of the 14th Air Squadron\nIndonesian CA-27 CAC Sabre\nBased on the Decree of the Minister/Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Number: Skep/135/VII/1962 dated 1 July 1962 concerning the formation of the 14th Air Squadron with the main headquarters at PAU Iswahjudi, Maospati, Magetan, East Java. This squadron initially had 20 MiG-21F aircraft made by Eastern Bloc countries, with its first commander, Air Major Roesman. In fact, Roesman had previously served as Commander of the 11th Air Squadron, but he was trusted to lead the 14th Air Squadron. The inauguration of this Squadron was carried out on 8 August 1962 at PAU Kemayoran. With the establishment of this squadron with MiG-21F, Indonesia was the first country outside the Warsaw Pact to operate it. The decree dated 1 July 1962 was finally commemorated as the an",

    "Rachel Reeves' tenure at HM Treasury (2024-present)\nRachel Reeves became Chancellor of the Exchequer on 5 July 2024, upon her appointment by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, following Labour's victory in the 2024 general election. She  succeeded Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt, and became the first woman to hold the office of Chancellor in its 708-year history.\nIn this role she has adhered to \"modern supply-side economics\", an economic policy that focuses on infrastructure, education and labour supply by rejecting tax cuts and deregulation. It is heavily inspired by Joe Biden's economic policy, particularly his Inflation Reduction Act. She coined the term securonomics in 2023 to refer to her version of this economic policy.\nBackground\nMain article: 2024 United Kingdom general election\nRachel Reeves was appointed Shadow Chancellor in May 2021, following a shadow cabinet reshuffle. Over her three years in office, Reeves proposed to scrap tuition fees, no re-introduction in a cap on bankers' bonuses, and a plan to nationalise the railways.\nSecuronomics\nSince 2022, Reeves has adhered to \"modern supply-side economics\", an economic policy which focuses on infrastructure, education and labour supply by rejecting tax cuts and deregulation. In May 2023, Reeves coined the term \"securonomics\" to refer to her version of this economic policy, originally in a public address at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It is heavily inspired by US president Joe Biden's economic policy, particularly his Inflation Reduction Act. Securonomics is based on the belief that globalisation has failed to achieve its stated aims and that economies in the Western world must adapt in response. It would involve a productivist \"active state\" taking a more active role in managing the free-market economy, boosting production and drawing up industrial policy, stronger supply chains, and more economic cooperation with international allies with similar economic goals. Reeves believes that the active state is part of an \"emerging global consensus\" led by Biden's administration which will replace the neoliberal economic consensus, and that economic policy must be driven by the need for security.\nIn an interview with the Financial Times in May 2023, Reeves said securonomics had to be based on \"the rock of fiscal responsibility\". She said her proposed \u00a328 billion climate investment plan, Labour's version of the Inflation Reduction Act, had to \"fit within her fiscal rules\". In June 2023, the investment plan was revised to a gradual roll-out where the annual investment would rise gradually to \u00a328\u00a0billion by around 2027. She argued that following the economic impact of the 2021\u20132023 global energy crisis, food price crisis and the Truss government's \"mini-budget\", the plan \"will only be possible if we have an iron grip on public spending and tax receipts\". The New Statesman reported that in an interview Reeves said \"a Labour government would not introduce annual wealth and land taxes; raise income tax; equalise capital gains rates and income tax; rejoin the European single market and customs union; change the Bank of England's inflation target and reform its rigid mandate; or take private utilities into public ownership, except for the railways\".\nTenure\nReeves appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer by Keir Starmer, 5 July 2024\nReeves delivers her first speech, July 2024\nReeves was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on 5 July. She became the first woman to hold the office of Chancellor in its 708-year history. On taking office Reeves has said that since there is \"not a huge amount of money\" the focus will be on unlocking private-sector investment, as she believes \"private-sector investment is the lifeblood of a successful economy.\" She made her first statement as Chancellor two days later, announcing measures to grow the economy. Reeves also announced her first budget would be released later in the year in the autumn.\nIt is such an honour to be here today as the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I know that responsibility that brings to guide our economy through uncertain times, to restore stability in an age of insecurity, to build prosperity that draws on the talents of working people.  To every young woman and girl.... to every young woman and girl watching this: let today show that there should be no ceilings on your ambitions, your hopes or your dreams.\u2014\u200aRachel Reeves' statement to HM Treasury, July 2024\nReeves with Rayner, visits a housing development site in Oval, London.

She also studied pansori and won the grand prize at the Honam Arts Festival.\nJang's interest in acting was sparked when she attended a church retreat and witnessed college students' impressive theater performance. This encounter inspired her to join a theater club while studying Korean literature at Korea University. She studied in England (1997\u20131998) and spent her part-time money watching musical performances like The Phantom of the Opera and Cats. The following year, she visited India and was inspired by Bollywood movies with their vibrant dancing and singing. This sparked the idea of combining the solemnity of British works with the popular and comical aspects of Indian works to create a unique performance. At the time, she didn't realize she could write it herself.\nWhen Jang returned to South Korea, she saw a program promoting theater and felt drawn to pursue that path. In 2000, she re-enrolled at the Korea National University of Arts to study directing in the theater department. As a student, Jang was a cinephile and had the opportunity to take classes in the film department, located across the hall. She even had the chance to learn from director Byun Young-joo. She also took a class on writing musicals taught by American professor Calvin McClinton, which allowed her to express herself freely and eventually win a competition.\nCareer\nSongsan Night Flowers and Kiss Me Tiger\nDuring her studies in the Directing Department at the Korea National University of Arts, Jang started writing play. Her debut work as a director was \"There, Silently\", a workshop piece at Yeonwoo Stage. In 2001, Jang began writing \"The Tiger Maiden is Having an Affair,\" which is based on \"The Tale of Kim Hyeon-gam-ho\" from the 5th volume of Samguk yusa. The tale is about the unrequited love story of a woman who lives as a tiger by day and a human by night and an innocent young man, Kim Hyeon. The story, which is structured like a frame that goes back and forth between the past and the present, is filled with Korean humor.\nThe performance was presented in 2002 under the title \"Songnyeon Yahwa\" by the theater company Dure. The composition was overseen by musician Kim Hye-seong. The musical was performed at the Munhwa Ilbo Hall from July 4 to 25, 2002. The musical was directed by Son Nam-mok and starred Eom Ki-jun, Chu Jeong-hwa, Kwon Geun-yong, Shin Mun-seong, Jang Geum-jun, Lim Ki-hong, and others. It was performed again the following year at the Daehangno Arunguji Small Theater from April 9 to May 11, 2003. The cast includes Song Chang-ui, Han Ae-ri, Kim Hyeon-tae, Lee Ji-won, Kim Na-young, Lee Gil-woo, and Kim Jin-tae.\nAfter graduating from the Korea National University of Arts in 2004, she began working in theater and film. While working as an assistant director, she earned less than 5 million won a year. In order to support herself, she also wrote movie scripts. Meanwhile, she also wrote a musical script called Finding Kim Jong-wook. She worked tirelessly, often sacrificing sleep. After a year and a half, she returned to the stage.\nIn 2005, Kang directed Musical \"Love Quilt,\" which was performed at the Seoul Education and Culture Center Grand Theater from December 16 to 20. It was created to teach children the value of family. The story follows children and young magicians who want to change their parents, but learn to appreciate and cherish them during their adventures. The cast included Bae Moon-joo, Kim Sam-seok, Kang Mi-ri and others. The cast included Bae Moon-joo, Kim Sam-seok, Kang Mi-ri, and others.\nIn 2006, \"The Tiger Maiden is Having an Affair,\" was performed under the title \"Kiss Me Tiger\" at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts Small Theater from July 18 to July 6. Also in 2006, Jang acted as director for musical Lee produced by Seoul Arts",

    "2023 EP by Garbage\nWitness to Your Love is an EP released by alternative rock band Garbage for Record Store Day 2023, on April 22.\nIt contains \"Witness to Your Love\", a track that was first released on the fifth volume of the Urban Outfitters and Filter Magazine charity compilation Give Listen Help in 2008, during the band's seven-year hiatus from releasing studio albums, and then released as a single to promote Anthology the previous year; a cover of \"Cities in Dust\" by Siouxsie and the Banshees; and two previously unreleased tracks from the No Gods No Masters sessions.\nBackground and recording\nThe origin of title-track \"Witness to Your Love\" dates back to 2008, when singer Shirley Manson was approached by friend Jeff Castelaz, founder of the Pablove Foundation, to include a Garbage track on the fifth volume of the Give Listen Help charity compilation benefitting the Children's Hospital Los Angeles helping to fight cancer in children. Manson wrote the lyrics of \"Witness to Your Love\" to unfinished tracks from the Absolute Garbage sessions and finished the track with drummer Butch Vig in his GrungeIsDead home studio in Silver Lake, with guitarists Duke Erikson and Steve Marker sending guitar parts through online collaboration. Additional drums were played by Matt Walker.\nIn 2011, a previously unreleased acoustic version of the track was uploaded by Garbage on the media player of their Facebook page. The player has since been taken down. The acoustic version has been eventually released in 2024 on the deluxe edition of the band's fourth album Bleed Like Me reissue. \nWhilst \"Cities in Dust\" was a newly recorded track, \"Blue Betty\" and \"Adam and Eve\" are two outtakes from the band's seventh studio album No Gods No Masters' sessions.\nComposition\n\"Witness to Your Love\" has been described as a personal track dealing with the sudden death of David Williamson, the husband of Morag Williamson, one of Manson's closest friends in Scotland. Manson was inspired to write the lyrics to the song after Williamson's funeral and some of the lyrics directly reference the poem read at the memorial. The song's lyrics also mention the Edinburgh district of Canongate and Manson's episodes of shoplifting in her youth. In 2022, Manson further explained that the song was written as an attempt to comfort Williamson about the loss of her husband saying \"I saw him. I know he existed. And he was somewhere else, but he was there. And I'm your girl, and I've got your back. And your history is my history, and our history together is something that will move forward throughout our lives. It's a joyous song in a funny way although it's based in Debby Downerisms.\" Vig called the song \"a pretty obscure track of ours, but one of the most beautiful songs Shirl sung.\"\nOn November 21, 2009, Manson performed a live acoustic performance of the song at the Pablo Castelaz memorial at Avalon, in Hollywood, with Vig on guitar. At the event, Manson explained the song is about \"acknowledging someone's life, and in doing so, acknowledging our own and how lucky we are to be alive.\" The performance brought Vig and Manson close and prompted them to contact the other band members to start making music again.\n\"Cities in Dust\" stays largely faithful to the original, albeit being more electronic and featuring more abrasive guitars. The song closes with an ad lib by Manson whispering \"I love you, Siouxsie\".\n\"Blue Betty\" deals with the death of Manson's aunt Betty, who jumped off the Forth Road Bridge outside Edinburgh, Scotland, whereas \"Adam and Eve\" makes a reference to the pen knife Manson tied to her boot and used to self-harm during her teenage years in its lyrics.\nRelease and promotion\n\"Witness to Your Love\" has been released on the band's greatest hits compilation Anthology on October 28, 2022, and as a standalone digital single on the same day. It received a music video by Scottish filmmaker and long-time Garbage fan Bryan M. Ferguson. The music video was filmed in Glasgow over three days. It stars actors Maungo Pelekekae, Alasdair Scott and Sally Pritchett as three vampires, and Ferguson's wife, Vari, as a shop assistant. Ferguson wanted to \"tell a story of eternal youth, dynamism and a feeling of invincibility\", so he decided to turn the protagonists into \"reckless bloodsuckers\": the three vampires steal blood units from a hospital, go to a skatepark (The Arches DIY), shoplift Garbage CDs in a music store (Missing Records), steal a car, drink blood from a man and go dance in a nightclub before going back to sleep in coffins built from refrigerators. Throughout the video, many easter eggs referencing Garbage are featured: at the beginning, scenes from the \"Push It\" music video can be seen on a TV; the vampires sleep in a refrigerator with a Garbage sticker on it; at the skate park, one of the vampires has a radio with Garbage stickers; four Garbage albums can be seen in the music shop: Anthology, Garbage, Version 2.0 and Beautiful Garbage; Pelekekae wears ",

    "Church in Croatia\nNational Shrine of Saint Joseph (Croatian: Nacionalno sveti\u0161te svetog Josipa) is a Croatian Catholic national shrine dedicated to Saint Joseph located in the city of Karlovac, in Parish of Our Lady of the Snows.\nHistory\nParish\nEarliest written mention of the parish is found in the records of the Diocese of Zagreb in 1334. Parish was founded around Dubovac Castle, named after Croatian word for oak (\"dub\"), as it was surrounded by and oak forest. Originally, parish was dedicated to Saint Michael, to whom chapel near the castle was dedicated. By the end of the 17th century, new chapel was erected at the hill near the Dubovac Old City, which was proclaimed parish church in 1741 and consercrated to Our Lady of Snows. Nowadays, parish has around 5,000 parishioners. Besides parish church and the shrine, there are also calvary dedicated to Saint Anne and Greek Catholic chapel of the Wounded Jesus.\nThe initiator of the construction of the church and sanctuary was Msgr. Marijan Radanovi\u0107 (hr), who was parson in Dubovac from 1955 to 1998.\nSanctuary\nFollowing proclamation of St. Joseph as a patron saint of Kingdom of Croatia by Croatian Sabor on 9 and 10 June 1687, Croatian bishops at their assembly in Split in 1972 confirmed \"that the decision of the Croatian Sabor from 1687 is still in force, because the Sabor did not have in mind the abstract Croatian kingdom, but the Croatian people, who survive all vicissitudes surrounding their sovereignty...\".\nChurch construction started in 14 July 1968, with cornerstone blessed by then auxilliary bishop of Zagreb Franjo Kuhari\u0107; church was consecrated by archbishop Franjo \u0160eper on 15 September 1974. The main designer of the building was Josipa \u0160ponar Muth. At Christmas in 1974, sculpture of St. Joseph was consecrated in the church. In 1975, bell tower was finished and sculpture of St. Mary was consercrated. Way of cross was finished and placed in 1979. In 1980, three church bells were purchased and dedicated to St. Joseph (980 kg), Mother of God (520 kg) and St. Francis of Assisi (297 kg), all of which were consecrated and blessed by archbishop mons. Franjo Kuhari\u0107. In 1983, the organ was installed and blessed by auxiliary bishop of Zagreb Mijo \u0160kvorc. Stained glass elements were made by Croatian painter Josip Botteri Dini.\nTogether with Zagreb Cathedral, Croatian National Shrine of Saint Mary of Marija Bistrica and Church of the Most Holy Trinity in Kra\u0161i\u0107, during 2016 Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy it was among the four churches with Doors of Mercy in the Archdiocese of Zagreb.\nAfter a one year preparation, on 1 September 2021 Josip Botteri Dini started placing his altar mosaic with a scene of the Nativity of Jesus. At the time of its installation, it was the largest church mosaic in Croatia. The mosaic was blessed by auxilliary bishop of Zagreb Mijo Gorski on 8 December 2021. Mosaic consists of 168 surfaces with the total area of 120 m2 and 2,500 pieces of industrial and Murano glass.\nPublishing\nSanctuary publishes quarterly magazine Glasnik svetog Josipa (hr, \"The Messenger of the St. Joseph\"), founded by Josip Stadler in 1873.\nPilgrims and devotions\nShrine feast days are 19 March (feast day of St. Joseph), which is preceded by nine Wednesdays of preparation (Great novena to St. Joseph), 1 May (St. Joseph the Worker) and 15 September (consercration day, \"Posvetilo crkve\"). Every Wednesday devotions to St. Joseph are held.\nAs part of the sanctuary, the devotion \"Wreath of the Immaculate Heart of Joseph\" (Vijenac Pre\u010distog Srca Josipova) was created, which consists of prayer wreaths consisting of 31 supplicants, leader and priest. Each member is responsible for having his own prayer day on a certain day of the month for specific purposes, which consists of the Rosary, attendance at Holy Mass, Holy Communion, confession, and if possible, fasting. The Brotherhood of St. Joseph for aid to the dying (Bratov\u0161tina svetog Josipa za pomo\u0107 umiru\u0107ima) also operates within the sanctuary, with hundreds of supporting members throughout Croatia and in the Croatian diaspora.\nBetween 2015 and 2019 sanctuary was visited by around 210,000 pilgrims. In 2023, there were 80,000 pilgrims.\n",
    "One of the most important Celtiberian inscriptions discovered in recent years (early 21st century), the Novallas bronze tablet dates to the late first century BCE and is the longest Celtiberian text in Latin orthography we have. Though fragmentary, the text seems to discuss agreements between different cities in the region for how wide spaces between buildings and fields should be, presumably for purposes of right of way.\nThe fragmentary tablet measures 18.1 centimeter high at its longest, 22.5\u00a0cm. at its widest, and .2\u00a0cm thick.\nA small square hole at what seems to be the top would suggest that the plaque was nailed to a wall or some other structure, as was common with official notices.

But various place names and phrases can be recognized, with varying degrees of certainty.\nCeltiberian words and phrases\nIn line 2, the form DOIBIM is explained by Stifter as a dative dual *dou\u032fibim \u2018to the two.\u2019\nOn DVNDOM LITANOM and VAMV\u015a LITANA\u1e42 on lines 3 and 4, see below.\nIn line 5, for AVDITUM Jord\u00e1n C\u00f3lera suggests an origin from the Proto-Indo-European root *h2ew-dheh1- / *h2ew-dhh1-o \"grant, bestow, donate,\" specifically from the genitive plural of the present active participle of this verb: *h2ew-dheh1-nt-\u014dm \"of the donating ones.\"\nLine 6.

It looks to be adjective formed by the common suffix -\u0101ko-, \"from a substantive contrebia, the etymology of which seems clear: kom- (\u201ctogether\u201d) + *treb- (\u201cto live, habitation\u201d) + *-y\u0101 collective suffix.\" So something like 'where  live together.' \"We know three Celtiberian cities called Contrebia: Contrebia Belaisca,28 Contrebia Carbica,29 and Contrebia Leucada.\" The last of these was quite near Novalla, but the term could well have been an adjective attached to many settlement, not necessarily any of these mentioned.\nLatin, or Latin influenced, words and phrases\nLine 1: (-?)L]OQUENDI, presumably from the gerundive of Latin loquor \"to speak\" or a compound thereof. So probably \"(These things) are to be announced (publicly) (at such and such time(s) and place(s),\" the rest of the legible text presumably being the 'these things' to be announced, especially given that monetary units or spacial measurements seem to be mentioned in lines 3 and 4 (see below). This would mean that any indication of when and where the announcement is to be made came in the lost part of the text before what we have legible to us.\nLines 2, 3, 5, and 10: PUBL(ICUS), in lines two and five, apparently part of a full phrase ODUS PUBL(ICUS). The latter would seem to reflect the Latin phrase pedes publicos, 'feet of the people(?)' (with loss of p- as expected in Celtic, a loss not evidenced, though, in the following word!), presumably an official 'public' measurement, except that this Latin phrase is not actually recorded until medieval times.\nLine 4: \"The sequence II ECQVE S could also be borrowed from Latin, if II and S can be understood as a numeral and the abbreviation of semis.\" So if ECQUE reflects L. etque \"and\" this could mean \"two and a half.\" This along with IIS in line 3 directly above could be referring to the Latin sestertius which originally meant \"two asses (coins) and half of a third.\" But it is more likely that these numbers refer to measurements of space (see below).

    "The Battle of K\u00f6rmend was a military engagement that took place on June 26\u201327, 1664, as part of the Austro-Turkish War (1663-1664). Although not a major engagement in the broader context of the conflict, it nonetheless played a huge role in the subsequent Christian victory at the Battle of Saint Gotthard.\nBackground\nGrand Vizier Ahmed K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc wanted to take the ford of the R\u00e1ba river in 1664 to move towards Vienna with his huge army. He was leading the Ottoman army to reinforce the defenders of Kanizsa castle. They took \u00daj-Zr\u00ednyiv\u00e1r castle, then they were heading toward Vienna through Zala County. General Raimondo Montecuccoli deployed the Imperial troops along the line of the R\u00e1ba River to fend off the Turks. The general sent Franz III. N\u00e1dasdy and his Hungarian and Croatian men to defend the ford at K\u00f6rmend. N\u00e1dasdy was aided by the troops of Batthy\u00e1ny Krist\u00f3f, Chief Captain of the Trans-Danubian Region.\nThe first skirmishes took place on July 25 between Ottoman raiding parties and the Hungarian forces. However, the Christian troops did not want to engage the main Ottoman army in a large-scale battle just yet.\nThe soldiers of the French Count Jean de Coligny-Saligny and the men of Imperial Count Wolfgang von Hohenlohe arrived at K\u00f6rmend on 26 July, along with the Hajd\u00fa warriors of Esterh\u00e1zy P\u00e1l. They occupied the crossable fords of the R\u00e1ba river while the cannons of the castle were firing at the Ottoman army who made camp on the right bank of the river.\nBattle\nOn July 26, at around 2:00 PM, the garrison stationed at K\u00f6rmend Castle commenced an artillery bombardment, targeting the Turkish encampment situated on the opposite riverbank. Meanwhile, Christian cavalry forces were positioned in close proximity to the shelling site. By the time the sun set, the defenders, consisting of Hungarian, Croatian, German, and French soldiers, had successfully reinforced and fortified their defensive positions.\nThe following day, on July 27, the Turks launched an attack against the bridge, which was being defended by Hungarian forces. However, with the arrival of French units, the Ottomans were ultimately repelled and driven back from the bridge. However, the low walls of the city did not provide adequate protection from the shots of the Ottoman cannons, and the French cavalry was most exposed to danger. In the fight, the commander-in-chief of the French, de Coligny, was also wounded.\nWhen the cavalry of Montecuccoli arrived, the Ottomans decided to withdraw their army. However, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc launched a final attack against the mounted riflemen of Baden, but the Germans inflicted great casualties among the assaulting Ottoman warriors. Seeing this, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc issued the order of withdrawal.\nAftermath\nWhile the battle of June 26\u201327 was not a major engagement in the grand scheme of the conflict, it nonetheless played a meaningful role in setting the stage for the subsequent Christian victory at the Battle of Saint Gotthard. Although the entirety of the Ottoman army was not committed to this particular clash, the fact that the Christian defenders were able to hold their ground and prevent the enemy from crossing the river represented an important tactical success. Following this engagement, the army of K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc continued its advance, while the Hungarian and Croatian forces of N\u00e1dasdy and Esterh\u00e1zy remained stationed at K\u00f6rmend to monitor the river fords.\n",

    "1989 film by George Eastman\nMetamorphosis (Italian: DNA formula letale) is a 1990 film written and directed by Luigi Montefiori under the pseudonym G. L. Eastman. It is the only film directed by Montefiori, best known for his career as an actor under the pseudonym George Eastman. (Although he had previously served as an uncredited director on 2020 Texas Gladiators.)\nPlot\nGeneticist Peter Houseman, professor at a private university, is involved in studies on DNA with the support of his friend Mike and his young collaborator Willy, developing a serum he claims could be capable of preventing aging and defeating death. However, a commission decides to examine his continued requests for funding. Among the members stand out the elderly Professor Lloyd, very envious of Peter, and Inspector Sally, for whom Peter immediately shows attraction. The commission's skepticism and bureaucracy lead Peter to test the serum containing the modified DNA he has created. on himself\nAt first the experiment seems to have a positive result; Peter feels increasingly stronger and begins a relationship with Sally, although her son Tommy immediately shows hostility towards him. Shortly after, however, Peter start showing episodes of violence. First he goes to a club where he brutally beats a prostitute, without remembering what happened. Then Patricia, a flirtatious student who had tried to seduce him, is raped and then strangled. Meanwhile, his body also begins to degenerate and acquire reptilian traits.\nHit by a police car, Peter is admitted to a hospital, where he goes through a phase of premature aging that weakens him greatly. He claims that as a result of his experiment, he will forever remain whatever he becomes into and will never die. Kept under observation by doctors Mike and Lloyd, the latter hypothesizes that his body is regressing at an unspecified point in man's evolutionary history. Now looking monstrous, Peter escapes from the hospital, kills Lloyd and Willy, and discovers that his body needs human blood to stay strong. He kidnaps Tommy and then returns to the university lab, leaving a trail of death and blood in his wake, to make one last attempt to correct the experiment. However, Tommy destroys the bottle containing the serum and, pursued by Peter, escapes helped by his mother, who arrives at the scene. Tommy and Sally manage to escape outside where Mike and the police are waiting. Peter, who has now turned into an anthropomorphic dinosaur-like monster, opens the door and is shot by the police, before completely decomposing.\nSome time later, Tommy shows his mother a lizard that he keeps in a box. When Sally tells him to let it be free or otherwise it will die, the boy responds that it will never die, implying that the lizard is a surviving Peter.\nCast\nGene LeBrock as Peter Houseman\nCatherine Baranov as Sally Donnelly\nHarry Cason as Mike\nDavid Wicker as Willy\nJason Arnold as Tommy\nStephen Brown as Professor Lloyd\nTom Story as Professor Huston\nAnna Colona as Patricia\nWally Doyle as Inspector\nLaura Gemser as Prostite\nSerina Steinberg as Patricia's friend\nWayne Potrafka as Old Professor\nTim Wright as Hopkins\nAllison Stokes as Alice\nReception\nVarious reviews of the film highlighted that the film was largely derivative of David Cronenberg's The Fly. Scott Aaron Stine in The Gorehound's Guide to Splatter Films of the 1980s wrote that the film \"holds promise early on, despite being entirely derivative of Cronenberg's The Fly. Unfortunately, once the interesting premise has been established, it quickly degenerates into an '80s take on tacky '50s style horror films. Stiff acting, an obnoxious soundtrack, crappy make-up effects, and a not-as-menacing-as-they'd-like-you-to-think-it-is papier-mach\u00e9 monster make the viewing experience that much more wretched.\" Stine also sentences on Montefiore, \"And, yes, he should've stuck to acting.\" Clive Davis in Spinegrinder: The Movies Most Critics Won\u2019t Write About cites the film as \"boring FLY remake rip-off.\"\nFantafilm writes: \"Directorial debut of actor and screenwriter Montefiori under the pseudonym George L. Eastman. The story he chooses, centered on genetic mutation, is halfway between The Fly (and its prequels and sequels) and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Specialized critics, usually not very kind to Italian forays into fanta-horror, have highlighted in the film a medium technical skill in the construction of images and an original reference to the themes of David Cronenberg.\nThe Lexikon des internationalen Films (which reviewed the film under its German title Lizard) also compared the film to David Cronenberg's The Fly, stating that the film \"largely forgoes the unpleasant shock effect\" of said film, but fails to achieve the \"tension and consistency of its template.\"\n",

The company develops artificial intelligence (AI) chips used in self-driving cars and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).\nBackground\nHorizon Robotics was founded in 2015 by several former Baidu employees. One of them was Yu Kai who previously led Baidu's self-driving car division.\nThe company was funded by notable investors that included Intel, Hillhouse Investment, HongShan, Yuri Milner, Sinovation Ventures and Yunfeng Capital. Other backers include BYD, Chery and CATL. Due to the United States New Export Controls on Advanced Computing and Semiconductors to China attracted more interest from investors who felt Horizon Robotics could be an alternative to Nvidia in China which had abide with selling restrictions.\nIn December 2017, Horizon Robotics launched Journey 1.0, the first generation of its AI chips used in vehicles. It would help cars recognize external objects in a low power consumption manner.\nOriginally Horizon Robotics planned to hold an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States that could raise as much as $1\u00a0billion. However, in October 2021, it was reported that it changed its IPO country to Hong Kong instead. This came at a time where the Chinese government was increasing scrutiny of overseas listings.\nIn October 2022, Volkswagen Group invested $2.3\u00a0billion to establish a joint venture (JV) with Horizon Robotics. The JV was named Carizon and was aimed to develop in-house vehicle software for Volkswagen.\nAt the 2023 World Internet Conference, Yu announced that the number of vehicles featuring navigate on autopilot (NoA) equipped with Horizon Robotics chips has surpassed that of Nvidia. According to a report from China Money Network, Horizon Robotics controlled 49% of the Chinese self-driving chip market in 2023.\nIn March 2024, Horizon Robotics submitted its IPO application to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The offering is expected to raise $500\u00a0million.\nWhile Horizon Robotics mainly focuses on developing AI chips used in the automobile industry, it also develops AI chips that are used in surveillance cameras and other internet-connected smart devices. It holds partnerships with Chery, Audi, SAIC Motor and SK Telecom.\nSee also\nSelf-driving car\nSemiconductor industry in China\n",
    "\nOperation Bosanska Krajina was the code name of the Army of Republika Srpska in capturing the entire municipalities of Prijedor, Sanski Most and Klju\u010d. This was also the response of the VRS to the ARBiH attack on the city of Prijedor. The operation ended with the victory of the VRS and the beginning of the siege of Biha\u0107.\nThe Operation\nAt the end of May - beginning of June, the Serbs had to carry out a difficult operation in Sanski Most and the Muslim villages around Klju\u010d. The goal was to use preventive military measures to neutralize possible partisan activity of Muslims in Bosnian Krajina and to secure the largest city of Republika Srpska - Banja Luka. On May 25, units of the 6th Sanska (former 6th Partisan) Brigade began shelling the suburbs of Sanski Most with mortars. The next day, the Serbs began a search for weapons, simultaneously separating all the soldiers. Women, old people and children were sent to the territory under the control of Muslim forces, and most of the men were taken to camps in the area of \u200b\u200bPrijedor. At the same time, two battalions of the 6th Sanska, a battalion of the 13th Partisan and a battalion of the 2nd Engineer Regiment began to clear the villages north and northwest of the town of Klju\u010d. Their population was also expelled from the borders of the Republika Srpska, or placed in concentration camps, in order to be further sent to Muslim territory. The ARBiH attack began at 4:00 a.m. on May 30. Muslim forces attacked a hotel used by the Serbs as a barracks, a public security unit, a radio station and an administration building in Prijedor . After the defense of Prijedor, the VRS reacted quickly and launched a counterattack, occupying the settlements around Prijedor. In some settlements, there was a brief resistance by members of the BiH Army who attacked Prijedor a few days ago, but the VRS defeated them. The VRS continues its offensive south of Prijedor. On June 1, 1992, tragic events took place in the village of Prhovo , 7 km northeast of Klju\u010d. A Serbian detachment (supposedly volunteers who were part of the Sixth Infantry Brigade) carried out the usual operation to uncover secret weapons caches. At first, the soldiers behaved rudely towards the residents. Then a shooting began in which 53 civilians were killed, \u00a0including women and children. At the beginning of the war, such crimes were committed by all sides in the conflict, because many armed groups consisted of poorly controlled, undisciplined soldiers, with little understanding of the modern rules of warfare. In the summer and fall of 1992, the Serbian military-political leadership undertook a series of measures to improve discipline. Several hundred Muslims and Croats took refuge in the forests of Majdanski brdo, between Prijedor and Sanski Most. Most of them were civilians, but among them there were remnants of units of the Patriotic League, including those who participated in the attack on Prijedor. They launched partisan actions against Serbian patrols and small garrisons. With that, the Serbian army moved on to a decisive operation to clean up Bosanska Krajina. According to the cleaning plan, the 5th partisan brigade under the command of Major Pero \u010coli\u0107 , reinforced by the battalion of the 43rd Prijedor Motorized Brigade, was supposed to move from Prijedor to the south, in the direction of Stara Rijeka . Here, the soldiers under the command of \u010coli\u0107 were supposed to link up with the units of the 6th San Brigade, which is advancing from the south and is fighting a battle in Sanski Most against ARBiH rebels and snipers. The operation began on July 20. In the course of it, Serbian troops defeated several small guerilla groups. Imprisoned civilians were sent to refugee camps for further transfer to territory under the control of Muslim-Croatian forces. The operation to clear the Majdanska mountain was the last such action, in which the army also took part. The police were later in charge of breaking up small groups of Patriotic League militants in the forests. The VRS repels the ARBiH forces all the way to Biha\u0107. This is where the operation ended and the siege of Biha\u0107 began.\n",
    "Tunnel in the south of Albania\nLlogara Tunnel (2022)\nThe Llogara Tunnel is a tunnel located in the south of Albania about 20 km from Vlora. The tunnel that cuts through the Llogara National Park, has a length of 6 kilometers and is the longest in the country. It is expected to significantly improve travel times between the Albanian Riviera and other parts of the country.\nOverview\nThe Llogara Tunnel, an important infrastructure project in southern Albania, aims to improve connections and facilitate transportation between Vlora and the Albanian Riviera. With the growing tourism in this beautiful area, the need for road improvements became clear. While the SH8 road was constantly being expanded, the Llogara Pass remained challenging due to its elevation of over 1,000 metres (3,300\u00a0ft) and narrow bends.\nIn 2017, Prime Minister Edi Rama first announced the idea of constructing a tunnel under the Llogara National Park. After a brief tender process, the planning contract was awarded to an Austrian engineering firm at the end of 2020. Less than a year later, the construction contract was awarded to a Turkish consortium, with an estimated cost of 140 million euros.\nOfficial excavation work for the tunnel began in November 2021, and about 14 months later, in January 2023, the first tube was completed. It passes under the Llogara Pass and connects Vlora with the Albanian Riviera, offering stunning views along the way.\nThis 142 million euro investment includes concrete lining and complex systems for drainage, ventilation, fire and smoke protection, lighting, emergency calls, and signaling. Upon completion, the tunnel is expected to reduce the travel time from Dukat to Palas\u00eb from 30 minutes to just 7 minutes.\nThe Llogara Tunnel is expected to have a significant impact on the country's economy and contribute to the development of tourism along the Albanian coast. With its opening for traffic on July 5, 2024, the tunnel will facilitate travel and provide a new experience for all who visit this area.\nSee also\nAlbanian Riviera\nThirr\u00eb-Kalimash Tunnel\n",
    "Former nightclub in Paris\nBains Douches Facade\nLe Bains Douches (roughly translated as The Bathing Houses) (aka Les Bains-Douches and Bains Douches) was a Parisian nightclub located at 7 rue du Bourg-l'Abb\u00e9 in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris active from 1978 to 2010. Bains Douches was a mecca of decadent excess for Parisian nightclubbers during the 1980s; the trendiest meeting place in Paris for international artistic society. After many adventures over the decades, the nightclub closed its doors in 2010.\nHistory\nThe building originally houses the Guerbois thermal baths, created in 1885 by Fran\u00e7ois Auguste Guerbois (1824\u20131891) and his son Albert Guerbois (1857\u20131926) who also operate the Guerbois caf\u00e9, a popular meeting place for artists and intellectuals at the time. It was immortalized by \u00c9douard Manet. The plaque at the entrance of Les Bains Douches indicates: Bains Guerbois, swimming pool, Turkish and Russian baths, sulfurous steam showers. At the end of the 19th century, the place attracted many influential homosexual personalities, including Marcel Proust. Jean-Pierre Marois, historic owner of the place, founded the company Les Bains in 2011 as part of the renovation of the new project.\nOpening as a club\nMaurice Marois bought the place as a cesspool at the end of the 1960s before transferring the lease many years later. The shabby-chic club Bains Douches was established in 1978 by Jacques Renault, an antique dealer and his partner Fabrice Coat. They transformed the baths into a modular nightclub with a lounge on the first floor.\nPhilippe Starck, then just starting out, re-decorated the place in white and black tiles. Later, David Rochline retouched the appearance of the entrance. The swimming pool in the basement had a giant chessboard at the bottom of the water, the pieces of which are moved by a frogman. Added to this was a concert hall, discotheque, restaurant and bar. It opened to much fanfare on December 21, 1978 with more than 2,000 people present. Pierre et Gilles designed the invitation card.\nPost-Punk days\nFar from the ostentatiousness disco trend of the moment, Bains Douches became the meeting point for the world of no wave cultural intellectuals and artists. Disc jockey/singer Philippe Krootchey hosted a large number of evenings there featuring the music of Talking Heads and The B-52's. Depeche Mode gave its first concert in France at Bains Douches in September 1981. Other hosted live music performances were by the Dead Kennedys, Joy Division, Suicide, Les Rita Mitsouko, The Jesus and Mary Chain and Echo & the Bunnymen (among many others). Joy Division recorded their Les Bains Douches 18 December 1979 LP there and the CD booklet contains a reprint of the original poster for the show. Also the No Wave band James Chance & the Contortions recorded their album Live Aux Bains Douches there in 1980.\nFarida Khelfa was the club's physiognomist for two years before being replaced for a time by Caroline Loeb and Paquita Paquin. Transgender icon Jenny Bel'Air also worked the door for a while. Regular club goers included Roman Polanski, Johnny Depp, Naomi Campbell, Mick Jagger, Kate Moss, David Bowie and Jean-Charles de Castelbajac.\nSee also\n1980s portal\nLe Palace\nCBGB\nTier 3\nMudd Club\n",

    "Ren\u00e9 Maublanc (17 July 1891 \u2013 20 January 1960) was a French Marxist philosopher and historian.\nBiography\nRen\u00e9 Maublanc was born in to the republican middle-class family of a lawyer and professor of law Georges Maublanc. His studies led him to the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in 1911, where he obtained the agr\u00e9gation in philosophy in 1919. After two years spent in the auxiliary services of the army, he was discharged.\nInvolved in the Human Rights League, in 1917 he was secretary of the \u00c9pernay section, a town where he was assigned as a history and geography teacher, before being appointed at the start of the 1919 school year to Bar-le-Duc. He then became involved in teacher unionism and recommended affiliation to the CGT, which earned him a trip to Algiers for a year.\nAssigned to Reims in 1921, he received a new sanction the following year from the school inspector for union activity. However, he obtained at that date a position as secretary-archivist at the Social Documentation Center of the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. He then promoted the collection of Charles Fourier's archives, by publishing in 1924 his Hierarchy of Cuckolding. In 1927 he obtained a position as professor of philosophy at the \u00c9cole alsacienne, but his participation in the strike of February 12, 1934 the school management requested for his departure. He then obtained a position at the Beauvais high school, which he held for two years, before returning to Paris, to the Henri-IV high school in 1936.\nHe continued his literary activity, publishing in 1929 the poetic works of Georges Chennevi\u00e8re. Until the war, he continued to publish works of fiction, literary works, and political texts. Maublanc became active within a group of Marxist intellectuals, close to the Communist Party , who sought to disseminate Marxist thought. Most of them were, like Maublanc, members of the Cercle de la Russie neuve, which became the Association for the Study of Soviet Culture. They included Paul Langevin, Henri Wallon, Marcel Prenant, Marcel Cohen, Georges Cogniot and Jean Baby.\nHe joined the Comit\u00e9 de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes and castigated in a pamphlet entitled \"Pacifism and the Intellectuals\", the \"integral pacifism\" of those who had just taken over the leadership of the committee, pushing the communists and sympathizers of the Communist Party into the minority. A member of the Association des \u00e9crivains et artistes r\u00e9volutionnaires (AEAR), he denounced in the journal Commune, the spirit of \"capitulation to fascism\" after the Munich Agreement.\nDuring the Second World War he joined the active Resistance. He was director of the Universit\u00e9 Libre in the autumn of 1943, after the execution of the founders of this publication, Georges Politzer, Jacques Decour and Jacques Solomon, he then joined the national committee of the Front national universitaire. At the same time, he also served as editor-in-chief of La Pens\u00e9e libre, the title given to the journal La Pens\u00e9e in clandestinity. He then joined the Communist Party in the same year.\nAfter  the Liberation, he also worked towards the unification of secondary school teachers' unionism, participating in the discussions which led to the birth of the SNES. He was briefly chief of staff to Henri Wallon, appointed Secretary General of the Ministry of National Education after the Liberation, he then returned to his post at the Henri-IV high school. He continued his work as a member of the editorial board of L'\u00c9cole la\u00efque, campaigned for the Union fran\u00e7aise universitaire, the Union rationaliste and, as editorial secretary, devoted a good portion of his time to the monthly review La Pens\u00e9e.\nWorks\nBooks\nCent ha\u00ef-ka\u00ef, Maupr\u00e9, Le Mouton blanc, 1924\nDerradji, fils du d\u00e9sert, Larousse, 1927\nYvonne au pays de Derradji, Larousse, 1929\nLa Philosophie du marxisme et l'enseignement officiel, Les Cahiers de contre-enseignement prol\u00e9tarien, No.\u00a019, juillet 1935\n\u00a0B\u00e9bert et le jeune ch\u00e2telain, \u00c9ditions sociales internationales, 1935\nLe Pacifisme et les intellectuels, Publications du Comit\u00e9 mondial contre la guerre et le fascisme, 1936\nLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et les classes, Paris, Bureau d'Editions, 1936-1937\nA la lumi\u00e8re du marxisme\u00a0: socialisme utopique et socialisme scientifique, Association pour l'\u00e9tude de la culture sovi\u00e9tique, 1938\nLa France en p\u00e9ril, Paris, Editions de Paix et Libert\u00e9, 1938\nEsquisse d'une morale r\u00e9publicaine\u00a0: notes d'instruction civique pour la renaissance fran\u00e7aise, Paris, La Biblioth\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise, 1945\nLe Marxisme et la libert\u00e9, Paris, \u00c9ditions Sociales, 1945\nLes Probl\u00e8mes de la libert\u00e9, Paris, 1947\nCollaborative Works\nUne \u00e9ducation paroptique\u00a0: la d\u00e9couverte du monde visuel par une aveugle, avec Le\u00efla Holterhoff Heyhn, Gallimard, 1926\nCours de marxisme\u00a0: premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, 1935-1936\u00a0: les classes, l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, la libert\u00e9, l'\u00c9tat, l'individu, socialisme et communisme, avec Jean Baby et Georges Politzer, Paris, Bureau d'\u00e9ditions, 1936\nFourier, avec F\u00e9lix Armand, Paris, \u00c9ditions sociales internationales, 1937\nPaul Lang",
    "South African politician (born 1959)\nConduct Richard Hlophe (born 7 July 1959), commonly known as Richard Mkhungo, is a South African politician from KwaZulu-Natal. He is currently serving as the Deputy Minister of Defence and Military Veterans since July 2024. A member of the African National Congress (ANC), he was elected as the national president of the South African National Civics Organisation in November 2023. He was formerly a local councillor in eThekwini.\nEarly life and career\nMkhungo was born on 7 July 1959. Hlophe, his legal surname, is his mother's surname.\nHe rose to political prominence as a trade unionist in the South African Municipal Workers' Union, first as a union organiser and then as the union's provincial secretary in KwaZulu-Natal between 1998 and 2006. He also served stints in the provincial leadership of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and as president of the Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood and Allied Workers' Union.\nSouth African National Civics Organisation\nIn the August 2016 local elections, Mkhungo was elected to represent the African National Congress (ANC) as a local councillor in the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality. He was elected to chair the council's ethics committee. At the same time, he held high office in the South African National Civics Organisation (SANCO), the ANC's alliance partner; by 2016 he was the provincial secretary of SANCO's KwaZulu-Natal branch.\nOver the next year he became a prominent figure in the regional politics surrounding the ANC's upcoming 54th National Conference, which would select a successor to ANC president Jacob Zuma. The Mail & Guardian said that Mkhungo was a supporter of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's leadership bid, which also had Zuma's support. However, Mkhungo also endorsed both of the other frontrunners: in May 2017, Mkhungo's provincial leadership corps formally endorsed Cyril Ramaphosa, and Mkhungo told press that he viewed Ramaphosa as \"fit and ready to ascend\"; then, in September 2017, he announced that the leadership corps had decided to back Zweli Mkhize instead. Ramaphosa was elected when the 54th National Conference was held in December 2017.\nIn August 2018, Mkhungo was at the centre of a major factional dispute between his allies and SANCO national leaders Skhumbuzo Mpanza and Richard Mdakane. On 11 August, Mpanza, as SANCO's national secretary general, issued Mkhungo with a formal suspension from his position as provincial secretary. He was accused of ill-discipline and of bringing the organisation into dispute. Mkhungo said that he would challenge the suspension in court if necessary and that \"there is no way we will allow a situation where I will vacate the office\". The spat was linked to SANCO's upcoming national elective conference, at which Mkhungo was expected to stand for Mpanza's position on a slate aligned to presidential candidate Roy Moodley. In the aftermath he regained his position as national secretary, and Mdakane and Mpanza were arrested in January 2019, accused of stealing from SANCO.\nMkhungo was re-elected as SANCO provincial secretary at a provincial elective conference in Durban on 27 January 2023. The same conference elected Lucky Hadebe as Mkhungo's deputy, and it also elected former president Zuma as SANCO's provincial chairperson. Mkhungo said that SANCO sought to \"learn from  and give him a platform to mobilise communities\". Responding to rumours that Zuma would use SANCO as a vehicle to contest the 2024 general election, Mkhungo said that he could not rule out that SANCO might split from the ANC and register as a political party; he told City Press that if the ANC sidelined Zuma and SANCO, \"We will make their lives difficult.\"\nIn the run-up to the election, Mkhungo's faction of SANCO (known as the Durban faction) held a series of reconciliatory meetings with their opponents (the so-called Alexandra faction) which culminated in a decision to disband Mkhungo and Zuma's provincial leadership corps. Instead, Mkhungo was appointed as national convener of the interim leadership that was appointed to lead the national organisation until fresh leadership elections could be held. SANCO's 7th National Conference was held in late November 2023 in Durban, and it elected Mkhungo as SANCO president; Chris Malematja and Lucky Moloi were elected as his deputies.\nShortly afterwards, Zuma announced the establishment of a new opposition party, the Umkhonto we Sizwe Party (MK Party), which would seek to unseat the ANC in the upcoming general election. In press interviews and in a speech to a January 8th rally, Mkhungo intimated a rejection of the MK Party, affirming SANCO's abiding alliance with the ANC and its support for President Ramaphosa. He condemned what he called \"some new tendency by new shenanigans who are using our name to associate with ourselves as if they don't know our originality\".\nNational government\nIn the May 2024 general election, Mkhungo stood as a candidate for election t",
    "Duke of Elchingen\nMichel Aloys Ney, 3rd Duke of Elchingen (3 May 1835 \u2013 23 February 1881), was a French general.\nEarly life\nHe was the only son of Michel Louis F\u00e9lix Ney, 2nd Duke of Elchingen (1804\u20131854), and Marie Jos\u00e9phine Souham. He had two sisters, Marie-Louise H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Ney d'Elchingen (who married Prince Nicolae Bibescu) and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Louise Ney d'Elchingen.\nHer maternal grandparents were G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Joseph Souham and Rosalie Desperiez. His paternal grandparents were Agla\u00e9 Augui\u00e9 and Michel Ney, 1st Prince de la Moskowa, 1st Duke of Elchingen, who was made a peer of France in 1814. On his execution in 1815, the peerage was revoked, but it was restored in 1831. Clauses in the titles' patents of creation caused the title of Prince de la Moskowa to pass to Ney's eldest son (Michel's uncle), Napol\u00e9on Joseph Ney, and the title of Duke of Elchingen to pass to his second son (Michel's father), Michel.\nCareer\nBattle of Hierba-Buena in 1865, by Jean-Adolphe Beauc\u00e9\nIn August 1852, he volunteered in the regiment of his uncle, Napoleon Joseph Ney, a few months after the death of his cousin of the same age. He served in the East, during the Crimean War in 1854, then in Algeria from 1855 to 1860, with a stint in Italy in 1859, again in Algeria then in Syria from 1859 to 1862. In 1861, he was officer in the chasseurs of the Imperial Guard. He participated in the Second French intervention in Mexico from 1862 to 1866, and finally during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870.\nDukedom of Elchingen\nUpon the death of his father in 1854, the dukedom passed to Michel. Upon the death of his uncle Napol\u00e9on Joseph Ney in 1857, who died without surviving legitimate male issue, the princely title passed to another uncle, Edgar Ney, who became the 3rd Prince de la Moskowa. When he died without issue in 1882, the title reverted to Michel's branch of the family. Since Michel had died in 1881, his younger son Charles became the 4th Duke of Elchingen and his eldest son, L\u00e9on Napol\u00e9on Louis Michel Ney, became 4th Prince de la Moskowa. Upon his death in 1928, the titles were again united and held by his second son, Charles.\nPersonal life\nPortrait of his wife (after she remarried to Prince d'Essling), by \u00c9douard Rosset-Granger, 1902Portrait of his daughter, C\u00e9cile, by Giovanni Boldini, 1910\nOn 9 August 1866, he married Paule Marguerite Laure Juliette Furtado-Heine in Rocquencourt, Yvelines.

    "French ch\u00e2teau\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Chambly is a historic ch\u00e2teau on rue d'Amblaincourt that is located in the commune of Chambly, in the French department of Oise in the Hauts-de-France region. Part of the park extends over the commune of Ronquerolles, in the Val-d'Oise department.\nHistory\nA prior ch\u00e2teau on the estate, located below the current, was named Petimus and, in 1620, belonged to Fran\u00e7ois de L'Hospital, Governor of the Bastille. Today, only a chapel built by Claude Le Picard in 1670 remains standing.\nPrince Murat\nIn 1887, Baron Camont de Valence and Marie de Beaumont sold the former estates of Petimus and Evosseaux to Joachim Murat, 5th Prince Murat, and his wife, C\u00e9cile Ney d'Echingen (a great-granddaughter of Marshal Ney). Prince Murat tore down the original ch\u00e2teau and hired French architects Blondel et Langlois to design and build his Anglo-Norman style ch\u00e2teau. He also had an English-style park designed by the landscape architect Duchene. Prince Murat, who was passionate about hunting, built large stables, a number of outbuildings (built in 1896) and a small stud farm built on the grounds. Prince Murat was master of the Hunt (Equipage) known as the Rallye-Champly. His father, Joachim, 4th Prince Murat, died at the chateau in 1901.\nDuring the World War I, the ch\u00e2teau and its outbuildings served as an auxiliary hospital. During World War II, the ch\u00e2teau was occupied by the Germans after which it was left abandoned.\nSimonet\nIn 1977, the ch\u00e2teau was acquired by local industrialist Pierre Simonet, who restored the property. The ch\u00e2teau remains owned by his descendants to this day.

The goal of the Croatian National Guard (Croatian: Zbor narodne garde, ZNG) and the 2nd Guards Brigade was to unblock communication lines between Sunja and Sisak in the Banovina region, which were under JNA - SAO Krajina control, the Croatian forces participating in this operation also attempted to stop the advance of the Yugoslav People\u2019s Army in the SAO Western Slavonia battleground, including the roads around Komarevo and Sunj.\nOrder of battle\nThe Croatian tactical group included 3 various units, whilst the number of  Yugoslav People\u2019s Army personnel is unknown. The Croatian tactical lacked sufficient weaponry and supplies. The Croatian tactical group included; Croatian Interior Ministry, 2nd Guards Brigade \u201cThunders, Gromovi\u201d and the Independent 57th \u201cMarijan Celjak\u201d battalion. The Serbs had more modern equipment and more weaponry, which was used by the Yugoslav People\u2019s Army during the operation.\nTimeline\nAt midnight, a Croatian National Guard (ZNG) company, led by one of the commanders from the units of the Croatian tactical group, set out from Komarevo to liberate the road to Sunja. The company navigated through Magyars, Letovanaci, \u010cakal, and Trnjan before reaching the Br\u0111ani Kosa road. After a long and challenging journey, the company arrived at the Br\u0111ani Kosa road and was greeted by the villagers, who had been subjected to years of Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) occupation. The company paused to regroup and reorganize before receiving reinforcements.\nAfter the Croats regrouped their forces, the ZNG forces advanced towards Sunja, but their progress was halted near Br\u0111an Cesta. The JNA launched a fierce counterattack, raining down bullets and artillery fire on the ZNG positions. Five ZNG fighters were killed in action, and 17 others were wounded. Despite the intense fighting, the ZNG refused to retreat, continuing to defend their positions with all available resources.\nRailway station ambush\nAs dawn began to break a day later, the ZNG forces regrouped at the Sunja railway station. Unbeknownst to them, the JNA had planned a decisive ambush. From this advantageous position, they unleashed a torrent of machine gun fire and artillery shells upon the exhausted ZNG troops. The ferocity of the attack caught the Croats off guard, sending shockwaves through their ranks.\nIn this chaotic moment, 1 more ZNG fighters lost their lives, while many others were injured. The JNA\u2019s relentless onslaught forced the ZNG to fall back and reorganize their lines. Despite this setback, the ZNG refused to yield, determined to push forward and reclaim their territory.\nAftermath\nThe Croatian Army suffered 5 killed and 17 wounded, all of whom belonged to the 2nd Guards Brigade \u201cGromovi, Thunders\u201d the Croats, whom lacked aforementioned Weaponry and supplies managed to inflict casualties on Yugoslav Personnel.\nThe Croatian Army failed to meet its goal of reconnecting communications with Sisak and Sunja, this included its other goals. With the aftermath of Operation Br\u0111ani '91, the defense of the Sisak-Sunja commenced, as the Yugoslav People\u2019s Army had been invading the Banovina region since Mid 1991.\n",
    "\nHuman settlement in England\nRomney Marshes Area internal drainage board is the successor to a long line on organisations who have managed land drainage and flood defence on Romney Marsh in the counties of Kent and East Sussex in the south-east of England. \nHistory\nRomney Marshes, along with The Fens and the Somerset Levels, is one of the three major areas of marshland in southern England. It covers some 100 square miles (260\u00a0km2) of land, and stretches from Hythe in the north east to Fairlight in the south west. To the west, the marshland extends along the valleys of the River Rother, River Tillingham and River Brede. Most of it is low-lying, below the level of high tides, and is susceptible to flooding from the sea and from fresh water. To some extent, it is protected from the English Channel on its south and east sides by large banks of shingle, consisting of flint pebbles, but these are constantly being altered by wave action. Dungeness, at the south-eastern tip, is a large promontary made of shingle. The gaps between the shingle banks have been plugged with sea walls, built over centuries, without which most of the area would quickly revert to salt marsh. Furthest west is Pett Wall, followed by Broomhill Wall, while between Dungeness and Hythe are the Littlestone Wall and Dymchurch Wall.\nMuch of the marshes became the property of the Priory of Canterbury in the 9th century, when the lands owned by the double minster of Lyminge were transferred to Christ Church, Canterbury. In the early 1100s, Christ Church granted land near Appledore to tenants, who had to maintain sea walls and drainage ditches known as sewers to prevent salt and fresh water flooding the land. Another early reference to flood prevention occurred sometime between 1155 and 1167, when Prior Wilbert of Canterbury granted a tenancy on land in Misleham, now part of Brookland parish, to a man called Baldwin Scudaway for \"all their land in Misleham which lies in the Marsh, in so far as Baldwin can inclose it against the sea\". Baldwin was required to pay for the sea defences himself, and the main drainage channel near Misleham is still called Baldwin's Sewer.\nA significant advance occurred in 1252, when Henry III issued the Charter of Romney Marsh. This prevented the Sheriff or his officers from taking any action which might prevent the Jurats of Romney Marsh from carrying out their responsibilities to protect the land from sea or fresh water flooding. This was one of the first pieces of legislation to recognise that land drainage was a bigger issue than could successfully be dealt with by individuals, and the resultant commission was the forerunner of many local authorities to control the drainage of low-lying areas of England. The charter allowed the Bailiff, Jurats and Commonality of the Marsh of Romney to levy rates, called scots, on occupants of the area to pay for maintaining the land drainage and sea defences, and this practice continued until 1932.\nExtreme weather during the 13th century caused numerous issues in the marshes, and the processes for dealing with them were gradually formulated into the Laws and Customs of Romney Marsh. Subsequently, commissions dealing with a number of other areas of marshland in England commanded that they should be managed according to the laws and customs of Romney Marsh. Edward IV issued another charter to Romney Marsh Corporation in 1462, to introduce liberties which would enable the population to increase, as the area had become depopulated. The ruling body became known as the Lords, Bailiff, Jurats and Commonalty of the Level and Liberty of Romney Marsh, and they were empowered to raise taxes in addition to the scots. The next major advance was the passing of a Land Drainage Act by Henry VIII in 1531. This act created Commissions of Sewers in all of the marshlands of England, apart from Romney Marsh, where the existing system worked so well that the Lords, Bailiff and Jurats continued to manage the land as they had previously done.\nBrack pumping station, owned by the IDB, was built in 1909.\nFollowing the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, Catchment Boards were set up to manage the main rivers. The Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board were responsible for the River Rother, the River Tillingham and the River Brede, while the Romney and Denge Marsh Main Drains Catchment Board were responsible for major waterways on the marsh itself. Within those catchment areas, internal drainage districts were created, to be managed by internal drainage boards (IDBs). They were responsible for the management of land drainage, and the network of channels that supported it. Six IDBs were created to manage the different areas of the marsh, but two of them amalgamated. The Romney Marsh Levels IDB managed the central area of the marsh, while Walland IDB managed Walland Marsh, bounded by Rye to the west, Lydd to the east and Brookland to the north. Denge and Southbrooks IDB managed Denge Marsh, to the east of Lydd, Pe",

    "\n3rd episode of the 2nd season of House of the Dragon\n\"The Burning Mill\" is the third episode of the second season of the fantasy drama television series House of the Dragon, a prequel to Game of Thrones. The episode was written by David Hancock and directed by Geeta Vasant Patel. It first aired on HBO and Max on June 30, 2024.\nIn the episode, a verbal conflict between the Riverland houses Bracken and Blackwood escalates into the deadly Battle of the Burning Mill. Daemon claims Harrenhal for Rhaenyra, securing the support of its castellan Ser Simon Strong. Rhaenyra, disguised as a septa, sneaks into King's Landing to secretly meet with Alicent.\n\"The Burning Mill\" introduced several new cast members, including Freddie Fox as Ser Gwayne Hightower, Gayle Rankin as Alys Rivers, and Simon Russell Beale as Ser Simon Strong. In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 1.1 million during its premiere night on linear television alone. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, with praise going towards the direction, character development, Alicent and Rhaenyra's reunion, Aemond and Aegon's brothel scene, Milly Alcock's return as young Rhaenyra in Daemon's vision, and the performances of the cast, particularly Emma D'Arcy and Olivia Cooke.\nThe episode marks the final appearances of Elliott Tittensor (Erryk Cargyll) and Luke Tittensor (Arryk Cargyll). \nPlot\nIn the Riverlands\nA small territorial dispute between long-time enemies, Houses Bracken and Blackwood, who support Aegon and Rhaenyra, respectively, escalates into a deadly battle resulting in ruination and many casualties.\nIn King's Landing\nHelaena forgives Alicent and empathizes with the smallfolk about losing children. Criston proposes a bold plan to take Harrenhal, the largest castle in Westeros albeit the ruins, to utilize it as a strategic military base. As Criston is about to depart for Harrenhal with a military detachment, Gwayne Hightower, Alicent's brother, unexpectedly joins them. Aegon also wants to accompany the campaign on his dragon Sunfyre, but Lord Larys Strong diplomatically persuades him to remain in King's Landing. Aegon then appoints Larys as his Master of Whisperers.\nIn a brothel, a white-haired man claims to be a Dragonseed, a bastard of Valyrian blood, and the half-brother of the late King Viserys Targaryen and Prince Daemon. When Aegon and his retinue bring a new squire to the brothel to lose his virginity, they encounter a naked Aemond with Sylvi. Aegon mocks his brother until Aemond leaves.\nAt Harrenhal\nDaemon arrives at Harrenhal on Caraxes before Criston's party reaches it. Ser Simon Strong, the castellan, instantly pledges his allegiance to Rhaenyra. He denounces his grand-nephew, Larys, claiming he had his own father, Lord Lyonel, and his brother, Ser Harwin, killed in the fire at Harrenhal. Later that night, an unseen force beckons Daemon to a weirwood tree. There, he experiences a vision of a young Rhaenyra sewing Jaehaerys' head back onto his decapitated body. He awakens before a cloaked woman who tells him he will die there.\nAt Dragonstone and the Crownlands\nErryk and Arryk Cargyll are buried together. Rhaenys suggests to Rhaenyra that Alicent might be persuaded against war. Rhaenyra sends her youngest sons Joffrey, Aegon, and Viserys away to the Eyrie to continue House Targaryen should the Blacks fail, with the Lady Jeyne Arryn taking Joffrey to ward. Rhaena is instructed to accompany them, but feels demotivated as she believes the reason to be her not having a dragon. She is mollified, however, when Rhaenyra entrusts four dragon eggs in her care.\nEn route to Harrenhal, Gwayne and a few soldiers recklessly head to a small village seeking amusement; Criston angrily races after them. Baela, patrolling the area on Moondancer, charges towards them, but they escape into a nearby forest. Baela reports this to Rhaenyra's councilors, who strongly suggest to engage dragons in the war. For her warning about Arryk, Rhaenyra rewards Mysaria with a place at court. Mysaria advises Rhaenyra on how to find Alicent in King's Landing. After reading Alicent's recent message, Rhaenyra decides to try and meet with her.\nIn King's Landing, cont.\nRhaenyra and one of her guards sneak into King's Landing. Disguised as a septa, Rhaenyra approaches Alicent while she is at prayer in a sept and they discuss recent events leading to the conflict. Rhaenyra realizes that Alicent misunderstood Viserys' dying words about the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy, mistaking her son for Aegon the Conqueror. Distraught by the revelation, Alicent dismisses Rhaenyra anyway, claiming the war can no longer be avoided.\nProduction\nWriting\n\"The Burning Mill\" was written by David Hancock, marking his first time as writer for the series. The name of the episode refers to the Battle of the Burning Mill started in the episode's opener, which is the first armed conflict of the war between the Greens and the Blacks.\nFilming\nThe episode was directed by Geeta Vasant P",
    "German biologist, natural philosopher and entomologist\nMay on trial in Nuremberg, 1947\nEduard May (14 June 1905, Mainz\u00a0\u2013 10 July 1956, Berlin) was a German biologist, natural philosopher, and entomologist who worked for an entomological research institute in Dachau established as part of the Nazi Ahnenerbe.\nLife and work\nMay was born in Mainz and studied in Frankfurt am Main before entering the University of Frankfurt where he studied zoology under Otto zur Strassen. His doctorate in 1929 was on shipworms. He then studied dragonflies at the Senckenberg Museum under Adalbert Seitz and processed the collections of Friedrich Ris. He was also involved in pest control working as a consultant for the chemical firm Gebr\u00fcder Borchers A.G, Goslar. He received several patents. In 1941 he went to Munich and later Starnberg. He was a friend of Hugo Dingler and became a professor at the University of Munich looking at relativism and natural philosophy. During World War II he was not drafted into the Wehrmacht as he had ear disease. In 1941 he was chosen by Wolfram Sievers for a new entomological institute that Heinrich Himmler sought to establish. Himmler was concerned by lice, typhus, flies, and was also interested in the applications of insect for wartime use. In 1943 he was assigned a research contract to develop control measures against mosquitoes as well as in the production of malarial mosquitoes which could be used for biological warfare. Although he was not a member of the NSDAP he made anti-semitic comments in some of his writings.  May worked in the institute which was located on the edge of the Dachau concentration camp and was part of a larger institute for applied defence science with other researchers who included Sigmund Rascher, Claus Schilling, and August Hirt, Rascher conducted lethal experiments on Dachau inmates and Hirt conducted mustard gas trials, collecting skulls for research. May conducted experiments on mosquitoes, their survival under different conditions particularly without food. In one letter he notes that Anopheles maculipennis was able to withstand prolonged survival without food and that it would be ideal for release, suggesting that offensive applications were not absent in the research. He also worked on fleas under a project code named \"Siebenschlaefer\" (Dormouse). This work involved collaboration with Karl Josef Gross who was known for his work on plague and typhus. He worked as SS-Sturmbannfuehrer at Posen and conducted human experiments in concentration camps. May recruited staff and advisors for his projects. These included Professor Josef Meixner from the University of Graz, Professor Erwin Schimitschek from Vienna, Erich Martini, Professor Friedrich Peus, and the advisors included his former employer Friedrich Borchers, Erwin Schimitschek, and Max Cretschmar. In September 1943 Sievers ordered May to manage rat control measures at Auschwitz concentration camp. May was involved along with Hans Bischoff in the confiscation of the Schmitz-Wassmann-collection of ants and Phoridae from Valkenberg, Maastricht and its movement to Berlin in 1943.\nMay was imprisoned by American forces in 1945 and was acquitted because his superior Wolfram Sievers wrote that May studied insects and had refused to conduct experiments on humans. His position at the University of Munich was terminated and on April 14, 1947, he was a witness at the Nuremberg Trials. In 1948 he founded a journal called Philosophia naturalis and taught at the Free University in Berlin from 1950 to 1956, succeeding Hans Leisegang as professor of philosophy.\n",

This forestland is the most complete forest in the lower southern region, there is a border extending to the Belum forest in Malaysia, part of Peninsular Malaysian rain forests.\nHistory\nIts history dates back to the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV), when Hiw Sin Jiw, a Hokkien Chinese immigrated to live and engaged in gold panning. At that time, gold from the gold mines of Phu Khao Thong was sent as tribute by the governor of Patani to the Siamese king in Bangkok for 30 catty per year. Until the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), he was appointed to tax collector for gold panning business and received the title of Khun Phra Wiset Suwannaphum (\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e34\u0e40\u0e28\u0e29\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34).

    "Goryeo government official\nIn this Korean name, the family name is  Cho.\nCho In-gyu (Korean:\u00a0\uc870\uc778\uaddc; Hanja:\u00a0\u8d99\u4ec1\u898f; 1237 \u2013 May 15, 1308) was a Goryeo civil official. Originally an interpreter for the Goryeo crown prince, his success in helping arrange a marriage between the prince and Kublai Khan's daughter propelled Cho's rise in Goryeo officialdom. He would eventually become the chancellor of Goryeo by 1292 and marry his daughter to the king's heir. \nBiography\nCho In-gyu was born in 1237 in Sangw\u014fn (\uc0c1\uc6d0; \u7965\u539f; modern-day Chunghwa County, North Korea) as the son of Cho Y\u014fng (\uc870\uc601; \u8d99\u7469) of the Pyongyang Cho clan. Cho's family was thought to be that of originally of commoner status. Cho In-gyu learned the Mongol language, due to Sangw\u014fn's close proximity to the Mongol-Goryeo border during Mongol invasions of Korea.\nIn 1269, due to Cho's proficiency in the Mongol language, Cho was selected to be the interpreter for Crown Prince Sim (the future King Chungnyeol) during his visit to the Yuan capital of Khanbaliq. As an interpreter, Cho was able to cultivate a relationship with not just the crown prince, but the prince's Mongol in-laws, his wife Princess Jeguk and his father-in-law, Emperor Kublai Khan. Due to his close ties to the royal families of Goryeo and Yuan, Cho was able to quickly rise through the ranks of Goryeo officialdom. He first was given the rank of senior colonel (\uc911\ub791\uc7a5; \u4e2d\u90ce\u5c07; chungnangjang), for his services in helping arrange the marriage between the heir of Goryeo and Kublai's daughter. He would obtain the offices of lieutenant general, royal secretary, deputy commissioner of the royal secretariat, and 1292, reach the top post of chancellor.\nIn 1292, Cho would also arrange another marriage, this time between his own daughter, Royal Consort Cho, and the crown prince, Wang Chang (the future King Chungseon). In 1298, King Chungseon's Mongol wife, Princess Gyeguk, noticed that that King Chungseon loved his other wife, Royal Consort Cho, more than her. She sent messages to the Yuan court, accusing her rival of having placed a curse on her causing the king to not love her. The Yuan arrested both Royal Consort Cho, as her family, including her father, Cho In-gyu. King Chungseon was deposed as king and his father, King Chungnyeol was re-instated as the king. When King Chungseon began his second reign as king in 1308, Cho's clan, the Pyongyang Cho clan, was listed as one of the fifteen great ministerial families (\uc7ac\uc0c1\uc9c0\uc885; \u5bb0\u76f8\u4e4b\u7a2e; chaesang chi chong), eligible for marriage with the royal House of Wang.\nCho was exiled to Anxi and would be released from exile six years later in 1306. After his return, in 1307, he was enfeoffed as the Lord of Pyongyang (\ud3c9\uc591\uad70; \u5e73\u58e4\u541b). Cho died on May 15, 1308.\nNotes\n^ In the Korean calendar (lunar), he died on the 25th day of the 4th Lunar month of the 34th year of Chungnyeol's reign (1208).\n",

    "\nSamba Ga\u00efn\u00e9 Sangar\u00e9 was a Malian author and politician who participated in a 1969 coup plot to overthrow Moussa Traor\u00e9. Sangare was sentenced to ten years of hard labor in Taoudenni, and wrote the book Ten Years of Hard Labor in Taoudenni about his experience.\nEarly life\nSangare was born in 1933 in Ntomikoro, French Sudan (now Nara Cercle, Koulikoro Region, Mali). He completed his primary schooling in Nara and was admitted to high school in Bamako, but accused his professors of corruption and was kicked back to Nara. 18 year-old Sangare became an assistant clerk in the Native Society of Providence in Nara, an organization compulsory for peasants in French colonies.\nSangare left his job in December 1953 to join the French Colonial Army. He completed basic training at a base in S\u00e9gou alongside future compatriots Mamadou Sanogo and Kissima Doukara. After completing basic training, Sangare served in the 1st Platoon in Bamako and in 1955 was sent to serve in the 2nd Platoon of the Signal Battalion in Thi\u00e8s, Senegal. In 1956, he was promoted to sergeant, transferred to a base in Kati, and was sent to fight for the French in the Algerian War in 1958. Sangare received the French Commemorative Medal of North Africa for his service.\nWhen Mali gained independence in 1960, Sangare was deployed as part of the Malian contingent of ONUC during the six-month time period while Patrice Lumumba was in power. He was rewarded the United Nations Peace Medal in November 1960, when he returned to Mali. After the collapse of the Mali Federation, Sangare continued to serve in his battalion at Kayes. He recalled that\n\"It was a national euphoria. We were young, enthusiastic and wanted to succeed in nation building. We were ready to move mountains to prove that we did not need a colonizer or Senegal to develop. To this end, in 1961, we, civilians and military, began building the Kayes-Guinea road. It was crazy; we thought we could do anything.\"\nSangare was promoted to senior sergeant in 1963 and in 1965 was transferred to the Sahara Company based in Kidal and commanded and founded the military posts of Tirikine in Kidal Region and Fanfing in M\u00e9naka Region. In Kidal, Sangare became close friends with company commander Dibi Silas Diarra, who suppressed the 1960s Tuareg rebellion. Sangare was eventually supposed to transfer to the region to become Diarra's secretary.\nFailed coup plot\nWhen Sangare joined the army, he took mandatory classes on Malian state politics, which was required under Modibo Ke\u00efta's rule. Sangare believed in developing the country under a Malian socialism and supported anti-imperalist ideas in Africa. He stated that \n\"It cost us nothing to go to the ends of the earth to defend our territorial integrity, the peace of our people and contribute to the development of the country.\"\nSangare joined the ruling Sudanese Union party and became an activist. The 1968 Malian coup d'\u00e9tat led by Moussa Traor\u00e9 overthrew Keita and put an end to Keita's Malian socialist ideas. The Sudanese Union was dissolved, and while the putschists promised to hold free and fair elections, it became clear the coup produced a second dictatorship. Dibi Silas Diarra began forming an army opposition movement to Traore in the summer of 1969, and prepared a plan for a coup to return power back to civilians. Sangare supported Diarra's conspiracy and believed that it would put Mali back on track to socialism. However, the plot failed and Sangare was arrested by Moriba Diakite on August 12, 1969.\nThe trial began on December 10, 1969. The State Security Court led by Amara Danfar and Mamadou Coulibaly sentenced 33 officers and sergeants to hard labor in sentences ranging from 5 years to life imprisonment. The sentence was announced on December 17, and Sangare learned he had been sentenced to ten years of hard labor in the Taoudenni desert. Led by Diarra, the sentenced officers began singing the Internationale. They were transported to Bamako prison, and at dawn on December 20, 1969, Sangare was one of the first nine prisoners to be shipped to Taoudenni.\nTaoudenni\nThe convicts were loaded on a plane and flown to Timbuktu. On December 25, they arrived in Taoudenni, where the government intended on building a fort and more salt mines to harvest salt that had been discovered there in the 16th century. When they arrived, the commander at Taoudenni Lt. Almamy Nyentao explained to Sangare and the other convicts that he had received orders to regard them as former comrades and not to pity them. As such, Nyentao ordered the men to wear civilian clothes and ordered that they be handcuffed and shackled. Their diet was limited to crushed finger millet boiled in saltwater and decomposing animal corpses, causing widespread malnutrition and beriberi.\nSangare and his comrades took turns sleeping on mats in a cramped room, waking up at 4 a.m. under threat of whipping to build a fort later called Nyentao. Sangare and other convicts created the bricks used in the fort, and prod",
    "Sikh politician, actor and activist\nDaljeet Kalsi is a actor-turned-activist, fundamentalist and politician. He first came into media limelight due to his support to and association with Khalistan-supporting, radical leader Amritpal Singh and his organization named Waris Panjab De. He was allegedly the link between Amritpal Singh and Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence.\nHe was originally a C-Grade Punjabi actor who joined Deep Sidhu, who was a key conspirator in the 2021 Red Fort Incident. He had openly spoken on Khalistan before his association with Amritpal Singh and had connections with Khalistani lobbies in Vancouver and London. He also had connections to Pakistan and its Inter Services Intelligence. Kalsi has been supporting Amritpal in professing radical ideology and raised the demand of secession of Punjab from India by violent means. He also had been supporting Amritpal actively provoking and conspiring to wage war against the state for a separate nation by name of Khalistan.\nIt was said he was the key financer of Amritpal Singh, he received around 35 crore rupees of foreign aid from other countries, possibly Pakistan. He had various Bollywood actors and singers in his friend circle as well. He was arrested from his house in Gurgaon after a crackdown on Amritpal Singh and his aides. Other than Kalsi and Amritpal Singh, 8 other aides to Waris Punjab De were arrested under the National Security Act and detained in Dibrugarh Jail, Assam.\nDuring the 2024 Indian General election, Amritpal Singh won from the Khadoor Sahib Constituency. Whereas Sarabjeet Singh Khalsa, the son of Beant Singh who assassinated Indira Gandhi, won from the Faridkot constituency. Possibly influenced by these wins, Daljeet Kalsi had declared that he would contest in the Dera Baba Nanak Assembly by-elections. He decided to contest before any other party declared their candidates. Other than him Prime Minister Bajeke and Kulwant Singh Rauke decided to contest from Giddarbaha and Barnala respectively.\n",
    "1983 Indonesian film\nCHIPS: Cara Hebat Ikut Penanggulangan Masalah Sosial is an Indonesian comedy film that premiered on April 15, 1983. Directed by Iksan Lahardi, it stars Dono, Kasino, and Indro. This film is inspired by the success of a similarly famous TV series from the 1980s, CHiPs, starring Erik Estrada as Officer Francis Ponchorello.\nCast\nWahjoe Sardono as Dono\nKasino Hadiwibowo as Kasino\nIndrodjojo Kusumonegoro as Indro\nSherly Malinton as Lita\nM.

Alongside the Warkop DKI trio, the film stars the late Panji Anom as Junet, their boss at CHIPS, and Sherly Malinton as Lita, Dono's romantic interest. From the outset, the film presents a series of comedic incidents: Kasino chasing after a reckless trail motorcyclist, Indro managing the antics of a mischievous child named Tomi (played by Memet Mini), and Dono ending up soaked after accidentally falling into a river with Lita during a romantic interlude.\nA memorable line from the film is \"Jangkrik Boss,\" uttered by Kasino upon catching his boss in a compromising situation with a woman in the forest. The film concludes somewhat tragically as Dono is compelled to abandon his plans to propose to Lita, who must honor her arranged marriage with Junet, their boss. Nonetheless, Dono exacts a humorous revenge by tossing Junet's cigar in a fit of rage, which elicits laughter from the trio as they play a prank on their former boss. Ultimately, the film ends on a comedic note.\nRelease\nThe film was produced in 1982 and officially released to the public on 15th April 1983.\nLegacy\nDuring the controversy between Warkop DKI and Warkopi in 2021, comedian Sammy Notaslimboy claimed that the film CHIPS was clearly plagiarized from the CHIPs TV series.\nThe CHIPS organization was reintroduced in the first and second installments of the Warkop DKI Reborn film series. These films were released in 2016 and 2017, respectively.\n",

    "American political operative\nMolly Amelia Michael is an American political operative and former government staffer. She was a Deputy Assistant to the President and Executive Assistant to the President during the Trump Administration. Michael was a key figure in President Donald Trump's day-to-day life at the White House and in his post-presidency life.\nEarly life\nMichael grew up outside of Chicago and attended Palm Beach Atlantic University.\nCareer\nMichael started working at the White House in 2017. In 2018, Michael became President Trump's executive assistant in the White House. In December 2020, Michael conveyed information from the President regarding alleged election fraud to high-ranking administration officials. Michael was notably absent from work on the morning of January 6, 2021 for personal reasons, which may have contributed to some of the gaps in President Trump's call logs that day.\nAfter President Trump left the White House, Michael remained in his service. She was reportedly close enough to him to proactively reach out to friends and allies to ask them to contact the former president with \"positive affirmations.\"\nIn November 2021, Michael received a subpoena from the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol. In March 2022, she appeared before the Select Committee, describing herself as an employee of Save America, Donald Trump's political action committee.\nBecause of her proximity to the former president, Michael is considered a key witness in many of the legal proceedings against the President. Unlike other current and former staffers of his, she has reportedly demonstrated cooperative behavior with law enforcement. In 2022, following the FBI's search of Mar-A-Lago related to the classified documents, Michael helped transfer additional files to the FBI upon discovering them in her work area. Some of those documents included to-do lists written on classified documents. President Trump reportedly urged her not to tell law enforcement officials about her knowledge of any classified documents that were improperly handled.\n",
    "\nSeason of television series\nThe second season of the Chilean version of Gran Hermano was announced in early 2024, with casting calls being opened in March of the same year. Diana Bolocco will return to host the reality series from Chile, while the housemates will once again occupy the Gran Hermano Argentina house.\nThe series was then announced by Chilevision to have a 2-night premiere event: with the live move-in on Friday, 12 July 2024, and the first team task to determine who gets to stay in the main house airing on Sunday, 14 July 2024.\nFormat\nSimilar to season one, the format remains largely the same: The show follows a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, who live inside a custom-built house outfitted with cameras and microphones recording their every move 24 hours a day. The HouseGuests are sequestered with no contact with the outside world. During their stay, the HouseGuests share their thoughts on their day-to-day lives inside the house in a private room known as the Diary Room. Each week, the HouseGuests compete in competitions to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in a Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HOH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and selects another HouseGuest to be saved for eviction. On eviction night, the audience vote to evict one of the nominees, and the nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house.\nFormat changes and additions\nCivilians vs. Celebrities\nFor the first time in Gran Hermano Chile history, contestants will be divided into 2 teams that will compete against each other for prizes, benefits and immunity.

    "The day Vietnam veterans threw their military medals away in antiwar protest\nVietnam Veteran Throwing Medal at the U.S. Capital\nOn April 23, 1971 Vietnam Veterans Against the War staged what was arguably \"one of the most dramatic and influential events of the antiwar movement\" as hundreds of Vietnam veterans, dressed in combat fatigues and well worn uniforms, stepped up, and angrily, one after another for three straight hours, hurled their military medals, ribbons, discharge papers, and even a cane, onto the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Many of them paused to speak, expressing sentiments ranging from \"I pray that time will forgive me and my brothers for what we did\" to \"I got a purple heart and I hope I get another one fighting these mother-fuckers.\":\u200ap.113\u200a\nVeteran Throwing His Medals as Others Wait Their Turn. Photo by Fred W. McDarrah\nThere has never been an antiwar or anti-government protest anything like this in the U.S. before or since. The very soldiers who had been sent to fight were back home\u2014many bearing the physical and mental wounds of war, some riding in wheelchairs\u2014at the doorsteps of the government which sent them, testifying to what they had witnessed and come to understand, saying the war was wrong; demanding it end.:\u200ap.116\u200a An editorial in the Akron Beacon Journal called the veterans \"men of conscience\" and said, of \"all the demonstrations\" against the war, \"none has had greater impact\". It continued, arguing that veteran testimony \"must inevitably carry more weight than the protests or endorsements of those who have never seen this war firsthand.\" A member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, a patriotic organization which was holding its annual convention in Washington that week, approached one of the protesting veterans and said, \"'Son, I don't think what you're doing is good for the troops.'\" The veteran replied: \"'Lady, we are the troops.'\":\u200ap.104\u200a:\u200ap.97\u200a\nOperation Dewey Canyon III\nVietnam Veterans Protest the War During Operation Dewey Canyon III\nThe medal throwing was the culminating event of six days of protests which started on April 18 as the first of over two thousand veterans arrived in Washington, DC. The whole six days came to be called Operation Dewey Canyon III by the veterans\u2014a name intended to draw attention to two semi-secret U.S. and South Vietnamese military operations in Vietnam and Laos dubbed Dewey Canyon I & II.:\u200ap.57\u200a Using typical military jargon, the protesting vets termed Operation Dewey Canyon III, a \"limited incursion into the country of Congress.\":\u200app.26&172\u200a The early days were filled with marches of hundreds of veterans, often led by men in wheelchairs and on crutches, wearing \"a wild assortment of campaign ribbons, purple hearts, camouflage half uniforms, and jungle camouflage hats\"; guerrilla theater on Capital Hill, where vets staged mock search-and-destroy missions showing how U.S. troops were ordered to kill everything that moved and demonstrating that the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre was not an aberration; and lobbying of members of congress.\nThe lobbying efforts were an eye-opener for many veterans who hoped they would be listened to by the politicians. Instead they discovered many wouldn't even meet with them, saying things like \"I know where you stand and you know where I stand. We're on opposite sides.\" One veteran was berated by his congressman who said, \"You're a disgrace to the uniform! Get out of this office!\" With few exceptions, the vets felt the politicians were unmoved and not about to change their positions. \"The politicians sent us to Vietnam. Now they don't want to hear us,\" said one ex-Marine. Another vet concluded, it made us \"more radical.\":\u200app.99\u2013102\u200a\nPresident Richard Nixon fed into this growing disillusionment and anger when he claimed that \"only 30 percent of the people  Vietnam veterans.\" The vets responded by collecting 1,200 DD-214s (military discharge papers) from the veterans in the camp and presenting them to the press. One veteran expressed all the protesters' sentiments when he said, \"Only 30 percent of us believe Nixon is President.\":\u200ap.102\u200a One of the highlights for the vets was attending a Senate hearing room to hear Senator George McGovern \"call for an immediate end\" to the war. They cheered as he denounced the crimes \"involved in killing several hundred thousand innocent civilians by our massive firepower.\" And again as he compared the \"crimes against humanity\" being committed by the U.S. in Vietnam to those committed by German and Japanese forces in World War II.\nMedal Throwing\nHundreds of Vietnam veterans hurled their war medals, ribbons, discharge papers, and even a cane onto the U.S. Capitol Steps\nThe growing anger of the veterans helped them decide what to do on the last day of the demonstrations. As one vet explained, \"I remember there was a big debate about whether we should throw the medals away at the Capitol Building or put them in a body bag.\":\u200ap.111\u200a Some of the less radical vets felt it would be disrespectful ",
    "\nOn January 8, 2011, French and Nigerien commandos attempted to retrieve two French nationals taken hostage by AQIM militants in Niamey, Niger in the desert near Tabankort, Mali. Both hostages were killed during the botched rescue operation, along with three Nigerien soldiers and four kidnappers. The rescue operation's failure sparked controversy in France as it was reported that one of the hostages was killed by French gunfire.\nKidnapping\nOn January 7, 2011, a six-man team of AQIM jihadists raided Niamey, the capital of Niger, with the goal of capturing Westerners to be used for ransom. The comando team including a man sent by Boko Haram. The jihadists reached Niamey that evening aboard a Toyota Land Cruiser and entered the Toulousain restaurant, frequented by Western nationals and diplomats. The parking attendants at the Toulousain did not raise alarm as the militants were dressed in military uniforms, with the attendants believing the jihadists were soldiers. At 10:40\u00a0p.m., the jihadists burst into the restaurant. Two jihadists guarded the entrance while two others ordered a table with two Frenchmen to follow them. Some customers tried to intervene, but stood down after the jihadists pointed weapons in their face. The jihadists fled the restaurant with the hostages within a minute, and left the city by heading northeast. The remaining fifteen European nationals in the restaurant hid in the bathroom until the jihadists left, and only a Nigerian professor chased the militants although he got lost.\nThe two hostages were 25 year-old Antoine de L\u00e9ocour, an expat and humanitarian worker who was set to marry a Nigerian woman that month, and 25 year-old Vincent Delory, an engineer and friend of Antoine's who was in Niamey to attend the wedding.\nPursuit of the kidnappers\nAs the jihadists left Niamey, their vehicle got a flat tire and the militants took some time to change it before heading back towards the Malian border. Although the Nigerien-Malian border is only two hours from Niamey, the militants took many long detours and were in Ouallam at 3am. Meanwhile, Nigerien gendarmes notified all barracks in the area of the kidnapping. Two pickups with around twenty soldiers from the National Guard of Niger and the Gendarmerie Nationale set off in search of the jihadists. Seven others left Niamey, including former Tuareg rebels that had joined the National Guard and knew the border area very well.\nAfter an hour of driving, the Nigerien forces located the jihadists' vehicle which wasn't moving. The jihadists opened fire on the soldiers and seriously injured Captain Alhadi Ibrahim, a former Tuareg rebel, before driving off. The Nigerien National Guard returned to the barracks to save Ibrahim and only the gendarmes continued the pursuit. The jihadists entered Mali on the morning of January 8, and called for a group of reinforcements. A second AQIM vehicle came to their location.\nFrench special forces ordered Nigerien forces not to continue pursuing the jihadists, although the Nigerien gendarmes who had entered Mali did not receive the message. When the Nigerien gendarmes caught up to the jihadists who were parked, the Nigeriens approached them to ask for information assuming they were a group of Tuaregs. The jihadists opened fire and killed a gendarme and injured four others, including a captain who was shot in the head. The four wounded gendarmes were taken prisoner, and the surviving gendarmes fled. The jihadists then fled into Mali and brought the gendarmes' pickup.\nRaid\nFrench forces prepared their troops in Ouagadougou for a raid on the jihadists. French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who was on a trip to the Antilles and Defense Minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 gave the green light to intervene. Head of the Special Operations Command (COS) Frederic Beth mobilized 200 men for the operation. An Atlantique 2 plane took off from N'Djamena and followed the jihadists using infrared and thermal cameras and although the plane briefly lost sight of them, relocated them around 4 a.m. Three Cougar helicopters took off from Ouagadougou; one carrying machine guns and the other two carrying twenty soldiers from the 1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment and the 13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment. The helicopters were followed by a C-160 for refueling.\nThe raid began at 11 a.m. near Tabankort, Mali. Ten parachutists from the C-160 were dropped first, and then the helicopters landed to release the commandos. As soon as they landed, the French helicopters were surprised by the militants as they hid in bushes and shot at the helicopters, damaging them. One of the pilots was injured by a jihadist with a Dragunov rifle. French forces then opened fire and destroyed the pickups, burning two jihadists in their vehicle. The pickup transporting the Nigerien gendarmes was also destroyed and two of them were killed and two further injured in the friendly fire. The remaining jihadists fled, with one executing hostage Antoine de Lecouer three hundred meters fro",

    "Species of lichen\nLepraria xerophila is a species of leprose lichen in the family Stereocaulaceae. Found in Europe and northwestern North America, it was formally described as a new species in 2004 by the Norwegian lichenologist Tor T\u00f8nsberg.\nDescription\nLepraria xerophila has a thallus that is highly variable, usually crustose (crust-like) and rarely squamulose (scaly). It forms compact, defined rosettes up to 2\u00a0cm (13\u204416\u00a0in) in diameter, with marginal lobes that are 2 to 3\u00a0millimeters (mm) wide and about 0.3\u00a0mm thick, having rounded tips and a distinctly raised margin up to 0.5\u00a0mm thick. These rosettes often merge with other neighbouring thalli to create a coarse, irregularly spreading, nearly continuous crust that can extend up to a decimeter or more in width.\nThe upper surface of the thallus ranges from whitish-gray to pale yellowish-gray, with a texture that varies from smooth to rough. It supports numerous fragile lobules (small lobes) that can be horizontal to vertical, regular to irregular, and easily detached. These lobules act as diaspores (reproductive structures) and evolve partly by budding off from the lobe margins, partly from the upper surface, and possibly from disintegrating lobes. Soredia (powdery reproductive structures) are few or absent.\nIn thick specimens, the medulla (inner layer) is distinct and white. The photobiont (photosynthetic partner) is organized in roughly spherical groups, 24\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter, within the diaspores and forms a nearly continuous layer just beneath the thallus surface. The lower surface is whitish-gray and lacks a tomentum (a covering of fine hairs).\nSpot tests on this lichen yield the following results: K\u2212, C\u2212, KC\u2212, and P+. The secondary metabolites present in Lepraria xerophila vary by chemotype. Chemotype I (most specimens) contains minor atranorin, major pannaric acid 6-methyl ester, usually major roccellic or rangiformic acids, and possibly trace amounts of methyl porphyrilate, pannaric, and porphyrilic acids. Chemotype II contains major norstictic acid, minor strepsilin, minor isostrepsilin acid, minor atranorin, and minor chloroatranorin.\nHabitat and distribution\nLepraria xerophila typically grows on dry soil, though it is occasionally found on bare rock and on wood. It thrives in various habitats including grasslands, coastal scrubland,chaparral, and areas transitioning to desert. It is also present in mixed oak-chaparral-pasture regions and oak forests.\nGeographically, this lichen is found in Europe, where only chemotype I is present. In North America, it is distributed along the Pacific coast, from Mexico up to Marin County, California.\n",
    "Italian Dominican theologian (-1528)\nIsidoro Isolani (c.\u20091480 \u2013 1528) was a Dominican theologian, lecturer and writer.\nLife\nIsolani was born around 1480, probably in Milan. Towards 1500 he joined the Dominicans of Santa Maria delle Grazie, where he later served as prior from 1526 to 1528. There he received a theological and philosophical education based on Peter Lombard's Sentences and Thomas Aquinas' Summa contra gentiles. In 1509\u20131510, he took part in the reform of the convent of Sant'Eustorgio. In 1513, he was a lecturer at Sant'Apollinare in Pavia. In 1514, he was at the oratory of Saint Joseph in Fontanellato. From 1516 to 1518, he was back in Milan. There he was attached to the circle around the mystic Arcangela Panigarola. In 1519, he was lecturing at the Dominican studium in Cremona.\nIn the war of 1521\u20131526 over the Duchy of Milan, Isolani favoured France. In 1521, he was lecturing at Sant'Apollinare. In 1522\u20131523, he read the Sentences at the Dominican studium in Bologna and became a Bachelor of Theology. He may have served for a time as regent of the studium. The date of his death is unknown, but Philip Schaff places it between 22 April and 9 July 1528.\nWorks\nAn illustration from Isolani's biography of Veronica da Binasco\nIsolani wrote in Latin. His works include:\nDe immortalitate animi humani (Milan: G. A. Scinzenzeler, 1505)\nLibellus adversus magos (Milan: G. A. Scinzenzeler, 1506)\nExplanatio immortalitatis humani animi secundum phylosophos (Milan: Gottardo Da Ponte, 1509)\nOpus de veritate conceptionis Immaculatae Virginis Matris Dei Mariae ex doctrina Ioannis Scoti ac divi Bonaventurae (Milan: 1510), an analysis of the papal bull Grave nimis (1483) of Sixtus IV, which declared the Immaculate Conception a dogma\nIn Averroistas de aeternitate mundi libri quatuor (Pavia: G.

Benedetti, 1523), his last publication\nIn 1518, Isolani published a biography of Veronica da Binasco, Panigarola's mystic predecessor. It was dedicated to King Francis I of France.\nIn November 1519 at Cremona, Isolani published anonymously a treatise against Martin Luther, entitled Revocatio Martini Lutherii Augustiniani ad Sanctam Sedem. It was the first response to Luther written by an Italian on his private initiative and without official sanction. It is divided into ten persuasiones inviting Luther to repentance. Isolani claimed authorship of the Revocatio in a later publication against Luther, the Disputationes, first printed at Pavia in 1522 and again at Lyon in 1528. It was dedicated to Garc\u00eda de Loaysa. In it, Isolani mounts a defence of the practice of indulgences.\nIsolani took up the project of Paolo da Soncino, an epitome of John Capreolus's commentary on the Sentences, and completed it in 1521. It was published at Pavia by G. Pocatela in 1522 under the title Divinum epitoma quaestionum in IV libros sententiarum a principe Thomistarum Ioanne Capreolo O.P. disputatarum and dedicated to Francis I.\n",
    "Officine Padane was an Italian manufacturer of vehicle bodies in Modena.\nHistory\nOfficine Padane was founded in 1943. The company traces its origins to the Modena-based Orlandi company, which from 1921 onwards primarily manufactured bodies for buses. Antonio Vismara took over Orlandi in the course of 1943 and moved the company to new workshops. Initially the company was called Carrozzeria e Meccanica Padana, but from 1950 the name was changed to Officine Padane. The relationship refers to the Italian name of the Po Valley.\nLike its predecessor, Padane mainly manufactured bus bodies. The chassis came from Fiat, Daimler-Benz, Lancia, OM and Volvo. Many buses were exported.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Padane also took on small batch production of passenger cars. These included the Maserati Mistral, the Maserati Indy, and the Maserati Bora, as well as the Stutz Blackhawk I and the Stutz Duplex, which were distributed by Stutz Motor Car Company. Padane built most of the coup\u00e9s of the first series (1971) using numerous Italian add-on parts (door handles from the Maserati Indy, taillights from the Fiat 850), before Carrozzeria Saturn in Cavallermaggiore took over series production of the Stutz.\nIn the early 1980s, the Milan-based Societ\u00e0 Costruzioni Industriali Milano (Socimi) took over the company. Due to economic difficulties of the new parent company, Padane also suffered and had to close in 1992 after bankruptcy.\nRevival\nIn 2015, the newly founded company Industria Italiana Autobus SpA (IIA) from Bologna bought the naming rights to Padane.\nGallery\nPadane coach on Volvo chassis\nStutz Blackhawk\nMaserati Indy\nMaserati Bora\nLiterature\nHartmut Lehbrink: Gericke\u2019s 100 - 100 Jahre Sportwagen, Gericke Holding GmbH, D\u00fcsseldorf 2002, ISBN 3-938118-00-8\nGianni Cancellieri et al.

    "Drahichyn Ghetto (\u0414\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0442\u0442\u043e) (July 1941 \u2013 October 15, 1942) was a Jewish ghetto, a place of forced relocation for the Jews of the city of Drogichin in the Brest Region during the Holocaust in Belarus under the occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany during World War II.\nOccupation of Drogichin and Establishment of the Ghetto\nIn the pre-war years, among the 3,125 residents of Drogichin, there were 1,521 Jews \u2013 about half of the population. Before the war, there were 2,675 Jews in the city. The city was captured by the Wehrmacht on June 25, 1941, and remained under occupation for over three years, until July 17, 1944.\nIn July 1941, the Germans herded all the remaining Jews in the city into the ghetto, forcing them under threat of death to sew yellow patches in the shape of stars onto the front and back of their clothing.\nConditions in the Ghetto\nThe Drogichin ghetto was located west of the bridge, bordered by Lenin, Pervomayskaya, Oktyabrskaya, and Pushkin streets. The ghetto was enclosed by a tall wooden fence with no gaps, topped with barbed wire. By the end of July 1941, the Nazis forced the Jews to organize a Judenrat. Soon, over 1,000 Jews \u2013 both local and those driven from nearby villages such as Shereshevo, Khomski, Gutovo, and others \u2013 were crammed into the ghetto, living in dreadful overcrowding with 40-50 people per house.\nThe Drogichin ghetto was soon divided into two sections, with movement between them prohibited. One section housed craftsmen, who were forced to make clothes and shoes for the Germans, along with wealthier Jews who were extorted for valuables. The other section held the infirm and poor Jews, who were the first planned for execution, and they were gradually taken away in groups for mass shootings at Bronnaya Gora.\nLiquidation of the Ghetto\nFrom late summer 1942, the Nazis, as part of Hitler's plan for the extermination of Jews, began the widespread liquidation of the last ghettos. By this time, the number of prisoners in the Drogichin ghetto had significantly decreased, as Jews whose professions were not urgently needed by the Germans, along with their wives and children, had been taken and killed at the extermination camp at Bronnaya Gora.\nBefore the complete destruction of the ghetto, the remaining Drogichin Jews were mostly shot at night near the prison, in the cemetery area in the city center. During these \u201cactions\u201d (a euphemism used by the Nazis for organized mass killings), the doomed people were tied together with barbed wire, shot, and their bodies thrown into pits. Witnesses reported that the Germans and collaborators did not finish off the wounded, but buried them alive with the dead.\nIn 1942, Jews from an agricultural settlement (officially called \u201cColony\u201d) located between the villages of Gutovo and Ogdemer were also driven into the Drogichin ghetto and killed along with the Drogichin Jews.\nThe ghetto was finally liquidated on October 15, 1942. Belarusian police under the command of SS officers, with dogs, drove the last prisoners of the ghetto, including elderly people and children, to the killing site. For the destruction of the last Drogichin Jews, a mass grave was prepared in the southern part of the town, at the \u201cDubovaya Struga\u201d area, 100 meters from the railway, near a warehouse and the railway station. The doomed were forced to undress in the warehouse, led to the edge of the pit, and shot with a machine gun. Those who tried to escape were killed by the Germans and policemen guarding the area. A total of at least 3,816 Jews were killed in this pit.\nAfter the Ghetto\u2019s Liquidation\nAfter the shootings, the Nazis forced local men and even teenagers to bury the bodies. Witnesses reported that attempts to refuse were met with threats: \u201cIf you don't want to bury the Jews, we'll bury you\u201d.\nAfter the liberation of Drogichin from German occupation, the Extraordinary State Commission found several mass graves. The largest number of bodies was found in the cemetery area near the district consumer union \u2013 3,816 bodies (895 men, 1,083 women, and 1,838 children), many with skull fractures, dislocated limbs, broken extremities and ribs, and mutilated faces. In the center of Drogichin, 150 bodies were found in 11 graves, and 250 bodies in 13 graves 300 meters from the Jewish cemetery in the \u201cZalesye\u201d area.\nOf the total number of 4,991 people killed during the three years of occupation in Drogichin and nearby areas, 3,338 were Jews \u2013 including residents of Drogichin itself, refugees, and Jews relocated to Drogichin from other ghettos.\nBefore retreating, the Germans tried to hide the traces of their crimes by forcing local peasants to exhume and burn the bodies. According to witnesses, such fires burned near the villages of Khomsk (where around 2,000 Jews were killed in August 1941 on the northern outskirts) and Gutovo. The Germans did not allow the locals to approach the burning bodies and threatened to shoot anyone who came closer. However, even after the fires, traces of ",
    "Former circular castle in Gorinchem, seat of Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy\n51\u00b049\u203237\u2033N 4\u00b058\u203227\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff51.826944\u00b0N 4.974167\u00b0E\ufeff / 51.826944; 4.974167\nView of the Blue Tower (mid 16th century)\nThe Blue Tower (Dutch: Kasteel de Blauwe Toren) was a castle with an imposing stone keep in Gorinchem, the Netherlands. It was a princely residence of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. The complex, which stood there between 1461 and 1578, gained an almost mythical status thanks in part to descriptions by the Gorinchem chronicler Abraham Kemp and the discovery of its foundations in 1983.\nIt was located at the southwestern side of the city center, at the level of the current Tolsteeg, Duivelsgracht, and Buiten de Waterpoort by the Merwede river.\nHistory\nThe Blue Tower on a map by Pieter Sluyter (1553)\n The floor plan of the Blue Tower can be recognized on a map by Jacob van Deventer (1558) \n The Blue Tower as a quadrangular tower on a view by Frans Hogenberg (around 1580)\nDutch Riverscape by a follower of Jan van Goyen (1644) with possibly the Blue Tower included\n The Blue Tower by Jacob van der Ulft (1656) \nThe Blue Tower by Jacobus Schijnvoet (1711)\nThe Blue Tower by Charles Rochussen (1854)\nPlan indicating where the location of the Blue Tower is within Gorinchem by Arie Saakes (2018)\nWillem VI of Holland\nAfter the Arkelse Wars (Dutch: Arkelse Oorlogen) (1402\u20131412), the castle of the Lords of Arkel to the east of the city center of Gorinchem was demolished. Willem VI of Holland decided to build a new castle on the southwestern side of the city. Little is known about this castle. It was built on the Merwede as part of the medieval fortress and had to withstand both sieges from the riverside and potential attacks from the city itself. For its construction, a city gate and a nearby grain mill at the southern end of Molenstraat had to be removed.\nIn 1440, Philip the Good paid the church of Gorinchem 17 Wilhelmusschilden and 5 Flemish groats because he and his predecessors, Willem V of Holland and Jacoba of Bavaria, had expropriated houses and estates. The area of the complex probably covered a significant part of the land that later served as the outer bailey of the Blue Tower.\nCharles the Bold\nIn 1461, Charles of Charolais, later known as Charles the Bold, ordered the expansion of the castle and the construction of a bridge over the Merwede. This was all because he was embroiled in a power struggle with his father, Philip the Good. Their dispute was settled again in 1465, and his ambitious plans were adjusted. Only two sturdy towers were completed. The largest was clad on the outside with Petit Granit, a moisture-resistant blue limestone, and thus got the name Blue Tower.\nMargaret of Austria\nOn the orders of Margaret of Austria (1480\u20131530), Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, construction of the distinctive roof with stepped gables began in 1522. The architect was Rombout II Keldermans, the personal architect of emperor Charles V. The construction contract was signed on 1 September 1523, by carpenters Jacob Snouc from Gorinchem and Joos Janssone de Keyser from The Hague. The stone suppliers mentioned were Michiel Yselwijns and Anthonis de Vleeshouwere. The work was completed in 1530.\nThe end\nIn 1578, the tower was demolished as it did not fit into the new fortification plans designed by Adriaan Anthonisz. The freed stones were used in the new fortifications of Gorinchem.\nVan der Aa reported that it was not until 1831 that the last remnants of the walls disappeared from sight. These remnants gave rise to a local legend about a wicked castle lady who, during times of famine, had the unpleasant habit of feasting and scrubbing her courtyard with milk until God had enough and, as punishment, caused her and the entire castle to vanish into the Duivelsgracht or Duveltjesgracht (English: Devil\u2019s Moat).\nArchitecture\nThe castle originally consisted of two floors: a ground floor that included a knight's hall above vaulted cellars, which housed the prisons. According to 17th-century records, the castle had walls 36 feet thick (approximately 11.3 meters), tapering to 29 feet (approximately 9.1 meters) at the top. From a reconstruction of the structure built atop the tower in 1524, it appears that this measurement refers to the thickness of the ring. The walls themselves were likely much thinner. The total diameter of the castle was about 46 meters at the base, narrowing to about 42 meters at the top.\nIt seems that the dimensions of the Blue Tower represented some sort of ideal measurement. Even the most famous 14th-century European princely round castles, such as the Bellver Castle (diameter approximately 45 meters) in Palma de Mallorca, dating from the first half of the 14th century, and Queenborough Castle (diameter approximately 44 meters) in Kent, built between 1361 and 1377 by King Edward III of England, had nearly the same dimensions. The Dutch historian Ruud Meischke describes the construction of the towers as a pinnacle o",

    "Kingdom in southern Africa\nThe Nkhamanga Kingdom was a pre-colonial kingdom located in the region of Malawi, specifically in the northern and central areas. The kingdom was established in the 18th century by the Chitumbuka people, a Bantu-speaking group.\nHistory\nFormation\nThe Tumbuka people originated from the Congo basin and settled in the area, where they became the leading residents. The group formed a kingdom and set up a ruling class with a king as the head. They lived in a compact area where each village was headed by one particular clan such as the Luhanga or Mkandawire clans. The Tumbuka community was recognized as a peaceful society without significant central authority or taxes. Instead, they showed their appreciation for their leaders through symbolic gestures, like offering leopard or lion skins as special tributes, reflecting their emphasis on community and mutual respect.\nBalowoka\nIn the late 18th century, a group of traders led by Kakalala Msawira Gondwe arrived in Nkhamanga from Nyamwezi, seeking to capitalize on the abundant elephant population and lucrative ivory trade. The region, known for its vast elephant herds, was dubbed \"elephant built.\" The traders, dubbed the Balowoka, meaning \"those who crossed the lake,\" had traversed Lake Malawi in dhows in 1750. They settled peacefully in the Henga valley, Hewe, and Nkhamanga, integrating into the local Tumbuka community without conflict or coercion.\nCreation of the kingdom\nThe Balowoka traders played a crucial role in the formation of the Nkhamanga State. There are two competing theories that attempt to explain how they managed to establish their political influence in the Tumbuka region. The first theory suggests that they leveraged their trading prowess to gain power, while the second theory proposes that they used military force to conquer and dominate the area. These two theories offer different perspectives on the Balowoka's rise to political authority.\nThe trade theory\nThe trade theory suggests that Mlowoka, a wealthy trader, established the Nkhamanga State through his business ventures. He formed friendships with local chiefs, exchanging goods like clothes, beads, and hoes for ivory and leopard skins. By marrying into powerful families like the Luhanga and Kumwenda, Mlowoka solidified his ties to the region and strengthened his economic influence. When his father-in-law, Mubila Luhanga, passed away, Mlowoka's son, Gonapamuhanya, ascended to the throne, cementing the Balowoka's political power. However, some historians, like Leroy Vail, disagree with this theory, viewing Mlowoka as merely a merchant seeking fortune, rather than a political leader who established a kingdom.\nThe invader theory\nHistorians Saulos Nyirenda and Cullen Young supported the theory that Mlowoka, a political leader, founded the Nkhamanga State. They argued that Mlowoka's marriages into the Luhanga and Kumwenda families enabled him to exert political influence, introducing administrative and coronation practices that fostered peace among the Tumbuka people. Mlowoka's military presence expanded the kingdom's reach, stretching from the South Rukuru River to Bisa country in the west and Lake Malawi in the east. When Mlowoka died, his son Gonapamuhanya inherited the throne, solidifying the Balowoka dynasty's grip on the region.\nMlowoka's strategies\nMlowoka's strategic gift-giving and intermarriage with the Tumbuka families of Luhanga and Kumwenda earned him their support and acceptance as a relative. He gained the people's trust through fair and generous trade practices, respecting their customs and traditions. He showed reverence for their beliefs by paying annual tribute to the Mwadandambi shrine and honoring clan heads with symbolic turbans. By distributing valuable holes (likely a valuable resource for farming or craftsmanship), he won their admiration and was hailed as Chikulamayembe, meaning \"the distributor of holes.\n",
    "Namibian football club\nFootball club\nEeshoke Chula Chula FC is a Namibian football club based in Eeshoke village near Oshikango in the Ohangwena Region which currently plays in the Namibia Premiership.\nName\nThe club's name comes from a Okutyuulwa war cry \u201cTo tyuulwa keeshoke\u201d which has been anglicized as \"chulachula\".  The village name Eeshoke derives from a species of tall, sharp grass that is common in the area.\nStadium\nEeshoke Chula Chula FC currently plays its home matches at the 8,000-seat Oshakati Independence Stadium until construction of the Eenhana Stadium in the region's capital of Eenhana is completed.\nHistory\nThe club formed informally as a small village team in 1995. It entered the Third Division in 1998. By 2001, the club had reached the Ohangwena Second Division. Between 2001 and 2013, the club bounced between the Second and Third Divisions. Chula Chula made a breakthrough in 2013, reaching the final of the Namibia FA Cup, ultimately falling 0\u20138 to Orlando Pirates. The club returned to the First Division in 2018 following an undefeated campaign in the third tier. However, financial problems and the COVID-19 pandemic caused a long absence of organized football beginning in Namibia prior to the 2019 season.\nChula Chula FC were champions of the North-East First Division when organized football returned to Namibia for the 2022/2023 season, earning promotion to the Namibia Premier Football League for the first time. Because of its popularity as the \"people's team\", the club signed a three-year sponsorship deal with PstBet worth N$1,8m per year.\nIn September 2023, the club played its first match in the top flight, securing a 2\u20131 victory over Mighty Gunners at its home Oshakati Independence Stadium. The club reported to have sold 17,275 tickets at the 8,000-seat stadium, a new league attendance record. The previous record of 7,000 spectators had stood since 2013. The club remained undefeated over the first five matches of the season and sat in fourth place in the league table at that point. During that period, Chula Chula drew 1\u20131 with reigning champions African Stars in front of a crowd of 38,000. The club continued to draw large crowds throughout the season.\nIn addition to the club's solid league play that season, Chula Chula went on to win the 9th annual Dr. Hage Geingob Cup, defeating favorites African Stars at Windhoek's Independence Stadium. In the process, Chula Chula became the first club to win the competition during its first participation.

However new data that emerged on the break of the 21st century radically changed this perception.\nIn 1958 the central directorate of KGB transferred to its Ukrainian SSR department 3,496 cases of criminal investigations against the former Tsarist officers in the Red Army carried out during 1930\u20131931, because the majority of them were related to Ukrainian SSR. However, for unknown reasons the batch included hundreds of cases concerning Moscow, Leningrad, and Voronezh\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Yaroslav Tinchenko with the help of the archivists of the Ukrainian security service got an insight into this classified information.\nHistory of the case\nWhile the mass systematic arrests started in 1930, repressions against \"former military\" began much earlier. Initially the tsarist voyenspetses were fired, demoted, or transferred to military teaching positions. Initially arrests were only occasional, but their amount gradually increased. In 1929-1930 a major purge of the military industry was carried out.\nIn addition to the Vesna case, other repressions against former tsarist officers were carried out at the same time, often overlapping with \"Vesna\", such as the \"Microbiologists\" case (\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e\n\u00ab\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432, \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u00bb).\nA major instigator of the case was leader of the Ukrainian State Political Directorate (GPU) Izrail Leplevsky, apparently supported by Yagoda. Other major Ukrainian \"chekists\" involved in the fabrication of the cases were Genrikh Lyushkov and Vsevolod Balitsky. Some others opposed the case after seeing the evidence of the fabrication in the documents. However Yagoda and Kaganovich appealed to Stalin himself, and he ordered to fire the GPU \"dissidents\".\nIn particular, several arrested gave evidence against general Tukhachevsky even during cross-examination in front of Stalin and other members of Politburo. Tukhachevsky was spared at that time, but still he was executed later, during the Great Purge.\nNotable convicts\nAmong others, arrested were \u0410.\u00a0\u0415.\u00a0\u0421\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0432, \u0410.\u00a0\u041b.\u00a0\u0420\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0444, \u0410.\u00a0\u0410.\u00a0\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0438\u043d, \u041f.\u00a0\u041f.\u00a0\u0421\u044b\u0442\u0438\u043d, \u0424.\u00a0\u0424.\u00a0\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0410.\u00a0\u0418.\u00a0\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0412.\u00a0\u0418.\u00a0\u0413\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438\u043d, \u042e.\u00a0\u041a.\u00a0\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0412.\u00a0\u0410.\u00a0\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0433\u0435, \u0412.\u00a0\u0410.\u00a0\u042f\u0431\u043b\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438\u043d, \u0415.\u00a0\u041b.\u00a0\u0421\u043b\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041d. \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0431, \u0410.\u00a0\u0410.\u00a0\u0411\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041c.\u00a0\u0414.\u00a0\u0411\u043e\u043d\u0447-\u0411\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, \u041d.\u00a0\u0410.\u00a0\u041c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0432, \u0410.\u00a0\u0415.\u00a0\u0413\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0440, \u0410.\u00a0\u0425.\u00a0\u0411\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041c.\u00a0\u0421.\u00a0\u041c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u044f\u0441\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, \u0412.\u00a0\u0424.\u00a0\u0420\u0436\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0412.\u00a0\u041d.\u00a0\u0413\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041f.\u00a0\u041c.\u00a0\u0428\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447, \u0414.\u00a0\u0414.\u00a0\u0417\u0443\u0435\u0432, \u041d.\u00a0\u0415.\u00a0\u041a\u0430\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043d, \u0418.\u00a0\u0410.\u00a0\u0422\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439.\n",

    "American architect (1898\u20131974\nTopeka High School, designed by Griest for T. W. Williamson & Company and completed in 1931.\nTheodore R. Griest FAIA (August 14, 1898 \u2013 April 19, 1974) was an American architect in practice in Topeka, Kansas from 1933 until his retirement in 1956. Griest's architectural work included Topeka's high school (1931), city hall (1940) and public library (1954). In his retirement he was involved in the City of Topeka's planning and urban renewal efforts.\nLife and career\nTheodore Reed \"Ted\" Griest was born August 14, 1898, in Cheyenne Wells, Colorado to John E. Griest and Annie Griest, n\u00e9e Campbell. He was educated at Kansas State College, graduating in 1923 with a BS in architecture. In between terms he worked for Topeka architect Thomas W. Williamson. After his graduation he briefly worked for Lowe & Bollenbacher in Chicago before returning to Williamson. In 1929\u201330 he spent a year in graduate study at Harvard University. He then returned to Williamson as chief designer. For Williamson, Griest designed the Topeka High School, completed in 1931.\nIn 1933 Griest left Williamson to open an independent office. In 1937 he formed the partnership of Griest & Coolidge with Raymond A. Coolidge, this was dissolved in 1942. In 1946 he formed a new partnership, Griest & Ekdahl, with Oscar S. Ekdahl. Griest retired from the partnership in 1956, which was continued by Ekdahl as Ekdahl, Davis & Depew. After retiring from his firm, Griest turned to consulting work, in which he would remain until his death.\nIn 1957 Griest joined the Topeka planning commission, a year after the city began a major urban renewal project, which would eliminate a largely Black neighborhood known as \"the Bottoms\" and substantially depopulate the city center. He left the commission in 1959 and in 1962 was directly employed by the city as a consultant. He was involved in the urban renewal project until 1970. At the time the project was supported by the local elite, but was rejected by neighborhood residents. No public vote was ever taken on the project.\nIn 1949, when architects in Kansas were first required to be licensed, Griest was appointed to the board charged with setting licensing rules. He served on the board until 1959. He joined the American Institute of Architects in 1935 as a member of the Kansas chapter. In 1958 he was elected a Fellow in recognition of his public service.\nPersonal life\nGriest was married in 1931 to Frances H. Crarey. He died April 19, 1974.\nArchitectural works\nFor T. W.

    "\nA legislatively referred referendum on whether the US state of Georgia should adopt the popular election of presidential electors was held on October 5, 1824, concurrently with legislative elections to the general assembly. The proposal received substantial support with 70.92% of voters supporting the change.\nUnlike the 1823 bill that authorized popular elections for governor, the bill to adopt the popular election of presidential electors for 1824 proved to be divisive as election day was only a year away.

Many of these factions were usually held together through personal friendships and family associations. The two factions at the time were the Clark faction, followers of Governor John Clark, and the Crawford faction, followers of Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford.\nDuring the 1823 legislative session, there was a growing push among grand juries and newspaper correspondents for electoral reform. This movement was supported by Clark and his party, who advocated for the popular election of both the governor and presidential electors. The legislature considered two bills regarding gubernatorial elections: one allowing the people to choose gubernatorial electors and the other permitting them to vote directly for the governor. Ultimately, the legislature chose the latter bill.\nA companion bill to adopt the popular election of presidential electors for the 1824 election proved to be more divisive as election day was only a year away.

    "19th century Orthodox priest from Bosnia and Herzegovina\nStevan Bakovi\u0107 (O\u017eegovac, 1794\u2014Sarajevo, 1893), popularly known as Prota Bakovi\u0107, was a priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church, who spent most of his ministry in Sarajevo. He is one of the most deserving people for the construction of the Cathedral in Sarajevo, whose foundations he personally consecrated. He was appreciated and respected by the people regardless of religion and ethnicity, and his death represented a great loss for the Serbian people in Sarajevo at the time. The people of Sarajevo considered him to be a man of great character and a true patriot, and a model priest for the church and the people.\nBiography\nProta Stevan Bakovi\u0107 was born in 1794 in the village of O\u017eegovac in Herzegovina, at the time Eyalet of Bosnia, in an Orthodox family, to father Prodan and mother An\u0111elija. He did not spend much time in his native village because shortly after his birth, his family moved to the village of Crljenice, which today belongs to the municipality of Pljevlja in Montenegro. After he was ten years old, around 1804, his parents took him to the Holy Trinity Monastery to begin his education, under the then Metropolitan Jeremije of Herzegovina. In 1812, Stevan married Jelka, the daughter of Trivko Zec from Fo\u010da, and decided to devote the rest of his life to a priestly vocation. The following year, he was preparing for the priestly rank, and continued to live with his wife in the monastery of the Holy Trinity.\nIn 1813, he came to Sarajevo for the first time, where on June 28 and 29, according to the old calendar, the then Metropolitan Venijamin ordained him as a priest. He served in Sarajevo for two years, after which he went to visit his relatives in Pljevlje, from where he went to Serbia, where Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 started an uprising. Prince Milo\u0161's invitation to remain active in the uprising, he refused due to a sudden illness, when he returned to the Holy Trinity Monastery, where he remained until he was healthy. He performed his priestly duties for a short time in Stolac, and then in Duvno, until around 1823, Metropolitan Vanijamin of Metropolitanate of Dabar-Bosnia appointed him permanent parish priest in Sarajevo, near the Old Church. In 1840, Bishop Amvrosije ordained him to the rank of provost. During the time of Archpriest Stevan, twelve bishops changed in the Metropolitanate of Dabar-Bosnia. In 1882, he was appointed by King Milan as an honorary member of the consistory, and Metropolitan Sava Kosanovi\u0107, the first among all protas, awarded him a pectoral cross.\nIn 1862, the foundation was laid for the construction of the Cathedral in Sarajevo, in which great merit was due to prota Bakovi\u0107.

    "Olayemi Olurin is a Bahamian-Nigerian lawyer, political commentator, writer, and abolitionist thinker. Olurin also hosts a YouTube show, \"Olurinatti The Show,\" and a podcast, \"Olay & Friends.\" She contributes to outlets like Teen Vogue and maintains her own Substack, \"Olurinatti,\" where she writes about socio-political issues.\nEarly life and education\nOlurin was born and raised in Nassau, The Bahamas, and moved to the United States in 2008 to attend high school. She experienced racism from other students at the school.\nShe holds a BA in Political Science, African American Studies, and Law, Justice & Culture from Ohio University and a JD from St. John's University School of Law in 2018.\nCareer\nFrom 2018 until 2022, Olurin worked as a public defender at The Legal Aid Society in New York City, representing those who cannot afford legal representation. In 2021, she gained significant attention by posting a video on Twitter showing an NYPD officer kneeling on one of her client's necks, which led to the charges being dismissed.\nCommentary\nOlurin is an advocate for criminal justice and prison reform, particularly emphasizing systemic issues in the legal system and the need for abolition. She has focused on issues at Rikers Island, which she describes as a pretrial detention center plagued by systemic failures and human rights abuses. She also addresses issues of systemic racism and the prison-industrial complex, frequently critiquing media misrepresentation of criminal justice matters. Her work often covers topics such as deadnaming in the transgender community.\nAs an abolitionist, she argues that the current criminal system perpetuates inequality rather than addressing crime. Mass incarceration, which she describes as akin to slavery, benefits economically but fails to enhance safety. She advocates for reallocating resources from policing and prisons to address poverty and social issues, aiming to create a more effective and equitable system over time.\nShe criticized the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict on The Hill's \"Rising\" show. She argued that the verdict undermines the modern understanding of self-defense, suggesting it is problematic for someone to bring an illegally obtained gun to a protest, act as unauthorized security, and then claim self-defense after killing people. Olurin highlighted that Rittenhouse was the only one to kill despite the protest's chaotic nature and argued that his actions incentivize violence. She contrasted this with the behavior of Black Lives Matter protesters, who maintained peace without resorting to lethal force.\nIn an op-ed, she argues that diversifying police departments alone cannot address the systemic racism and inherent violence within policing. It highlights the case of Tyre Nichols, suggesting that his killing by Black police officers underscores how systemic racism transcends individual officers' racial backgrounds. The piece contends that structural changes are needed beyond racial diversity to fundamentally reform policing practices and eliminate systemic racism and violence.\nShe wrote an opinion piece that argued Donald Trump's felony convictions should not be used as a reason to push for felon disenfranchisement. She argued a recently passed crime bill in Washington, D.C., reflected a continuation of \"tough on crime\" policies advocated by Black politicians. She has argued that more police are not the solution increases in crime and mass shootings.\nInterview with NYC Mayor Adams\nIn an interview on \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d on Power 105.1 FM with Mayor Eric Adams, Olurin challenged Adams on his administration's policies. Her Instagram posts of the interview have garnered millions of views. Adams faced intense questioning from her about his tough-on-crime policies. She challenged him on issues like Rikers Island, the migrant crisis, homelessness, and bail reform, backing her points with statistics and reports. The interview highlighted Adams's struggles with low approval ratings, a federal investigation, and a sexual assault lawsuit.\n",

    "\nThe Battle of Gudermes (December 1995) \u00a0was an battle of the First Chechen War, in which Russian armed forces regained control of Gudermes. It was characterized by large losses among the civilian population and mutual accusations of Genocide.\nPrelude\nOn July 30, 1995, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, but in December, Chechen militants declared the region's independence in an attempt to sabotage elections falsified by federal authorities. In early December, they seized the administration buildings. These actions marked a return to the hot phase of the conflict.\nThe day before, the leadership of the Russian Armed Forces announced the start of an operation to take the city, which had been under the control of Chechen militants since December 14. According to TASS, the Russian command postponed the offensive so that civilians could leave the city.\nThe Battle\nOn December 14, fierce fighting broke out. Russian troops used artillery and aerial bombardment, which destroyed most of the city. On December 19, a ground assault on the city began. The most intense fighting took place near the railway station and the local military headquarters, where 150 Russian troops were surrounded by 600 CRI fighters. By December 23, the CRI units retreated on the orders of Aslan Maskhadov and the Russian Armed Forces established control over the city.\nAftermath\nAccording to official data, the Russian side suffered more than 100 casualties as a result of the fighting. At least one Ural truck and at least two armored personnel carriers were also destroyed . According to eyewitnesses who fled the city, the number of civilian casualties is in the hundreds. According to statements by local pro-Russian authorities, the actual losses among the civilian population are much lower.\nSome of the residents who fled the city accused the rebels of looting. Many of the refugees interviewed claimed that the Russian Armed Forces were indiscriminately shelling areas where there was no fighting. Bukhari Muskhanov, 43, who was hiding with his family in a basement:Russian artillery fired from a hill near the TV tower, shelling every street. Within two days my children were sick and coughing, but every time we tried to leave the city the shooting became more intense.\nReactions\nRussian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov called the actions of the CRI Armed Forces genocide and said they were ready to sacrifice the last Chechen. Pro-Russian regional leader Doku Zavgayev justified the federal forces' actions and said Chechnya could not turn into another Afghanistan . In his opinion, the outcome was provoked by CRI fighters who had fortified themselves in the hospital, making it a military target.\nSources\nhttp://www.voinenet.ru/voina/istoriya-voiny/574.html\nhttps://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=861\n",

    "Municipal building in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, England\nHaywards Heath Town Hall is a municipal building in Boltro Road in Haywards Heath, a town in West Sussex, in England. The building accommodates the offices and meeting place of Haywards Heath Town Council.\nHistory\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with the opening of the London and Brighton Railway, a local board was established in Haywards Heath in 1872. After the local board was succeeded by Haywards Heath Urban District Council in 1894, the new council decided to commission dedicated council offices. The site it selected was on South Road, just to the east of Victoria Park. The new offices were designed in the Jacobean style, built in brick with a cement render finish and were completed in the early 20th century. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of four bays: there were round headed doorways in the outer bays, a segmental headed opening for the fire engine in the second bay, a round headed mullioned window in the third bay, and a bi-partite window in the stepped gable above.\nAfter the original offices on South Road became inadequate, the council sought larger premises. A large house, known as Oaklands on Oaklands Road, which had been built for a Brighton bookseller, Harry Treacher, in 1866, became available when a subsequent owner, a businessman, Sir James Bradford, died in April 1930. Oaklands went on to become the headquarters of the enlarged Cuckfield Urban District Council in 1934, and, following local government re-organisation in 1974, it became the headquarters of Mid Sussex District Council.\nIn the mid-1980s, Haywards Heath Town Council decided to commission its own offices and meeting place. The site they selected was on the west side of Boltro Road. The new building was designed in the Neo-Georgian style, built in red brick and was completed in 1990. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of seven bays facing onto Boltro Road. The central bay featured a portico formed by a pair of Ionic order columns supporting an entablature and a balcony with iron railings; there was a French door on the first floor. The other bays were fenestrated by casement windows. Internally, the principal rooms were the various offices for council officers, four meeting rooms, and the council chamber.\nThe building was subsequently licensed to host weddings and civil partnership ceremonies. The football manager, Matt Beard, married his partner, Debbie, there in around 2010. In August 2014, a marble plaque was installed under the portico to commemorate the life of the locally-born soldier, Sergeant Arthur George Knight of the 10th Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at the Villers-l\u00e8s-Cagnicourt during the First World War. The Princess Royal visited the town hall and met with civic officials in October 2020.\n",
    "Archaeological site in Japan\nThe Harayama Dolmen Cluster (\u539f\u5c71\u652f\u77f3\u5893\u7fa4, Harayama shisekibo-gun)  is an archaeological site with a late J\u014dmon cemetery located in the Kita-Arima neighbourhood of city of Minamishimabara, Nagasaki Prefecture Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1972. It is the oldest in Japan, along with the \u014cnodai Dolmen Cluster on the Shimabara Peninsula.\nOverview\nThe Harayama Dolmen Cluster is located  in the highlands at an elevation of about 250 meters, which extends from Mount Unzen in the southwestern part of the Shimabara Peninsula. It is a communal graveyard from the late J\u014dmon period, and archaeological excavations were carried out in parts of it in the 1950s and 1960s.  It originally consisted of three groups, but the first group was lost due to land reclamation, and only the \"third dolmen group\" and the \"second dolmen group\" remain today. The 46 remaining dolmens are made up of several supporting stones with an andesite cover stone placed on top, and a box-type stone coffin, jar coffin, or earthen pit grave underneath. Most of the box-type stone coffins are about one meter long and 50-centimeters wide, and it is believed that the bodies buried in them were buried in a crouching position rather than lying down.  About half of the dolmens have J\u014dmon pottery and stone knives from the late J\u014dmon period placed under the cover stone as grave goods.   Thirty-six dolmens and pottery from the late J\u014dmon period bearing impressions of rice grains. It is believed that rice cultivation was introduced from mainland China (Zhejiang Province) in the late J\u014dmon period, which is contemporary with these graves.\nThe site has been developed as an archaeological park. It is located about 29.2 kilometers southwest of Shimabarak\u014d Station on the Shimabara Railway Line.\nAs of 2010, 13 dolmen sites have been confirmed in Nagasaki Prefecture (including this site), and seven of these (including this site), are in the northern part of the prefecture, all of which are adjacent to alluvial plains near the coast. It has also been pointed out that there are similarities with the Ukumatsubara Dolmen Site on Ukujima island, as well as dolmen sites distributed in Saga Prefecture and Itoshima, Fukuoka, such as the Shito Dolmen Cluster. \nSee also\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Nagasaki)\n",
    "Species of lichen\nPyrenula sanguinea is a rare species of lichen belonging to the family Pyrenulaceae. This species is characterized its bright red, prominent to sessile growths on tree bark in the rainforests of Rond\u00f4nia, Brazil. What makes Pyrenula sanguinea unique are its trypethelioid ascomata\u2014structures housing the reproductive spores\u2014that are fused together, and its brown ascospores (spores) surrounded by a thick, gelatinous sheath with distinctive horn-like appendages.\nTaxonomy\nPyrenula sanguinea was formally described in 2013 by the lichenologists Marcela C\u00e1ceres, Andr\u00e9 Aptroot, and Robert L\u00fccking. The name sanguinea, meaning \"blood-red\", refers to the striking red colour of its pseudostromata, the tissue surrounding the ascomata. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Pyrenula sanguinea is closely related to Pyrenula cruenta, another species known for its bright red pigment, though they differ significantly in morphology and chemistry.\nDescription\nThe lichen features a crust-like, somewhat shiny thallus (the main lichen body) that is pale yellowish-brown, often tinged red. It grows as a flat, crusty layer on tree bark. The ascomata, or spore-producing structures, are pear-shaped and grouped together within the red pseudostromata without forming a visible outer layer. These ascomata are unique for their partly fused walls and separate, apical openings visible as black dots. The ascospores are initially transparent but soon turn brown, with three septa (divisions) and distinctive, gelatinous appendages at both ends that dissolve in a specific chemical solution.\nSeveral features characterise the morphology of this species. The pseudostromata are bright red, varying in shape, contributing to the lichen's distinctive appearance. The ascomata are immersed in pseudostromata, with fused outer walls, unique among lichens for resembling those found in genus Trypethelium. Ascospores of the species are brown, with a reduced endospore formation, and bearing long, horn-like appendages.\nChemistry\nThe lichen's chemistry is complex, with six identified anthraquinone pigments, including haematommone. These substances, responsible for the lichen's colouration, do not evaporate upon application of a potassium hydroxide solution (K+), showing a purple reaction. This chemical makeup is significant for distinguishing Pyrenula sanguinea from other lichens with similar red pigments but different chemical reactions.\nHabitat and distribution\nThis species is found on the smooth bark of trees within the primary rainforest of the Cuni\u00e3 rain forest reserve in Amazonian Rond\u00f4nia, Brazil. Its discovery at this single location suggests it may be endemic to this region, thriving in the humid, tropical environment.\nSee also\nList of Pyrenula species\n",
    "2003 studio album by Alexander von Schlippenbach\nBroomriding is an album by pianist Alexander von Schlippenbach. It was recorded on September 21, 2002, at DeutschlandRadio Berlin, and was released on CD in 2003 by Psi Records. On the album, Schlippenbach is joined by bass clarinetist Rudi Mahall, cellist Tristan Honsinger, and percussionist Paul Lovens. The recording features a seven-part suite by Schlippenbach, along with two compositions by Honsinger and two by Eric Dolphy.\nReception\nIn a review for AllMusic, Dan Warburton called the album \"a joy from start to finish,\" and wrote: \"the juxtaposition of tightly structured and freely improvised material adds depth and contrast...  Schlippenbach is obviously in his element. The whole history of the 20th century piano is in there, from Teddy Wilson to Misha Mengelberg, from Debussy to Xenakis.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings described the recording as \"an album to savour slowly,\" and stated: \"at moments this recalls nothing more than a freer and more classically aligned version of Dolphy's work with bassist/cellist Ron Carter... this release... is immaculately recorded and mastered, allowing every delicate inflection... to come through.\"\nJohn Eyles of All About Jazz commented: \"At times, this is almost chamber improv. However, although the anarchy may be controlled, it is still definitely anarchy... The Schlippenbach pieces form the backbone of the album, providing a series of concentrated free improvisations that will reveal their merits over years, not months... By contrast to these, the other compositions almost come as light relief.\" AAJ's Andrey Henkin remarked: \"this is actually an album of moods... this is avant-garde slowly and thoroughly percolated... The album as a whole can propel a listener who can then go back and assess the merit of the individual ideas presented. Certainly there are few better versions of Dolphy material extant than these.\"\nWriting for One Final Note, Jay Collins stated that the album \"focuses on 'compositions' grounded in free improv that venture into the churning, swishing, building of tensions that followers of these musicians have come to expect.\" He commented: \"The record is one for fans of loose structures and/or Schlippenbach's work in general... it is a fine opportunity to check out what Schlippenbach has been up to lately.\"\nTrack listing\n\"Broomriding 1\" (Alexander von Schlippenbach) \u2013 9:05\n\"Straight Up and Down\" (Eric Dolphy) \u2013 4:14\n\"Broomriding 2\" (Alexander von Schlippenbach) \u2013 8:10\n\"Broomriding 3\" (Alexander von Schlippenbach) \u2013 6:15\n\"Poetica\" (Tristan Honsinger) \u2013 4:54\n\"Broomriding 4\" (Alexander von Schlippenbach) \u2013 4:18\n\"Broomriding 5\" (Alexander von Schlippenbach) \u2013 7:29\n\"Attya\" (Tristan Honsinger) \u2013 4:27\n\"Broomriding 6\" (Alexander von Schlippenbach) \u2013 8:23\n\"Broomriding 7\" (Alexander von Schlippenbach) \u2013 5:52\n\"Something Sweet, Something Tender\" (Eric Dolphy) \u2013 4:28\nPersonnel\nAlexander von Schlippenbach \u2013 piano\nRudi Mahall \u2013 bass clarinet\nTristan Honsinger \u2013 cello\nPaul Lovens \u2013 percussion\n",
    "Species of lichen\nUmbilicaria nodulospora is a species of foliose lichen in the family Umbilicariaceae, discovered on steep rock faces of old lava flows in California and Oregon, USA. This species is distinguished by the unique shape of its ascospores and its DNA sequence, which does not closely relate to any known species within its family.\nTaxonomy\nThe species was formally described in 2014 by Bruce McCune, Joseph Di Meglio, and Marc J. Curtis, following DNA analysis and detailed study of its unique spore morphology. The molecular phylogenetics analysis involved the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) of ribosomal DNA, confirming its distinctiveness but not identifying any close relatives within the Umbilicariaceae.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Umbilicaria nodulospora is either monophyllous (single-leafed) or polyphyllous (multiple leaves), growing up to 2\u20133\u00a0cm (0.8\u20131.2\u00a0in) in diameter and about 0.2\u00a0mm thick, excluding the rhizines. It features a brown to gray-brown upper surface that is faintly to distinctly pruinose (powdery), creating a grayish effect especially near the central attachment point (umbo). The texture is smooth to broadly cracked in a network pattern (reticulation), facilitating the thallus splitting into partial thalli. The edges may be whole to irregularly torn or lobed.\nThe lower surface varies from brown to black, often covered with a dense mat of rhizines\u2014hair-like growths that anchor the lichen to its substrate. These rhizines can be parallel or entangled, contributing to a mat that is 1\u20132\u00a0mm thick. The apothecia (fruiting bodies) are black, sessile (directly attached), and can be up to 2\u00a0mm in diameter, typically showing a gyrose (brain-like) surface. The spores are simple and hyaline (translucent), and characterized by having one or two blunt, shallow knobs at one end, giving them a T, Y, or L shape.\nHabitat and distribution\nUmbilicaria nodulospora is known from geologically recent flood basalts in central Oregon to northeastern California. It inhabits steeply inclined surfaces of these basalt flows, typically found in cooler, north-facing areas. The specific ecological adaptations that allow it to thrive in such niches are not fully understood, though its occurrence on basalt is a key aspect of its habitat preference.\n",

In 2005, he was appointed assistant professor at the University of Washington in Comparative History of Ideas and History, later assuming the role of associate professor in 2008 and has been serving as Professor since 2018.\nThurtle served as Director of the Comparative History of Ideas program from 2010 to 2013, followed by acting director from 2016 to 2017.\nResearch\nThurtle has contributed to the fields of history of science and technology and molecular immunology by investigating genetic thinking, the influence of information on the body, and the impact of graphic design on biological understanding and societal beliefs. His book, The Emergence of Genetic Rationality: Space, Time, and Information in American Biological Science, 1870\u20131920, explored the transformations required to enable genetic thinking, incorporating insights from social theory, media theory, and intellectual history, and was called a \"fascinating and wide-ranging book\" by academic Michael Dietrich. He co-edited two books with Robert Mitchell focusing on how information reshapes the human body: Semiotic Flesh: Information and the Human Body and Data Made Flesh: Embodying Information as well as co-authored an interactive DVD Biofutures: Owning Body Parts and Information with Mitchell and Helen J. Burgess. In a review for the MIT Press,  Eugene Thacker stated, \"Data Made Flesh is interesting because I believe it asks us to begin to think beyond the phenomenological and anthropomorphic vantage point of \"embodiment.\"\"\nIn 2018, Thurtle authored Biology in the Grid: Graphic Design and the Envisioning of Life, examining how evolutionary and developmental biology research, as well as popular culture, depict cellular and cultural transformations. Amy Ione remarked, \"It impressively conveys how contemporary tools that capture motion have altered traditional distinctions between time, space, linearity, and so forth.\"\nThurtle's publications have also addressed topics such as superheroes and embodiment, biofeedback in music, the naturalist and eugenicist David Starr Jordan, and the plant hybridizer Luther Burbank. Together with Adam Nocek, he edited a special issue of Inflexions titled \"Animating Biophilosophy,\" which looked into the changing relationship between thought and life in the late twentieth century. In another collaborative study, he argued that superhero comic books act as a \"logic of the anomalous,\" allowing readers to explore societal anomalies and extreme experiences, connecting political economy, media theory, and science and technology studies. His research also showed how Gilded Age trotting horse breeders' practices influenced the development of genetic reasoning in the U.S., linking industrial growth to the rise of eugenic and genetic research.\nAwards and honors\n2013 \u2013 Distinguished Teaching Award, University of Washington\n2015, 2018 \u2013 Digital Humanities Fellowship, Walter Chapin Simpson Center for the Hum",
    "Seminary school in Palermo, Sicily, Italy\nThe Arb\u00ebresh Seminary of Palermo, also known as the Italo-Albanian Seminary (Italian: Seminario Italo-Albanese di Palermo), was an important educational and cultural center for the Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb Albanian community in Sicily. The Seminary is situated in the historic center of Palermo, facing the magnificent post office building, between a street of the same name (Via Seminario Italo-Albanese) and Piazza Padre Giorgio Guzzetta.Monument to P. Giorgio Guzzetta, created by Ignazio Marabitti, at the Italo-Albanian Eparchial Seminary in Piana degli Albanesi, originating from the former Italo-Albanian Seminary of Palermo\nFounded in Palermo in 1734 by Father Gjergj Guxeta, Apostle of the Arb\u00ebresh in Sicily and one of the foremost intellectuals of the Arb\u00ebresh in the 18th century, the Seminary has for centuries been a bastion for preserving the Albanian language, culture, and traditions; It nurtured many intellectuals, priests, monks, distinguished bishops, writers, and renowned poets who also contributed to Albania, their homeland. Since 1950, due to significant damage caused by American bombings of Palermo during World War II, its headquarters officially relocated to Piana degli Albanesi. The Seminary's premises, owned by the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church, have been modernized and leased to the Italian state as a school.\nHistory\nDuring the pontificate of Pope Clement XI (1700\u20131721), of Albanian origin, and Clement XII (1730\u20131740), there was a renewed interest from the Holy See in the Byzantine Christian tradition, which manifested in the founding of the \"Collegio Corsini\" of Saint Benedict (San Benedetto Ullano, 1732) in Kozenx\u00eb (later transferred in 1794 to Saint Demetrius of Coron\u00eb, known as \"Collegio San Adriano\" for the Arb\u00ebresh communities of the Byzantine rite in Calabria), and the establishment of the Arb\u00ebresh Seminary of Palermo (1734) for the communities of Sicily.The Historical Via Seminario Italo-Albanese, named after the seminary, in central Palermo\nThe Arb\u00ebresh Seminary of Palermo was founded by Father Gjergj Guxeta (Italian: Padre Giorgio Guzzetta). This institution had the duty of welcoming and educating young people from the Arb\u00ebresh communities of the Byzantine rite present in Sicily. The Seminary thus became the most important religious and cultural center for the education - according to the Eastern Byzantine rite - of young generations of Arb\u00ebresh priests for their colonies in Sicily.\nFather Gjergji Guxeta was the first rector of this center, serving for approximately ten years. He was succeeded by the priest Papa Pjet\u00ebr d'Andrea from Himara, who in 1746 was appointed chaplain of the parish church of the Seminary of \"Sh\u00ebn Kollit\" (San Nicol\u00f2 \"dei Greci\"), until his death on October 17 of the same year.\nFollowing a valued collaboration from the early days of the same seminary, Father Guzzetta appointed Father Pal Maria Parrino (1710\u20131765) from Pallaci (Palazzo Adriano) as vice-rector in 1739, and in 1752 as rector of the Seminary he established in Palermo. After Guzzetta's tenure, Parrino became the second rector of the Italo-Albanian Seminary, a position he held from 1746 until 1765. He was assisted by Father Vasili Stasi (Italian: Basilio Stassi) from Piana degli Albanesi and Father Melchiorre Masi from Munxifsi (Mezzojuso).\n",
    "Military unit\nInternal Defense Forces (Polish: Wojska Obrony Wewn\u0119trznej) was one of the types of troops of the Polish People's Army.\nHistory\nIn 1965, on the basis of the Internal Security Corps units which were handed over from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of National Defence, a new type of troops was created - the Internal Defense Forces. After reorganization, they became part of the National Territorial Defense forces.\nInternal Defense Forces wore a khaki uniform of the Army and a navy blue cap rim. Hats with feathers and capes related to the regional costume of the Podhale people were received by the 5th Podhale Brigade of the Internal Defense Forces.\nIn 1965, the disbanding Internal Security Corps transferred three brigades, eight motorized regiments, a tank regiment, a pontoon and bridge regiment, two engineering battalions, a communications regiment and a communications battalion to the Ministry of National Defense. On the basis of these units, four groups of units of the Internal Defense Forces were created: security for the State Defense Committee and Provincial Defense Committees (protection and communication units), land defense of the country's territory (to combat enemy landings and sabotage groups), security for the regrouping of troops (pontoon-bridge units and traffic regulation). In the event of a threat, Internal Defense Forces were also supposed to provide assistance to the Ministry of Internal Affairs bodies in maintaining public order and security. In December 1976, the Internal Defense Forces Command was dissolved, and its subordinate units were subordinated to the commanders of the Military Districts (Polish: Wojew\u00f3dzki sztab wojskowy).\nThe Internal Defense Forces, which totaled 65,000 troops in 1982, were equipped as mechanized infantry units, including tanks. The component units, which were organized at district level, had the missions of engaging hostile troops on Polish territory and eliminating local underground elements. The units were to receive the same individual training as regular ground forces, although they did not participate in large-scale coordinated exercises.\nThe Internal Defense Forces existed until 1989, when they were disbanded as part of the reduction of the Polish People's Army. Some units were transformed into security regiments, some were subordinated to the commander of the Vistula Military Units.\nOrganization and structure\nThe Internal Defense Forces of the Territorial Defense Forces were divided into the following units:\nSecurity units of the State Defense Committee (Polish: Jednostki zabezpieczenia Komitetu Obrony Kraju) - three brigades and two regiments of Internal Defense Forces., one regiment and four communications battalions\nSecurity units of the Voivodeship Defense Committees (Polish: Jednostki zabezpieczenia Wojew\u00f3dzkich Komitet\u00f3w Obrony) - sixteen communications companies\nLand defense units (Polish: Jednostki obrony l\u0105dowej) \u2013 four Internal Defense Forces regiments.

    "Bridge in Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi\nKendari Bay Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge located in Kendari City, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. It spans Kendari Bay, connecting Kendari District with Abeli District on the south side of the bay. This bridge was constructed by PP Construction & Investment and Nindya Karya, and was inaugurated by President Joko Widodo on October 22, 2020. The bridge is claimed to reduce travel time from the Old Town area of Kendari on the north side to the southern areas of Kendari, such as Bungkutoko Port and Poasia District, from approximately 25\u201330 minutes to 3\u20135 minutes.\nHistory\nBefore this bridge existed, residents had to travel around Kendari Bay from Kendari District on the north side (historically part of the Old Town area) to Abeli District on the south side, and vice versa. The only shortcut was by using a boat taxi service called \"papalimbang\". The Kendari Bay Bridge was initiated by Southeast Sulawesi Governor Nur Alam during his second term from 2008 to 2017, with the motto \"Building Community Welfare\" (Bahteramas). The construction of the bridge began with a groundbreaking ceremony on August 19, 2016. PP Construction & Investment and Nindya Karya served as the contractors, under the responsibility of the National Road Implementation Center XXI Kendari, Directorate General of Highways, Ministry of Public Works and Housing. The construction cost, sourced from the state budget (APBN), amounted to IDR 804 billion through a multi-year contract scheme from 2015 to 2020.\nDesign\nThe Kendari Bay Bridge is located on the shortest side of Kendari Bay, the eastern side. The bridge comprises an approach road of 602.5 meters, an approach span of 357.7 meters, a side span of 180 meters, and a main span of 200 meters. The bridge's width is 20 meters, featuring four traffic lanes, a median, and sidewalks. With a total length of 1,348 meters (approximately 1.35 kilometers), this bridge is the third longest sea-crossing bridge in Indonesia, following the Bali Mandara Toll Road in Bali (12.7 kilometers) and the Suramadu Bridge in East Java (5.4 kilometers), surpassing the Merah Putih Bridge in Maluku (1.1 kilometers).\nEach pillar of the bridge bears the inscriptions \"Indonesia Maju,\" \"Kendari Bay Bridge,\" and \"Southeast Sulawesi.\" \"Indonesia Maju\" refers to the name and slogan of President Joko Widodo's second administration, while the other inscriptions identify the bridge and its location. Additionally, each pillar features symbols representing the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing, the province of Southeast Sulawesi, and the two contractors.\n",

Portrait c. 1644 by Robert Walker (1599\u20131658), collection of National Trust, Killerton House\nSir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet of Colum John\nThe Acland Baronetcy, of Colum John (modern: Columbjohn, near Broadclyst) in the County of Devon, was created in the Baronetage of England on 24 June 1644 for John Acland, a supporter of Charles I. The letters patent were then lost in the confusion of the Civil War. \nHe was succeeded by his son, the 2nd Baronet; he died as a minor and was succeeded by his younger brother, the 3rd Baronet. On his death the title passed to his son, the 4th Baronet. He also died young and was succeeded by his uncle, the 5th Baronet, who on 21 January 1678 he was granted new letters patent, confirming him in the title, with the precedence of 1644. Acland later represented Barnstaple and Tiverton in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his grandson, the 6th Baronet, who sat as Member of Parliament for Barnstaple. When he died the title passed to his son, the s7th th Baronet, who married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Dyke and built Killerton House as the family seat. He represented Devon and Somerset in Parliament.\nHe was succeeded by his grandson, the 8th Baronet; he died as a child and was succeeded by his uncle, the 9th Baronet. When he died the title passed to his eldest son, the 10th Baronet, a politician. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the 11th Baronet, also a prominent politician as well as an advocate of educational reforms. On his death the title passed to his eldest son, the 12th Baronet, a Liberal politician who held minor ministerial office under William Ewart Gladstone. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the 13th Baronet, again a Liberal politician who like his elder brother held minor ministerial office. His eldest son, the 14th Baronet, was another Liberal politician and served as Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. On his death the title passed to his eldest son, the 15th Baronet. He was one of the founder members of the socialist Common Wealth Party. As of 2024 the title is held by his grandson, the 17th Baronet, who succeeded his father in 2009.\nAcland baronets of Columb John (1644)\nSir John Acland, 1st Baronet (c. 1591 \u2013 1647), English landowner, was the only son of Arthur Acland. Pricked High Sheriff of Devon in 1641, he fought as a Royalist during the English Civil War. He was created a baronet for his service in 1644, but the letters patent were either lost or did not pass the seals; a new grant was made in 1677/8 to the 5th Baronet confirming the 1644 creation. He surrendered to the Parliamentarians when Thomas Fairfax captured Exeter in 1646 and composed for his estate.

    "\nJerome Michael Sage, who mostly went by the name Jerry M. Sage, was a Canadian-born American soldier, special forces operator, and spy, prisoner of war during World War II. He was notable for over 15 prison escape attempts leading to 15 sentences in solitary confinement, earning him the name \"Cooler King,\" until his final successful escape. Sage was the inspiration for Steve McQueen's character in The Great Escape. Sage stayed in the Army and also fought in the Korean War and Vietnam War.  He is considered one of the fathers of United States Army Special Forces.  One of the phases of the schoolhouse for special operators at Fort Liberty, the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, is named Robin Sage, partially in his memory. \nEarly life\nSage was born 1917 in British Columbia and grew up mostly in Indianapolis, Indiana, playing football and going to house parties while he was in high school. \nSage entered the Army in 1938 through the R.O.T.C. program of Washington State University, where he graduated with a Phi Beta Kappa key.  He graduated with a commission into the Infantry in the Army Reserves. \nAfter college, he worked for three and a half years at Proctor and Gamble Distributing Company. Before entering the Army, he was the senior salesman for the middle Pacific region; Northern California, San Francisco, and Hawaii.\nHe first reported to active duty with the Army at the Presidio of San Francisco a little before Thanksgiving of 1941. For a few weeks, he worked in the field bakery platoon.\nWorld War II\nWild Bill and the 'Glorious Amateurs'\nIn December 1941, with the attack on Pearl Harbor, Sage was transferred to Fort Lewis, Washington, to prepare for deployment to the Pacific against the Japanese. He trained his bakery platoon in fighting infantry tactics, but within a few weeks, he received orders to report to the Q Building at the E Street Complex in Washington, D.C.\nSage was recruited into an organization run by William J. \"Wild Bill\" Donovan called the Office of the Coordinator of Information, which was the precursor to the Office of Strategic Services.  He was one the first men from the Special Operations Branch selected by Millard Preston Goodfellow, David K. E. Bruce, and Garland H. Williams to attend a training camp set up by the British Special Operations Executive outside of Toronto, Canada called Camp X.  There, he learned the British methods of sabotage, reconnaissance, guerrilla warfare, underwater and amphibious assault, trailing suspects, and managing networks. \nThe British gave him the nickname \"Dagger,\" which he carried for the rest of his career. \nSage taught physical training to the new recruits of the Office of the Coordinator of Information, which later became the Office of Strategic Services. \nSage was deployed to colonial North Africa against the Germans and Italians as a member of the OSS, where he was captured by the Germans. \nStalag Luft III\nSage was taken to the prison camp Stalag Luft III, where he passed himself off as an airborne infantry officer, never revealing his membership in the OSS - had he done so, he would have been executed. \nSage unsuccessfully attempted to escape 15 times, leading to 15 separate incarcerations in solitary confinment in \"the cooler,\" giving him the nickname \"Cooler King.\" His most famous attempt was as a part of the \"Great Escape,\" where he and many others worked for 15 months on the significant three-tunnel project.\nActor Steve McQueen portrayed a character based on Jerry and a mixture of other men in the movie, The Great Escape.\nEscape from Oflag 64\nSage was eventually transferred to the prison camp called Oflag 64, where he finally managed his escape - through Poland, into Ukraine down to Odessa, and then finally back into the custody of the OSS in Egypt 1945. \nAfter War II\nSage became an instructor at West Point, attended the Command and General Staff College, and the War College.\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis, he served as a Staff Officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.\nHe worked in Laos and trained with Montagnards in the highlands.\nAs a Colonel, Sage was assigned to Bad Tolz, Germany, where he commanded the 10th Special Forces Group.\nSage outlived both of his children. Sage's son, Terrence F. Sage, died serving the Army as a Captain during the Tet Offensive in Vietnam in 1968.  Sage's daughter Barbara Ellen Bussard died in 1975.\nFollowing that, he served with the Third Army in Atlanta and worked with Army ROTC programs at colleges and universities throughout the South. He later became Assistant to the President of the University of South Carolina in Columbia, S.C.\nAfter a few years, he left to teach high school in the public school system and was nominated for and won \"Teacher of the Year\" for the state of South Carolina in 1979. In Enterprise, Ala., he was nominated for and won Enterprise Man of the Year in 1991.\nLater life\nSage retired from the Army on March 1, 1972, after 30 years of service.\nHe died of canc",
    "Creole language spoken in Indonesia\nFor the Malayo-Polynesian language used by the Gorontalo native people, see Gorontalo language.\nGorontalo Malay, also known as Gorontalo Indonesian, in Gorontalo language it is called Mobisala Molayu, is a Malay-based creole language spoken by the majority of the Gorontalo people in the Minahasa Peninsula region, especially in Gorontalo, as well as in Buol Regency, Central Sulawesi.\nBased on its grammatical characteristics, Gorontalo Malay is classified as Malay trade and creole languages. In general, the Gorontalo Malay functions as lingua franca in Gorontalo and the surrounding area, including several areas in the northern part of Tomini Bay which are also inhabited by the Gorontalo people.\nThe influence of Arabic language is very visible in Gorontalo Malay. This can be seen from several Arabic vocabularies that have been absorbed into Gorontalo Malay, for example the word ana \u0623\u0646\u0627 as the first person singular pronoun (me), and ente \u0623\u0646\u062a as the second person singular pronoun (you).\nHistory\nGorontalo Malay initially developed in the coastal region of Gorontalo, especially in port cities, then gained influence from languages of Arabic, Dutch, Ternate Malay, and was mainly based on Manado Malay, and Gorontalo language as mother tongue of the people. Gorontalo Malay also has several similarities with Ternate Malay in terms of vocabulary and grammar, something that is also found in other Eastern Indonesia Malay varieties. One of the differences between Gorontalo Malay and other Eastern Indonesia Malay languages is the pronunciation intonation used, this is very influenced by the Gorontalo language.\nPronouns\nGorontalo Malay has pronouns which are mainly based on Manadoic Malay languages (Manado Malay and Ternate Malay).\nPersonal pronouns\nThere are several foreign language borrowings of personal pronouns in Gorontalo Malay, especially from Arabic language.\nPossessive pronouns\nGorontalo Malay uses the parenthetical word pe to express ownership.\nPhonology\nIn some verbs and nouns in standard Malay that use the letter , there is a change in the pronunciation of vowel phonemes which is influenced by speech in Gorontalo language, so in Gorontalo Malay the pronunciation will change to the letter , for example bolajar 'belajar' (study), posawat 'pesawat' (aircraft), moncuci 'mencuci' (wash), and also has an influence on the pronunciation of the word \"Melayu\" (Malay) itself as Molayu.\nSee also\nLanguage portalIndonesia portal\nManado Malay\nNorth Moluccan Malay\nMalay trade and creole languages\n",
    "German photographer\nMartin Rosswog (born 31 May 1950 in Bergisch Gladbach) is a German photographer. He is associated with the D\u00fcsseldorf School of Photography, as a student of Bernd Becher. He lives and works in Lindlar.\nEarly career\nAfter studying social education during the first half of the 1970s, he worked freelance as a media educator and photographer, from 1977 to 1981. Rosswog studied supervision from 1980 to 1982, in Kassel. He afterwards went to study photography at the D\u00fcsseldorf Art Academy, in 1982. After his undergraduate studies, he attended Bernd Becher's class, since 1983. He completed his studies in 1987 as a master student of Becher.\nWork\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Martin Rosswog created an extensive group of photographic portraits following August Sander's systematics. Inspired by Bernd Becher, towards the end of his studies he portrayed former miners from the disused Zollern II/IV mine in text and images. Rosswog continued to follow the documentary practice of his masters Bernd and Hilla Becher.\nIn 1989, Rosswog began a large-scale documentary work on the interiors of traditional European rural homes. Rosswog systematically took photographs in many countries, including Ireland, Great Britain, Russia, Finland, Romania, and Hungary. These photographs document traditional forms of housing that give an impression of pre-industrial life and living in the countryside, as well as their current development facing social changes. At the same time, they document interior furnishings and room decorations that have since often disappeared. Rosswog photographs both in black and white and in color. He almost exclusively uses large-format cameras. In this way, he avoids the sense of artificiality caused by unnatural light and underlines the documentary character of his work, which can be classified as social documentary photography.\nIn addition to these works, which have been reproduced in several publications, Rosswog also takes photographs of the exterior views and the surroundings of the interior spaces that he documents. For example, in 2003 and 2004 he photographed the changes taking place in the village of Vurpar (Burgberg) in Transylvania, Romania, as a result of the departure of the Transylvanian Saxons.\nExhibitions\n1990 Oberbergisches Museum Schloss Homburg, N\u00fcmbrecht\n1994 Edgar Faure Gallery, Paris\n1996 Hungarian National Museum, Budapest\n1998 Hof Art Association, Hof/Bavaria\n2000 Municipal Gallery, Plovdiv, Bulgaria\n2002 Danube Swabian Central Museum Ulm\n2005 Retrospective.

    "1386 treaty in Denmark\nThe Treaty of Nyborg (Danish: Freden i Nyborg, German: Vertrag von Nyborg), also known as the Meeting at Nyborg (Danish: M\u00f8det i Nyborg), was a peace treaty between Queen Margaret I of Denmark and the German dukes, Henry II and Nicholas I, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg on a territorial and successional dispute in Schleswig. The treaty was signed during a meeting in Nyborg on Funen on 15 August 1386 and stated that the Holsteinians were to hold the Duchy of Schleswig for eternity.\nBackground\nIn 1375, Schleswig was roughly split between Henry, Duke of Schleswig in the North, and the Counts of Holstein-Rendsburg, Henry II and Nicholas I in the South. However, after the death of Duke Henry of Schleswig the same year, the northern part of Schleswig laid open to Holsteinian invasion. Queen Margaret, who was the de facto leader of Denmark and Norway, was unable to secure Denmark's southern border since she had all her resources and attention elsewhere. Subsequently, the two dukes invaded Northern Schleswig, quickly taking the island of Als and the two towns of Haderslev and T\u00f8nder. The occupation would only be officially confirmed by Denmark years later in 1386, when the two parties would meet at Nyborg.\nTreaty and Stipulations\nAt Nyborg, King Oluf and Margaret would grant the Duchy of Schleswig to the sons of Henry II of Holstein-Rendsburg, who had died earlier in the year, and Oluf and Margaret would concurrently reconcile with Count Nicholas I. The German, Presbyter Bremensis, would give a detailed description of the stipulations in his Chronicon Holtzatiae:\nThe Holsteinians were to Hereditary hold the Duchy of Schleswig for eternity.\nA man of the count's family would always be lord and Duke of Schleswig.\nBoth sides were not to permit any rivalry.\nThe castle of Tranek\u00e6r on Lolland was to be held by the Danish King for three years, during which period the Holsteinians would rule the Frisians. After three years, the situation could remain unchanged, or, if both parties agreed, they could exchange roles.\nIf war occurred, both were to aid each other against the enemies if requested.\nAftermath\nMargaret would, however, invade Schleswig in 1404 after the death of Count Gerhard VI. Here, Margaret would spend much of the rest of her life combatting the Holsteinians, and it would also be here, specifically in Flensburg, where she would die presumeable from the Bubonic plague.\nSee also\nTreaty of Stralsund (1370)\u00a0\u2013 1370 peace treaty between Denmark and the Hanseatic League\nHolstein-Pinneberg\u00a0\u2013 countshipPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallbackPages displaying short descriptions with no spaces\nSiege of Kolding (1368\u20131369)\u00a0\u2013 Siege in Denmark, 1369\nBattle of Nonnebjerg\u00a0\u2013 1340 battle in Denmark\n",
    "2012 book by Gordon L. Clark, Kendra Strauss, and Janelle Knox-Hayes\nSaving for Retirement: Intention, Context, and Behavior is a 2012 book by Gordon L. Clark, Kendra Strauss, and Janelle Knox-Hayes. The book explores the evolving landscape of retirement savings, focusing on the increasing responsibility placed on individuals as governments and employers reduce their roles in providing retirement income. The authors delve into the behavioral revolution in financial decision-making, considering how social identity and societal resources influence savings behavior. Using UK databases, the book presents empirical evidence to support an integrated approach to financial decision-making and advocates for the rethinking of individual behavior and the design of retirement income systems.\nSummary\nThe book studies how individuals navigate the complexities of saving for retirement in the modern financial landscape. This book situates its analysis within the broader context of the financial crisis and the subsequent economic, political, and social challenges that have influenced the retirement saving environment.\nAs developed economies face the repercussions of financial globalization, marked by significant private and public debt accumulation and misjudgments within the financial industry, the authors delve into the implications for retirement savings. The transition from defined benefit (DB) schemes to defined contribution (DC) schemes has shifted the risk from firms and the state to individual households, a shift exacerbated by aging populations and the strain on state-sponsored pension provisions.\nThe book emphasizes the critical need to move beyond traditional rational choice models by integrating insights from social psychology and behavioral economics. It highlights how variables such as social backgrounds, geographic locations, gender, and cultural contexts influence individuals' investment decisions and risk profiles. By mapping out these factors, the authors reveal distinct regional risk cultures and social stratifications that affect retirement saving behaviors.\nIn Chapters 1 and 2, the authors provide an introduction to the different concepts, debates, and literature surrounding retirement savings. Empirical analysis forms the core of the book from Chapters 3 to 7, utilizing a representative survey of DC participants to investigate various retirement saving methods, including asset allocation, housing, and annuities. The study identifies two archetypes of investors: the naive investor, who lacks a comprehensive understanding of financial information and global market instability, and the sophisticated investor, who critically evaluates financial data and comprehends market volatility. The predominance of naive investors underscores the necessity for state programs and financial firms to guide individuals toward effective retirement planning.\nIn Chapter 8, the authors introduce the concept of \"new paternalism\", illustrating the crucial role of private and public agents in assisting individuals to make sound investment choices. They stressed how this guidance is imperative in a DC-dominated environment where information asymmetry between institutional investors and individuals is significant.\nThe book primarily focuses on the UK, but it raises pertinent questions about how different ecologies of finance might vary across capitalist economies.\nReviews\nAdam D. Dixon, from the University of Bristol, praised the book for its significant contribution to understanding retirement savings and financial decision-making within the framework of economic and social geography. Dixon highlighted the book's timely critique of the behavioral revolution in social sciences, noting its relevance in demonstrating how individual context (such as cultural, societal, and environmental factors) profoundly shapes decision-making over the life course. He commended the authors for challenging the reliance on universal models of human behavior and stressing the importance of considering diverse sociodemographic characteristics in financial planning policies. Dixon also underscored the book's policy relevance and its engagement with broader social science and policy communities on critical economic issues.\nAlan Shipman, from the Open University, commended the book for its insightful empirical research into retirement saving behaviors. Shipman appreciated the authors' challenge to the conventional wisdom of behavioral economics, stressing the importance of social context and demographic factors in financial decision-making. He underscored the thorough examination of risk aversion and the varying influences on retirement planning across different socio-economic groups. Shipman viewed the book's critique of \"libertarian paternalist\" approaches and its call for more collectively managed retirement systems as significant contributions to the discourse on pension policy and financial education.\nRodrigo Fernandez, from the University of Amsterd",
    "1860s coastal artillery gun by Krupp\nThe 15\u00a0cm Ring Kanone L/22 or Kurze 15\u00a0cm Ring Kanone was a 15\u00a0cm 22 caliber long Krupp Ring Kanone (RK). It was a rifled breech loader built-up gun with a Krupp cylindroprismatic sliding breech. It was designed based on the idea that for penetrating armor, it was more effective to increase the charge than to increase the caliber. There were two models: The original model with 24 wedge grooves and the later model with 36 parallel grooves.\nContext\nIncreasing the charge\nMain article: 15 cm RK L/26\nThe early 1860s saw an arms race between guns and armor, which led to a steady increase in the caliber of guns. In 1867, the Prussian Artillery Test Commission then got the idea that instead of constantly increasing the caliber of guns, it might be more efficient to increase the charge. The commission made some proposals which were not approved.\nThe Aptirte 15 cm Marine Kanone\nMeanwhile, the Prussian Navy had a 15\u00a0cm gun with double wedge breech and a weight of 60\u00a0Zentners (3,000\u00a0kg)  changed for increased charge. This was called the 'Aptirte 15\u00a0cm Marine Kanone'. In detail, it was a massive cast steel breechloader of 3050\u00a0kg including the double wedge breech block. The length of bore was 2,084\u00a0mm. There were 24 grooves with a twist length of 63.2 calibers or 9.42\u00a0m.\nThis gun was tested in Fall 1868. The results were surprising. This 15\u00a0cm proved able to penetrate 127\u00a0mm of armor at 150\u00a0m. The Artillery Test Commission then made its proposal that led to the 15\u00a0cm RK L/26.\nThe 15 cm Ring Kanone L/22 c/69\nThe original 15 cm RK L/22 c/69\nWhen the Artillery Test Commission made its proposal in November 1868, Krupp had already made some short 15\u00a0cm Ring Kanonen for the Navy. These were only 3,270\u00a0mm long and had 30 wedge grooves with a twist length of 68 calibers. The gun used a charge of 6\u00a0kg. At the time these were called kurzer Ring 24pfdr. c/69 125\" (70Ztr. schwer). This meant: caliber 15\u00a0cm, constructed in 1869, 3.270\u00a0m long and weighing 3,500\u00a0kg.\nIn August 1871, the kurzer Ring 24pfdr. c/69 125\" (70Ztr. schwer) would become the kurze 15\u00a0cm Marine Ring Kanone. In 1885 it and the later model became the 15\u00a0cm Ring Kanone L/22. Another early name for the gun was 'kurzes 15\u00a0cm Marine-Ring' (Rohr).\nIn late 1869, The Artillery Test Commission determined that the kurze 15\u00a0cm Marine Ring Kanone would use the standard grenade Langgranate of the army's short 15\u00a0cm siege gun. All the guns designed in 1869 (c/69) had driving bands of thin soft lead. This sufficed up to a velocity of 420\u00a0m/s and a faster rotation than used in the contemporary field and fortification artillery.\nIn Winter 1869/70 the short 15\u00a0cm navy gun was tested. It fired projectiles with a velocity of 441\u00a0m/s, and was very inaccurate. The projectiles that had been fired showed damage to the driving bands. These tests were stopped by the Franco-Prussian War. In 1870 most of the guns that were under test were sent to Wilhelmshafen.\nLater in 1871, the tests with the short 15\u00a0cm navy gun were resumed. In Winter 1871/2, the 15\u00a0cm RK L/26 joined these tests. The results were disappointing. The Artillery Test Commission then proposed to use hard lead like the new army artillery did. The navy proposed copper driving bands.\nExperiments\nIn 1868, Krupp's Ring Kanone system had proven itself superior over the British rifled muzzleloaders. However, the British manufacturers then improved the performance of their guns by introducing pebble gunpowder. In order to stay ahead, Krupp wanted to find the best combination of the kind of gunpowder to use, the kind of grooves and twist length of the gun, and the kind of driving bands on the projectiles. These matters were intertwined.\nIn early 1872 the navy then wrote to the Artillery Test Commission that it wanted to go along with some Krupp proposals. The 15\u00a0cm gun would be the best option to test rifling choices and driving bands.\nMeanwhile, the German admiralty wanted to use a very long grenade for its 15 and 17\u00a0cm guns. The idea, which was also supported by the British and French navies, was that such grenades could easily penetrate wooden ships by having an increased punch per cm2 and less loss of velocity at longer distances. This required a stronger twist (smaller twist length), which indicated the use of copper driving bands.\nThese test started in August 1872 and were done with long 15\u00a0cm guns. In March 1873, the army then approved hard lead driving bands for its 15\u00a0cm guns. In Fall 1873, it determined that the best groove configuration for this were 24 wedge grooves with a constant twist length of 50 calibers. In Summer 1874, the admiralty decided on wedge grooves, a 45 caliber constant twist length and three caliber long grenades with copper driving bands for its long 15\u00a0cm guns.\nThe aptirte 15 cm RK L/22\nAs the c/69 design was a very early design, the part of the chamber where the projectile was placed was not rifled. In Winter 1875/76 it became clear that extending the rifling to thi",

It is the first film to be made in Chhattisgarhi language after Ghar Dwar (1971). \nMor Chhainha Bhuinya was released on Diwali day on October 27, 2000.  The film was a major commercial and critical success. Every actor made his or her debut with this Chhattisgarhi film, most notably Anuj Sharma. The film is credited for giving a major impetus to Chhattisgarh's own film industry or Chhollywood.\nPlot\nThe film is about a farmer family's trials and tribulations involving three generations. A man with his wife and children leaves his poor old parents' home alone and goes to Mumbai for work. However, disillusioned he is forced to return to the village after facing tough times in the big city where they had gone with many hopes and dreams.\nCast\nShekhar Soni as Uday\nPiyush Mishra as young Uday\nPoonam Naqvi as Sudha, Uday's Lover\nAnuj Sharma as Kartik\nVash Shirshak as young Kartik\nJagriti Rai\nSamita Nayak\nAshish Shendre as Kishan, Kartik's father\nSanju Sahu as Kartik's mother\nSuresh Gondale as Kartik's grandfather\nNisha Gautam as Kartik's grandmother\nChandrakala as Sudha's Sister\nManmohan Thakur as Girdhari Pandey (Villain)\nRavi Tiwari as Netaji or Tauji\nShiv Kumar as Dipak\nAnil Sharma as D.K.

He had a story ready, but no finance was available. The continued budget constraints forced curtailing the movie by cutting back on shooting of 20 scenes and 1 song. The director toured the state of Chhattisgarh extensively in search for suitable actors/actresses for his new film. A technical team came from Mumbai to shoot the movie. Even the action sequences were executed by fight master Andlib Pathan from Mumbai. The film led to the rebirth of Chhollywood. \nFilming\nThe film was mostly shot in and around the city of Bhilai, Chhattisgarh. \nRelease\nInitially, no one was willing to distribute/release the movie. So the writer/director Satish Jain and his brother decided to distribute the film themselves. Exhibitors were apprehensive of the idea of screening a Chhattisgarhi film. But Satish Jain requested exhibitors to release the film in Raipur, Durg, and Bilaspur on the occasion of Diwali on October 27, 2000. Initially released with just 3 prints, the subsequent demand after the film became a superhit, meant that producers released 12 prints. Post release a new song was added.\nSoundtrack\nAll lyrics are written by Laxman Masturia, Vinay Bihari, Pushpa Kulu, and Rakesh Nirala ; all music is composed by Babla Bagchi\nBox office\nThe film ran for more than 100 days across many theatres in the newly formed state of Chhattisgarh grossing over \u20b92 crores in lifetime collections. The film had a slow start in the first 2 days, but word-of-mouth publicity turned the fortunes of the film from 3rd day onwards making it a blockbuster. The film even surpassed other Bollywood flicks that were also released alongside it on Diwali like Mohabbatein and Mission Kashmir in Chhattisgarh. \nSequel\nAfter 23 years writer and director Satish Jain decided to make a sequel, Mor Chhainha Bhuinya 2. Satish Jain returns as writer and director of the new film, which is a remake or spiritual sequel of the original movie and was released on 24 May 2024. The lead characters in the new film play the same role as the original movie but the setting is different.  \n",
    "1993 novel by Australian author Frank Moorhouse\nGrand Days is a 1993 novel by the Australian author Frank Moorhouse.\nThis novel is the first in the author's Palais des Nations series, and was followed by Dark Palace in 2000 and Cold Light in 2011.\nSynopsis\nEdith Campbell Berry is a young Australian working for the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, in the 1920s. \nCritical reception\nWriting in Australian Book Review Carmel Bird was very impressed with the work: \"The novel is a powerful work of the imagination. If Moorhouse had simply written a history of the League, we would have had the facts, but with the novel we actually feel the hope and the disaster of the enterprise. This is a remarkable thing. The historical novels I used to read always took as their subject, I think, the wild and wonderful bits of what has happened on the planet. By opening up the attic of the things that happened in Geneva in the 1920s and 1930s, Frank Moorhouse has done something rare, strange, and important. The overall tone is sad and bitter, but not without a certain preservation of hope in the possibility of goodness and a means to peace.\"\nAlison Broinowski, in The Sydney Morning Herald noted: \"The story of how  idealistic belief in the league's supranational, super-rational capacity to save the world vaults into ambition and then slides into compromise is as much the story of the league itself as it is the subsequent story of the UN...The mood of the 1920s is so faithfully evoked that Edith's escapades sometimes read like the 'madcap scrapes' of English schoolgirl fiction of the period.\"\nPublishing history\nAfter the novel's initial publication in Australia by Macmillan Publishers in 1993, it was reprinted as follows:\nPicador, UK, 1993\nPantheon Books, USA, 1993\nPicador, Australia, 1994\nVintage Books, Australia, 2000\nRandom House, Australia, 2018\nThe novel was also translated into French in 1996.\nAwards\nAdelaide Festival Awards for Literature winner 1994\nSee also\nCandida Baker interviewed the author about the book for The Age\n1993 in Australian literature\n",

    "\nThe Siege of Rethymno happened during the Cretan War when the Ottomans launched a campaign to conquer the city of Rethymno in Crete from the Venetians. The Ottomans captured the city in the end.\nBackground\nOn June 4, 1646, a new Ottoman armada of 60 galleys and four galleasses emerged from Istanbul, reinforced by Barbary states, and sailed to Chania. The Venetians did not attempt to stop them fearing defeat. The Ottomans tried to storm Souda but failed. The Ottomans then turned to attack the city of Rethymno. Rethymno was in a ruined state such that a successful resistance was impossible. The walls and fortifications had long fallen into ruins; and worst of all, the population was desperate and rebellious. Soon after the conquest of Chania, the most prominent men had written to Hussein Pasha that they were ready to submit to the Sultan since they could no longer expect anything from Venice, and the people were fed up with the Venetian government, which they hated and which could not even provide them with protection.\nSiege\nThe Ottomans arrived in Rethymno on October 11. The Ottomans assaulted on October 20th which resulted in the capture of the city. Those who managed to escape rushed into the castle in terrible confusion. A Venetian commander, Cormaro, who had tried to maintain some semblance of order among the retreating, received a fatal bullet wound amid the chaos and died on the spot. Several other experienced Venetian commanders were killed. The Venetians in the castle were led by Luigi Minotto. He and his 1,200-strong men resisted bravely, but the castle could no longer hold out for long. Not only were the walls almost destroyed in a few days by the Ottoman cannon fire, but inside the castle, the plague was wreaking havoc. Guards in the towers were losing their lives. In addition, there was a great lack of ammunition and the low morale began to prevail among the garrison. Minotto was therefore forced to raise the white flag on November 10. Hussein Pasha, whose troops were likewise greatly weakened by the plague, immediately stopped firing. The Venetians were allowed to leave Unharmed. The castle was surrendered three days later, on November 13.\n",

    "Funerary complex in Cairo, Egypt\nThe Mausoleum of Amir Qawsun or Khanqah\u2013Mausoleum of Amir Qawsun is a historic architectural complex in the Southern Cemetery of Cairo, Egypt. It was built in the 1330s to house the tomb of its patron, the Mamluk commander Qawsun. \nHistory\nView of the ruined complex in 1867, with the mausoleum chamber on the left and the minaret on the right.\nThe construction of the funerary complex is dated to 1335 CE (736 AH). Its accompanying minaret is dated to 1337. Its patron, Qawsun, was a powerful amir (commander) in the Mamluk Sultanate during the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad. After the latter's death in 1341, he briefly remained influential until he was arrested and executed in Alexandria later that same year. His body was brought back to Cairo and buried in the mausoleum he commissioned.\nThe mausoleum complex is partially ruined today. Along with some of the other medieval monuments in the vicinity, some of its walls were likely quarried for construction materials in later periods, contributing to its current state. Its remaining parts were restored in the 1980s by the Supreme Council of Antiquities. In 2023, the minaret, along with the minaret of the nearby Sultaniyya Mausoleum, was dismantled to make way for a new highway roundabout. The government plans to move both minarets to a new location.\nArchitecture\nThe original complex was a combination of khanqah (a venue for Sufis) and mausoleum. It consisted of two domed tomb chambers attached to either side of a prayer hall that served the khanqah. The minaret was attached to the northwest corner of the complex. This is similar in composition to the nearby Sultaniyya Mausoleum, built later in the same century, and reflected a common layout used in Cairo during this period. The whole complex was about as large as the better-preserved Khanqah of Faraj ibn Barquq (15th century) in the Northern Cemetery of Cairo.\nOnly the minaret and one of the domed chambers have been preserved to the present day. Until its dismantlement in 2023, the minaret stood around 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) to the northwest of the dome. The surviving domed chamber retains a sample of rich stucco decoration, including medallion designs with dense vegetal motifs. The minaret is made of stone and ornately carved. Its design reflects the early 14th century style of this period, consisting of three tiers: a square-based bottom tier, followed by an octagonal tier, and topped by a cylindrical lantern-like summit covered by a ribbed dome. It is the last surviving minaret to be built in this particular form. It is carved with muqarnas cornices at each level, with ribbed blind keel arches on its octagonal level, and with an unusual row of spikes running around the base of the summit's dome.\nSoutheastern exterior fa\u00e7ade of the mausoleum chamber\nSouthwestern fa\u00e7ade of the mausoleum chamber\nSouthwestern fa\u00e7ade, with remains of stucco decoration\nDetail of a carved stucco roundel on the southwestern fa\u00e7ade\nThe minaret\nDetail of the first tier/level of the minaret\nThe upper two levels of the minaret\nDetail of the stone carving and muqarnas on the minaret\nNotes\n^ All photos in this article are from 2012 (prior to recent construction and demolition in the area) unless otherwise indicated.\n",

It was discovered and registered as national remain in 1935.\nIt is also known as Prasat Ban Prasat (\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e17\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e17, pronounced ) or Prasat Noenthat (\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e17\u0e40\u0e19\u0e34\u0e19\u0e18\u0e32\u0e15\u0e38, pronounced ). The reason it has many names is because it is normal practice in Isan (northeast region) they always this type of construction (Khmer Hindu temple) as  Prasat Ban Prasat.  Somehow, the restoration of such construction changed its look so they called it That Chedi (\u0e18\u0e32\u0e15\u0e38\u0e40\u0e08\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c, pronounced , \"pagoda containing Buddhist relics\") or just called Noen That. Later, when more constructions were found so in order to make it clear which one it is referring to its location such as the one here is called Prasat Huai Thap Than.\nPrasat Huai Thap Than was built during Baphuon period (around the mid-11th century) in ancient Khmer civilization. Later, around the 18th\u201319th centuries, Lan Xang Kingdom became more influence so the top of the construction changed and changed its name to That Chedi. The religious belief changed too from Hinduism or Brahmanism that involved with Trimurti, which are Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma. That is way three chedis were always built.\nIn Lan Xang civilization, the top of the chedi changed its look to something more like a Phra That (\u015bar\u012bra) as its the Buddhism's belief.\nWhen it was first built, the construction  concerned on the direction of building so all temple faced to the east and surrounded with wall. Therefore, three buildings were built on the same foundation. The main building in the middle with two more buildings on its left and right side. This kind of formation of Trimurti. Ancient remains and religious related constructions changed their function during the time.\nCurrently, the building doors on both sides are closed. The sandstone door frame proved that there was a door there, and only the main building that is allowed to go inside. The bricks on the construction are new and old bricks.\n",

    "The Companhia Geral de Com\u00e9rcio de Pernambuco e Para\u00edba (CGPP in short) was a privileged monopoly company created by the Marquis of Pombal in the second half of the 18th century in Portugal.\nFounded on August 13, 1759, it was intended to control and promote commercial activity with the captaincies of Pernambuco and Para\u00edba, in the state of Brazil. Maria I of Portugal ended the monopoly at the beginning of the 1780s, in the context of the so-called \"Viradeira\".\nFoundation\nThe Companhia de Com\u00e9rcio de Pernambuco e Para\u00edba was a monopoly company responsible, between 1759 and 1780, for carrying out all the transatlantic trade between the captaincy of Pernambuco and its adjacent captaincies: Para\u00edba, Rio Grande do Norte, Cear\u00e1, as well as parts of Alagoas. \nThe company purchased export agricultural inputs such as sugar, tobacco, cotton, and leather, selling them at fixed prices set by the Inspection Board. Additionally, the company engaged in the sale of manufactured products and provided financing for consumer goods and producers' tools. It supplied labor by selling enslaved people from Angola and managed the acquisition of necessary regional goods, alongside building ships. The company and its members enjoyed privileges including private judgment in profit-related actions, a 20-year commercial monopoly, exemption from compulsory public service, and certain tax exemptions.\nAdministrative structure\nThe company's trade network spanned Europe, Asia, and Africa, with England being the primary supplier of manufactured products like cotton fabrics and sugar refining goods. Holland provided naval supplies, while Hamburg, Genoa, Trieste, Venice, Marseille, Rouen, and Madrid, along with the Azores islands Faial and S\u00e3o Miguel, supplied linen and sailcloths. From Goa, various Asian fabrics were imported. These goods were sold both to the company and colonials, aiming to create a consumer market in Portugal for manufactured goods. Cloths and crockery were primarily sold to Pernambuco plantation owners, with foreign-made goods surcharged to make domestic products more attractive.\nThe company also forced African enslaved people to Brazil, mainly from Angola. There were 49,344 enslaved people brought from Angola to Brazil between 1761 and 1786. Most were adults and 508 were listed as children.\nSugar was the main product sold by the Pernambuco and Para\u00edba Company. Before its establishment, the annual sugar production averaged below 6,100 boxes, which increased to 8,100 during its monopoly. Despite conflicts in the 1770s over sugar prices, only three price increases occurred (1765, 1770, and 1777). The company's administrators aimed to keep Brazilian sugar competitive, refining it primarily in London and Hamburg, which doubled its value and yielded a 250% profit, benefiting neither the sugar mill owners nor the company itself.\nThe archives of the company are held at the Portuguese National Archives of Torre do Tombo.\n",
    "Municipal building in Esher, Surrey, England\nSandown House, known as Esher Town Hall during much of the 20th century, is a historic building in the High Street in Esher, a town in Surrey, in England. The building, which has been converted into flats, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nElements of the building may dated back to the late 17th century. However, much of the significant development of the house took place after it was acquired by the East India Company trader, Richard Barwell, in the mid-18th century. A degree of re-modelling took place when Barwell commissioned Sir William Chambers to re-design much of the interior in 1762. It then became the home of a local magistrate, James Nugent Daniell, in the first half of the 19th century. Various sources state that the mathematician and writer, Ada Lovelace, lived at Sandown from 1841 until her death in 1852.\nThe house was then became the home of the Governor of the Bank of England, James Pattison Currie, in the mid-19th century. In around 1880, some of the land around the house was sold to Sandown Park Racecourse.\nAfter Esher Urban District Council was formed in 1894, it was initially based at Brabant Villa in Thames Ditton; however, by the end of the First World war, these premises were inadequate and, in 1922, the council acquired Sandown House to serve as Esher Town Hall. The house continued to serve as the headquarters of the council for over half a century, but it ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Elmbridge Borough Council was formed at Walton-on-Thames in 1974. The new council continued to use Sandown House as a base for the delivery of local services until 1992.\nThe house was subsequently sold to a developer, Active Office, and, in April 1998, after the building became dilapidated, Active Office was fined \u00a35,000 for neglecting to undertake repairs. It was bought by Latchmere Properties and Countryside Residential in May 2000 and was then converted into apartments in the early 21st century.\nArchitecture\nThe five-bay central section of the building is three storeys high, with attics above, while the four-bay wings are of two storeys.  It is built of brick with stucco finish. It features a central pedimented portico, formed by Ionic order columns supporting an entablature and a pediment, and it is fenestrated with sash windows. The bays are separated by banded pilasters supporting a modillioned cornice and balustrade at the eaves. There is also a square cupola built of brick, housing a clock. To the left is a five-bay extension.  Inside, the entrance hall has a grand staircase. The house was grade II listed in 1969.\nNotes\n^ Despite the blue plaque on Sandown House, Ockham Parish Council claim that Ada Lovelace actually lived at Ockham Park, not Sandown House.\n",

    "Urban square in Warsaw, Poland\nThe Disabled People Square (Polish: Plac Inwalid\u00f3w) is an urban square and traffic circle in Warsaw, Poland, within the \u017boliborz district. It is located at the intersection of Czarnieckiego Street, Mickiewicza Street, and Wojska Polskiego Avenue. The square waw opened in 2024.\nHistory\nBetween 1863 and 1864, in the location of current square, the Imperial Russian Army had constructed the Georgy Fort, as part of the fortifications of the Warsaw Citadel. It was made from bricks and dirt, and had a circular form. The construction was concerned to the Citadel via a tunnel, which survivez to the present day. The fort was deconstructed in the early 1920s.\nIn its place, in 1923, was constructed a large urban square, placed at the intersection of Czarnieckiego Street, Mickiewicza Street, and Wojska Polskiego Avenue. There was also constructed a tram line, going alling Mickiewicza Street. It was opened on 20 December 1924, and on 27 September 1926, it was named the Disabled People Square, to honour people that became disabled during the First World War.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, around the square were considered multifamily residential buildings of the Officers Housing Association and the Warsaw Housing Association. During the German occupation in the Second World War, at the square were placed two Ringstand 58c small military bunkers. The buildings around the square survived the conflict undamaged.\nOn 30 September 1995, at the square was unveiled the 1st Armoured Division Monument designed by sculptor Jerzy Sikorski and architect Andrzej Kici\u0144ski. It is dedicated to the 1st Armoured Division of the Polish Armed Forces during the Second World War.\nOn 23 September 2017 there was also unveiled the monument dedicated to \nStanis\u0142aw Sosabowski, general and leader of the 1st Independent Parachute Brigade of the Polish Armed Forces during the Second World War.

    "Municipal building in Addlestone, Surrey, England\nRunnymede Civic Centre is a municipal building in Station Road in Addlestone, a town in Surrey, in England. The building accommodates the offices and meeting place of Runnymede Borough Council as well as a library and police station.\nHistory\nIn the 19th century, Addlestone was a chapelry within the parish of Chertsey. After Chertsey Urban District Council was established in 1894, the new council was initially based in offices in Guildford Street in Chertsey. However, in the late 1950s, the council decided to commission new offices. The site they selected was open land on the south side of Station Road in Addlestone.\nThe council offices were designed in the modern style, built in dark brick, and were completed in 1962. The rear part of the building, which had a rather dull appearance on account of the dark colour of the bricks, was supported on stilts and it featured a landscaped garden. The council offices continued to serve as the offices of Chertsey Urban District Council for another 12 years and then became the headquarters of the enlarged Runnymede Borough Council when it was formed in 1974. In the 1980s, during the Cold War, a bunker was established under the building for use in the event of a nuclear attack.\nIn the early 2000s, the council decided to relocate to a new civic centre, which would incorporate a library and police station, in addition to the council headquarters.  Although it was originally planned to sell the old building, the Great Recession of 2008/2009 reduced demand and so the council decided to demolish the structure instead. The site was later occupied by a Waitrose Supermarket and a Premier Inn.\nMeanwhile, the council proceeded with the development of its new civic centre on a site immediately to the east of the previous council offices. The new three-storey building was designed by Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios in the modern style, built by Willmott Dixon in brick and glass at a cost \u00a312.6 million and was officially opened in 2008. In October 2023, it was announced the roof was leaking and would require replacement.\nArchitecture\nThe ground floor of the facade is fenestrated in plate glass, to make the building's functions visible from the outside.  The right-hand section of the first floor is canted forward and supported by a pier at the north west corner: it is clad in alternating sections of clear and coloured glass. Inside, there is a double-height space housing the library and help desks, with consultation rooms behind, and a wide staircase leading to the upper floors. There is a mezzanine floor with a staff cafe, while the first floor contains the council chamber, a drum-shaped space with desks for councillors in three horseshoes.  It is lit by a skylight, with a lantern above which shines a red light when the council is in session.  The second floor and remainder of the first floor house offices, as well as the police control room. The design was one of the regional winners for the 2009 RIBA Awards.\n",
    "American judge (born 1933)\nMichael A. Silverstein was a United States judge serving as an associate justice on the Rhode Island Superior Court. He was known for handling significant and complex cases, and for his involvement in creating and heading the Rhode Island Superior Court's Business Calendar, a specialized business court docket within the Superior Court.\nJudicial service\nIn 1994, Rhode Island Governor Bruce G. Sundlun appointed Silverstein as an associate justice to the Rhode Island Superior Court. Throughout his judicial service, Silverstein handled significant and complex cases of various types, notably including lead paint litigation, Rhode Island's receivership law, the 38 Studios suit, efforts to block the state sale of debt backed by proceeds of the tobacco industry settlement, and many others.\nAlong with Superior Court Presiding Justice Joseph F. Rogers Jr., Silverstein developed a specialized business court docket within the Superior Court known as the Business Calendar, which became operational on June 4, 2001. The Business Calendar was designed to handle complex litigation focusing on commercial and business disputes, as well as insolvencies. He served as the original Business Calendar judge in 2001, continuing as a Business Calendar judge until his retirement in September 2018, at the age of 85. Upon Silverstein's retirement, Rodgers described him as \"'the gold standard by which other judges assigned to that calendar will be measured....'\" \nSilverstein actively used alternative dispute resolution with his cases, and made the innovative use of non-lawyer professionals as mediators in appropriate circumstances, such as accountants and retired business people.\nEven after retirement, he was called upon to serve in the roles of judge and special master in important cases of varying types, including among other matters, internal disputes within Rhode Island's House of Representatives, an eminent domain matter against the State of Rhode Island, and the dissolution of a law practice.\nPrivate law practice\nSilverstein was admitted to the Rhode Island Bar in 1959, and was a lawyer with various law firms until his judicial appointment in 1994. He was the managing partner of the Rhode Island law firm Hinckley, Allen, Snyder and Comen before joining the Superior Court in 1994. \"Throughout his career, Silverstein specialized in dealing with faltering financial institutions.\" He became an advisor to Sundlun in connection with the 1991 Rhode Island banking crisis, and participated in drafting the legislation that created Rhode Island's Depositors Economic Protection Corporation in response to the crisis.\nEducation\nSilverstein received his undergraduate A. B. degree from Brown University in 1956, and his law degree from the Boston University School of Law in 1959.\nAwards\nIn 2010, Silverstein received the Chief Justice Joseph R. Weisberger Judicial Excellence Award from the Rhode Island Bar.  The \u201caward is given to a Rhode Island jurist for exemplifying and encouraging the highest level of competence, integrity, judicial temperament, ethical conduct and professionalism.\u201d In giving the award, the Bar observed that \u201chrough his vision of justice and fairness, Judge Silverstein adapts new trial technology in response to changes in the legal environment.\u201d\nOrganizational involvement\nHe has served as chair of the Woonsocket Industrial Development Corporation, and on the boards of Roger Williams University, the Meeting Street School, the American College of Business Court Judges and his synagogue.   \u00a0\n",

    "Species of lichen\nUmbilicaria semitensis, commonly known as Yosemite rock tripe, is a species of foliose lichen in the family Umbilicariaceae. It occurs in the western regions of northern North America, from southern California to southern Oregon.\nTaxonomy\nUmbilicaria semitensis was first described by Edward Tuckerman in 1872 from a specimen collected at Yosemite National Park. Initially recognized as a distinct species, it was later synonymized under Umbilicaria angulata due to their similar thallus appearances and overlapping geographical ranges. However, analyses of the ITS and LSU regions of nrDNA have supported the re-establishment of U.\u00a0semitensis as a distinct species, primarily distinguished by its muriform spores, in contrast to the simple spores of U.\u00a0angulata.\nThe type specimen of Umbilicaria angulata was collected in California, specifically in Monterey, by Archibald Menzies. Although the specimen is labeled as collected in Monterey, the exact locality remains uncertain due to the extensive travels of Menzies along the north Pacific coast, where U.\u00a0angulata is commonly found. This has led to speculation that the type locality might be mislabeled. Historical attempts to relocate Menzies' collecting sites near Monterey to find Umbilicaria angulata have been unsuccessful, suggesting that further investigation using Menzies' journals might be necessary to clarify the original collecting location.\nThe lichen's epithet semitensis is derived from the Latinized form of \"Yosemite\", referring to its type locality in Yosemite Valley. Molecular studies have further confirmed the distinct genetic identity of Umbilicaria semitensis, separating it from U.\u00a0angulata and other related species within its range.\nDescription\nUmbilicaria semtiensis was previously considered synonymous with its lookalike Umbilicaria angulata, shown here.\nUmbilicaria semitensis is characterized by its large, rounded, and often overlapping lobes. The thallus of the lichen is adnate to loosely adnate, typically ranging from 7\u201315\u00a0cm (2.8\u20135.9\u00a0in) in diameter. Its lobes are contiguous to overlapping and imbricate, with a surface texture that is pale greenish-grey to whitish-grey and shiny. As the lichen ages, its surface becomes finely foveolate and can develop reticulate cracks.\nThis lichen has numerous laminal pseudocyphellae, which are mainly linear to irregularly shaped. The older parts of the thallus densely develop cylindrical, simple to branched isidia, which are reproductive propagules. The rhizines on the lower surface are moderately abundant, ranging from simple to furcately branched, and are not squarrose.\nApothecia are quite common in Umbilicaria semitensis, appearing more or less pedicellate with a disc that is concave and thalline exciple that is often sparsely isidiate. The ascospores are broadly ellipsoid, measuring between 17\u201318 by 12\u201313\u00a0\u00b5m.\nHabitat and distribution\nUmbilicaria semitensis is found growing on rocky substrates, particularly in montane and subalpine regions. It ranges from southern California through to southern Oregon, growing at elevations from approximately 7,000 to 8,000\u00a0ft (2,100 to 2,400\u00a0m). The lichen prefers exposed, somewhat sheltered locations on rock surfaces, often above the Yosemite Valley.\n",
    "\nEnvironmental stages providing evolutionary pressure in accordance to the Bubble Theory\nThe Bubble Theory is a hypothesis postulating the simultaneous origin of both cellular and viral strategies of life from early replicators enclosed within liposomes, proposed by Radoslaw Piast. As lipid-enclosed replicators were not cells but a cooperating group of \"genes,\" the term \"bubble\" was chosen to describe this state and differentiate this stage of the origin of life from liposomes (not containing replicators) and cells (fully fledged living organisms). This led to naming the hypothesis \"the Bubble Theory.\" Piasts bubbles are the intermediate state between RNA world and first cells. They can be described as  evolvable conglomerates of individual replicons on their way to become individual cells through cooperation and competition minimization.\nAccording to the proposal, a population of replicators evolved the ability to navigate a bubble, which protected them from external conditions due to environmental pressure. This scenario could have occurred in the tributary of an ancient river that had one of its sources in a Darwinian warm little pond-like subterranean lake. This lake harbored early RNA-based life forms capable of self-replication and peptide production. As the lake produced all necessary substrates for replication, including liposome-producing amphiphiles like lipids, some of these nutrients, along with replicators, could have been packed into liposomes and washed away. The dilution of building blocks necessitated that the liposome-enclosed replicons cooperate to \"hunt\" other liposomes or bubbles for their nutritious content and remain within the supply zone. Eventually, two possible strategies were developed: a virus-like strategy based on the ability to transmit replicon information to nutrient-rich bubbles, and a cell-like strategy involving the maintenance of the lipid envelope and gaining nutrients via merger with other bubbles.\nStages\nThe Bubble Theory involves 3 stages crucial for the evolution of cells and viruses:\nThe Source - Subterranean lake with properties of Darwinian warm little pond. This body of water was a birthplace of the first living entities - RNA-based replicators able to produce peptides. The source was constantly producing nutrients supporting replication of replicons and lipid-like amphiphiles able to form liposomes.\nDilution point - Organic matter running from the source was forming a stream. This stream was merging with other rivers in the tributary, resulting in a continuous dilution of nutrients. At this point, only within liposomes' nutrients were not diluted and were able to support the replication. Replicators enclosed within liposomes must have started to cooperate with each other to gain the ability to navigate the whole structure. To distinguish it from liposomes and cells, replicon inhabited vesicles are called bubbles. For survivor purposes, bubbles had to merge with nutrient-rich liposomes from the source. Development of two strategies could be helpful in such an environment: a virus-like strategy based on the ability to transmit replicon information to nutrient-rich liposomes, and a cell-like strategy involving the maintenance of the lipid envelope and gaining nutrients via merger with other liposomes. Helpful in these processes was production of transmembrane peptides/proteins which could work as piluses, fimbria and fusion proteins.\nSolitude point - Far from the source, nutrient-rich liposomes were too rare to support bubbles. At this point replicators had to develop a system increasing their chances for finding new hosts, becoming parasites or had to start maintaining their lipid vessel becoming fully fledged cells.\n",

The bishop sent 14 oak trees from his estate at Farnham Castle to use as pillars inside the new church, transporting them to Gosport by ox and cart. The interior of the church was built to a classical style with ionic colonnades, white walls and a barrel vault ceiling.\nHoly Trinity was assigned as its own parish in 1860.\nCoat of arms above the west door\nReconstruction\nSince it was first built in 1696, Holy Trinity has undergone several alterations. In 1730, a fast-growing population and lack of convenient seating led to a gallery being built on the north side of the chapel and a portico added to the west end. In 1745, another 60 pews were added. In 1828\u201330 a new west front was built to the design of Thomas Ellis Owen. In 1867 the church was re-pewed, a new altar was inserted and chancel formed, with Thomas Hellyer as architect.\nThe church underwent substantial remodelling in 1887 by architect, Arthur Blomfield, to mark Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The whole exterior, which had previously been stuccoed, was refaced in red brick, the windows were re-formed, and a bellcote was added over the east gable. \nA birdseye view of the church looking over to Portsmouth Harbour.Holy Trinity's campanile as viewed from Portsmouth Harbour.Holy Trinity's campanile as viewed from Walpole Park.\nInternally, Blomfield would have liked to redesign the church in his preferred neo-gothic style, but its classical colonnades made this impossible. Instead, he added an iron screen across the west end of the building, installed a new altar from St Agatha's, Landport and removed the galleries.\nHoly Trinity has thus ended up with an unusual fusion of architectural styles \u2013 a Victorian fa\u00e7ade, but with a classical interior ordered for Anglo-Catholic worship.\nNikolaus Pevsner said, of Blomfield's work:\n\"He turned the old plain building with its low-pitched nave, tall, steep-pitched aisles, and apsidal chancel into a rather crude and simplified version of a lombard basilica.\"\u2014\u200aNikolaus B. L. Pevsner and David W. Lloyd, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight (1967)\nIn 1889, Blomfield added a campanile to the North West of the church. This tower has been an iconic feature of the Gosport skyline ever since and can be seen from Portsmouth Harbour.\nAnglo-Catholicism\nFrom 1858, under the incumbency of Fr William Skipsey-Saunders, Holy Trinity increasingly fell under the influence of the Oxford Movement. The reordering of the church, most notably the construction of the chancel and a new altar reflects this renewed emphasis on ritual and ceremony. The present high altar orientated for eastward celebration was installed in 1887. This period also saw the installation of the reredos and other elements, such as statues of various saints, associated with the Oxford Movement.\nThe church's high churchmanship was further developed under the ministry of Fr Henry Woolsey (1912\u20131926) who had previously been, for 17 years, a master at Hurstpierpoint College, a school of the Woodard Corporation, a group of schools founded to inculcate Anglo-Catholic belief and practice in the Victorian middle classes. Although Holy Trinity had had Tractarian leanings for 50 years by this point and celebrated weekly Communion, Matins had remained the main Sunday service. Woolsey replaced this with a Sung Mass and instituted a structure of daily Matins, Mass, and Evensong as well as popularising the practice of Confession. The use of incense was begun on Christmas Day 1913. Woolsey also founded and edited a monthly parish magazine as a means of spreading Anglo-Catholic teaching throughout the parish. His wish to introduce the reserved sacrament \u2013 a highly controversial act in late Victorian Anglicanism \u2013 was not realised until after his death.\nHoly Trinity remained, however, in the 'Prayer Book Catholicism' strand of the Anglo-Catholic movement: notwithstanding the use of external elements such as vestments, bells, and lights in worship, the liturgy itself remain strictly in accordance with the canonical norms of the Book of Common Prayer. Subsequent vicars maintained this 'moderate' position, eschewing Anglo",
    "\nLaw enforcement agency\nThe Border Security Command (BSC) is a proposed law enforcement agency in the United Kingdom to be responsible for coordinating the activities of Immigration Enforcement, MI5, the Border Force and the National Crime Agency to attempt to tackle smuggling gangs which facilitate illegal migrant crossings over the English Channel. The first steps towards establishing it were announced in July 2024 by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to replace the Rwanda asylum plan and will be led by the Border Security Commander, who will answer to the Home Secretary.\nThe command was first proposed by the Labour Party in May 2024 as an alternative to the Conservative government's Rwanda asylum plan, with the aim of tackling the ongoing crisis of illegal migrant crossings on the English Channel. After Labour's victory in the 2024 general election, the command was launched by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper on 7 July 2024.\nHistory\nThe Border Security Command was first proposed in a speech by Labour Party leader Keir Starmer in May 2024. The party planned to create a new border security command if it entered government. The command would be responsible for tackling the ongoing crisis of illegal migrant crossings on the English Channel by coordinating the activities of government agencies such as MI5 in prosecuting people smuggling gangs which facilitate illegal immigration to the United Kingdom. The command was proposed as Labour's alternative to the Rwanda asylum plan of the incumbent Conservative government, which the party claimed would fail to tackle the migrant crossings across the Channel and criticised as a waste of money. The command was further detailed in Change, the Labour Party's manifesto for the 2024 general election, as one of its main manifesto commitments. In the manifesto, the party pledged to establish the command with counter-terrorism powers to enable it to prosecute people smugglers should it enter government. It would be funded by ending the Rwanda asylum plan and reallocating the money pledged for the plan to the command, which the party said would enable it to \"pursue, disrupt and arrest those responsible for the vile trade\". Starmer said he wanted to raise around \u00a375 million from the defunct plan each year to fund the command.\nFollowing Labour's landslide victory in the 2024 general election and the formation of the Starmer ministry on 5 July, the new Labour government scrapped the Rwanda asylum plan on the day it entered office. On 7 July, the new home secretary Yvette Cooper launched the Border Security Command (BSC) to replace the plan, accompanied by an audit into the money already granted to the Rwandan government through the plan to see if the UK government could take it back, as well as new counter-terrorism legislation which would be drawn up in the coming weeks to tackle illegal immigration. The command would be funded by money previously earmarked for the Rwanda plan and  would be responsible for coordinating the activities of Immigration Enforcement, MI5, the Border Force and the National Crime Agency in tackling smuggling gangs which facilitate illegal migrant crossings over the English Channel. The new office of Border Security Commander was also established, whose remit would be to lead the new command and its members, with the government expecting the appointment of the first officeholder to be made in the coming weeks. A team in the Home Office was tasked with setting out the remit of the command, as well as its governance structure and its strategic direction.\nOrganisation\nThe Border Security Command is led by the Border Security Commander, who answers to the Home Secretary; the office is currently vacant, as the inaugural commander has not yet been appointed by the government. The Border Security Commander with receive a salary of \u00a3140,000 to \u00a3200,000.\nSee also\nMaritime Border Command\n",
    "Polish painter (1827\u20131883)\nJ\u00f3zef Marszewski (Lithuanian: Juozapas Mar\u0161evskis, Russian: \u0418\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0444 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439; c.\u20091827 \u2013 27 March 1883) was a Polish-Lithuanian landscape painter. He was the grandfather of Zygmunt Marszewski\u00a0, a colonel of the Polish Army.\nBorn in Vilnius, then part of the Russian Empire, Marszewski was educated at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg. Having stood out as a capable painter and friend of Ivan Shishkin, Marszewski won two silver medals for his paintings of the Neva and Ravel. After graduation, Marszewski extensively traveled Europe, painting local landscapes ranging from Spain to the Tatra mountains, as well as portraying Vilnius and its surroundings. He often set up exhibitions in Krak\u00f3w, Lviv, and Warsaw. He settled in Warsaw around 1872, however in the following year lost a large amount of money he had deposited in a bank, and as a result fell into a deep depression which would develop into a mental illness. He died either in Warsaw or Vilnius. His works are housed in the National Museum in Warsaw and National Museum in Krak\u00f3w.\nBiography\nEarly life\nJ\u00f3zef Marszewski's birth date varies in sources. According to Marszewski's biographer Wojciech Gerson, Marszewski was born on 14 March 1827 in Vilnius (then part of the Russian Empire). He was taught art by either Aleksander Kokular in Warsaw or by Wincenty Dmochowski in Vilnius, or possibly by both of them. From 1853 to 1856 he studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg under Maksim Vorobyov, where he won two silver medals for his paintings View of the Neva During the March of Ice and Revel. Alexey Bogolyubov notes that others (Alexey Chernyshev, Vasily Maksutov, Vladimir Sverchkov and himself) also worked on View of the Neva During the March of Ice painting for fun. Marszewski graduated as an artist of the 14th class of the Academy. As a student, Marszewski was friends with Ivan Shishkin.\nTravels\nContinuing his studies, Marszewski began traveling across Europe visiting firstly Paris and Spain. In 1858 he lived in Dusseldorf where he continued improving his skills under Andreas Achenbach. Marszewski also visited Switzerland, Rome, Courland, and the Tatra mountains (in 1865 and 1866). He traveled to Dusseldorf again in 1864, where he stayed until around 1870, after which he moved to Paris. Despite his travels, Marszewski retained contacts with his former Academy and in 1870 received the honorary title of \"Class Artist\", 1st Degree, for his painting View of Menton. Marszewski regularly submitted his works for exhibitions in Krak\u00f3w, Lviv, and Warsaw.\nLater years and death\nAfter returning from his travels, Marszewski usually lived in Warsaw (settled around 1872) and Vilnius, sometimes visiting modern-day Ukraine. In 1873 Marszewski lost a large amount of money he had deposited in a bank and as a result fell into a deep depression, which eventually turned into a mental illness.\nMarszewski died on 27 March 1883 in Warsaw. Other sources claim he died on 27 March 1874 in Vilnius. He was buried in Vilnius, in what is now the old cemetery complex of Vilnius evangelicals. He was remembered by his contemporaries as \"a seasoned landscape painter full of energy  an excellent artist and a much-lamented colleague  full of life, with sparkling black eyes, of short height, dark-haired, with wide eyebrows, he was full of enthusiasm for art and he retained his love of work for it until the end.\"\nWorks\nMarszewski usually painted landscapes from the lands of Italy, Germany, Spain, Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania (especially around Vilnius). As was typical of landscape artists, Marszewski treated the landscape in an emotional way with which he tried to reflect the moods prevailing in nature. It is also known that Marszewski painted religious scenes and portraits. In 1847 he also painted Passage Through Berezina, a composition depicting the Battle of Berezina.\nGallery\nRuins of the Trakai Island Castle at Sunset (1866)\nNocturnal Landscape with Windmills (1864)\nLandscape with Houses Among Trees\nSteep Bank of the Viliya River\nMount Mura\u0144 in the Tatra Mountains at Sunrise (1867)\nMountain Landscape with Staffage (1859)\nNear Vilnius (River Landscape) (1872)\nView of the church of Missionaries and Visitation Sisters in Vilnius (1870)\nFishermens' Boats Near the Mediterranean (1869)\nVilnius viewed from Tauras Hill (1872)\nGediminas Hill in Vilnius (1861)\nVilnius, Bernardine Gardens (1868)\nVilnius, Vingis\n",
    "Irrigation canal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan\nUpper Swat Canal is an irrigation canal located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The canal takes off from Swat River at Amandarra Headworks in Malakand District. It irrigates a large area in the north of Mardan District, Swabi District and the north-eastern portion of the Charsadda District. The irrigation area is 276,000 acres of land and discharge is 1,800 cusecs. The length of the main canals is 138 miles and that of the distributaries is 431 miles.\nHistory\nBackground\nDuring the expansion of the British Empire in the Indian subcontinent, the Malakand Pass was a point of battle in 1897 between the British Army and the local tribesmen who showed heavy resistance. In 1907, the British Empire conceived the Benton Tunnel and Upper Swat Canal project to irrigate the dry Valley of Peshawar and to appease and improve their image among the local tribes.\nOriginal alignment\nAfter completing preliminary work, surveys, acquiring land and selecting alignments, it was found that the alignment of the main canal from Chakdara to Malakand District was interfered by graveyards, hence it had to be abandoned. This alignment consisted of a 5,000 feet long tunnel, with a slope of 1/100, velocity of 15.2 feet per second and a discharge of 2,394 cusecs.\nNew alignment\nA new alignment was soon found, however the new alignment included a longer tunnel through the Malakand Pass. The costs were cut by constructing a shorter and more direct main canal. The new tunnel was 11,235 feet (2 miles) long, with a slope of 1:215, velocity of 11.2 feet per second and a discharge of 2,218 cusecs.\nExecution\nWork on the tunnel began in March 1910 and was completed in 1914 (now called Benton Tunnel), with irrigation in the region commencing the same year. The Upper Swat Canal was declared complete by the British Empire in late 1916 and the cost was \"206 lakhs of Rupees\" or Rs20.6 million at the time. It was supervised and executed by Executive Engineer of the North-West Frontier Province at the time, W.P Sangster.\nEven though the original design of the Upper Swat Canal had a much greater discharge, the Benton Tunnel created a bottleneck due to its unlined nature, hence the total discharge of the canal was limited to 1,800 cusecs.\nImpact\nThe local population began to grow along with the production of wheat, sugarcane, tobacco, fruits and vegetables. Small villages grew into small towns, the local population began to grow Poplar trees along the canal and waterways. They started growing two crops a year instead of one, with most growing three. The canal brought great prosperity to the region and has become an integral part of it. More than one million people directly or indirectly depend on the Upper Swat Canal for their livelihood.\nThe canal transformed the Peshawar Division from a rainfed to a canal irrigated area.\nRestoration works\nBetween 1990 and 1999 the Government of Pakistan spent roughly US$130 million to upgrade the existing system of the Upper Swat Canal and the Lower Swat Canal by improving surface and subsurface drainage, remodelling the irrigation system, renovating watercourses and providing support facilities. The project also involved the creation of an auxiliary tunnel to overcome the Benton Tunnel's bottleneck.\nSee also\nList of canals in Pakistan\nLower Bari Doab Canal\nNara Canal\n",
    "American hang glider pioneer and musician\nTerry Sweeney is an American inventor and hang glider pioneer. He designed hang gliders and equipment for Sky Sports and was a founding member and leader of many musical groups including Sweeney's Glider, Fly by Day, and Tam and the Bourines.\nEarly life\nTerry Sweeney was born in Grasmere, New Hampshire, on December 6, 1947, and raised in Dunbarton, New Hampshire. He was the youngest of the four children of John Sweeney, a laborer, and Charlotte Sweeney, a waitress. He was fascinated with flight from a very young age and began building balloons and gliders in his backyard as a teenager.\nSweeney as a pre-teen with a favorite model glider in the late 1950s.Sweeney preparing his homemade solar balloon for flight in his Dunbarton, NH backyard in the late 1960s.Sweeney with a friend and a Rogallo hang glider in his Dunbarton backyard in the mid-1970s\nSweeney's Glider\nSweeney and one of his first gliders, a homemade $40 biplane, were featured in Fritz Weatherby's 1971 classic hang gliding video, Sweeney's Glider. In the video, Terry Sweeney describes the inspiration for his biplane, and Weatherby documents the efforts to get the glider off the ground. The video is accompanied throughout by music from Sweeney's band, Sweeney's Glider, singing about the dream of gliding flight.\nSky Sports\nSweeney designed hang gliders for Sky Sports, an East Coast hang glider manufacturer in the mid-1970s. While working for Sky Sports, along with other members of the Sky Sports design team, including designer Tom Peghiny and pilot Dennis Pagen, Sweeney contributed to the design of the Sirocco I, Sirocco II, Osprey, Merlin, and Kestrel. Sweeney was one of the first to incorporate double sail surfaces and an enclosed crossbar in his glider designs. To improve pitch stability of these early Rogallo designs Sweeney added a strut under the sail of each wingtip, which were then attached to the top of the kingpost with a cable. Together with David Aguilar he also helped design and develop the Sky Sports supine harness. Sweeney was also an early pioneer in powered hang gliders. In 1977, he developed a twintube kingpost mount for attaching an engine to a Rogallo-type flex-wing glider; this proved to be quite a dangerous design in turbulent conditions.\nSweeney preparing for take-off with a standard Rogallo glider in New Hampshire in the early 1970s\nHang gliding instructor\nAfter teaching himself to fly various types of fixed-wing gliders in the late 1960s, by the early 1970s, Sweeney was sharing his enthusiasm for the sport by teaching others. His beginner lessons in the \"Clay Pit\", an open field by a slope near his house in Dunbarton, New Hampshire, were well known throughout the East Coast by hang gliding aficionados. The hill has become overgrown with trees and is now part of a popular motocross trail called Hang Glider Hill in the Hopkinton-Everett Multi-Use Trail System in Weare, New Hampshire.\nSweeney instructs a first-time hang gliding student on the slopes of the Clay Pit, Weare, New Hampshire, in 1975.\nAwards and honors\n1975 Champion, USHGA Eastern Regionals, Grandfather Mountain, North Carolina\n1975 6th place in First World Hang Gliding Championship in K\u00f6ssen, Austria \n2003 Rogallo Hall of Fame Inductee\nPersonal life\nTerry Sweeney is married to Lisa Lapin.

    "\nJean-Denis Barbi\u00e9 (28 April 1760 - 28 December 1825) was a French geographer and cartographer, dean of the Facult\u00e9 de lettres de Paris and a member of the Institut de France. He was also known as Barbi\u00e9 du Bocage and Barbier du Bocage.\nLife\nHe was born in Paris to an architect and engraver from a bourgeois family from Normandy. He was orphaned aged nine, studied at the coll\u00e8ge Mazarin and worked for a time in a prosecutor's chambers, where he had been sent by his mother, who hoped he would become one himself. Instead, in 1777, he became the only pupil of Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville (1697\u20131782), first geographer to the King, who became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres in 1754 and of the Acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences in 1773. d'Anville trained him in geography and in 1786 Barbi\u00e9 added the new discoveries up to their time to d'Anville's world map.\nIn 1780, aged 20, he was attached to Louis XVI's foreign ministry under Charles Gravier de Vergennes (1719\u20131787), then from 1785 to the Cabinet des m\u00e9dailles in the  King's Library, then headed by abb\u00e9 Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my, producing the maps for the latter's Voyage du jeune Anarchis (The Young Anarchis's Journey). In 1792 he was put in charge of that library's geography section, but was dismissed from that role during the Reign of Terror after having been imprisoned as a suspect on 2 September 1792.\nUnder the Directory, in 1797, he was made a member of the geography committee in the office of the registry of the Interior Minister. Under the Consulate, in 1802, he was put in charge of several geographical projects run by the Ministry of War, including the 'carte de Mor\u00e9e' of the Peloponnese for the First Consul Napoleon, who would have had it sealed to give him the monopoly on using it. From 1803 to 1809 he geographer to the Foreign Ministry headed by Talleyrand and until 1807 was head of its geography store. In 1804 he drew up a map of Europe for state education. In 1806 he produced a map of the Principality of Benevento (within the Kingdom of Naples and confiscated from the Papal States) for Talleyrand, who had been made prince of that principality by Napoleon, as well as being put at the head of a project to produce a large map of France for the department of Bridges and Roads.\nHe was also a member of the Institut de France - on 7 November 1806, under the First French Empire he was elected an ordinary member in the Class of History and Ancient Literature, beating the Hellenist J. B. Gail and replacing the historian abb\u00e9 Louis-Pierre Anquetil-Duperron (1723-1806). Talleyrand was already a member and on Barbi\u00e9 du Bocage's election he saluted the \"justice of his spirit\" and \"the extent of his knowledge\". Also in Barbi\u00e9 du Bocage's class were Ameilhon, Fran\u00e7ois-Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas, Joseph Bonaparte, Brial, Champagne, Marie-Gabriel-Florent-Auguste de Choiseul-Gouffier, Clavier, Bon-Joseph Dacier (perpetual secretary from 1782), Pierre-Claude-Fran\u00e7ois Daunou, Desales, Dupont, Gail, Garran de Coulon, Gaussin, G\u00e9rando, Ginguen\u00e9, Gosselin, Gr\u00e9goire, Louis-Matthieu Langl\u00e8s, Lakanal, Lanjuinas, Laporte du Teil, Lebreton, Lebrun, Levesque, Mentelle, Mercier, Millin, Antoine Mongez, Pastoret, Petit-Radel, Pougens, Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy, Charles-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Reinhard, Antoine-Isaac Silvestre de Sacy, Talleyrand, Toulongeon and Visconti.\nIn 1809 he became the first professor of ancient and modern geography at the Facult\u00e9 de lettres de Paris, becoming dean of the Sorbonne in 1815 as successor to Pierre-Paul Royer-Collard, as well as sitting on the academic committee of Paris from 1821. He also taught at the \u00c9cole normale.

    "\nBrigadier Arthur George Peart, OBE (30 March 1915 \u2013 11 March 1999) was a British Army officer during World War II and Deputy Engineer-in-Chief at the War Office.\nEarly life and family\nBorn on 30 March 1915 to John Redmond Peart, a Dublin solicitor, and Matilda Mary Macnamara, Peart was educated at St Gerard's School, Stonyhurst College and Jesus College, Cambridge followed by RMA Woolwich with a three-year interlude, completing three years of basic engineer training, at Chatham.\nIn 1940, Peart married Elizabeth Helen Watson, daughter of James Arthur Watson, WS, Town Clerk of Nairobi.\nMilitary career\nPeart was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1935. In 1938, he was posted to Singapore, and in 1940 was promoted to Captain, second-in-command of an independent company for Commando-type service in southern Norway.\nIn 1941, as a Major, Peart was granted command of a field company but soon joined the operational planning branch of the War Office in late 1942. In early 1944, Peart undertook a series of foreign assignments in Ceylon, Burma, Singapore and Hong Kong as part of Lord Mountbatten's staff as a Lieutenant Colonel. Later that year, he worked closely with Winston Churchill in orchestrating the D-Day landings.\nAfter the war, Peart was in charge of the rehabilitation of Singapore and, in 1947, was awarded an O.B.E. for his services in Ceylon, Burma, Singapore and Hong Kong.\nIn 1966, Peart was posted as a Major General with an overseas posting but chose retirement instead.\nRetirement\nPeart became a director of a civil engineering firm in the Midlands, specialising in building bridges, multistorey car parks and opencast coalmining, before moving to Lymington. He subsequently built up one of the finest stamp collections of the West Indies, becoming an authority on the Queen Victoria Leeward Islands' stamps and postmarks, about which he gave lectures and wrote a number of reference books. The entire collection was stolen during a comprehensive burglary in 1990 \u2014 on Easter Sunday, on his birthday, whilst he was at church.\nDue to a trapped nerve, Peart gradually become wheelchair bound. Ten years later, he moved to Court Lodge nursing home where he died peacefully in his sleep on 11 March 1999.\n",
    "Species of plant\nTulbaghia acutiloba, the wild garlic, is a species of plant in the family Amaryllidaceae. First described by William Henry Harvey in 1854, it is found in the countries of Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, and South Africa.\nDescription\nTulbaghia acutiloba is one of 22 members of the genus Tulbaghia found in tropical and southern Africa. The plant is a clump-forming, bulbous perennial that ranges from 15\u201345 centimetres (5.9\u201317.7\u00a0in) in height. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, they are 50\u2013450 millimetres (2.0\u201317.7\u00a0in) in length, and 3\u20138 millimetres (0.12\u20130.31\u00a0in) in width. The rhizome of the plant can grow to 3 centimetres (1.2\u00a0in) in diameter. When the plant is touched, a garlicky scent is emanated.\nThe flowers are small, trumpet-shaped, around 8 by 4 millimetres (0.31\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a00.16\u00a0in) in size, and green, white, and orange-brown in colour. Khaki colored flowers are surrounded by green, recurved tepals, and a fleshy orange to reddish-brown ring, with an umbel of around 2 to 6 flowers. The flowers are sweet in scent, and the scent is particularly noticeable during the evening. The plant flowers throughout the year, mainly between the months of August to November, which is late winter to early summer in Southern Africa. The plant can flower multiple times in a single season.\nRange\nT. acutiloba in its native habitat, South Africa\nTulbaghia acutiloba is found in the countries of Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, and the eastern portions of South Africa. In South Africa, it is found in the provinces of Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and North West. In Botswana, it is found in the southeastern portion of the country.\nHabitat\nThe preferred habitat of Tulbaghia acutiloba is dry, rocky, grasslands of an elevation up to 1,800 metres (5,900\u00a0ft).\nHuman interactions\nThe leaves of the plant are edible, and young plants are eaten as food. In the provinces of Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, it is used as a culinary herb. Traditionally, T. acutiloba was used to treat various illnesses, including infectious diseases and hypertension.\nConservation\nIn an assessment of South African plants in 2009 by Raimondo et al., Tulbaghia acutiloba was ranked as \"Least Concern\".\nEtymology\nThe generic epiphet Tulbaghia is derived from Ryk Tulbagh, the governor of the Cape of Good Hope. Tulbagh's extensive correspondences with Carl Linnaeus included sending him 200 plant specimens, among which was a specimen of Tulbaghia acutiloba sent in 1769 which led to its description. The specific epiphet acutilobus denotes the plant's \"sharply pointed lobes\", from the Latin acutus \"acute, pointed\" and lobus \"lobe\", which likely refers to the flower's tepals.\nIt is commonly known as \"Wild Garlic\" in the English language. It is also known locally as \"Wildeknoffel\" in Afrikaans, \"isihihi\" in the Xhosa language, \"ishaladi lezinyoka\" in the Zulu language, and \"motsuntsunyane\" or \"sefothafotha\" in the Southern Sotho language.\nTaxonomy\nTulbaghia acutiloba was first described in 1854 by William Henry Harvey. Formerly placed in the family Alliaceae, the family was merged into the larger family Amaryllidaceae as per the APG IV system in 2016.\n",
    "American crafts scholar\nAllen H. Eaton (1881\u20131970) was an American crafts scholar and politician who became a staff member of the Department of Surveys and Exhibits of the Russell Sage Foundation.\nHe studied at the University of Oregon where he joined the faculty in 1915. He was elected to the Oregon State legislature and curated the Oregon Art Room for the 1915 international Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. In 1917 he was expelled from the faculty of the university for being a pacifist, something that Upton Sinclair later wrote about in his defense. The scandal caused him to lose his reelection in 1918 as a representative for Eugene. \nHe left Oregon for New York City \"the next day\" and got a position with the American Federation of Arts. His 1919 Buffalo, New York exhibition Arts and Crafts of the Homelands drew almost fifty thousand visitors. After the death of John C. Campbell in 1919 he took his place as field secretary for the Russell Sage Foundation, which resulted later in his Handicrafts of the Southern Highlands in 1937. In 1942 he was shocked at the treatment of Japanese-Americans through Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, and resolved to do something to help the internees remind themselves and the rest of America of their contributions. He had already written about the group in his 1932 Immigrant Gifts to American Life. His vision during the war was to have exhibitions on American arts and crafts travel from relocation center to relocation center, but he could not find sponsors for such an undertaking. He was determined to survey them for his work on American crafts however and visited several centers himself, impressed especially by miniature \"gardens\" and \"home\" decorations made from scrap and other local materials. This work resulted in his \"Beauty behind Barbed Wire\". During the project he was gifted many articles for use in a large permanent exhibition that never transpired. Among the artefacts was work by artist Estelle Peck Ishigo.\nHe was acknowledged as an early collector and admirer of Grandma Moses by her agent Otto Kallir. At the end of his life, Eaton was working on a book about Moses and her farming subjects. In 1951 he had helped organize an exhibition of 25 works by her which included a catalog and an essay he wrote about her work. The year before Eaton died in 1961, the centenarian artist gifted him a double-sided painting showing scenes of a \"Flax Farm\", after having given a painting of a colonial-style farm called \"Home Sweet Home\" to his daughter Martha the year before. Eaton claimed he had known Grandma Moses \"before she got famous\" and had previously purchased a \"Thanksgiving Turkey\" painting by her in 1942.\nNotable works\nThe Oregon system, the story of direct legislation in Oregon; a presentation of the methods and results of the initiative and referendum, and recall, in Oregon, with studies of the measures accepted or rejected, and special chapters on the direct primary (1912)\nImmigrant Gifts to American Life: Contributions of Our Foreign-Born Citizens to American Culture (1932)\nHandicrafts of the Southern highlands: With an Account of the Rural Handicraft Movement in the United States and Suggestions for the Wider Use of Handicrafts in Adult Education and in Recreation, with illustrations by Doris Ulmann, (1937), on Russell Sage Foundation website\nHandicrafts Of New England (1949) on archive.org\nGrandma Moses\u00a0: twenty-five masterpieces of primitive art (1951)\nBeauty Behind Barbed Wire: The Arts of the Japanese in Our War Relocation Camps (1952)\n",

    "French resistance fighter\nPierre Blanchet (Boll\u00e8ne, September 10, 1907 - Mort pour la France on June 18, 1944, in Radicofani) was a French resistance fighter, Companion of the Liberation. A graduate of HEC Paris, he however put aside a commercial career to become a police officer in Shanghai. Joining the Free French forces after the armistice of June 22, 1940, he fought in the Middle East, North Africa then in Italy where he was killed.\nBiography\nSon of an officer, Pierre Blanchet was born on September 10, 1907, in Boll\u00e8ne in Vaucluse where he spent his childhood in the absence of his father based in Madagascar. After studying at the high schools of Avignon and Marseille, he passed the written examination of the \u00c9cole polytechnique but was not authorized to take the oral exam due to physical incapacity. He then prepared for the HEC Paris exam which he passed. In October 1929, he was called up for his military service which he carried out in the 10e r\u00e9giment de tirailleurs s\u00e9n\u00e9galais in Tunisia. Having followed the reserve officer cadet courses, he left with the rank of reserve second lieutenant. In 1931, freshly graduated from HEC Paris, he prepared to join the Banque de l'Indochine. However, his brother-in-law Louis Fabre, director of police in the French concession of Shanghai, suggested that he come and take command of the Municipal Guard. Accepting the position, Pierre Blanchet left for China where his father, prefect of the Tientsin concession, was already working.\nWishing in vain to be mobilized when war was declared in 1939, Pierre Blanchet resigned from the police of the French concession and left for Indochina where he was appointed commander of the Poulo-Condor garrison. The armistice of June 22, 1940 preventing him from going to fight in France, he was demobilized and returned to his position within the Shanghai police. Shortly after, while replacing his brother-in-law on leave as head of the police, he was the victim of an attack in which he was shot and injured. Eager to continue the fight against Germany, he left China again and went to Manila in the Philippines where he obtained help from the British embassy to join the Free French forces in the Middle East. Assigned to Bataillon de marche no 1, he participated in the Syrian campaign at the end of which he was promoted to captain in September 1941. Transferred to the Bataillon du Pacifique in April 1942, he was engaged in the desert war and took part in the battle of Bir-Hakeim during which he was wounded on June 9. Refusing to be evacuated, he led his company in the evacuation of the post on the night of June 10 to 11. Shortly after, his battalion merged with the 1st Marine Infantry Battalion to form the Bataillon d'infanterie de marine et du Pacifique. Within this new unit, Pierre Blanchet participated in the second battle of El Alamein then in the Tunisian campaign.\nAfter the campaigns in North Africa, Pierre Blanchet had several months of calm to train young recruits who were reconstituting his company after the losses of previous battles. He and his unit were then engaged in the Italian campaign. On May 12, 1944, he was injured in the hand by shrapnel from a mortar shell during the capture of Mount Girofano. Evacuated a few days later, he was quickly treated and immediately joined his company in combat. The following June 18, while his unit attacked the village of Radicofani, Pierre Blanchet was killed by a shell explosion. He is buried in the French military cemetery in Rome.\nAwards\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\nCompanion of Liberation\nCroix de Guerre 1939\u20131945\nBibliography\nM\u00e9morial des Compagnons - 1940-1945\u00a0: Compagnons morts entre le 18 juin 1940 et le 8 mai 1945, Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 1961.\nJean-Christophe Notin, 1061 compagnons\u00a0: Histoire des Compagnons de la Lib\u00e9ration, Paris, \u00c9ditions Perrin, 2000, 822 p.

    "South African advocate and politician\nShameemah Salie (n\u00e9e\u00a0Dollie; born 1974) is a South African advocate and politician who has been a Member of the National Assembly of South Africa since July 2024, representing Al Jama-ah, of which she serves as national spokesperson. She previously served on the Cape Town City Council from 2021 until 2024. \nEarly life and education\nThe youngest of six children, Salie was born in 1974 to Ebrahiem Dollie and Abeedah Mukaddam. The family first lived in the Bo-Kaap before moving to Bonteheuwel, then to Mitchells Plain in 1979 and then to Wynberg in 1987. Salie studied law at the University of the Western Cape, earning a B.Proc degree and then a Bachelor of Laws.\nPolitical career\nSalie is a member of Al Jama-ah, a party for upholding Muslim interests in South Africa. She serves as the party's national spokesperson. In May 2021, Salie was announced as the party's candidate for deputy mayor of the City of Cape Town ahead of the local government elections to be held later that year. While the Democratic Alliance retained control of the City of Cape Town, Salie was elected as a proportional representation councillor for Al Jama-ah, which won three seats.\nControversies\nIn June 2023, Salie equated the high prevalence of rape and murder in South Africa to the LGBTQIA+ community, saying \"We\u2019re already living in Sodom and Gomorrah and you know that. The murders, the rapes, the LGBTQI+ community\". As a result, Salie was named Mampara (buffoon) of the Week by the Sunday Times.\nSalie was criticised by DA national spokesperson Solly Malatsi for remarks she made surrounding the involvement of LGBTQI+ members in a parliamentary process relating to new family policies during an interview with journalist Stephen Grootes on Newzroom Afrika.\nParliamentary career\nAL Jama-ah won two seats in the National Assembly during the 2024 national and provincial elections. The first seat was taken up by party leader Ganief Hendricks, however, the party decided against Johannesburg councillor Imraan Moosa taking up the second seat because he chairs the City of Johannesburg's Environment Infrastructure and Services committee. The party opted to choose Salie to take up his seat until May next year when he will be sworn in. Salie was sworn in as a Member of Parliament by speaker Thoko Didiza on 2 July 2024.\nOn 8 July 2024, Salie was nominated to serve on the Portfolio Committee on International Relations and Cooperation, the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development and the Portfolio Committee on Sports, Art and Culture.\nPersonal life\nSalie is married to Nathmi, and they have five children together.\n",
    "\nLight Scanning Photomacrography (LSP), also known as Scanning Light Photomacrography (SLP) or Deep-Field Photomacrography, is a photographic film technique that allows for high magnification light imaging with exceptional depth of field (DOF). This method overcomes the limitations of conventional macro photography, which typically only keeps a portion of the subject in acceptable focus at high magnifications.\nSea snail shell (Tenagodus anguinus) image captured using scanning light photography instrument.\nHistorical background\nThe principles of LSP were first documented in the early 1960s by Dan McLachlan Jr., who highlighted its capability for extreme focal depth in microscopy \nand in 1968 patented the process.\nThe technique was revived and further developed in the 1980s by photographers such as Darwin Dale and Nile Root, a faculty member at the Rochester Institute of Technology. In the early 1990s, William Sharp and Charles Kazilek, both researchers at Arizona State University, also published articles describing their technique and system setup for capturing SLP images.\nPredecessor to stack image photography\nLight Scanning Photomacrography offered a powerful analog tool for high-detail imaging in the age of film photography. It provided a comprehensive depth of field, making it invaluable in scientific and biomedical photography. As technology and techniques continue to evolve, LSP has been replaced by digital image focus stacking. A technique that uses a collection of images captured in series at different focal depths and is then processed using computer software to create a single image that has a greater depth of focus than any single image.\nCapturing an image of a seashell using a scanning light photography instrument.\nLSP technique and results\nLSP involves the use of a thin plane of light that scans across the subject, which is mounted on a stage moving perpendicular to the film plane. The technique utilizes traditional optics and is governed by the physical laws of depth of field. By moving the subject through a narrow band of illumination, the entire subject can be recorded in sharp focus from the nearest details to the farthest ones. This analog process produces sharp and detailed images by slowly recording the image on film as the specimen passes through the sheet of light that is thinner than the effective DOF.\nLight Scanning Photomacrography Depth of Field Diagram. Labels: 1) camera lens, 2) color correction filters, 3) dotted line shows effective DOF, 4) light sheet, 5) motorized stage with specimen.\nBecause the image is captured at the same relative distance from the camera lens, the resulting images are axonometric rather than perspective projection, which is what the human eye sees and is typically captured by a film camera. Because all parts of an LSP image are captured at the same distance from the lens, relative measurements can be taken from an LSP photograph and can be used for comparison.\nEquipment and setup\nA typical LSP setup includes:\nA stage that can move the subject perpendicular to the film plane.\nLight sources, in some cases modified projectors, are used to project a thin plane of light.\nA camera mounted on a stable stand such as a tabletop copy stand.\nIn 1991, Sharp and Kazilek described their SLP system that used three Kodak Ektagraphic slide projectors with zoom lenses to create a thin plane of light. The projectors each had a slide mount with two razor blades placed edge-to-edge to create a thin slit for the light to pass through. The image was captured using a Nikon FE-2 SLR camera mounted above the specimen. Kodachrome 25 slide film was used to record the image and to minimize film grain size and maximize image sharpness \nLight Scanning Photomacrography (LSP), or Scanning Light Photomacrography (SLP) Setup. Labels: 1) film camera 2) copy stand 3) specimen mounted on a motorized stage 4) equipment leveling jacks 5) slide projector.\nCommercial systems\nA commercial SLP instrument was produced by the Irvine Optical Corp. Their DYNAPHOT system was based on a photomacroscope and could capture images on 4x5 film. The instrument came with two or three illumination sources and a motorized specimen stage. The system advertised a 2X \u2013 40X magnification range and the ability to capture images in black and white and color. Other systems have been developed by Nile Root and Theodore Clarke and reported higher magnification (up to 100X).\nDynaphot Light Scanning Images of foraminifers from Escanaba Trough.\nLSP process\nAlignment and Focusing: The light sources are aligned and focused to project a thin, consistent plane of light across the subject\u200b\u200b.\nStage Movement: The subject stage moves at a controlled speed, scanning through the plane of light\u200b\u200b.\nImage Capture: The camera shutter is set to a long exposure or can be opened and closed manually. As the subject moves through the illuminated plane, it is recorded on the film. This process is very much like painting an image onto the film u",

Both books are based on old palm-leaf manuscripts with the same title composed in the form of verses and both contain explanations and illustrative examples.\nThe title \"Asthana Kolahalam\" may be literally translated as \"assembly room (royal audience place) uproar\" and the term \"uproar\" suggests making the audience happy, jovial and cheerful.\nGOML's \"Asthana Kolahalam\"\nAn extract from page 55 of GOML's \"Asthana Kolahalam\" showing Sa\u1e45gamagr\u0101ma M\u0101dhava's value of pi\nGOML's \"Asthana Kolahalam\" publication is based on a single palm-leaf manuscript submitted to GOML in 1921 by one Sankaravenkataramayyangar of Periyakulam. The work contains 57 stanzas of various meters including an invocation stanza. These stanzas specify rules for carrying out elementary arithmetical operations.\nOne interesting feature of this work is that bulk of the work has been devoted to discussing topis in mathematics not contained in the various stanzas of the original manuscript. After completing the explanation of stanza 46 in page 52, the editor embarks on a grand detour of various topics in mathematics and returns to stanza 47 only in page 140. The context for this digression is apparently the value of the mathematical constant pi. The topics covered in this detour include the history of the computations of the value of pi (incidentally, he mentions Sangamagrama Madhava's approximate value of pi also, namely the value 2827433388233/(9 x 1011) ), the various trigonometric functions, formula for the area of a circle, formulas for the surface area and volume of cones, cylinders, etc., formulas for the circumference and area of ellipses, Pythagorean theorem and several related geometrical problems.\nSML's \"Asthana Kolahalam\"\nSML's \"Asthana Kolahalam\" is a work compiled from three different palm leaf manuscripts kept in SML, all having the same title.

    "From July to December, third of a trio\nThe 2024 Hungarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union is the third in a trio of rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union positions currently held by Hungary. Hungary's Presidency of the Council in 2024 is the final nation in the twelfth trio of Council Presidencies together with Spain and Belgium, which began on 1 July 2023 and will last until the end of 2024. It is Hungary's second Presidency of the council, after its first in 2011.\nHungary succeeded Belgium as president on 1 July 2024. The next presidency will be held by Poland starting on 1 January 2025.\nObjectives\nThe Hungarian Presidency stated on its presidency website that it will focus on the following priorities:\nStrengthening the external borders of the European Union and combating illegal immigration\nAddressing the demographic challenges of an aging population in Europe\nPromoting enlargement of the European Union to the Western Balkans\nIncreasing the economic competitiveness of the European Union\nShaping the future of the European Union's regional cohesion policy\nPromoting a \"farmer-focused\" European Union agricultural policy\nStrengthening the European Union's defense policy\nVisual identity\nLogo\nThe Rubik's Cube, a famous Hungarian invention, is used in the presidency's logo as a symbol of ingenuity, creativity and strategic thinking.\nMotto\nThe presidency used the motto \"Make Europe Great Again\", which has been criticized for its resemblance to former US President Donald Trump's campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again\".\nEvents\nUnannounced \"peace missions\" to Kyiv, Moscow, and Beijing\nSee also: 2024 visits by Viktor Orb\u00e1n to Russia and China\nOn July 2, Viktor Orb\u00e1n visited Kyiv and asked Volodymyr Zelenskyy to consider a ceasefire for the Russo-Ukrainian War, encouraging setting a deadline prior to the next Kyiv peace summit in order to accelerate peace talks.\nOn July 5, Viktor Orb\u00e1n made an unannounced visit to Russia in order to discuss possible ceasefire proposals prior to creating peace terms. The meeting was strongly condemned by several European politicians, especially due to Putin referring to Orb\u00e1n as \"a representative of the European Council\" rather than just as a representative to Hungary. Vice-President of the European Commission Josep Borrell responded by saying that Viktor Orb\u00e1n \"does not represent the EU in any way\" for Charles Michel, \"Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim, the rotating EU presidency has no mandate to engage in dialogue with Russia on behalf of the EU\". NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that \"Viktor Orb\u00e1n does not represent NATO at these meetings, he represents his own country\". The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned Orb\u00e1n's visit to Moscow for not coordinating or seeking permission for the visit with Ukraine beforehand.\nFollowing his meeting with Putin, Orb\u00e1n flew to Beijing on 8 July to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, describing the trip as \"Peace Mission 3.0\" in a statement on Twitter.\nFollowing the meetings, several EU diplomats planned to meet in Brussels on 10 July to discuss Orb\u00e1n's meetings and potential actions to take towards him and the rotating presidency. In addition to other EU member states, Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states threatened to boycott EU meetings chaired by Hungary. EU parliament delayed Orb\u00e1n's speech to open the Hungarian presidency to as late as September, which parliament officials claimed was to \"focus on nominees for the European Commission\".\n",
    "River\nNahal Arugot (Hebrew: \u05e0\u05d7\u05dc \u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05d2\u05d5\u05ea, Arabic: \u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u064a\u062c\u0629) is a stream that drains many streams in the center of the Judean desert. The stream is a popular hiking destination located in the Ein Gedi Nature Reserve in Israel. The area offers various hiking trails, suitable for different levels of hikers, and features landscapes, water streams, waterfalls, and historical sites. There are two primary hiking routes in Nahal Arugot: a shorter, family-friendly trail and a longer, more challenging circuit.\nGeography\nNahal Arugot is a large stream with a drainage basin of over 230 square kilometers. The stream begins in the area of Efrat, Migdal Oz, and Beit Fajjar, from where it flows eastward for about 8 kilometers until it enters the desert plateau. At this point, the stream turns south-southeast and continues in this direction for about 30 kilometers, collecting numerous tributaries until it reaches the eastern edge of the plateau. Here, the stream turns directly eastward towards the Dead Sea and the Syrian-African Rift Valley. In this section, it becomes increasingly canyon-like, and in its final kilometers before reaching the Dead Sea, it descends into a massive canyon over 500 meters deep, where spring waters flow year-round.\nThe final section of the stream begins in a narrow, deep gorge interrupted by a high waterfall (Arugot Waterfall). Below Arugot Waterfall, Ein Arugot springs emerge, and from there on, the stream becomes a perennial stream with rich riparian vegetation, including willow trees, Euphrates poplars, common reed, giant reed, Salvadora persica, and jujube trees. In the perennial section of the stream, herds of ibex and large groups of rock hyraxes can be found.\nA hiking trail passes through the final canyon, starting from the reserve parking lot and leading to the \"Hidden Waterfall\" and the \"Upper Pools\" in the stream. Additionally, two challenging trails connect to the stream from the mountains above: Ma'ale Bnei HaMoshavim from the north and Ma'ale HaIssiyim from the south.\nName\nIn Arabic, Nahal Arugot has several names according to its sections:\nThe upper part descending from the Hebron Hills to the desert plateau is called Wadi Jihar (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u062c\u062d\u0631), meaning \"the stream hidden in its hole\". This section is a deep canyon with caves containing remains of prehistoric human activity. The middle part, crossing the Judean Desert plateau, is called Wadi Al-Ghar (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631), meaning \"the stream of the Abraham shrub,\" named after the numerous Abraham shrubs growing there. The deepest and final section of the stream is called Wadi Al-\u2018Arija (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u064a\u062c\u0629), meaning \"the stream that deviated from its path.\" This name is a preservation of an ancient name and has been officially designated by the Government Naming Committee as Nahal Arugot.\nHiking trails in the stream\nShort Hike\nDistance: 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi) (out and back) \nClimb: 150 metres (490\u00a0ft) \nLevel: Easy\nThe short hike begins at the Nahal Arugot ticket office, where hikers walk upstream along the Red Trail. After approximately 1.5 kilometers, there is a junction with a Blue Trail. Turning left onto the Blue Trail, hikers will traverse through the gorge near the stream, sometimes wading in shallow water. This section leads to the \u201cHidden Waterfall,\u201d a 10-meter waterfall that drops into a deep pool, perfect for swimming and relaxing. Hikers can continue another kilometer upstream to explore the \u201cUpper Pools.\u201d The return journey follows the same route or the higher, dry Red Trail.\nLong Hike\nDistance: 8 kilometres (5.0\u00a0mi) (circular) \nClimb: 500 metres (1,600\u00a0ft) \nLevel: Moderate\nThe longer hike also starts at the Nahal Arugot ticket office but heads down the paved road to Tel Goren, the location of ancient Ein Gedi, where the Black-marked trail begins. Hikers ascend the hill to reach the Ein Gedi Spring, a picnic spot with shade and a fresh water pool. Continuing past the spring, the trail passes near the remains of a Chalcolithic temple, leading to the \u201cEin Gedi Ascent,\u201d an ancient path negotiating a steep cliff with views of the Dead Sea.\nFollowing the Black Trail on the desert plateau, hikers make a detour to the Ein Gedi lookout and then proceed to the top of the Nahal Arugot Canyon. Descending the steep trail, they reach the bottom of the canyon and turn right onto a Red-marked path leading to the Hidden Waterfall. After a dip in the pool, the return journey follows the Red-marked trail back to the park entrance.\nPoints of interest\nHidden Waterfall: A 10-meter waterfall dropping into a deep pool.\nUpper Pools: Located further upstream from the Hidden Waterfall.\nEin Gedi Spring.\nChalcolithic Temple: Remains of an ancient temple dating back to 3500 BCE.\nEin Gedi Ascent: An ancient path with historical and biblical significance, providing stunning views of the Dead Sea.\nDesert Plateau and Lookout Points: Panoramic views of the Dead Sea and the surrounding landscape.\nA panoramic view of Nahal Ergot\n",
    "Dutch cognitive psychologist on romantic love\nSandra Langeslag is a Dutch cognitive and biological psychologist who studies romantic love. Langeslag is the director of the Neurocognition of Emotion and Motivation Lab at the University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis. She received her PhD from Erasmus University Rotterdam in The Netherlands.\nStudies by Langeslag using EEG have demonstrated that self-regulating love feelings is possible, especially through a task called cognitive reappraisal. Cognitive reappraisal involves focusing on positive or negative aspects of the partner to change how one feels.\nA 2012 experiment by Langeslag also contradicted a long-running hypothesis in love research which supposed that intrusive thoughts during early-stage romantic love might be caused by decreased serotonin levels. Her experiment found that serotonin levels were differently affected in men and women, and that obsessive thinking in women was actually associated with an increase in serotonin.\nInfatuation and attachment\nSee also: Passionate and companionate love\nA 2012 study by Langeslag and others determined that while the Passionate Love Scale is a commonly used instrument to measure passionate love, some of the questions actually measure companionate love as well. She developed a new questionnaire, the Infatuation and Attachment Scales (IAS), to measure slightly different constructs, which she refers to as infatuation and attachment:\nInfatuation is the overwhelming, amorous feeling for one individual that is typically most intense during the early stage of love (i.e., when individuals are not (yet) in a relationship with their beloved or are in a new relationship). Attachment, on the other hand, is the comforting feeling of emotional bonding with another individual that takes some time to develop, often in the context of a romantic relationship.\nLove regulation\nLangeslag studies love regulation, \"the use of behavioral or cognitive strategies to change the intensity of current feelings of romantic love.\" Cognitive reappraisal is an emotion regulation strategy where one focuses on positive or negative aspects of e.g. the partner, the relationship or imagined future scenarios:\nIn negative reappraisal, one focuses on negative qualities of the beloved (\"he's lazy\", \"she's always late\"), the relationship (\"we fight a lot\") or imagined future scenarios (\"he'll cheat on me\"). Negative reappraisal decreases feelings of infatuation and attachment, but decreases mood in the short term. Langeslag has recommended distraction as an antidote to the short-term decrease in mood.\nIn positive reappraisal, one focuses on positive qualities of the beloved (\"he's kind\", \"she's spontaneous\"), the relationship (\"we have so much fun together\") or imagined future scenarios (\"we'll live happily ever after\"). Positive reappraisal increases attachment and can increase relationship satisfaction.\n",
    "Not to be confused with Shahjadpur Kachharibari.\nBuilding in Kushtia District, Bangladesh\nShilaidaha Kachharibari (Bengali: \u09b6\u09bf\u09b2\u09be\u0987\u09a6\u09b9 \u0995\u09be\u099b\u09be\u09b0\u09bf \u09ac\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09bf) is place where the Tagore family's zamindari activities were conducted. This Kachharibari was built in 1892. This kachari house is also known as Rabindra Kachharibari (Bengali: \u09b0\u09ac\u09c0\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0 \u0995\u09be\u099b\u09be\u09b0\u09bf \u09ac\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09bf).\nHistory\nThe two-storied Kachharibari was built in 1892 on 9.918 acres (40,140\u00a0m2) of land. The management of land rent was conducted from this Kachharibari. The Tagore family used Shilaidaha Rabindra Kuthibari for living, but Rabindranath Tagore managed the zamindari sitting in the Kuthibari. He did not go to Kachharibari without special reason.\nBefore Rabindranath Tagore's zamindari acquisition, there was a separate seating arrangement for Hindus and Muslims in the assembly of the people of the Kachharibari. Rabindranath Tagore abolished this practice. Apart from collecting the zamindari rent, fairs were held in the grounds of this building. Rabindranath Tagore used to visit this fair.\nThe building was under Kushtia District Administration. In 2020, the Kushtia District Administration handed over the building to the Department of Archaeology . The building was the land office of Shilaidah Union for several days. The building is currently abandoned due to its vulnerability. From May 2023, the Department of Archeology started the renovation of the building.\nStructure\nThe Kachari house has a pond and staff quarters. There is a pond on the east side, the horse stables were on the west bank of this pond. Some ruins of the stables are still visible. An iron gate was built at the entrance for security purposes but this too is no more.\nThe two storied building has 4 rooms on the ground floor and 3 rooms on the upper floor. Its architectural design is Indo-European but very simple. The building is 19.47 meters long and 9 meters wide in east\u2013west direction.\nBibliography\n\u0995\u09c1\u09b7\u09cd\u099f\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09a4\u09cd\u09a8\u09a8\u09bf\u09a6\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6\u09a8  (in Bengali) (1st\u00a0ed.). 38/2A Banglabazar, Dhaka 1100: Gatidhara.

    "English religious leader and reformer (1790\u20131855)\nFor the classical scholar, see James Scholefield.\nJames Scholefield (6 April 1790 \u2013 24 April 1855), was an English religious leader, social reformer, undertaker and medical practitioner. He is known for his contributions to the Bible Christian Church, his advocacy for vegetarianism and temperance, and his involvement in the British radical reform movement.\nLife and career\nJames Scholefield was born at Colne Bridge, in the parish of Kirkheaton, Yorkshire, on 6 April 1790. In 1809, he joined the newly established Bible Christian Church, a non-conformist sect founded by William Cowherd. He was educated at Cowherd's Salford Grammar School and Academy of Sciences, covering subjects such as physical science, medicine, astronomy, Latin, Hebrew, and Greek.\nIn 1813, Scholefield was ordained as a minister in the sect and served at Christ Church in Hulme until 1823. Scholefield  founded the Christ Church Chapel in Every Street, Ancoats, Manchester, in 1824. His ministry was characterised by his strong principles; he was a committed teetotaller and vegetarian.\nAround 1851, Scholefield published a pamphlet advocating for vegetarianism. It was translated into German by Emil Weilsh\u00e4user as \"Der Meusch\u2014Kieu Raubthier\". His lifestyle and teachings were influenced by the belief that abstaining from alcohol and meat was integral to a virtuous and healthy life.\nDespite his active ministry, Scholefield did not receive financial compensation for his religious work. Instead, he supported himself through various ventures. He was a successful undertaker and managed a large graveyard adjacent to his chapel. Notably, he developed the \"Safety tomb\" designed to protect graves from robbers, a significant concern at the time.\nIn addition to his work as an undertaker, Scholefield practiced medicine. Although he was not formally qualified, he studied medicine and began practicing before the Medical Act of 1815, which mandated formal qualifications for medical practitioners. He was a trusted figure among the working-class population of Ancoats, known for his practical medical knowledge and his proprietary remedy, \"Scholefield's Cholera Mixture\", which enjoyed popularity for several decades.\nScholefield was deeply involved in the radical reform movements of the early 19th century. He was present at the Peterloo Massacre in 1819 and later, in 1842, he commissioned an obelisk in memory of Henry Hunt, a politician and reformer who played a significant role in the events leading up to the event. In the same year, he allowed the Chartist conference to convene in his chapel. For permitting this, Scholefield was tried at the Lancaster Assizes in 1843. However, he was acquitted.\nTowards the end of his life, he played a prominent role in the Manchester Vegetarian Society, the Short Time movement advocating for shorter working hours, and the Parliamentary and Financial Reform Association. This association united a diverse group of reformers, including Richard Cobden, John Bright, Joseph Hume, and Feargus O'Connor.\nDeath and legacy\nScholefield died on 24 April 1855 and was buried in Every Street churchyard, Ancoats. His gravestone is the only one from that period that remains intact. The Every Street chapel later became associated with the University of Manchester Settlement.\nIn 1934, Mary Stocks wrote and produced a play about Scholefield's life, which was performed in the chapel, celebrating his contributions to the community and his reformist spirit.\n",
    " British physicist (1883-1950)\nJames Arnold Crowther (1883\u20131950) was British physicist who worked on beta particle scattering with JJ Thomson in connection with the first tests of modern atomic physics (see plum pudding model) as well as X-ray scattering including practical applications in medical radiology. He authored numerous textbooks and was a founding Fellow of the Institute of Physics.\nEducation and career\nBorn in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England on Aug. 28, 1883, Crowther attended Cambridge University from 1903 to 1906.\nIn 1906, as the Hutchison Student of St. John's and Open Research Student of Emmanuel, he published \"On the coefficient of absorption of the \u03b2 rays from uranium\" based on work he did under the direction of Thomson. In this work Crowther measured the intensity of radiation from uranium as it passed through various material like mica, cardboard, and especially a series of metal foils. He continued this work for several years with increasingly sophisticated apparatus. Among the important contributions of this work was the introduction of highly collimated beams of radiation and very thin films of metal, enabling a shift from measuring simple absorption values to measuring particle intensity by scattering angle.:\u200a274\u200a Ernest Rutherford together with Hans Geiger and his student Ernest Marsden applied these ideas and others to the scattering of alpha particles from metal foils to discover that the atom has a compact nucleus of charge.\nCrowther continued this work as Mackinnon Student of the Royal Society and then as  Fellow of St. John's through 1924. During this time he wrote \"The life and discoveries of Michael Faraday\".\nDuring the First World War, Crowther collaborated with Alfred Robb to run one of the first diagnostic X-ray labs, at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Later, Crowther became the editor of the Handbook of Industrial Radiology, a lecturer (1921\u20131924) in medical radiology at Cambridge and President of the British Institute of Radiology.\nFrom 1924 to 1946, Crowther was chair of the physics department at University of Reading. During this time, he wrote his popular and influential book Ions, Electrons and Ionising Radiations.:\u200a296\u200a Also during this period, he helped to found the Institute of Physics.\nPersonal life\nCrowther died March 25, 1950, leaving a widow and two sons.\n",
    "This article is about war for ants. For other uses, see War (disambiguation) and Warring (disambiguation).Wars or conflicts can break out between different groups in some ant species for a variety of reasons. These violent confrontations typically involve entire colonies, sometimes allied with each other, and can end in a stalemate, the complete destruction of one of the belligerents, the migration of one of the groups, or, in some cases, the establishment of cordial relations between the different combatants or the adoption of members of the losing group. For some species of ants, this is even a deliberately undertaken strategy, as they require capturing pupae from other species to ensure the continuity of their colony. Thus, there are specific biological evolutions in certain species intended to give them an advantage in such conflicts. In some of these confrontations, ants can adopt ritualized behavior, even governed by certain implicit rules, for example by organizing duels between the most important ants of each colony or choosing a specific location for a battle.\nThese conflicts are not simply internal to ants, which can fight each other even within the same species, but also involve other animals, particularly other eusocial insects like termites or wasps. In the early 21st century, with the rapid spread of many species into new habitats facilitated by human colonization, significant wars are being waged between different supercolonies.\nTerminology\nThe use of the term \"war\", found in scientific literature, is an anthropocentric analogy, derived from human wars.\nCauses and prevalence\nCauses\nThe reasons that can lead ant colonies to clash are varied and depend on the species, locations, and contexts. For a number of them, such as leafcutter ants Atta laevigata, wood ants of the genus Formica, certain species of the genus Carebara, or giant ants Dinomyrmex gigas, it is a matter of territory covered and thus the available food for the different colonies. It can also be related to issues of overpopulation of the same species in the same area at certain times of the year. In other cases, some species aim to capture the pupae of an opposing group to use them in their own colony later.\nPrevalence\nIt is difficult to assess the prevalence of this type of behavior in ants, given the significant diversity of species, behaviors, and different situations. Some species undergo specific evolutions with the sole purpose of engaging in these conflicts, such as Polyergus rufescens, which have sickle-shaped mandibles. The emergence of supercolonies from the 19th century, facilitated by human movements, has certainly reinforced these behaviors in the affected ants. It also seems to depend on the context in which the ants find themselves. For instance, within the same species, a colony facing external threats from another ant colony can produce up to twice as many soldier larvae as a colony not experiencing the same pressures. Some species are almost exclusively on defensive strategies, such as Camponotus ligniperdus, which are peaceful and occupy a small territory but defend it fiercely against any incursion, even against more dangerous or deadly species.\nProcess and outcomes\nProcess\nIn general, there are two main ways ants conduct these conflicts. On the one hand, some species use specific ants that are more powerful and whose primary function is to fight. On the other hand, colonies increase the number of available fighters and send large numbers of individuals into battle. In some species, conflict is ritualized, for example through limited duels undertaken by the individuals most capable of combat, but phenomena of battles are also common. In the genus Formica, such battles are commonplace and can involve tens of thousands of individuals, and they are sometimes ritualized, with the respective groups withdrawing at nightfall only to return the next day to the same locations to resume the battle. The bodies of dead or injured ants are then brought back to the colony, where they are eaten. In other species, such as within the genus Carebara, ants arrange themselves in specific formations before the battle, like phalanxes, and advance against each other. They also regularly sacrifice workers, whose role is to try to hinder, injure, and attack enemy majors, before their own majors join the battlefield and can intervene.\nIn other cases, particularly among ants that aim to capture larvae or pupae, colonies use chemical weapons, such as olfactory propaganda, to try to enter the targeted colonies as discreetly as possible.\nOutcomes\nGenerally, wars between ants are costly for the groups, which must allocate a significant portion of their production to the war effort, to the detriment of forming workers, for example. These wars can result in the death of tens of thousands of individuals within a few hours; for wood ants of the genus Formica, there are regularly 10,000 casualties per day during the spring. For these ants, the wa",

    "2024 single by Ella Langley featuring Riley Green\n\"You Look Like You Love Me\" is a song by American country music singer Ella Langley, released on June 21, 2024 as the fourth single from her upcoming second studio album Hungover. It features American country music singer Riley Green and was produced by Will Bundy. The song is Langley's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100, debuting at number 53.\nBackground\nElla Langley stated in regard to the song, \"I'm obsessed with this song, I think it's so fun. I first wrote it with Aaron Ratiere, and then Riley came in and wrote the second verse. It's a cute little love song and hopefully it'll be someone's wedding song one day. In an interview with Holler, Green said the song was \"one of those things that can only happen out on the road, out on tour, just really organically. I heard the song, and I think she kinda thought maybe it would be a good collaboration with somebody, so I wrote a second verse for it. It's just a really fun song. She does a great job with it, and it's definitely something that I'm sure we'll be doing together.\"\nLangley teased the song on May 13, 2024, through two clips on social media. She and Green also shared snippets of the song on TikTok and performed it during their joint tour.\nComposition\nThe song combines pedal steel guitar with drums in the instrumental and consists of two verses performed in spoken word. In the first verse, Ella Langley's character recounts being lonely during a night in the bar at 22 years old, until falling in love with a cowboy upon spotting him dancing. She walks up to the man, hands him a beer and confesses her love for him, which is depicted in the sung chorus. The second verse finds Riley Green speaking from the man's point of view, in which he returns her affection. The two then sing the next chorus together.\nCritical reception\nMaxim Mower of Holler called the song a \"beautifully retro duet\", writing \"Ella Langley's infuses plenty of swagger and charisma into her vocals, which carry the majority of the track, before Riley Green enters the fray to reciprocate her advances\" and \"Riley's gruff, rugged delivery and the gravitas he brings create the perfect balance with Ella's voice, with the two lacing 'You Look Like You Love Me' with the chemistry needed to make this a convincing, simmering collaboration that oozes sexual tension.\" Casey Young of Whiskey Riff stated, \"Hearing a song written from the woman's perspective when it comes to making the first move is definitely different, especially in the country genre, and I love Ella's fresh take on dating and what's typically 'acceptable.'\" He also commented, \"And obviously, having Riley on it adds such a fun layer in terms of making it a duet, and like I said, I can already see this being a big hit among both of their fan bases. It's already one of my favorite singles released this year, and I'll have it on repeat for the foreseeable future.\"\nCharts\n",
    "French-Algerian colonialist politician\nRobert Martel (5 March 1921 - 21 December 1997), nicknamed \"the Chouan of Mitidja\", was a French-Algerian farmer, counter-revolutionary French nationalist, founder member of the Union Fran\u00e7aise Nord-Africaine (UFNA) then leader of the extreme-right-wing political party the Mouvement populaire du 13-Mai (MP-13) following the coup d'\u00e9tat of 13 May 1958.\nMartel was born in Algiers. His family came from Brittany. He owned 300 hectares of vineyards in the Mitidja plain, in Chebli. He was known as an ultra, a monarchist, a passionate colonialist and Catholic, with nostalgia for the Vichy r\u00e9gime. A member of the poujadiste UDCA shopkeepers' union, in 1954 he joined the fr:Groupe des sept(Group of Seven), a secret anti-independence alliance formed during the Algerian War between leaders of counter-revolutionary groups, poujadist personalities and revolutionary theorists. They infiltrated Gaullist activist fr:L\u00e9on Delbecque's 'Vigilance Committee' with the aim of overthrowing the r\u00e9gime of the French Fourth Republic and placing power in the hands of the army under general Raoul Salan. Martel was also the leader of the Union fran\u00e7aise nord-africaine (French North-African Union) (UFNA).\nHe was one of the main organizers of the coup d'\u00e9tat: Op\u00e9ration R\u00e9surrection commenced with deputy Pierre Lagaillarde ramming the gate of the government building with a lorry before Martel and his supporters took over the building. The next day, Martel tried to have general Salan declared in charge but Delbecque persuaded Salan to finish his speech to the crowd with \"Vive de Gaulle!\" (\"Long live de Gaulle!\"). Despite this setback, Martel continued to protest against Gaullism. The new MP-13 party was formed in June by fr:Lionel-Max Chassin. Martel became a member of the 'Safety Committee' of general Jacques Massu, who had temporary command over civil and military matters in Algeria, with Salan as chair. However, Martel then merged UFNA with MP-13 and took over the latter's leadership in September 1958 while tendering his resignation to Massu from his Committee.\nMartel took part in \"La semaine des barricades\", a week of protests in Algiers from January 24, 1960, with about 20 000 demonstrators and reservists. He declared, \"With Deputy Pierre Lagaillarde, Maurice Crespin and farmers from the Mitidjia Plain, we are entrenched in the university. We will hold out till the end.\" The protests led to significantly increased fighting in the Algerian War with the formation of the Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te (OAS), an underground dissident paramilitary terrorist force of which Martel became a leader of the Constantinois district. An arrest order was issued for him and others and he went into hiding. In March 1961, he was sentenced to five years' prison in absentia for his part in the barricades. After three years, he was arrested in western France on January 21, 1963, and sentenced to a further year for his protest and eighteen months for plotting against the state. His former alliances had not lasted and he claimed to disavow OAS methods. He was released in 1968, following that year's amnesty law. He retired to Poitiers. He died in Bain-de-Bretagne in 1997.\nPortals: France Algeria Politics 1950s 1960s\n",
    "Area of Moscow, Russia\nView of the Olympic Village\nOlympic Village (Russian: \u041e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u044f) is a residential microdistrict in the west of Moscow in the Troparevo-Nikulino area, built in 1977\u20131980 as part of a program to prepare for the XXII Summer Olympic Games for the accommodation of their participants. When designing it, a standard series of residential panel houses was used, and the construction of household buildings envisaged by the project made it possible to transfer the microdistrict to the city after the end of the Olympics. In addition, some of the buildings house cultural institutions.\nHistory\nBackground\nView of the Olympic Village in 1980\nThe issue of constructing the Olympic Village arose after October 23, 1974, when Moscow was approved as the site for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Initially, several projects were proposed for its implementation: one of them involved implementation in round panel houses, but was not accepted due to its high cost. The option of placing it in the Izmailovo hotel complex was also considered, which was rejected due to the remoteness of the hotel from the sports complex in Luzhniki. Ultimately, the choice was made in favor of the project of a group of architects (A. Samsonov, A. Bergelson, V. Korkin and I. Novitskaya) under the leadership of Evgeniy Nikolaevich Stamo, according to which it was formed from sixteen-story panel buildings along with the entire urban infrastructure on 83 hectares along Michurinsky Avenue, south of the village of Nikolskoye.\nConstruction and operation\nThe former administration building\nConstruction of the village began in 1977 and continued until 1980. During this period, 18 residential buildings with 3,438 apartments, 8 children's institutions and 22 buildings for cultural, communal and sports purposes were erected. The perimeter of the residential area was marked with a fence with checkpoints, and wheeled electric trains were launched through the territory. On a section of the Samorodinka riverbed adjacent to the village, a park was organized. In addition, special places were allocated for the religious rites of Christians, Muslims, Jews and Buddhists, and 20 clergy were invited. The settlement of athletes began at the end of June 1980. The official opening, which took place on June 28 at the Square of Nations, was attended by the chairman of the executive committee of the Moscow City Council, Vladimir Promyslov, and the Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games, Ignatiy Novikov. During the Olympics, athletes were moved into apartments in pairs, however, due to the refusal of a number of countries to participate in the Olympics, some houses remained unoccupied.\nWith the end of the Olympic Games, the village was officially closed by its organizers on August 10, and six months later, as planned, it was given to the city. In the spring of 1981, 14.5 thousand residents began moving into the area into apartments that had previously been cleared of interior. In the same year, the authors of the Olympic Village project were awarded the USSR State Prize. The non-residential buildings of the former Olympic Village, which housed the administration and cultural center, were transferred at different times to Moscow cultural institutions. From 2014 to 2017, reconstruction was carried out in the former cultural center. By June 2019, a residential complex was built on the site of the former telephone exchange of the Olympic Village. Also in 2018\u20132019, tennis courts, a football field with artificial turf and an indoor skating rink were built in the microdistrict.\nAdministrative-territorial affiliation\nBy the time construction began, the surrounding territory belonged to the Gagarinsky district.  On July 5, 1991, the municipal district \"Olympic Village\" was formed; on September 12 of the same year it was merged with the district \"Nikulino\". On September 28, 1993, the municipal districts of Nikulino and its neighboring Troparevo were united into a single district \"Troparevo-Nikulino\". According to the city law of July 5, 1995, the Troparevo-Nikulino district was formed.\nLayout and infrastructure\nFormer cultural center\nThe microdistrict is located on Michurinsky Prospekt, between the Olympic Village Park and Shkolnikov Park, on an area of \u200b\u200b83 hectares. 20 hectares were allocated for the residential area, where residential buildings were built, which formed three closed courtyards with rings of greenery planted in them. The courtyards are intersected by the road to the sports, cultural and shopping complexes, which was originally intended to be part of the pedestrian spaces and decorated with spherical lanterns. In parallel, they are accompanied by 2 schools and 4 kindergartens. The shopping complex of the microdistrict is represented by three buildings, including the Lux Gallery, in the area between which a parapet for a fountain was built. On the opposite side of the square there is a memorial plaque. According to the designers, resid",

    "\nThe Qarmatian-Hudhayl conflicts were a series of two military confrontations between the Banu Hudhayl tribe and the armies of the Qarmatians of Bahrain which took place in the 10th century CE. The conflicts, instigated by the earlier Sack of Mecca, ended with Abu Tahir al-Jannabi fleeing from the Hijaz and returning to Bahrain.\nBackground\nMain article: Sack of Mecca\nIn the year 930 CE, the Qarmatians under Abu Tahir al-Jannabi invaded Mecca and raided the Sacred Mosque along with massacring the pilgrims within the building. The Emir of Mecca was killed in the conflict as well. Afterwards, the sanctuary of the mosque was defiled, with the Black Stone stolen from its original spot near the Kaaba. The motives for the attack are not very clear, and historians including Hugh N. Kennedy theorized that the main motive of the Qarmatians was to direct pilgrimage from the Kaaba and to another place, presumably in Bahrain as well.\nCourse of conflict\nFirst attack by Banu Hudhayl\nAfter the Kaaba and its surroundings had been looted enough, Abu Tahir al-Jannabi ordered one of his soldiers to climb up the Kaaba and break off the Mizab al-Rahma, which was essentially a gutter for the Kaaba that was plated in gold. The Hudhayl tribe, who had camped on the top of the Abu Qubays mountain, began their surprise attack by firing arrows at the soldier, killing him. Abu Tahir sent another soldier who met the same fate. After several failed attempts to break off the gutter, the Qarmatians retreated and left the Sacred Mosque.\nSecond attack\nAs the Qarmatians were leaving the Hijaz, a group of the Banu Hudhayl ambushed them relentlessly. Many of the Qarmatian ranks were slaughtered by the Hudhayl, who were eventually able to free the prisoners whom the Qarmatians had taken captive as they were raiding Mecca earlier. After the fighting had died down, the Hudhayl took a large number of camels from the Qarmatians as war booty, before continuing to block any potential exits the Qarmatians could potentially take. Abu Tahir and his soldiers were stranded for a while, until a Bedouin was able to find a safer way for them to exit the Hijaz and return to Bahrain.\nSee also\nAbyssinian raid on Mecca (570)\nSack of Mecca\n",

Md Humayun Kabir is the managing director of the North Bengal Sugar Mills.\nHistory\nNorth Bengal Sugar Mills was established in 1933 by the Messrs Surujmal and Nagrumal during the British Raj. The mill produced bagasse, molasses,  and Sugarcane press mud. In 1965, the government of Pakistan nationalized the mill.\nDuring the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, the Pakistan Army killed 150 staff of the mill including administrator Lieutenant M Anwarul Azim. This was in revenge for a Mukti Bahini ambush on the Pakistan Army at the Gopalpur railway station, later renamed Azim Nagar. The bodies were dumped in a pond at the mill which was later renamed to Shaheed Sagar (martyr sea). Azim was awarded the Independence Award, the highest civilian award of Bangladesh. The incident is called the Gopalpur massacre and commemorated every year.\nIn February 2008, the government stopped production at the mill amidst rising price of sugar.\nNorth Bengal Sugar Mills suspended production in 2010 while facing mounting losses. It lost 120 million BDT that year while missing production target due to low yields.\nThe mill stopped production in February 2012 due to shortage of raw material. Workers of the mill went on strike demanding the mill implement the wages recommended by the National Wages and Productivity Commission.\nThe mill owns  22,729 hectares of farm land and 1.62 billion BDT in assets. In 2014, the mill started a project to develop its facilities to produce refined sugar and electricity at the same time. The project was supposed to be completed in December 2016. It's deadline was extended to June 2021 but the Project Evaluation Committee stopped it in January 2021 and ordered a new survey. Bangladesh Planning Commission blamed the cancelation on poor planning and implementation of Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation.\nBy 2020, North Bengal Sugar Mills along with Natore Sugar Mills were the only state-owned sugars still in production.\nThe mill purchased 48,000 tons of sugarcane in 2021 short of 71,000 ton target. The recovery rate/yield was bellow seven percent. The mill had difficulty sourcing sugarcanes as farmers were selling to illegal crusher plants which offered a higher price for the sugarcanes. Six sugar mills were closed across the country as they were struggling with similar issues. Pabna Sugar Mill supplies sugarcane to North Bengal Sugar Mills.\nIn January 2022, the managing director of North Bengal Sugar Mills, Md Humayun Kabi, stated productivity at the mill was down due to aging machinery due to which resulted in losses for the mill. It made 861.7 million BDT in losses in the 2019-2020 fiscal year. The company indicated that it wanted to produce alcohol like state owned Carew & Co (Bangladesh) Ltd.\nThe Mill stopped production in March 2024 after producing nearly 11 thousand tons of sugar for the season.\n",

Paus lived in Skien until 1876 and then studied engineering at the Royal Technical College in Hanover from 1876 to 1880.\nIn 1881, he established Den Norske Hesteskos\u00f8mfabrik with his brothers Ole and Christian Paus, which became one of the larger industrial companies in Christiania. In 1885, the company purchased the former Foss Spinderi (Foss Spinning Mill) from Thorvald Meyer and co-owners and had factory facilities at Thorvald Meyers gate 1 by the Akerselva; \"H\u00f8nse-Lovisa's house\" (Sandakerveien 2) was also part of the factory complex and is its only remaining building. The company was a member of the Akerselvens Brugseierforening. In 1883, the company opened a branch in London and built a factory in Hamburg. He was the technical director of the company for 37 years, in addition to being a co-owner. By 1889, the company had 158 employees in Christiania. In 1916, the company was transformed into a joint-stock company with a capital of one million kroner; the company announced plans to expand and build an electric steel smelting plant. In 1917, Karl L. Paus and his nephew Thorleif Paus were board members of the Christiania Steelworks. Karl L. Paus stepped down from the leadership of the company in 1918. The company changed its name to A/S Den norske Hesteskofabrik in 1925; in 1926, the business and machinery were sold to the Sarpsborg company De forenede norske hesteskofabrikker, and the properties by Akerselva were repurposed.\nHe was married to Elise Schaft Gj\u00f8r (b. 1868), daughter of the noted physician Herman Gj\u00f8r and Valborg Tostrup, and granddaughter of timber magnate Christopher Tostrup. They were the parents of skier and landowner Herman Paus (1897\u20131983) of Herresta\u00a0Manor, factory owner Eyvind Paus (b. 1900), landowner Karl Paus (b. 1902) of N\u00e4rsj\u00f6 Manor, and Walborg Elise Paus (b. 1907). His daughter-in-law, Countess Tatiana Tolstoy, was the last surviving grandchild of the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy.\nHe took over the Fredensborg estate on Bygd\u00f8y from his father-in-law in 1907. He was an avid hunter and lived for several years later in life on one of his son's estates in Sweden, which had extensive hunting grounds. He also had a property in Vestre Slidre, where he hunted with people like Ivar Fosheim. The family's house on Bygd\u00f8y was seized for use as a guard barracks by Quisling during World War II. After the war, he settled at H\u00f8n in Asker. He is interred at the Cemetery of Our Saviour in the same grave as his father.\n",
    "Austrian photographer\nPaul Albert Leitner (born 1957 in Jenbach) is a photographer from Austria.\nBiography\nPaul Albert Leitner trained as a photographer from 1973 to 1976; in 1984 he moved from Tyrol to Vienna and has worked as a freelance artist ever since.\nHis photography is strongly influenced by his travels, he is said to keep \"a travel diary in the photographic medium\".\nFor photography historian Marie R\u00f6bl, Leitner made a development from \"staged photography, dedicated above all to a 'search for one\u2019s own self-cognizance\u2019 by means of collages, repainting, mirroring techniques, projections and shadow play\u201d, to traditional \u201cstraight photography\". Because of his pronounced drive to collect things photographically and in other ways, \"he has to face an ever increasing torrent of images\u201d and various other items he gathered while travelling, which he deals with \u201cthrough an encyclopedic drive for ordering  and cataloguing his inventory\u201d. \"Kunst und Leben\"  (still separated in the title of one of his early books) were thus interwoven from then on. His series \u201cExkurs \u00fcber das Reisen\u201d , in which he himself often took on the role of fictional characters, could be seen as a transitional phase.\n\nBook editor Rainer Iglar describes Leitner's photographic approach (2018): When he, who always travels and for whom \"photography is the adequate means for the uninterrupted work on a poetic chronicle\", returns home, he goes on \"desk duty\", he arranges and edits his pictures, he makes small prints from his 35mm color films and sticks them on labeled, titled and numbered index cards. Leitner's picture archive - his apartments have always been more like archives - comprises more than seventy thousand pictures from all over the world. Cultural journalist Johanna Hofleitner underlines his insistence on a working process developed for analog photographic workflows.\nIn Leitner's travel photography, it is not \"the exoticism of foreign worlds\" that is decisive factor (Rainer Iglar), but rather \"the recognition of the self\"  (Urs Stahel). In his \"literary\u201d photography, he pursues the \"concept of a staged photograph that tells stories of an almost floating reality with romantic irony (and self-irony).\" In his travel photographs, Leitner repeatedly appears as a protagonist. In these self-portraits, he emphatically adopts a certain pose, which he himself attributes to Gilbert and George, among others, and for which he had a so-called \"travel suit\" specially made.\nWorks by Paul Albert Leitner can be found (among others) in these public collections: Fotomuseum Winterthur, Wien Museum, Belvedere Collection, Vienna\nExhibitions (Selection)\nSolo Exhibitions\n2023 Mein Archiv w\u00e4chst und ich bin 66.

    "Israeli folklorist\nDov Noy\nDov Noy (Hebrew: \u05d3\u05d1 \u05e0\u05d5\u05d9, October 20, 1920 in Kolomyia, Poland - September 29, 2013 in Jerusalem) was an Israeli folklorist. He is considered one of the most important researchers in the field of Jewish folk tales.\nEarly life and education\nDov Noy was born as Dov Neuman on October 20, 1920, in Kolomyia, Galicia (then Poland, now Ukraine). He got a traditional Jewish education and had a private tutor, Jewish poet Shimshon Meltzer\u00a0. He emigrated to Palestine in 1938 and studied Talmud, Jewish history and the Bible at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He served as a volunteer for the British Army Royal Engineers from 1941 to 1945. Most of Noy's family were killed in the Holocaust, with the exception of himself and his brother Meir, who emigrated to Israel in 1948.\nAfter the war, in 1946, Noy got his MA from the Hebrew University. He then worked as a teacher in British internment camps for Holocaust survivors in Cyprus in 1947\u20131949, where he met his brother Meir. From 1949 to 1952, he was part of the editorial team of a children's weekly magazine Davar Le'yeladim.\nHe studied in the United States from 1952 to 1954, first studying comparative literature under Ren\u00e9 Wellek at Yale University before moving to Indiana University. There, he completed his doctoral dissertation under the supervision of folklorist Stith Thompson. Titled \"Motif-Index of Talmudic-Midrashic Literature\", Noy's dissertation analyzed motifs in rabbinic literature. This work was later included into Thompson's six-volume Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, \"greatly raising the status of Jewish folklore in the field\". Noy was the first folklorist who applied the Aarne-Thompson classification to Jewish folklore.\nCareer\nUpon returning to Israel in 1955, Noy began teaching at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, focusing on aggadah. The same year, he founded the Israel Folktale Archives in Haifa, which would go on to collect more than 25,000 Jewish folktales from around the world. The archive was later renamed in Noy's honor. Noy collected and analysed folk tales of multiple Jewish communities, including Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Middle Eastern Jews. The collection of the Israel Folktale Archives have been published in English translation in the series Folktales of the Jews, edited by Noy's student Dan Ben-Amos.\nHe also founded the Folklore Research Center at the Hebrew University and taught Jewish Folklore course there. Noy travelled a lot, giving lectures and attending conferences. In 1985\u201392, he was also the Professor of Yiddish Folklore at Bar-Ilan University.\nRecognition\nIn 2004, Noy was awarded the Israel Prize, the country's highest honor, for his folklore research. In 2002, he got the Bialik Prize. He was called \"The Doyen of Jewish Folkloristics\", and that he \"single-handedly established the study of Jewish Folklore in Israel\".\nNoy passed away on September 29, 2013, in Jerusalem.\nFamily and students\nMeir Noy\nComposer and ethnomusicologist Meir Noy\u00a0 (1922\u20131998), Dov Noy's brother, founded a music archive, the \"Hebrew Song Collection\", in Tel Aviv.\nNoy was married to historian Tamar Noy\u00a0; their son Chaim Noy is a media and communication professor. He was married before, and had two sons, poet Amos Noy and Izhar.\nAmong his students are Heda Jason\u00a0, Dan Ben-Amos, Aliza Shenhar, Eli Yassif\u00a0, Tamar Alexander\u00a0, Haya Bar-Itzhak, and Galit Hasan-Rokem. Noy was known for his \"astounding memory\" and good sense of humor. Noy was fluent in English, Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish, Russian, and German.\nBibliography\nNeuman (Noy), Dov (1954).

    "Norwegian lawyer and government official\nPeder Hansson Paus (1691 \u2013 1759) was a Norwegian lawyer and government official who served as governor and district judge\u2014i.e. the region's foremost government official\u2014of Upper Telemark from 1723 to 1751. He was also known for authoring a cultural and historical description of the district and a glossary of Telemark dialect in 1743. Besides his official duties, he engaged in personal business ventures, including interests in mining.\nBiography\nHe was born in Kviteseid. He belonged to the Paus family and was the son of the parish priest of Kviteseid, Hans Povelsson Paus. His great-grandfather Peder Povelsson Paus came to Telemark in the early 17th century and became provost of Upper Telemark. His mother, Susanne Morland (1670\u20131747), was the daughter of provost Amund Morland and granddaughter of the estate owners Christen Andersen and Anne Gundersdatter of Borgestad Manor. Peder's father is also known for authoring the poem Stolt Anne.\nOn May 21, 1717, he was designated as the successor of his uncle Cornelius Povelsson Paus (1662\u20131723) as governor and district judge of Upper Telemark. The office included both judicial and administrative duties and was the foremost government official of Upper Telemark, a vast region. When his uncle died, Peder Paus assumed the office, which then included the parishes of Fyresdal, L\u00e5rdal, Vinje, Kviteseid (with Brunkeberg, Nissedal, Treungen, and Vr\u00e5dal), and Seljord. However, he had no formal appointment from the king in Copenhagen, and thus took office on his own accord based on his 1717 \"letter of expectation.\" It was only after several years that the king issued a formal letter of appointment. From the time he assumed office, he lived on the Midsund farm in Kviteseid, making Kviteseid the administrative seat of Upper Telemark, a tradition that has continued to this day. He belonged to \"one of the most prominent judge dynasties\" in Norway, with the office remaining in the family for 106 years.\nPeder Paus has been described as a diligent and righteous district judge who distinguished himself with good and independent legal judgments that emphasized common sense and knowledge of human nature. He wrote a cultural-historical description of the district and a glossary of Telemark dialect in 1743. As district judge, Peder Paus also dealt extensively with the larger trading houses at Skiensfjorden, involving property registrations, fees, etc., as reflected in the main books of Herman Leopoldus L\u00f8venskiold and Niels Aall the Elder.\nIn 1745, a consortium including Peder Paus, Niels Aall, the mining secretary Wildhagen, Adam Adamsen Ziener (Peder Paus' later son-in-law), and several members of the von Koss family received permission for the copper deposits at \u00c5mdal. Mining was carried out there by this consortium until shortly after 1758.\nPeder Paus was married first to Cathrine Medea Maj Hermansdatter (died 1736) from Denmark, daughter of the parish priest of \u00d8lsted on Zealand, Herman Arentsen (1647\u20131698), and Gundel S\u00f8rensdatter May. Herman was the son of the well-known topographer, councilor in Copenhagen, and more, Arent Berntsen, while Gundel was the daughter of the provost in Holb\u00e6k, S\u00f8ren Nielsen May, and Catharina Motzfeldt, who in turn was the daughter of the wine merchant and city captain in Copenhagen, Peter Motzfeldt (1584\u20131650). Mother-in-law Gundel May was also a cousin of statesman Peder Griffenfeld. In his second marriage, Peder Paus was married to his cousin Hedvig Coldevin Corneliusdatter Paus (1711\u20131771), daughter of his predecessor as district judge, Cornelius Paus, and Valborg Rafn.\nPeder Paus had two children, both from his first marriage: Anna Susanna Paus (1720\u20131798), married to Adam Adamsen Ziener (born 1709), and his successor as district judge in Upper Telemark, Hans Paus (1721\u20131774). Son Hans Paus was married to the Danish-born Andrea Jaspara Nissen and has numerous descendants.\nPeder Paus bore in his coat of arms a dove with an olive branch in its beak, sitting on a coiled snake.\n",
    "French woman of letters and artist\nPortrait c. 1832 by Sir Thomas Lawrence in the Louvre\nAntoinette Sophie Laure Lain\u00e9 du Vaucel (19 December 1789 \u2013 18 November 1867) was a French woman of letters and an artist. She assisted her step-father Georges Cuvier with his natural history researches and public talks. \nSophie was the daughter of Louis Philippe Alexandre Du Vaucel, Marquis de Castelnau (1749-1794) and Anne Marie Sophie Coquet du Trazail (1764-1849). Her father collected taxes for the French king and was guillotined in 1794 during the French Revolution. Two years later, her mother married Georges Cuvier, who adopted Sophie and the other three children including the naturalist Alfred Duvaucel. Sophie was brought up in a free-thinking Catholic family and at the age of 14 she went to her step-father's home in the Jardin des Plantes. She studied music and drawing like others of her class in the period as well as joined the social conversations of the family. She also met the literati at her step-father's saturday salons. Among the family visitors she met the English lawyer Sutton Sharpe (1797-1843) who courted Sophie. She also corresponded with the French writer \"Stendhal\" who likely used Sophie as the model of his character Mathilde de la Mole in his 1830 novel The Red and the Black. She also accompanied her step-father during his public lectures and acted as his secretary. She also assisted him in arranging the natural history collections, preparing plaster casts of fossils, and making illustrations. She illustrated for Cuvier's Histoire naturelle des poissons. Sophie's knowledge of English also made her the natural companion during Cuvier's visits to England and they met William Buckland in Oxford and William Elford Leach in London. She was engaged briefly to Sutton Sharpe but broke off the engagement. Cuvier died during a cholera epidemic in Paris in February 1832. The next year she married the widower Admiral Ducrest de Villeneuve, adopting three of his children. Sophie would frequently visit her mother in Paris until her from influenza in 1849. Sophie assisted Stendhal in meeting important connections including Countess Abrizzi.\n",
    "Percussionist, performer, composer\nValerie Naranjo (born October 10, 1958), is a percussionist, musicologist, professor, and member of the Saturday Night Live Band. She specializes in the music and percussive instruments of West Africa, particularly the gyil and also excels at the marimba. She has been a touring musician, played with Broadway productions, and composed film scores.\nEarly life and education\nNaranjo was born in Los Angeles. Both parents were Native American, her father was a member of the Southern Utetribe and her mother had Navajo heritage. Music was an important part of her community and her childhood experience and she started playing piano in high school.\nStarting her university studies at the University of Colorado, she took a class with a Ghanaian instructor and first learned of West African keyboard percussion and the gyil. She transferred to the University of Oklahoma and majored in Vocal and Instrumental Music Education. After graduating, she moved to New York City and later pursued a graduate degree at Ithaca College, studying with Gordon Stout.  \nCareer\nIn New York, Naranjo made many opportunities to establish herself as a working musician. She played her 7-foot marimba in the subway system (which resulted in at least two bookings in off-Broadway plays.) She also freelanced and built connections in a wide and active group of musicians in the city that led to work such as touring Europe with The Philip Glass Ensemble between 1988 and 1993. Other performance experience from the first half of the 1990s included work with Ulali, Richard Barone, and David Byrne. She also traveled to and spent time living in South Africa and Zimbabwe where she immersed herself in learning new rhythms and about pacing during energetic percussion performances. (In the late 80s, she had also spent time in Ghana, solidifying her love for and expertise with the gyil.) \nAfter working on The Tempest with director Julie Taymor, Naranjo was asked to be a part of The Lion King in 1996. She was an important part of the creation of the show's sound: selecting instruments to be included in the show's orchestra, auditioning musicians, and helping to write the musical arrangements. Naranjo has performed with The Lion King for over 25 years and it is the highest grossing Broadway musical of all time.\nAround the same time she was establishing the percussive sound of The Lion King, an old friend and musical collaborator, Lenny Pickett, who she met playing music with Philip Glass, asked Naranjo to join the Saturday Night Live Band in 1995. Pickett looked to her to bring lively percussive and fresh sounds to the show during a time the show was struggling to maintain its audiences. She works alongside Shawn Pelton, a drummer, in the band. Her instrument set-up consists of two mallet instruments as well as chime trees, woodblocks, cymbals, congas, bongos, djembe, kpanlogo drum, timbales, and a variety of shakers, among other instruments.\nSince 2011, Naranjo has taught in the New York University Steinhardt School's percussion department. She directs the African Gyil and Percussion Ensemble there.\nNaranjo has performed at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and The White House and was named World Music Percussionist of the Year in 2005 and 2008 by Drum! magazine reader poll.\n",
    "Sikh soldier\nNot to be confused with Misr Diwan Chand.\nDiwan Kirpa Ram (d. 1842), the youngest son of Diwan Moti Ram, was a civil administrator and soldier in the Sikh Empire. \nFamily\nDiwan Kirpa Ram was born into a family with a rich legacy of military and administrative service. His grandfather Dewan Mokham Chand, contributed significantly to the early consolidation of territories that came under the sway of Ranjit Singh. Moti Ram was an honest, well-respected administrator and faithful courtier, who served as the governor of Kashmir for two terms. Diwan Kirpa Ram's brother, Diwan Ram Dayal, was killed in the line of duty while trying to enforce tribute collection from rebellious tribes in Hazara.\nCareer\nKirpa Ram managed the Jalandhar doab while his father, Diwan Moti Ram, was serving in Kashmir. In 1823, Diwan Kirpa Ram participated in the Battle of Nowshera against the Barakzai Afghans in the trans-Indus region on the banks of the river Kabul. He was with the advance troops and played a crucial role alongside Hari Singh Nalwa in securing Sikh dominance against Afghan forces, which underscored his strategic capabilities and military prowess. \n\n\nIn 1827, Diwan Kirpa Ram was appointed the Governor of Kashmir, a post he held till 1831. Despite his success, and like his father before him, Kirpa Ram faced political challenges and intrigues within the Maharaja's court, particularly from rivals like Dhian Singh and Gulab Singh Dogra, who had long been eyeing Kashmir. Accusations of embezzlement led to Kirpa Ram's imprisonment. \nDeparture\nRepeated insults, slights, imprisonment and the imposition of an unjustified exorbitant fine forced Kirpa Ram to apply for permission to join his father in\u00a0Benares. While Moti Ram obtained permission from Ranjit Singh before he left the Sikh Empire for Benares in May 1833, Kirpa Ram applied but got no answer. Tired of waiting, Diwan Kirpa Ram undertook a pilgrimage to\u00a0Jwalamukhi\u00a0and crossed the Satluj into British territory. En route, he was offered a job by the\u00a0Phulkian\u00a0rajas whose state he travelled through, but he refused them.\nAfter Kirpa Ram's departure, Ranjit Singh applauded the capability and intelligence of Dewan Mokham Chand, Moti Ram, Ram Dayal and Kirpa Ram in the Durbar. He attempted Moti Ram's return without success. After Ranjit Singh's demise, his inheritors tried to tempt Diwan Kirpa Ram with money and position but failed.\n",

    "French journalist and video blogger\nHugo Travers (French pronunciation:  \u24d8, born 6 April 1997 in Versailles, Yvelines), better known under the pseudonym HugoD\u00e9crypte (\"HugoDeciphers\"), is a French journalist and YouTuber known for his video reporting and interviewers, which have become a popular source of news for young people in France.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nHugo Travers was born on 6 April 1997 in Versailles, Yvelines, \u00cele-de-France. His father is a British national who works in marketing, while his mother works in human resources. He obtained his baccalaur\u00e9at \u00e9conomique et social (ES) with an option internationale at the lyc\u00e9e Jean-Pierre-Vernant inS\u00e8vres, Hauts-de-Seine. He entered Sciences Po Paris in 2015 and graduated with a master's degree in communications, Media and Creative Industries in 2020. He planned to become a journalist.\nCareer\nRadio Londres\nIn 2012, while still in school, he launched RadioLondres (\"Radio London\"), a current affairs website. The name was chosen in reference to a hashtag on Twitter that shared the results of that year's French presidential election despite the ongoing period of silence.\nHugoD\u00e9crypte\nIn 2015, during his first year at Sciences Po, he created the YouTube channel \"HugoD\u00e9crypte\", which aimed to use short videos to provide \"a journalistic treatment of the news\" for young people.\nOver the next few years, he interviewed multiple candidates for the 2017 French presidential election and later the 2019 European Parliament election (such as Nathalie Loiseau, Beno\u00eet Hamon,\u00a0etc.). He even interviewed French president Emmanuel Macron on the eve of the European elections on 24 May 2019.\nAs part of the YouTube Creators for Change program, he received funding from the company in 2018.\nOn 17 March 2020, Travers launched a daily format tracking the  COVID-19 pandemic named \"Point Coronavirus\". As the subjects covered quickly diversified, the series was renamed \"Actus du Jour\", and has continued, along with a podcast version, to the present.\nHugo Travers in 2020\nTravers founded Frame55, an influencer marketing agency along with content creator Micode and Jean Sabouret in 2020.\nOn 5 February 2021, he interviewed Minister of Higher Education Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Vida live on his Twitch channel about the issues facing students due to university closures.\nBy September 2021, the HugoD\u00e9crypte channel had thirteen staff members, which grew to 20 by 2023, mostly young journalists. As of 2024, the channel has a team of 25 employees.\nOn 23 September 2021, he commented over a political debate broadcast on BFM TV between \u00c9ric Zemmour and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. In response, BFM TV reported him and other streamers on the platform livestreaming their feed, leading to a 48-hour ban being placed on Travers' channel. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon himself expressed support for the streamers.\nOn 4 September 2023, he interviewed Emmanuel Macron about the future of French education, in the context of a ban on the abaya in schools. The exchange, titled \u00ab\u00a0Quel avenir pour les jeunes\u00a0\u00bb (\"What is the future for young people\"), was broadcast live on YouTube and TikTok.\nOn 17 April 2024, he interviewed Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine about the Russo-Ukrainian War.\nMashup\nOn 13 January 2022, Travers launched a weekly talk-show named \"Mashup\"\u00a0that is broadcast on Twitch.\nElan\nOn 31 March 2024, he\u00a0launched a digital media company named \"Elan\" focused on introducing youth to the workforce. Additionally, a job search platform for young people was launched. Elan launched with content on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and LinkedIn, with further expansion in the works.\nTelevision\nDuring the 2017 French presidential election, Travers was a commentator for the TV channel LCI on Christophe Jakubyszyn's show.\nIn March 2019, he debated Marine Le Pen over the topic of \"fake news\" for the show L\u2019\u00c9mission politique on France 2.\nTravers debated Sarah El Ha\u00efry, the secretary of state for youth, on the subject of student anxiety caused by COVID-19-related university closures for Bruce Toussaint's show on BFM TV. Some internet commenters criticized El Ha\u00efry for using the informal tu (thou/you) pronoun to address Travers during the debate.\nStarting in October 2023, he hosted a show with longer-form (30-minute) interviews on France 2 titled HugoD\u00e9crypte\u00a0: L'interview face cach\u00e9e, as part of a shift by public broadcaster France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions to increase youth appeal.\nRadio\nBetween 2018 and 2019, he worked as a commentator on Europe 1.\nReception\nHis status as a journalist and the applicability of the moniker \"decryption\" for his program, which can be likened to a press review, have been questioned.\nTravers has been praised for making information accesbile to young people.\nOn the other hand, his interview with his friend Squeezie for France 2 was criticized as self-serving and promotion by T\u00e9l\u00e9rama.\nHe has also been criticized for political interviews with contradictory statements or lacking, parcitularly by overcondensing talking points.\nAccolade",
    "English clergyman and translator\nAaron Thompson (1681 or 1682 \u2013 27 July 1751) was an English clergyman from a Cumberland family who served as vicar of Broad Chalke in Wiltshire from 1724 until his death.  He is best known for his only book, The British History, Translated into English from the Latin of Jeffrey of Monmouth. With a Large Preface concerning the Authority of the History (1718).  This was the first, and for the better part of 200 years only, translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae.\nParentage\nAaron Thompson was apparently born in 1681 or 1682, the youngest son of George Thompson, owner of the estate of Farmanby, north east of Penrith in Cumberland.  George Thompson came from a Cavalier and therefore presumably Church of England family, but his wife Jane, daughter of William Jameson of Parkhead, Kirkoswald, from a Presbyterian one; both were excommunicated for recusancy in 1666, though George seems to have later returned to the Church of England.\nEducation and career in the Church\nGeorge Thompson died while Aaron was still a child, leaving him \u00a3100 in his will, but when Aaron entered Queen's College, Oxford on 27 January 1700 and matriculated on 2 July 1700 he was entered in the university records as a pauper puer, \"poor boy\". In 1705 he gained his Bachelor of Arts degree, and that seems to have marked the end of his education.  He found a patron in Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington, who made him a domestic chaplain.  In 1724 he was made vicar of All Saints Church, Broad Chalke, Wiltshire, and he retained that office until his death on 27 July 1751.  He was buried at Broad Chalke on 1 August.  A one-paragraph obituary of him published by The London Evening-Post, a Tory and High Church newspaper, described him as \"a sound and universal Scholar, of the strictest Piety, and firmest Integrity\", and deplored the machinations of \"corrupt Party and sordid Interest\" in depriving him of the Church preferment he deserved.\nPersonal life\nThompson married twice and had at least four children.  By his first wife, whose name is not known, he had a daughter named Tabitha.  On 5 December 1734 he married his second wife, Jane Ryman, in St Mary's Church, Litton Cheney, Dorset.  By her he was father of Daniel, Jane and Henry.\nThe British History\nThompson is chiefly remembered for having published in 1718 the first translation into Modern English of the 12th-century pseudohistorian Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, impelled thereto, he said, by the requests of various of his friends.  Though Thompson claimed in his preface to have consulted several manuscripts of the Historia and the 1517 edition by Josse Bade, his was essentially a translation of the highly inaccurate 1587 edition by Jerome Commelin.  It included, as his title-page said, \"a large Preface concerning the Authority of the History\", and also an appendix explaining the work's place-names.  It was, in the judgement of Lewis Thorpe, by far the most sound of the Historia's translations until the 20th century.  Though Thompson translated all of Geoffrey's prose himself, for the short poem in Book I in which Brutus of Troy addresses the goddess Diana he turned to his London neighbour Alexander Pope, who obliged with an eight-line version, \"Goddess of Woods, tremendous in the Chace\".  It has been suggested that Pope also gave him the translation of Diana's verse reply, \"Brutus there lies beyond the Gallick Bounds\", though this is pure speculation.\nIn his preface Thompson argues that the Historia was indeed, just as Geoffrey claimed it to be, a Latin translation from an ancient British book rather than an original composition, and that it was a credible historical source.  He focussed especially on the essential truth of its account of the founding of the British nation by the Trojan refugee Brutus and his followers.  This defence of the Historia, which seems to have been motivated by his patriotic feelings, is based on Robert Sheringham's ingenious but naive treatise De Anglorum Gentis Origine Disceptatio (1670), and gives little evidence of historical erudition on Thompson's own part.  It ignores the scholarship of his own day, which had disproved many of the arguments he used, and which had established that Geoffrey's work was of little use to the historian.  The antiquary Thomas Hearne (1678\u20131735) was consequently to dismiss Thompson as \"but a Dabbler\".\nBy 1782 Thompson's British History was described as \"not commonly to be met with\", but in 1842 a new edition by J. A. Giles appeared which claimed that \"the translation of Thompson has been followed, revised and corrected wherever the phraseology appeared to be unsuited to the more accurate ears of today\".  In fact, Thompson's text was left largely untouched.  Not until 1896, almost two centuries after Thompson's British History, did an entirely new translation of the Historia appear, by Sebastian Evans.  During this period the influence Thompson's work exercised on mal",
    "1831 Anglo-Sikh meeting in Ropar, Punjab\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh by Jewan Ram, an artist from Delhi, accompanied the Governor General to Ropar.\nThe Ropar Meeting in October 1831 was between Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Lord William Bentinck, Governor-General of the East India Company, on the banks of the river Satluj, in a town of the same name.  Ranjit Singh's fame had reached its peak, attracting the attention and friendship of sovereigns from afar.\nLord William BentinckLady William Cavendish-Bentinck\nBackground\nThe Ropar Meeting highlighted the camaraderie between Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire and the East India Company, which governed Hindustan. The grandeur of the Sikh display prompted a British historian to compare it to the Field of the Cloth of Gold.\nThe agenda of both powers differed significantly. Ranjit Singh aimed to secure recognition for his son, Kharak Singh's accession,  and sought the Company's response to his plans to annex Sindh. At the same time, the Company harboured suspicions that Ranjit Singh had initiated communication with Russia. The East India Company was preparing to court him, recognising him as essential to realising it's expanding aspirations for 'rightful influence' and lucrative commerce. It wanted Ranjit Singh to permit trade access through the Indus and Satluj rivers.\nThe Satluj defined the border of the Sikh Empire with British East India Company-controlled Hindustan\nThe Treaty of Amritsar, signed by Ranjit Singh and the Company in 1809, constrained Sikh expansion south of the Satluj and prevented the Company from extending north of it. Sindh, located south of the Satluj, was a matter of interest due to the flow of the Satluj's waters after it left the Punjab. The Satluj joined the Panjnad before reaching the Indus near Mithankot, at which place it left the Sikh Empire and entered Sindh. The Treaty did not address the issue of territorial control along the Satluj's route to the Arabian Sea. The events following the Ropar Meeting showed that the East India Company misinterpreted the 1809 treaty to suit their own convenience.\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century, the historical land trade route from the plains of Hindustan to Afghanistan ran through the Sikh Empire. Other overland routes were considered unsafe and circuitous. The East India Company aimed to gain waterway access through Sikh territory to facilitate sea trade from Bombay to Attock via the Indus River. From Attock, goods could be transported up the Kabul River. Caravans would carry the goods through the Khyber Pass to Kabul and to markets in Bokhara, Khorasan, and Iraq, providing competition to Russian goods.\nThe precursor to the meeting\nIn April 1831, four months before the Ropar Meeting, Ranjit Singh deputed a mission to Shimla to felicitate the Governor-General. The Sikh delegation was the first foreign mission hosted by Lord Bentinck as Governor-General.\nRunjeet Singh and his Suwarree. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, depicted on horseback, stands as the central figure, surrounded by the Sikh cavalry. The foreground features elephants and camels. Ropar, 1831.\nClaude Martin Wade, the British agent appointed by the East India Company to oversee Sikh affairs, was tasked by the Governor-General to organize the meeting.\" All correspondence regarding the proposed meeting was kept confidential because it would have been inappropriate for the Governor-General to appear overly eager to initiate such discussions. \nThe meeting\nWilliam Bentinck and his extensive entourage descended from Shimla in the Himalayas to Ropar on the plains of Punjab. Ropar, a small town situated on the banks of the river Satluj, was under the control of Bhup Singh, a Sikh chieftain loyal to the East India Company.\nThe parties had determined to encamp on \u2018their side\u2019 of the river Satluj. Both parties constructed their bridge of boats to facilitate passage across the river. Commandant Chet Singh supervised the bridge on behalf of the Sikhs and Lieutenant Frederick Mackeson did the same for the Company. The Governor-General reached Ropar on the evening of the 22nd, two days before Maharaja Ranjit Singh did. Maharaja Ranjit Singh arrived on the morning of the 25th to a 101-gun salute.\nInvitations were extended, salutes fired, ceremonial exchanges and gift-giving took place, followed by displays of military prowess and feasting with entertainment. Amidst all this, discussions commenced.\nConversations occurred in three languages\u2014Punjabi, Persian, and English. Ranjit Singh conveyed his message in Punjabi to Fakir Azizuddin, who translated it into Persian for Captain Wade. Wade then rendered the communication into English for the Governor-General. Throughout the proceedings, Captain Wade served as interpreter and master of ceremonies.\nAlexander Burnes, an East India Company employee, remarked, \"The English gentlemen appeared a sorry contrast to the gilded splendor of the Sikhs' elephants.\" Upon noticing this difference, Ranjit Singh invited the ",
    "American psychologist\nPeter W. Graham is a professor of physics at Stanford University.\nEarly life\nGraham was born to Wayne Wickelgren and Norma Graham. He has 4 siblings including mathematician Kirsten Wickelgren and American lawyer Abraham Wickelgren. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School. He is grandson of psychologist Frances K. Graham and great-grandson of surgeon Evarts Ambrose Graham.\nEducation\nGraham attended Harvard University, graduating with an AB and AM in 2002. He studied physics. He received a Ph.D. in physics from Stanford University in 2007. He was advised by Savas Dimopoulos.\nCareer\nGraham became an assistant professor at Stanford in 2010.\nHe is interested in physics beyond the Standard Model, both theoretically and through proposals for novel experiments using techniques from astrophysics, atomic physics, and solid-state physics.\nHe proposed, with Surjeet Rajendran and others, the Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment (CASPEr), which aims to detect axions as candidates for dark matter using NMR, and the DM Radio Pathfinder Experiment, which aims to search for dark matter in the hidden photon and axion sector using magnetometry and electromagnetic resonance. He also proposed, with Rajendran and others, to detect gravitational waves using atom interferometry.\nTogether with David Kaplan and Surjeet Rajendran, he proposed a solution to the hierarchy problem with dynamic relaxation in the early universe instead of, as is usually the case, with new physics (such as supersymmetry, extra dimensions) on the electroweak scale of the Standard Model (or the Anthropic Principle ). According to Graham's model, the relaxation field that determines the inflation dynamics also determines the Higgs mass, and the value of the relaxation field today is close to one of its many local minima. At the beginning of the universe, however, it had much higher values, with an associated Higgs mass possibly on the Planck scale. In the simplest version, the model of Graham and colleagues includes, in addition to the Standard Model, inflation and a QCD axion that is identified with the relaxation. As soon as the quarks acquire mass via the Higgs field, the axion/relaxion field is conversely frozen by interaction with the quarks. The model was inspired by a similar mechanism that Larry Abbott used in 1984 to explain why the cosmological constant is so small. The simplest version of the model, which identifies the relaxation ion with the axion, has been criticized by others and probably needs to be modified. The axion is already a candidate for dark matter and was originally introduced as a solution to the strong CP problem in the Standard Model. The model of Graham and colleagues also attracted attention because no supersymmetric particles, which until then were considered the most promising explanation of the hierarchy problem, had been discovered at the LHC.\nIn 2017, he received the New Horizons in Physics Prize with Asimina Arvanitaki and Surjeet Rajendran for developing new experimental tests of physics beyond the Standard Model. In 2014, he received an Early Career Award from the Department of Energy and was a Terman Fellow at Stanford.\nPersonal life\nGraham has 2 children with his wife Lauren Graham, named Keira and Ashley.\n",
    "Football match between FC Flora and FCI Levadia\nThe Tallinn derby (Estonian: Tallinna derbi) is the name given to a football rivalry between FC Flora and FCI Levadia, two clubs based in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. First contested in 1999, the fixture is considered to be the fiercest rivalry in Estonian football, with Flora and Levadia being the two biggest and most successful football clubs in the country.\nAlthough Levadia was originally founded in Maardu, the club moved to Tallinn in 2000 and officially affiliated themselves with the capital city in 2004. Since 2019, the two clubs share their home ground A. Le Coq Arena. During winter and early spring months, the matches take place at Sportland Arena, as natural grass grounds are not playable during the period due to the region's harsh winter climate.\nIn the past, language and nationality were also one of the separating factors between the two clubs, as Levadia was seen as the club of choice for the Russian-speaking population of the city and Flora for the Estonian-speaking. While Flora has remained to represent Estonian nationalism and only plays with Estonian players, Levadia is no longer affiliated with Russian-speaking culture and is more of an international club, often relying on international players on the pitch. Thus, the cultural divide between the two clubs has diminished significantly.\nHistory\nBackground\nThe history of the two clubs dates back to the 1990s, when Estonia had restored its independence (1991) after half a century long occupation under the Soviet Union, and began rebuilding its society. A rebuild also took place in Estonian football, where the nation had previously isolated themselves from the sport for 14 years. FC Flora was founded in 1990 by Aivar Pohlak with the aim to restore and develop Estonian football and its culture through playing with native Estonian players, and soon the club established itself as the dominant force in the country. In October 1998, local Ukrainian steel industry businessman Viktor Levada founded FC Levadia in Tallinn's majority Russian-speaking suburb Maardu, and the club quickly earned promotion to the top division. Contrary to Flora, Levadia began playing with mostly local Russian players, laying the groundwork for a cultural rivalry between the clubs.\nBeginning of a rivalry\nDespite being the league newcomers, Levadia were considered as one of the main title contenders against the reigning champions Flora already before the start of the 1999 season. The first match between the two teams took place on 28 April 1999 in Maardu, when hosts Levadia drew 1\u20131 with Flora in the Estonian Cup semi-final first leg. Their first meeting in Meistriliiga took place less than a month later, on 22 May 1999, when Levadia held the reigning champions Flora to a 0\u20130 draw. The season commenced with Levadia winning the treble. In 2000, Levadia moved to Kadriorg Stadium in Tallinn and officially affiliated themselves with the capital city in 2004.\nIn addition to the sporting rivalry, language and nationality also became one of the separating factors between the two clubs in the early 2000s. While Flora was seen as a club that represented Estonian nationalism, Levadia's creation coincided with the dissolution of FC Lantana, a club previously supported by Tallinn's Russian minority, resulting in Levadia becoming the club of choice for the Russian speaking population of the city. Since 2010s, that cultural divide between the two clubs has diminished significantly.\nStatistics\nPlayer records\nAs of 3 July 2024. Active players currently playing for Flora or Levadia in bold.\nStadiums\nAs of 2024, the majority of the Tallinn derby league matches have been played at A. Le Coq Arena (over 40 matches). The two clubs also share Sportland Arena, the artificial turf stadium used during winter, which has hosted around 20 league derby matches. In addition to the two regular stadiums, 29 derby matches have been held at Kadriorg Stadium, five at Maarjam\u00e4e Stadium, three at Maarjam\u00e4e Stadium's artificial turf, two at Maardu linnastaadion, one at M\u00e4nniku Stadium's artificial turf and one at Viimsi Stadium.\nNotes\n^ In 1969, Estonia desisted from participating in the Soviet Union championship, resulting in native Estonians desisting from practicing football and local championships being played by teams consisting of local Russians. Such isolation lasted for 14 years, making Estonia practically the only nation in the world where football was not played for such a long period of time.\n",
    "American slave trader\nJohn W. Lindsey was a slave trader based in Montgomery, Alabama, United States in the 1840s and 1850s.\nBiography\nFrederic Bancroft described the nature of the Montgomery slave market in his 1931 history Slave-Trading in the Old South: \nMontgomery, the capital of Alabama and a good shipping-point, attracted politicians, planters and much general business, although in 1860 its total population was less than 9,000, of whom more than half were slaves and 102 were free colored. Its slave-trade was patronized chiefly by the central part of the State, for northern Alabama drew supplies from markets in other States, and Montgomery traders had competitors in Columbus, Georgia, on the east, Selma on the west, and Mobile on the southwest. Yet the capital did a thriving trade in slaves. The City Directory for 1859 listed four 'slave depots' along with the same number of banking establishments, whereas for the joyful visitors to the first capital of the Confederacy in February, 1861, there were only four regular hotels.\nAccording to the 1950 history Slavery in Alabama, the records of the Montgomery County probate court clearly reveal the names of the major slave traders working in the city, as they would return year after year to harvest unwanted slaves from the estates of the dead and carry them off to be resold. The names of traders and trading firms that recurred most frequently in records dating from 1838 to 1860 were Hill & Hartwell, Williamson & Puryear, Brown & Watson, Mason Harwell, and Lindsey.\nA runaway slave ad placed by H. M. Waters of Coffee County, Alabama in 1851 sought the return, for a reward of $30, of his slaves Joe and Adeline, about whom he wrote, \"Joe is about 6 feet 8 inches high, and about 35 years of age, rather a bright colored negro, and has had the small pox. Adeline is of medium size, black, and has a downcast look when spoken to, and is about 32 years of age. I purchased the above negroes from Lindsey, a negro trader in Montgomery. They may possibly be making for that place or Prairie Bluff on the Alabama river.\"\nLindsey advertised his business in the newspaper throughout 1852 and 1853, and one of the \"100 Negroes for Sale\" ads caught the attention of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who included it in her non-fiction polemic, A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin. She reprinted it, with the commentary, \"Mr. Lindsey is going to be receiving, from time to time, all the season, and will sell as cheap as anybody; so there's no fear of the supply falling off...Query: Are these Messrs. Sanders & Foster, and J. W. Lindsey, and S. N. Brown, and McLean, and Woodroof, and McLendon, all members of the church, in good and regular standing? Does the question shock you? Why so? Why should they not be? The Rev. Dr. Smylie, of Mississippi, in a document endorsed by two Presbyteries, says distinctly that the Bible gives a right to buy and sell slaves.\" \nSee also\nHistory of slavery in Alabama\nList of slave traders of the United States\nSlave markets and slave jails in the United States\nBibliography of the slave trade in the United States\n",
    "\nSwearing Allegiance to the Southern Cross by Charles Doudiet (1854)\nThis is a list of British colonial forces of Australia that took part in the Battle of the Eureka Stockade in 1854 at Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It was the culmination of the 1851\u20131854 Eureka Rebellion during the Victorian gold rush. The fighting resulted in at least 27 deaths and many injuries, the majority of casualties being rebels. The miners had various grievances, chiefly the cost of mining permits and the officious way the system was enforced. There was an armed uprising in Ballarat where tensions were brought to a head following the death of miner James Scobie. On 29 November 1854, the Eureka Flag was raised during a paramilitary display on Bakery Hill that resulted in the formation of rebel companies and the construction of a crude battlement on the Eureka lead.\nFortification of the Eureka lead\nMain article: Eureka Stockade (fortification)\nAn exhibit in the 1855 Victorian High Treason trials being a plan of the Eureka Stockade\nFollowing the oath swearing and Eureka Flag raising ceremony on Bakery Hill, about 1,000 rebels marched in double file to the Eureka lead, where the Eureka Stockade was constructed over the next few days.  It consisted of pit props held together as spikes by rope and overturned horse carts. Raffaello Carboni described it in his 1855 memoirs as being \"higgledy piggledy\". It encompassed an area said to be one acre; however, that is difficult to reconcile with other estimates that have the dimensions of the stockade as being around 100 feet (30\u00a0m) x 200 feet (61\u00a0m). Contemporaneous representations vary and render the stockade as either rectangular or semi-circular. Testimony was heard at the high treason trials for the Eureka rebels that the stockade was four to seven feet high in places and was unable to be negotiated on horseback without being reduced.\nLieutenant governor Charles Hotham feared that the goldfield's terrain would greatly favour the rebel snipers. Ballarat gold commissioner Robert Rede would instead order an early morning surprise attack on the rebel camp. Carboni details the rebel dispositions along:\nThe shepherds' holes inside the lower part of the stockade had been turned into rifle-pits, and were now occupied by Californians of the I.C. Rangers' Brigade, some twenty or thirty in all, who had kept watch at the 'outposts' during the night. \nThe location of the stockade has been described by Eureka veteran John Lynch as \"appalling from a defensive point of view\" as it was situated on \"a gentle slope, which exposed a sizeable portion of its interior to fire from nearby high ground\".\nIn the early hours of 1 December 1854, the rebels were observed to be massing on Bakery Hill, but a government raiding party found the area vacated. The riot act was read to a mob that had gathered around Bath's Hotel, with mounted police breaking up the unlawful assembly. A three-man miner's delegation met with Rede to present a peace proposal; however, Rede was suspicious of the chartist undercurrent of the anti-mining tax movement and rejected the proposals as being the way forward.\nThe rebels sent out scouts and established picket lines in order to have advance warning of Rede's movements and a request for reinforcements to the other mining settlements. The \"moral force\" faction had withdrawn from the protest movement as the men of violence moved into the ascendancy. The rebels continued to fortify their position as 300-400 men arrived from Creswick's Creek, and Carboni recalls they were: \"dirty and ragged, and proved the greatest nuisance. One of them, Michael Tuohy, behaved valiantly\". Once foraging parties were organised, there was a rebel garrison of around 200 men. Amid the Saturday night revelry, low munitions, and major desertions, Lalor ordered that any man attempting to leave the stockade be shot.\nBattle of the Eureka Stockade\nMain article: Battle of the Eureka Stockade\nEureka Slaughter by Charles Doudiet (1854)\nA map of the stockade and the opposing forces\nBallarat gold commissioner Robert Rede planned to send the combined military police formation of 276 men under the command of Captain John Thomas to attack the Eureka Stockade when the rebel garrison was observed to be at a low watermark. The police and military had the element of surprise timing their assault on the stockade for dawn on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath day of rest. The soldiers and police marched off in silence at around 3:30 am Sunday morning after the troopers had drunk the traditional tot of rum. The British commander used bugle calls to coordinate his forces. The 40th regiment was to provide covering fire from one end, with mounted police covering the flanks. Enemy contact began at approximately 150 yards as the two columns of regular infantry and the contingent of foot police moved into position.\nAccording to military historian Gregory Blake, the fighting in Ballarat on 3 December 1854 was not one-sided and full of indiscrimina",

Upon realizing that people may forget important news events, he decided to change his career to writing.\nKawai stated that it took about six months to write a draft of the English translation, and that she had to do background research on the events.\nPlot\nIt is about Kazumasa Yuuki (\u60a0\u6728 \u548c\u96c5, Y\u016bki Kazumasa), a news reporter trying to deal with the fallout from Japan Airlines Flight 123, a 1985 aircraft disaster. The opening portion of the novel is Yuuki revisiting the crash site in 2003, but most of the work covers Yuuki's role in the events during 1985, when the crash occurred and when Yuuki investigated the crash. The narrative alternates between the two time periods, which are seventeen years apart.\nIn the 1985 portions Yuuki worked for the North Kanto Times (NKT), a fictional newspaper. His company urged him to take the JAL123 assignment because Yuuki had hiterto refused to be promoted to a managerial role, something the company had disliked. Yuuki was supposed to go climbing on Mount Tanigawa with a friend that day, but not only was he covering the JAL123 incident, but his friend had a medical incident and ended up in a coma. The disaster also showed how different people working for the North Kanto Times reacted differently to the events. Yuuki had to navigate and respond to ethical dilemmas in his profession.\nIn the \"present\" portion of the novel, Yuuki takes his friend's son on Mount Tanigawa. Additionally, Yuuki had at one time abused his son, and in the \"present\" parts of the novel, is trying to mend his relationship with him.\nReception\nIain Maloney of The Japan Times described it as \"fantastic\" and a \"page turner\".\nTom Nolan of the Wall Street Journal wrote that he agreed with the advertising of the novel being, in the advertisement's words, \"tense, powerful\".\nTara Wilson Redd wrote in the Washington Times that at times there is \"dryness\", particularly regarding descriptions of the journalism business; she argued the conclusion makes the book worth reading through more boring portions.\nPublishers Weekly wrote that the work is \"engrossing\" and \"accessible\".\nAdaptation\nThere is a film adaptation, titled Climber's High.\nSee also\nOther works by Yokoyama:\nPrefecture D\nSix Four\nOther works about JAL123:\nDealing with Disaster in Japan - A non-fiction book\nOther books translated by Louise Kawai:\nThe Cat Who Saved Books\nMs Ice Sandwich\n",
    "Orthodox Jewish Rabbi, Rosh Yeshiva\nRabbi Aaron Lopiansky, also known as Rav Ahron, is an Orthodox Jewish scholar, author, and educator who currently serves as the Rosh HaYeshiva of the Yeshiva of Greater Washington \u2013 Tiferes Gedaliah. Known as one of the world's foremost experts in Jewish philosophy, he is renowned for his extensive contributions to Jewish thought and Torah education. He has written more than 20 works on Torah thought, liturgy, and philosophy.\nHe is a son-in-law of Rav Beinish Finkel, longtime Rosh HaYeshiva of the Mir Yeshiva (Jerusalem).\nEarly life and education\nRav Aharon was born and raised in New York's Lower East Side, where his parents, both Holocaust survivors, settled after the war. His father had lost a wife and children in Europe.\nHis upbringing was deeply influenced by his parents' experiences and their strong commitment to Jewish education and values. Growing up, he was immersed in a world of Torah learning and was encouraged to pursue a path of scholarship and spiritual growth. His father, a noted scholar, played a significant role in his early education, instilling in him the values of perseverance and dedication to Torah study.\nHe attended the local Rabbi Jacob Joseph School (RJJ), where he was taught by Rav Zeidel Epstein in the 11th grade. During his time at RJJ, Rav Aharon excelled in both his religious and secular studies, achieving high scores on statewide tests. However, towards the end of his high school years, he was influenced by several individuals to pursue full-time Torah learning.\nHis formal rabbinic training began at the Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem, one of the most prestigious yeshivas in the world. Under the guidance of renowned scholars such as Rav Chaim Shmuelevitz and Rav Nachum Partzovitz, Rabbi Lopiansky developed a deep understanding and appreciation for Torah learning. He was also greatly influenced by his father-in-law, Rav Beinish Finkel, the late Rosh Hayeshiva of the Mir, and by his close association as a talmid (student) of Harav Moshe Shapiro.\nCareer\nRabbi Lopiansky began his teaching career at Aish HaTorah in Israel, where he taught from 1983 to 1990. He then taught at his alma mater, the Mir Yeshiva, for five years, delivering the most advanced Gemarah shiur at the Yeshiva. During his time in Israel, he was extremely active in the cause of Soviet Jewry, traveling to the Soviet Union on numerous occasions and serving on resettlement organizations in Israel that assisted Soviet refuseniks in acclimating to Israeli life.\nIn 1994, the mechanech (headmaster) of the Yeshiva of Greater Washington reached out to Rav Aharon, who was then serving as a maggid shiur at Mir Yerushalayim, with an offer to become the Rosh HaYeshiva of the Yeshiva Gedolah in Kemp Mill, Maryland. After spending most of the 1980s delivering advanced Gemara shiurim at Aish HaTorah's Jerusalem campus, Rav Aharon was intrigued by the opportunity, despite the significant challenge it posed, including uprooting his family for an uncertain future in a young institution.\nRav Aharon initially moved to America alone, enduring a demanding cross-continental commute for six years, ensuring he was never away from home for more than three consecutive Shabbosim.\nIn August 2001, his wife, Rebbetzin Yaffa Lopiansky, daughter of Rav Beinish Finkel, along with their four children, joined him in Kemp Mill.\nActivities and contributions\nRabbi Lopiansky is recognized for his extensive work in Jewish outreach and education. He played a significant role in teaching and aiding Soviet Jewry, being one of the teachers who traveled to the Soviet Union to disseminate Torah knowledge. He was also involved in helping their physical and spiritual relocation to Israel. In addition to his work with Soviet Jewry, Rabbi Lopiansky taught in the Israeli Army's Hishtalmut program, which aims to broaden the perspective of the army's officer corps by exposing them to the diverse facets of Israeli society. He is a founding editorial board member of Klal Perspectives and an editorial board member of Dialogue.\nPublications and lectures\nRabbi Lopiansky is a prolific author, having written more than 20 works on Torah thought, liturgy, and philosophy. His writings contribute to the Encyclopedia Talmudit and various journals.\nHe has received worldwide acclaim for his sefer, \"Orchos Chaim: A Ben Torah for Life.\" During a speech at the 2019 Aguda convention, Rav Elya Brudny notably remarked, \"Every family that has made that transition  should own the book.\"\nHe also sits on several editorial boards, including the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture. Among his English-language works is \"Time Pieces,\" a collection of essays on the Jewish holidays. Rabbi Lopiansky lectures widely both nationally and internationally, sharing his insights on Torah and Jewish philosophy.\nTeaching and influence\nRabbi Lopiansky continues the mesorah (tradition) of his mentors, Rav Chaim Shmuelevitz, Rav Nachum Partzovitz, and his father-in-law, Rav Beini",
    "Genus of thescelosaurid dinosaurs\nFona (meaning \"the origin\") is an extinct genus of thescelosaurine thescelosaurid ornithischian dinosaurs from the 'mid'-Cretaceous Cedar Mountain Formation (Mussentuchit Member) of Utah, United States. The genus contains a single species, F. herzogae, known from several partial skeletons and skulls. Based on anatomical similarities to the closely related and similarly aged Oryctodromeus, Fona was likely a semi-fossorial animal, likely spending a significant amount of time in underground burrows. It also represents the oldest known definitive thescelosaurine.\nDiscovery and naming\nThe Fona fossil material was discovered in multiple different localities of the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation in Emery County of Utah, United States. The holotype specimen, NCSM 33548, was found in the 'Karmic Orodromine locality' and represents the only certain occurrence of Fona in the lower Mussentuchit Member. This specimen consists of mostly complete and somewhat articulated skeleton. Other outcrops yielded several other specimens referrable to Fona based on similarities in the skeletal anatomy. FMNH PR 4581 was found in the 'Manolo site', which is slightly younger than the holotype locality. It is also a mostly complete skeleton, missing most of the cranium, pelvis, and metatarsals. The youngest rocks with Fona material represent the 'Mini Troll locality'. Here, the skeletons of two well preserved, similarly sized individuals were found together, as well as some bones of juvenile specimens.\nPrior to the formal naming of Fona, the fossil material was reported in several conference abstracts and academic papers without thorough description, where it was typically mentioned as belonging to an orodromine thescelosaurid.\nIn 2024, Avrahami et al. described Fona herzogae as a new genus and species of thescelosaurine ornithopod based on these fossil remains. The generic name, Fona (pronounced \"foat-nah\" IPA: , references a figure of the same name in CHamoru culture (in Fino\u02bc CHamoru, an Austronesian language). Here, Fona (whose name means \"the origin\") is the ancestral maga'h\u00e5ga, or authoritative female in a clan. According to tradition, she used her powers to turn herself and her brother into the Earth and the life on it, after which she turns into stone. This story recalls the associated skeletons of two Fona subadults\u2014which may have been siblings or a male/female pair that were fossilized\u2014as well as efforts to recognize the equality of men and women and decolonize paleontology. The specific name, herzogae, honors Lisa Herzog, the discoverer of the Mini Troll locality from which several Fona specimens are known, and her contributions to fossil conservation.\nFamily of the related Oryctodromeus outside a burrow\nClassification\nIn their phylogenetic analyses, Avrahami et al. (2024) recovered Fona as a basal member of the Thescelosaurinae within the Thescelosauridae. The temporally and geographically close Oryctodromeus was consistently recovered as a close relative, followed by all three latest Cretaceous species of Thescelosaurus. The exact relationships of thescelosaurines depended on whether the analysis was time-calibrated. If it was not, Fona and Oryctodromeus were recovered in a clade as the sister taxon to Thescelosaurus (displayed in Topology A). It is was time-calibrated, Oryctodromeus was found as the next diverging member of the Thescelosaurinae after Fona, followed by Thescelosaurus (displayed in Topology B). These results are displayed in the cladograms below:\n",

    "American  slave catcher, fraudster (~1819\u20131858)\nFontaine H. Pettis (c.\u20091799?\u00a0\u2013 May 24, 1858), often doing business as F. H. Pettis, was a 19th-century American fraudster and/or attorney who specialized in recovering fugitive slaves for enslavers prior to the American Civil War. Based in Philadelphia, and later New York City, he advertised his services in southern newspapers. He is classed by most historians of slavery as a Northern slave catcher or \"slave taker\" even though he boasted of being a native of Virginia. He was also likely something of a charlatan, accused of fraud in more than one circumstance, and convicted of perjury in Washington, D.C. in 1831. President Andrew Jackson issued a pardon to Pettis on the perjury charges, possibly due to political influence. Several surviving records suggest he periodically could not or would not pay his bills, and so he attempted to borrow money from wealthier acquaintances or, more often, simply defaulted on the obligation. Pettis also worked as a small-time salesman, advertising corn plasters for feet, and trying to sell a waterproofing process.\nFamily and early career\nPettis was a native of Orange County, Virginia. He was the son of an American Revolutionary War veteran named John Pettis and his wife Martha \"Patsy\" Reynolds Pettis. He was a brother of U.S. Representative Spencer Pettis. According to historians at the University of Tennessee, Pettis was born about 1799. The 1850 census and New York City death records place his birth some 20 years later, in approximately 1819.\nThe Tazewell family papers at the Library of Virginia hold a letter from F. H. Pettis to Littleton Waller Tazewell on June 19, 1826, which apparently contained words to the effect that Pettis \"was travelling from Washington to Richmond via steamboat\u2014received letter  requires his return to Washington\u2014asks Tazewell for $10 loan\". In 1826, when Henry Clay was serving as U.S. Secretary of State, Pettis wrote him three different times asking for a patronage job; none was granted. Pettis was working as attorney by 1827, at which time he married a Philadelphian named Johanna M. Grotjan. In 1828 he and a partner named J. H. Lee were soliciting subscriptions for a 500-page biography of Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, who had died two years earlier at the age of 83. In 1829 he wrote twice to newly elected president Andrew Jackson, asking to be appointed a federal district attorney somewhere in the west, and later asking for a government job generally; none was granted. In 1830 a buyer-beware item about him appeared in a Lancaster, Pennsylvania paper, written by an anonymous correspondent signing himself \"Anti-Mason\":\nA CAUTION. Mr. CLARKE,\u2013In the Pennsylvania Inquirer of this morning, I observe an advertisement, signed F. H. Pettis & Co; announcing their intention of publishing a newspaper in the city of Washington entitled The Washington Galaxy, and Anti-Masonic Herald. The Mr. Pettis there subscribed, is doubtless the notorious F. H. Pettis, formerly of Virginia, but for several years past a resident in and about the city of Philadelphia, who has subsisted by obtaining money from our citizens under false pretences and against whom bills of indictment were preferred for blasphemy and defrauding a poor woman under the pretence of being an attorney. He is an accomplished swindler; the subscriber is ready to prove him such, and therefore cautions the public against paying him any money, in advance, for the Herald which he represents he intends to publish. In a similar way, he defrauded many of our city by a Prospectus of a life of Jefferson, he also applied to one gentleman to assist him in getting out a book in favour of Jackson, and at the same time to another, to aid him in publishing a book in favor of Adams. Beware! Beware! AN ANTI-MASON.\nPerjury case and presidential pardon\nIn December 1830, Pettis wrote to Henry Clay again, seemingly asking for help getting a newspaper editorship in a pro-Clay media market, volunteering his thoughts on the upcoming election, and describing Francis Blair's newly launched Washington Globe as a pro-Andrew Jackson periodical that sought to replace Duff Green as the official printer to the U.S. Congress: \"A Jackson Member (supposing me to be with my Brother & the administration) stated to me that its object is to supplant Duff\u2014that he is to be killed, and they mean to have the honor of doing it themselves.'\u2014Great honor don't you think?\" Clay wrote on the back of the letter \"not answered\".\nSpencer Pettis and Thomas Biddle killed each other in a duel fought on the Bloody Bar of the Mississippi River on August 26, 1831. In September 1831, F. H. Pettis was in Washington, D.C., selling corn plasters for treatment of foot maladies. The following month, according to the editors of the multi-volume The Papers of Andrew Jackson, \"He and his family were boarding in Washington with John Cromwell (c.\u20091800\u20131835), but had fallen into his debt.

    "Genus of stegosaurian dinosaurs\nBaiyinosaurus (meaning \"Baiyin reptile\") is an extinct genus of stegosaurian dinosaurs from the Middle Jurassic Wangjiashan Formation of China. The genus contains a single species, B. baojiensis, known from a partial skeleton including cranial bones. The skeletal anatomy of Baiyinosaurus demonstrates transitional features between basal thyreophorans and stegosaurs. While many stegosaurs are known from China, Baiyinosaurus is the only one currently named from Gansu Province.\nDiscovery and naming\nBaiyinosaurus type locality in Gansu Province, China\nThe Baiyinosaurus holotype specimen, IVPG-D021, was discovered in 2016 by Li Daqing and his crew during excavations in sediments of the Wangjiashan Formation (Straw-yellow Sandstone Member). These outcrops are in the Pingchuan District of the city of Baiyin in Gansu Province, China. Following their discovery, the bones were collected and prepared by the Gansu Zhendan Dinosaur Culture Communication Co. Ltd., and reposited at Gansu Agricultural University.\nThe holotype specimen consists of a partial skeleton, comprising fragmentary bones of the cranium (left premaxilla and maxilla, frontals, probable right jugal and squamosal, and left dentary) and several vertebrae (the atlas, seven dorsal vertebrae, and a caudal vertebra).\nIn 2024, Ning et al. described Baiyinosaurus baojiensis as a new genus and species of stegosaurian dinosaurs based on these fossil remains. The generic name, Baiyinosaurus, combines a reference to Baiyin\u2014the city where the holotype was found\u2014with with the Greek \"\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" (\"sauros\"), meaning \"reptile\". The specific name, baojiensis, references the Baiyinosaurus type locality in the Baojishan Basin in the Qilian Mountains.\nBaiyinosaurus is the only stegosaur taxon currently named from Gansu Province. The remains of a Cretaceous stegosaur, tentatively referred to Stegosaurus sp., were described earlier in 2024 from the Hekou Group but not assigned to a novel species.\nDescription\nAs a stegosaur, Baiyinosaurus would have been a quadrupedal herbivore with a paired row of a combination of large plates and spines running along the top of the animal from the neck to the tail tip. The purpose of these armor pieces is debated, but the plates have been suggested to play a role in display, species recognition, and/or thermoregulation, and the spikes were likely served as defensive structures.\nWhile the Baiyinosaurus fossil material generally resembles stegosaurs in morphology, several features are also reminiscent of basal thyreophorans such as Scelidosaurus and Emausaurus, indicating that Baiyinosaurus had both plesiomorphic thyreophoran traits as well as derived stegosaurian traits. Bashanosaurus, one of the basalmost stegosaurs from older rocks in China, also exhibits a similar blend of features, demonstrating the transitional states from early armored dinosaurs to the divergent body plans of stegosaurs and ankylosaurs.\nThe holotype specimen of Baiyinosaurus belongs likely belongs to an adult individual. This can be determined as the neurocentral sutures on the dorsal vertebrae are fused and not visible, while they would be open and unfused in a juvenile.\nSkull\nReconstructed skull of Baiyinosaurus\nBaiyinosaurus is known from several skull bones. The posterior subnarial process of the left premaxilla (upper jaw bone at the tip of the snout) is preserved and has an expanded surface where it would contact the nasal. The front and middle part of the left maxilla (primary tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw) is known, and indicates that this tooth row is inset medially (toward the middle of the skull), a feature expected in most ornithischian dinosaurs. \nA partial bone\u2014likely the right jugal\u2014is known, and has a triradiate form with a very expanded dorsal process. Another fragment\u2014tentatively identified as the dorsal part of the right squamosal\u2014includes visible sutures where it would be overlapped by the parietal and postorbital. \nSkull bones (left) and dentary (right) of Baiyinosaurus\nThe paired frontals (large bones of the skull roof) are generally broad and shorter from front to back when compared to other stegosaurs besides Tuojiangosaurus. This shape is also similar to the basal non-stegosaurian thyreophorans Scelidosaurus and Emausaurus. The describing authors identified this structure of the frontal\u2014being wider than long and contributing significantly to both the medial and anterior margins of the supratemporal fenestrae\u2014as an autapomorphy (unique derived trait) of Baiyinosaurus.\nThe left dentary (tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) is largely complete. It curves down and inward at the front. While a predentary (lower beak bone) is not preserved, there are visible facets for it on both sides of the tip of the dentary. Similar to many basally-branching stegosaurs like Huayangosaurus, Gigantspinosaurus, and Kentrosaurus, the first dentary tooth is immediately behind the predentary, without the wide diastema (gap) present in l",

    "Turkish poet\nFor other people with the same name, see Abdul Qadir.\nAbdul Kadir, full name \u0130brahim Abd\u00fclkadir Meri\u00e7boyu (pen name, A. Kadir; 1917, Istanbul - March 1, 1985, Istanbul), was a Turkish poet among the socialist poets of the 1940s generation.\nEarly life and education\nKadir completed his secondary education at Ey\u00fcp Middle School (1933) and Kuleli Military High School (1936). As a final-year student at the Turkish Military Academy (1938), he was arrested with N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet and sentenced to ten months in prison. After being released from prison, he completed his military service as a private. He enrolled in the Istanbul University Faculty of Law (1941).\nCareer\nHis poetry book Tebli\u011f, published in 1943, was banned and confiscated. He was exiled by martial law along with individuals deemed problematic to remain in Istanbul. He spent his exile in Mu\u011fla, Bal\u0131kesir, Konya, K\u0131r\u015fehir, and Adana. In 1947, he returned to Istanbul and began working in a biscuit factory. After leaving this job, he worked as a proofreader and translator in various publishing houses. After 1965, he continued his writing career by publishing his books himself.\nHaving shared a cell with N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet in Ankara Prison, A. Kadir was initially heavily influenced by this poet. This influence is clearly seen in the poems published in the magazines Ses and Yeni Edebiyat. His first book, Tebli\u011f, which expressed his love for his country, openly opposed war and realistically reflected the lives of poor people. After returning from exile, he occasionally published his poems in magazines. He and Abd\u00fclbaki G\u00f6lp\u0131narl\u0131 translated Rumi's poems from Persian into prose and compiled them into a book titled Mevl\u00e2na in Today's Language (1955).\nThis highly appreciated book was reprinted several times. The translation of Iliad he did with Azra Erhat in 1958 led to A. Kadir being recognized as a successful translator. His second book, Welcome Halil \u0130brahim (1959), showed that he did not deviate from his poetic line despite the poetic tendencies of the period. This was followed by Four Windows (1962) and a collection of all his poems, While There is Happiness (1968). Continuing his work in translation and simplifying old poetry, A. Kadir published the books Omar Khayyam in Today's Language (1964) and Tevfik Fikret in Today's Language (1967). In 1970, the translation of Odyssey, which he again did with Azra Erhat, was published. He compiled many translations he did alone or jointly from European and Third World poets into three volumes titled World Folk and Democracy Poems (1973 - 1980). Additionally, his poetry translations from Brecht and Selected Poems (1961), which he translated with As\u0131m Bezirci from Paul Eluard, received great attention. A. Kadir received the Habib Edip T\u00f6rehan (1959), TDK Translation (1961), Hasan  li Ediz Literary Translation (1980), and Yazko Translation (1983) awards for his translations. His work 1938 Military Academy Incident and N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet (1966) is also a book of great interest for shedding light on an important event of that era.\nDeath\nAbdul Kadir died on March 1985 and is buried in Zincirlikuyu Cemetery.\n",

    "\nGPU chips used in AI are noted to require more energy and cooling compared to a traditional CPU chip\nThe environmental impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) may vary significantly. Many deep learning methods have significant carbon footprints and water usage. Some scientists have suggested that artificial intelligence may provide solutions to environmental problems.\nCarbon footprint of AI\nAI has a significant carbon footprint due to growing energy usage, especially due to training and usage. Researchers have argued that the carbon footprint of AI models during training should be considered when attempting to understand the impact of AI.  One study suggested that by 2027, energy costs for AI could increase to 85\u2013134 Twh, nearly 0.5% of all current energy usage. Training one deep learning model may use up to the same carbon footprint as the lifetime emissions of 5 cars. Training and running large language models (LLM) and other generative AI generally requires much more energy compared to running a single prediction on the trained model. Operating a model, though, may easily multiply the energy costs of predictions. The computation required to train the most advanced AI models doubles every 3.4 months on average, leading to exponential power usage and resulting carbon footprint.\nBERT, a generative AI model trained in 2019, consumed \"the energy of a round-trip transcontinental flight\". GPT-3 released 552 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during training, \"the equivalent of 123 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for one year\". Much of the energy cost is due to inefficient model architectures and processors. One model named BLOOM, from Hugging Face, trained with more efficient chips and only released 25 metric tons of CO2. Incorporating the energy cost of manufacturing the chips for the system doubled the carbon footprint, to \"the equivalent of around 60 flights between London and New York.\" Operating BLOOM daily was estimated to release the equivalent carbon footprint as driving 54 miles.\nAlgorithms which have lower energy costs but run millions of times a day can also have significant carbon footprints. The integration of AI into search engines could multiply energy costs significantly, with some estimates suggesting energy costs rising to nearly 30 billion kWh per year, an energy footprint larger than many countries. Another estimate found that integrating ChatGPT into every Google search query would use 10 tWh each year, the equivalent yearly energy usage of 1.5 million European Union residents.\nAI has caused both increased water and energy usage, leading to significantly more demands on the grid. Due to increased energy demands from AI-related projects, a Kansas City and a West Virginian coal-fired plant pushed back closing. Other coal-fired plants in the Salt Lake City region have pushed back retirement of their coal-fired plants by up to a decade. Environmental debates have raged in both Virginia and France about whether a \"moratorium\" should be called for additional data centers. In 2024 at the World Economic Forum, OpenAI executive Sam Altman gave a speech in which he said that the AI industry can only grow if there is a major technology breakthrough to increase energy development.\nIn 2024, Google failed to reach key goals from their net zero plan as a result of their work with AI, and had a 48% increase in greenhouse gas emission attributable to their growth in AI. Microsoft and Meta had similar increases in their carbon footprint, similarly attributed to AI.  Carbon footprints of AI models depends on the energy source used, with data centers using renewable energy lowering their footprint. Many tech companies claim to offset energy usage by buying energy from renewable sources, though some experts argue that utilities simply replace the claimed renewable energy with increased non-renewable sources for their other customers. Analysis of the carbon footprint of AI models remains difficult to determine, as they are aggregated as part of datacenter carbon footprints, and some models may help reduce carbon footprints of other industries, or due to differences in reporting from companies.\nSome applications of ML, such as for fossil fuel discovery and exploration, may worsen climate change. Use of AI for personalized marketing online may also lead to increased consumption of goods, which could also increase global emissions.\nEnergy efficiency\nAI chips, (i.e. GPUs) use more energy and emit more heat than traditional CPU chips. AI models with inefficiently implemented architectures, or trained on less efficient chips may use more energy. Since the 1940's the energy efficiency of computation has doubled every 1.6 years. Some skeptics argue that improvements of AI efficiency may only increase AI usage and therefore carbon footprint due to Jevons paradox.\nWater usage of AI\nCooling AI servers can demand large amounts of fresh water which is evaporated in cooling towers. By 2027, AI may u",

    "Community support activity\nYouth services is a field of practices within the social services sector in North America. Defined as \"programs, activities, and services aimed at providing a range of opportunities for school-aged children, including mentoring, recreation, education, training, community service, or supervision in a safe environment,\" youth services are a comprehensive series of strategies, activities, programs and organizations spread across the United States and Canada today. In North America, youth services are generally viewed as more organized and systemized than youth work. The term \"youth services\" is used in international contexts as well.\nActivities\nYouth services are varied and disparate, often emerging from the needs of their local context or from the mandate of external funding sources. \"Best practices in youth services include the provision of safety, appropriate supervision, supportive relationships, opportunities to belong, positive social norms, support for efficacy and skill building, and integration of community, school, and family efforts.\"\nSpecific activities, projects, programs and organizations within the realm of youth services address a variety of issues. According to Fletcher (2024), they include: \nPrevention\nIntervention\nOut-of-school time education\nPersonal identities\nCivics and democracy\nCulture and society\nRights and freedoms\nYouth-specific issues\nPublic health\nPersonal health (including mental health)\nThe economy\nCrisis support\nNature and the outdoors\nRecreation\nThe arts\nPersonal development\nEmpowerment\nWithin each of those categories are more specific practices. For instance, the practice of \"youth services librarianship\" \"encompasses all library services to youth (children and young adults, ages zero to eighteen) in school and public library settings.\" According to one author, it \"has long been considered the classic success story of American libraries.\"\nFunding and support\nThere are various sources of funding for youth services across North America. They include government and philanthropic foundations, as well as corporate and private donors. In the U.S., the current thrust of youth services emphasizes positive youth development. In Contra Costa County, youth services \"receives funding from the California Department of Education, the Contra Costa County Workforce Development Board, Contra Costa County Employment and Human Services, the Department of Rehabilitation, as well as other funding sources.\"\nIn addition to local variations, there has been a wide variety of political, fiscal and public support for youth services throughout time. For instance, the New York City Youth Board existed from 1947 until 1976 \"when most of the program services were redistributed to several other city agencies.\" From that dispersion, many activities, projects and services were defunded and forgotten about for several years.\nU.S. federal support\nThe U.S. federal government supports a variety of youth services. For instance, the United States Department of Labor houses the Employment and Training Administration Division of Youth Services. This division \"primarily serve young adults ages 16-24 that face a variety of barriers to employment. We provide leadership to the workforce system and our grantees, policy direction and guidance, support for program administration, and technical assistance.\" Some of their youth services programs include Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Youth Formula, YouthBuild, and Reentry Employment Opportunities.\nThe United States Department of Health & Human Services Office of the Administration for Children & Families extensively addresses youth services. Many issues are served by this agency, including:\nAdolescent pregnancy prevention: These services \"educate adolescents on both abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections... and exclusively implement sexual risk avoidance education that teaches youth how to voluntarily refrain from non-marital sexual activity, empower youth to make healthy decisions, and provide tools and resources to prevent youth engagement in other risky behaviors.\"\nRunaway and homeless youth: These programs \"serve and protect runaway and homeless youth\" through street outreach, transitional living skills education, and maternity group homes\" for youth.\nFoster care and successful transitions to adulthood: The agency \"provides funding to support youth and young adults in or formerly in foster care in their transition to adulthood.\"\nUnaccompanied refugee minors programs: \"Services provided include arranging foster care, group homes, independent living situations, or reunification with relatives in the U.S., as well as other child welfare services to promote their well-being.\" The agency also researches and evaluates each of these program areas.\nU.S. state support\nSimilarly, many U.S. states, counties and local municipalities support youth services as well. In Utah, the Department of ",
    "Indian Tax Case Law\nMcDowell & Company Limited vs CTO (1986 AIR 649) is one of the earliest cases in independent India dealing with the concepts of tax planning and Tax Evasion. The case pertained to whether excise duty paid is a part of \"turnover,\" for the computation of sales tax under the  Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1947 of a liquor manufacturer when the excise duty is paid directly by the purchaser to the government exchequer. The Court upheld the legitimacy of tax planning in India and dealt with the legitimacy of transaction structuring to avoid payment of tax.\nFacts\nManufacture, sale-wholesale and retail including storage and transport of liquor in Andhra Pradesh is regulated by the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act, 1968 and the rules made thereunder. The manufacturer (McDoweel in the present case) is required to pay excise duty before removing liquor from distilleries. In the given case, the purchasers paid excise duty directly to the government to obtain distillery passes for removing liquor from distilleries.\nManufacturers are required to pay sales tax as a percentage of total turnover under the provisions of The Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 (Sales Tax Act). The appellant manufacturer paid sales tax based on its turnover which excluded excise duty. Notably, the invoices raised by the manufacturer do not include excise duty deposited by the purchaser to the exchequer on behalf of the manufacturer. The company was assessed for sales tax based on its returns but later the Commercial Tax Officer was of the view that the manufacturer had failed to include the excise duty paid on the liquor sold by it as part of the turnover. The tax authority accordingly called upon McDowell's to show cause why assessments made may not be reopened.\nIn an earlier case ( 1 S.C.R. 914), for the same appellant company, a division bench of the Supreme Court held that excise duty did not go into the common till of the appellant manufacturer and therefore is not part of the turnover for computation of sales tax. Subsequently, the rules under the Excise Act were amended and a similar question arose again under the amended rules. When the matter came up again before the Supreme Court, the correctness of the earlier decision was questioned and the matter was referred to a constitutional bench.\nDecision\nThe Court held that the excise duty was primarily a burden which the manufacturer had to bear, even if the purchasers paid the same under the Distillery Rules. The Court held that excise duty though paid by the purchaser to meet the liability of the manufacturer, is a part of the consideration for the sale and is includible in the turnover of the manufacturer. Justice Mishra delivering the decision for the majority held that \u2018tax planning may be legitimate, provided it is within the framework of the law'. However, it also held that \u2018colourable devices cannot be a part of tax planning and it is wrong to encourage the belief that it is honourable to avoid payment of tax by resorting to dubious methods'.\nA separate concurring judgement was delivered by O. Chinnappa Reddy detailing tax avoidance and held as follows:\n47. It is neither fair not desirable to expect the legislature to intervene and take care of every device and scheme to avoid taxation. It is up to the Court to take stock to determine the nature of the new and sophisticated legal devices to avoid tax and consider whether the situation created by the devices could be related to the existing legislation with the aid of 'emerging' techniques of interpretation was done in Ramsay 1982 AC 300, Burma Oil 1982 STC 30 and Dawson 1984-1 All ER 530, to expose the devices for what they are and to refuse to give judicial benediction.\nAftermath\nThe judgement in the McDoweel case and the matter of tax avoidance was again reconsidered by the Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v. Azadi Bachao Andolan (\u2018Azadi Bachao') in 2003, in which a three-member bench of the Supreme Court opined that the opinion of the majority is far from the opinion of Justice Chinnappa Reddy and opined that not every attempt at tax planning is to be seen as illegitimate. A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court in Vodafone International Holdings B.V vs Union of India & Anr in 2012 ruled that there was no conflict between McDowell and Azadi Bachao decisions and there was no need for reconsideration of the Azadi Bachao decision by a larger bench.\n",

    "\n1940 symphony by Georgy Sviridov\nThe Symphony for Strings (Russian: \u0421\u0438\u043c\u0444\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0440\u043a\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430, romanized:\u00a0Simfoniya dlya strunnogo orkestra, lit.\u2009'Symphony for String Orchestra'; also known as the Chamber Symphony), Op. 14 is a four-movement composition for string orchestra by Georgy Sviridov. He composed the work during a period of creative crisis, when he began to reject the works of Igor Stravinsky and Dmitri Shostakovich, and struggled to develop his own style. The work was premiered in December 28, 1941, by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Eduard Grikurov. The work immediately engendered intense debate, against and in defense of Sviridov, among members of the Union of Soviet Composers. After 1943, the Symphony for Strings was not performed again until the composer rediscovered the score among his personal papers in the 1980s, after which he unsuccessfully attempted to revise it. Its first modern performance occurred on June 28, 2000, in Saint Petersburg, with the Moscow Soloists conducted by Yuri Bashmet.\nBackground\nSviridov began to establish his reputation as a composer in 1936 with his settings of verses by Alexander Pushkin. The following year, in 1937, he was accepted into the Union of Soviet Composers\u2014a rare achievement for a young composer of his time. That same year, he performed in the world premiere of his Piano Concerto, partnered by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Yevgeny Mravinsky. A number of his works, including his score to the film Virgin Soil Upturned and collaborations with Ivan Dzerzhinsky, became instantly popular in the Soviet Union. As his music became more widely known, it also drew increasing criticism from his peers. In personal jottings set down in the 1970s, Sviridov recalled the period as one fraught with challenges for himself and the emergence of the new Soviet music.\nBy 1940, during his last year of tutelage under Shostakovich,, Sviridov began to confront a major creative crisis. What he referred to as \"state art\", such as the operas Into the Storm by Tikhon Khrennikov and Semyon Kotko by Sergei Prokofiev repulsed him because of what he perceived as their essential falsity. At the same time, Sviridov increasingly felt estranged from the music of Igor Stravinsky\u2014whose Pers\u00e9phone, Symphony of Psalms, and Jeu de cartes he knew well\u2014and Dmitri Shostakovich.\nIn 1940, Sviridov began and completed his Symphony for Strings. Sviridov's use of a string orchestra was considered unusual for a Soviet symphony of the period. The only previous example of such a work had been the Sinfonietta by Nikolai Myaskovsky.\nMusic\nThe symphony consists of four movements:\nModerato assaiVivaceAndante con motoAllegro molto\nThe opening movement begins with a tutti statement of a dramatic theme, followed by a contrasting lyrical second subject. Jewish folk motifs are evoked in the succeeding scherzo. An austere and broadly melodic \"Andante con moto\" gives way to a finale of a determined character that resolves the tension of the earlier movements. According to the musicologist Yulian Weinkop\u00a0, the work is influenced by Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 7, Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex and Apollon musag\u00e8te, and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5.\nA typical performance takes approximately 20 minutes.\nPremiere\nThe world premiere of the Symphony for Strings occurred on December 28, 1940, during a retrospective of Soviet music held in the Large Hall of the Leningrad Philharmonia. It was played by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Eduard Grikurov.\nReception\nDebate\nIn an article published prior to the premiere of the Symphony for Strings, Shostakovich called it an \"interesting and very significant work\". He added that \"the originality and freshness of  melodies, his harmonies and polyphonic sophistication are beyond question\". Shostakovich's article was the only one he ever devoted to one of his students. After Sviridov played the symphony during a plenum of organizing committee of the Union of Soviet Composers on May 11, 1941, Shostakovich called him the hope of Soviet music.\nSviridov's Symphony for Strings provoked intense debates not only among musical professionals, but also with audiences. Arousing these disputes was the abrupt stylistic shift and complexity evinced in the Symphony for Strings:\nThis work doubtlessly needs a certain investment of intellectual energy to be appreciated: in it Sviridov leaves behind the primal \"accessibility\" of his youthful creative endeavors. This will possibly upset some critics, who may be inclined to hear in the symphony of this young composer a \"formalistic fall from grace\".\nIvan Sollertinsky, a musicologist and close friend of Shostakovich, attacked Sviridov and other young Leningrad composers as \"epigones\" of Shostakovich, who was himself criticized as being the \"lord of the minds\" of his students. Alexander Shaverdyan\u00a0, a critic and editor, dubbed the phenomenon \"Shostakovichism\". Others, such as the musicologist Daniel Zhi",
    "\nHenry Morgan's raid on Porto Bello was a military event which took place in the latter half of the Anglo-Spanish war beginning on 10 July 1668. Notable Welsh Buccaneer Henry Morgan led a largley English Privateer force against the heavily fortified town of Porto Bello (now Portobelo in modern Panama). After landing Morgan and his men attempted to take the castles protecting the town. One such involved using captured citizens as human shields to seize one of the castles. After capturing them all by force the privateers subsequently entered the city and then plundered it before Morgan demanded a large ransom from the Governor of Panama Don Agust\u00edn de Bracamonte. While the negotiations for this was going on \u2013 Bracamonte led a sizeable force from Panama City intent on recapturing the city and putting the privateers to the sword.\nMorgan however managed to ambush and repel Bracamonte's Spanish counter attack forcing him to deliver the ransom. Having achieved this, Morgan and the Privateers left Porto Bello intact as promised and went back to Jamaica unhindered. The attack was highly successful and garnered some 100,000 pieces of eight as well as other valuable booty.\nBackground\nFurther information: Anglo-Spanish War (1654\u20131660)\nEngland and Spain had remained in a state of war in the Caribbean following the Restoration of Charles II in 1660. England's taking possession of Jamaica since 1657 had yet to be confirmed by Spain in a treaty. As a result Buccaneers were invited, to base themselves at Port Royal, to help defend against Spanish attacks.\nHenry Morgan, who had been in charge of the Port Royal militia and the defence of Jamaica, took over further privateering expeditions as Admiral in Chief of the Confederacy of Buccaneers.\nIn March 1668 Morgan set out on his first commanded expedition to the Spanish island of Cuba to seize Puerto Principe. Outside the town the Privateers defeated the militia in a pitched battle known as the Battle of la Savana. They then captured the town, plundering and sacking the place while also gathering a ransom for the town's prisoners. The President of the Real Audiencia of Panama Don Juan Perez de Guzm\u00e1n, then launched a retaliatory attack on Providence Island capturing it and sent the prisoners to Porto bello. Despite this Guzm\u00e1n had fallen foul of the new Viceroy of Peru and was now in imprisoned and had been replaced by the young Don Agust\u00edn de Bracamonte.\nAfter dividing the spoils of the conquest of Puerto del Pr\u00edncipe, Morgan announced a plan to attack Porto Bello in the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru. The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main as it was one of the main routes of high value of goods passing through its port between the Spanish territories and Spain. Silver and other treasures would be sent from Peru to Panama City. Then it was carried by mules overland to Porto Bello, where it was loaded onto the Spanish Plate fleet. Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another under construction in the town. The port had been attacked by English Privateers before; Francis Drake had been repelled in 1595 and then died of disease not far off the coast, and William Parker six years later captured and ransomed the place.\nThe 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure at Puerto Principe and the murder of their countryman, left Morgan's service and returned to Tortuga. In June 26 Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello but only he and the captains knew (including Edward Collier)\u2013 the rest were not told of the destination until they landed.\nRaid\nA map of Porto Bello from 1700 showing the location of the three castles as well as the town.\nOn 10 July Morgan weighed anchor with his nine vessels and 470 men at Naos, a village twelve miles from Porto Bello in the Bay of Bocas del Torro. From there he sailed along the coast to the port of El Puerto del Ponton, four miles from Porto Bello and transferred his men to 23 canoes. While this was happening six emaciated English prisoners captured from Old Providence appeared who were able to guide them and also gave valuable information. From there they paddled to within three miles (4.8\u00a0km) of the target where the Privateers approached a blockhouse at La Rancherria \u2013 an old pearling station guarded by five men. They were asked to surrender by the English, but were met with a volley of fire which wounded two men. The English then assaulted the blockhouse putting all to the sword.  Although the blockhouse was captured the surprise had now been lost. The musket fire had been heard in the city and the mayor immediately had called his men to arms. \nTaking the castles\nAs dawn broke the following day Morgan now had to rush his men forward two miles across the beach towards Santiago Castle. The former prisoners guided them to Santiago from the landward side, where they arrived half an hour before dawn. Morgan suddenly saw high the walls of the castl",

    "British comedian\nGrace Campbell (born April 30, 1994) is a British comedian, filmmaker, writer and presenter. As a stand-up comedian she has performed solo shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and the Hammersmith Apollo. She has appeared on Channel 4's Riot Girls. Her first book, Amazing Disgrace: A Book About \"Shame, was released by Hodder in 2021.\nEarly life and education\nCampbell grew up in North London. Her father, Alastair Campbell, started working for Tony Blair soon after she was born. Her mother, Fiona Millar, worked for Cherie Blair. She spent her childhood in the New Labour movement, with the children of Blair and Philip Gould, and the grandchildren of Neil Kinnock. She has said she became \u201cmore liberal than  father and more feminist than  mother,\u201d that her experience of politics as a child was \u201cquite brutal\u201d, and that she grew up with protesters outside her house and needed security. Campbell attended Parliament Hill School, where she benefitted from an all girls environment. While Tessa Jowell was her childhood inspiration, Campbell has said that Ed Miliband has the best sense of humour. She was a frequent visitor to the Branton Centre, a youth centre in Kentish Town, where she is now a patron.\nCareer\nCampbell is a feminist. She explained to Varsity that \u201cwomen love ...they feel seen. They feel like I'm speaking to them and their friends,\u201d. In 2019, she toured the stand-up show \"Why I'm Never Going Into Politics\", where she revealed that her mother was her inspiration. She performed All About Me(n) at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2022.\nCampbell was a writer and star of Riot Girls, a Channel 4 show that used stunts and sketches to discuss how women were treated in society.\nCampbell's first book, Amazing Disgrace: A Book About \"Shame\", was published by Hodder & Stoughton in 2021. The book explores her relationship with shame, whether that be shame about rejection, sex or mental health. Times Radio described Amazing Disgrace as a \u201crevealing and amusing memoir\u201d, whilst the Evening Standard said it was \u201can absolute riot. Brash, candid and casually obscene, this part memoir, part manual is a high octane adventure\u201d.\nActivism\nDuring a trip to Las Vegas, Campbell was the victim of rape. She described her experience in The Guardian, and how she felt resentful of her previously \u201csex-positive\u201d reputation in the immediate aftermath. She has written about how having an abortion affected her \u201con a physiological and psychological level\u201d.\n",
    "\nRight-wing group in the EU parlament\nPatriots for Europe (PfE or P4E) is a right-wing to far-right sovereigntist political group, formed as the third-largest group ahead of the 10th European Parliament. The founding of the group was announced at a press conference in Vienna in late June 2024 by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n (Fidesz), former Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 (ANO 2011), and former Austrian Minister of the Interior Herbert Kickl and MEP Harald Vilimsky (both Freedom Party of Austria).\nThe group includes almost all the former members of the Identity and Democracy group. The group could also coordinate the works of its members at the European Council and the Council of the European Union.\nHistory\nFidesz MEPs did not belong to any EU group until recently, having left the European People's Party Group (EPP Group) in March 2021. ANO MEPs belonged to the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party and its affiliated Renew Europe group since 2011, but left both organisations after the 2024 European Parliament elections after disagreements on the programme. The FP\u00d6 belonged to the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) group during the ninth term (2019\u20132024).\nOn 30 June 2024, representatives of the three founding parties signed \"A Patriotic Manifesto for a European Future\". The manifesto sets out the alliance's ideology, which includes weakening the EU, a focus on European cultural identity, stronger measures against illegal migration and a revision of the Green Deal for Europe.\nHungarian Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP), which has 1 MEP, also announced its intention to join the alliance following its exit from the EPP Group. On 1 July, the nationalist Portuguese party Chega became the fourth member of the Patriots for Europe, with two MEPs. On 5 July, the Spanish Vox party also joined, leaving the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group. The same day, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), formerly part of the ID Group, also announced it would join. On 6 July, the Danish People's Party and Vlaams Belang, both part of the ID group, announced they would also join, putting the group above the minimum member states required for group formation. On 8 July, the National Rally (RN) and Lega were announced as new members of the group. The prerequisite for establishing a political group of the European Parliament is the membership of at least 23 MEPs from at least seven EU member states. The alliance met this criterion on 6 July 2024. According to Le Monde, the RN waited for the end of the second round of the 2024 French legislative election for the announcement \"for fear of reviving suspicion of pro-Russian sympathies\".\nOn 8 July, Jordan Bardella, president of the National Rally (RN) of France, was named the group's President, together with Vice-Presidents, Chief Whip\tand Treasurer.\nMembers\nMain article: List of members of the European Parliament (2024\u20132029)\n10th European Parliament\nPatriots for Europe has MEPs in 12 member states.

The AfD expressed interest in creating a group including Hungarian Fidesz rival Our Homeland Movement, as well as other parties such as the Bulgarian Revival. The AfD eventually established its own group, with these parties, Europe of Sovereign Nations.\n Law and Justice (PiS), which won 20 MEPs, initially negotiated with the Patriots for Europe, but later reached an agreement with Brothers of Italy allowing it to remain in the European Conservatives and Reformists.\n Republic Movement, with 2 MEPs, expressed interest in a potential membership, though the party joined Europe of Sovereign Nations on July 10.\n Smer\u2013SD was speculated to join the alliance with 5 MEPs; however, according to its junior coalition partner, Hlas\u2013SD, Smer\u2013SD expressed a preference for rejoining the S&D group. Though it was later rejected from S&D, it declined to join Patriots for Europe, citing ideological differences.\nOrganization\nPresident\nBureau\nGroup bureau during the 10th European Parliament.\nNotes\n^ ANO 2011 announced its departure from ALDE and Renew Europe on 21 June 2024 due to leader Babi\u0161\u2019s declaration that ANO would not be able to fulfill its progra",
    "\nThe Battle of Sokal  is a battle between the army of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland under the command of the Grand Hetman of the Lithuanian Prince Konstanty Ostrogski against the army of Crimeans, which took place on August 2, 1519. The battle ended with the victory of the Crimeans.\nBattle\nOn July 1519, a large Crimean Tatar force of 40,000 men, crossed the Bug River. The Lithuanian hetman, Konstanty Ostrogski, gathered Podil and Galician nobility along the way. The combined Polish-Lithuanian forces set up a camp at the southern Bug River, not far from the city of Sokal. The Polish-Lithuanian army consisted of 7,000 men. Seeing the Crimeans numerical superiority, Ostrogski proposed not to engage them in an open battle but instead impose a maneuver on them by attacking them at night or while they were crossing as the Crimeans were overburdened with convoys and loot.\nThe Polish commanders refused the advice of Ostrogski, labeling him as indecisive. They advocated for an open battle. Ostrogski, not having the opportunity to convince his opponents of his plan, offered at least not to cross the river, but, using a strong position in the allied camp and wait for the approach of reinforcements for 600 Moldavian regiment soldiers. The Polish army was not able to convince him and decided to take on the Crimeans on their own without waiting for reinforcements.\nOn August 2, the Polish crown took their banners and began crossing the Bug River. They attacked the Crimean battle formations. The Crimeans, led by Bogatyr-Girey, used their usual tactic, feigned retreat, and lured them into the territory of Sokal, they began bombarding them with a hail of arrows which forced the Poles to retreat to the bank river. Ostrogski, seeing what was happening, led a force of 1,000 cavalry and attacked the flank of the Crimenas to cover the rear of the army. This improved the situation better for the moment; however, the Poles had to retreat to the right bank of the Bug River, suffering heavy losses. The army lost many knights and Osrtogski barely managed to break through the Crimenas lines and escape with his life. The Polish-Lithuanian army suffered 1,200 killed.\n",
    "Former Greek bank\nNot to be confused with Bank of the Orient, Banque Fran\u00e7aise des Pays d'Orient, or Deutsche Orientbank.\nFormer head office of the Banque d'Orient on Sofokleous Street, Athens\nThe Banque d'Orient (Greek: \u03a4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2, lit.\u2009'Bank of the East') was a bank active in the Eastern Mediterranean with seat in Athens, Greece. It was founded in 1904 with sponsorship by the National Bank of Greece (NBG), and eventually absorbed by NBG in 1932.\nOverview\nThe Banque d'Orient is commonly referred to under its French name, because French was the vehicular language of the financial and business community in early-20th-cezntury Greece and the Ottoman Empire.\nIt was originally founded as a joint venture between NBG and the Berlin-based Nationalbank f\u00fcr Deutschland. The latter, however, sold its shares after one year to France's Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris, and the Banque d'Orient sold its branches in Constantinople and Hamburg to the newly established Deutsche Orientbank.:\u200a72\u200a\nBy 1915, the Banque d'Orient had operations in Alexandria in Egypt, Salonica in Northern Greece, and Smyrna in the Ottoman Empire.:\u200a17\u200a It had to close its Smyrna branch in 1923 as a consequence of the Treaty of Lausanne.\nIn 1932, in the wake of the European banking crisis of 1931, the NBG took full control of the Banque d'Orient and integrated it into its operations. \nIn the 2010s, activist Artemis Storras\u00a0, leader of the ultra-nationalist Assembly of Greeks, claimed ownership of assets from the Banque d'Orient in a publicity stunt that was quickly dismissed by the Greek authorities.\nSee also\nBank of Athens\nNotes\n^ Johann Strauss (July 2016). \"Language and power in the late Ottoman Empire\".

    "The Yazbaki clan is a prominent Druze family in Lebanon and, alongside the Jumblatt clan, has been one of the two dominant Druze clans since the mid-18th century. Both clans have historically vied for significant influence within the Lebanese political establishment.\nHistory\nThe Yazbaki faction has been led by the Arslan family, whose leadership dates back to the 15th century.\nAn inner-Druze conflict in Lebanon during the 18th and early 19th centuries brought the Yazbaki and Jumblatt factions to prominence in Druze political affairs in Mount Lebanon. This division likely stems from the Druze tactic of aligning with various power contenders during crises, showcasing their adaptability (Yazbakis) and resilience (Jumblattis).\nDuring the Lebanese Civil War, the Arslan family's status declined due to their collaboration with the Kataeb Party. To prevent the Arslan clan from regaining influence, the politician Walid Jumblatt offered numerous Yazbaki activists positions within his various organizations.\nPolitical Influence\nBoth the Yazbaki and Jumblatt clans have played crucial roles in Lebanese politics, often competing for power and influence within the Druze community and the broader political landscape of Lebanon.  Throughout its history, the Yazbaki leadership has generally supported the existing political establishment and the concept of \"legitimacy.\"\nSee Also\nDruze in Lebanon\nJumblatt family\nArslan family\nAcademic sources\n^ a b c Salibi, Kamal S.

It has received positive reviews from critics.\nReception\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 4 out of 5 stars, with critic James Christopher Monger writing that \"Phillips draws the bulk of his material out of the positive vibes of new fatherhood\" with an album that has various genres and moods, but \"all signature Grant Lee Phillips\". In American Songwriter, Peter Gerstenzang rated Little Moon 4 out of 5 stars, calling it Phillips' strongest album. Stephen Rylance of PopMatters gave this release a 5 out of 10, stating that this album gives glimpses of how good Phillips can be but the inconsistent quality between tracks results in a middling album that \"sees a lack of imagination and an over-reliance on hackneyed musical and lyrical phrases threatening to eclipse Grant-Lee Phillips\u2019 indubitable talent\".\nOnline retailer iTunes named this Best Singer/Songwriter Album of 2009. \"Strangest Thing\" was highlighted as Song of the Day by NPR, where Barbara Mitchell called it \"an ode to optimism\".\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Grant-Lee Phillips.\n\"Good Morning Happiness\"\u00a0\u2013 2:48\n\"Strangest Thing\"\u00a0\u2013 4:08\n\"Little Moon\"\u00a0\u2013 4:19\n\"It Ain't the Old Cold War Harry\"\u00a0\u2013 3:41\n\"Seal It with a Kiss\"\u00a0\u2013 3:46\n\"Nightbirds\"\u00a0\u2013 3:15\n\"Violet\"\u00a0\u2013 2:44\n\"Buried Treasure\"\u00a0\u2013 4:26\n\"Blind Tom\"\u00a0\u2013 2:57\n\"One Morning\"\u00a0\u2013 4:52\n\"Older Now\"\u00a0\u2013 3:18\n\"The Sun Shines on Jupiter\"\u00a0\u2013 4:11\nPersonnel\nGrant-Lee Phillips\u00a0\u2013 12-string guitar, acoustic guitar, baritone guitar, electric guitar, banjo, vocals\nSebastian Aymanns\u00a0\u2013 percussion\nJay Bellerose\u00a0\u2013 drums, percussion\nPaul Bryan\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar (\"Seal It with a Kiss\", \"One Morning\", and \"The Sun Shines on Jupiter\"), backing vocals (\"Seal It with a Kiss\", \"One Morning\", and \"The Sun Shines on Jupiter\"), horn arrangements, string arrangements, production\nDaphne Chen\u00a0\u2013 violin\nRichard Dodd\u00a0\u2013 cello\nJamie Edwards\u00a0\u2013 clavinet, keyboards, Moog synthesizer, Hammond organ, piano, Wurlitzer, backing vocals (\"Seal It with a Kiss\", \"One Morning\", and \"The Sun Shines on Jupiter\")\nAlma Fernandez\u00a0\u2013 viola\nRyan Freeland\u00a0\u2013 audio engineering, mixing\nEric Gorfain\u00a0\u2013 violin\nGavin Lurssen\u00a0\u2013 audio mastering\nDenise Siegel\u00a0\u2013 backing vocals (\"The Sun Shines on Jupiter\"), art conception, photography\nJason Thor\u00a0\u2013 trombone, bass trombone, tuba\nMichael Triplett\u00a0\u2013 layout design\nSee also\n2009 in American music\nList of 2009 albums\n",
    "Stephen Mitchell (26 May 1948 - 30 January 2024) was a British historian and epigrapher, specialising in Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine Anatolia. He was a professor at Swansea and Exeter University.\nLife\nStephen Mitchell was the son of David Mitchell, a tutor of philosophy at Worcester College, Oxford, and Barbara Mitchell, a tutor of Latin at St Anne's College, Oxford. He studied literae humaniores at St John's College, Oxford from 1966 to 1970 and then undertook a DPhil on The History and Archaeology of Galatia under the supervision of Ewen Bowie and Eric Gray, which he completed in 1975.\nMitchell and his partner Matina had three children: Lawrence, Daniel, and Samuel.\nCareer\nMitchell was a temporary lecturer of Latin and ancient history at the University of Bristol from 1973 to 1974 and had a research lectureship at Christ Church, Oxford from 1975 to 1976. He was lecturer in ancient history at the University of Swansea from 1976 until 1993, when he was promoted to full professor. From 2002 until 2012, he was Levehulme Professor of Hellenistic Culture at Exeter University, where he established a \"Centre for Hellenistic Culture and Society,\" and served as head of department.\nMitchell became a member of the British Institute at Ankara in 1970, serving as a member of its council, as honorary secretary (1996\u20131999, 2009\u20132014), as chair (2016\u20132021), and as vice-president (2023\u20132024). His advocacy of the institute was \"instrumental in its transformation into a substantial research powerhouse that connects the ancient and the contemporary.\" He\nwas also President of the British Epigraphy Society (1999\u20132002) and of the Association Internationale d\u2019\u00c9pigraphie Grecque et Latine (AIEGL, 2008\u20132012).\nResearch\nMitchell's research focussed on Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine Anatolia. His doctoral thesis on Galatia was innovative for its combination of literary, archaeological, and epigraphic sources. In the 1980s, he established the \"Pisidia Survey Project\", which carried out archaeological survey work in Pisidia and Pamphylia, in collaboration with Marc Waelkens, Sabri Aydal, and Lut Vandeput. He authored or co-authored monographs on Cremna, Pisidian Antioch, and the Via Sebaste.\nIn addition, to this regionally focussed work, Mitchell produced more wide-ranging works of religious and cultural history, beginning with Anatolia: land, Men, and Gods in Asia Minor (1993). In the 2000s, Mitchell directed an AHRC project on \"Pagan Monotheism in the Roman Empire\", arguing for the existence of monotheism in the Greco-Roman world outside of the Abrahamic religions.\nIn the 2010s, Mitchell and David French co-authored a corpus of The Greek and Latin Inscriptions of Ankara (Ancyra) (2012, 2019).\nRecognition\nMitchell was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 2002 and subsequently served on its council. He received an honorary doctorate in theology from the Humboldt University of Berlin in 2006 and became an honorary fellow of St. John's College, Oxford in 2018. In 2020, Mitchell received the Gustave Schlumberger Prize from the French Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres for services to epigraphy and his volumes on the inscriptions of Ankara.\nSelect bibliography\nMitchell, Stephen (1995).

    "\"Fuselage station\" redirects here. For fuselage-located weapon mounting point, see Weapon station.\nTwo points on a fuselage at waterline 100/fuselage station 93 and waterline 101/fuselage station 276\nLofting coordinates are used for aircraft body measurements. The system derives from the one that was used in the shipbuilding lofting process, with longitudinal axis labeled as \"stations\" (usually fuselage stations, frame stations, FS), transverse axis as \"buttocks lines\" (or butt lines, BL), and vertical axis as \"waterlines\" (WL). The lofting coordinate frame is similar, but not the same as aircraft principal axes used to describe the aircraft flight. For the US-manufactured aircraft the ticks on the axes are labeled in inches, (for example, WL 100 is 100 inches above the base waterline).\nFuselage station\nFuselage stations on a scheme of a fuselage (atypically FS 0 is amidship, usually origin is at the nose, and FS values are nonnegative)\nFuselage stations are traditionally nonnegative, thus the origin is located at the nose of the plane or, sometimes, ahead of it. When compared to the coordinates used for aeromechanics, the fuselage stations are measured in the opposite direction than the ticks on the x-axis (and might not be aligned at all, if the wind-aligned coordinate system is used to describe the flight). Some manufacturers us designation \"body stations\", with the corresponding abbreviation BS.\nWaterline\nSee also: Waterlines \u00a7\u00a0Aircraft\nWater lines on a scheme of a fuselage. Baseline is at the ground line, all WL values are nonnegative\nPer the US Air Force Airframe Maintenance and Repair Manual (1960), a horizontal waterline extends from the nose cone of the aircraft to the exhaust cone. The base line of the aircraft is designated as waterline 0 (zero). The location of this base line varies on different types of aircraft. However. the planes of all waterlines above and below the zero waterline are parallel. The waterline number (WL or W.L.) in the US is expressed in inches, values increase upwards. Two typical alignments for the base line are the tip of the nose (negative WL are possible) or the \"nominal ground plane\" (measurements will be nonnegative).\nButt line\nButt lines on a scheme of a stabilizer (BL ticks are symmetrical here, usually ticks on the left are negative)\nButt line ticks increase to the right of the pilot with the origin at the centerline. When compared to the (right-handed) aeromechanics coordinate systems, the direction of the butt line is opposite to the y-axis.\nOther\nOther coordinate references on the aircraft body\nMany other reference points are used, especially on a large aircraft:\nAileron station (AS), distance from the inboard edge of an aileron;\nFlap station (KS), distance from the edge of the flap;\nNacelle station (NS);\nElevator station (ES);\nVertical stabilizer station (VSS).\n",

    "\nEvents in 1873 in animation.\nEvents\nDecember: The pioneer animator Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud starts holding free magic lantern shows in the style of Fran\u00e7ois-Napol\u00e9on-Marie Moigno.  Reynaud had previously worked as an assistant of Moigno. \nSpecific date unknown: In 1873, Leland Stanford approached Eadweard Muybridge and instructed him to photograph Stanford's favorite trotter Occident in action. Initially, Muybridge believed it was impossible to get a good picture of a horse at full speed. He knew of only a few examples of instantaneous photography made in London and Paris, that depicted street scenes. These were made in very practical conditions, with subjects moving towards the camera no faster than the ordinary walk of a man, in which the legs had not been essayed at all. He explained that photography simply had not yet advanced far enough to record a horse flashing by the camera. Stanford insisted, and Muybridge agreed to try. The first experiments were executed over several days. To create the needed bright backdrop, white sheets were collected and Occident was trained to walk past them without flinching. Then more sheets were gathered to lay over the ground, so the legs would be clearly visible, and Occident was trained to walk over them. Muybridge developed a spring-activated shutter system, leaving an opening of 1/8 of an inch, and in the end, managed to reduce the shutter speed to a reported 1/500th of a second. Nonetheless, the best result was a very blurry and shadowy image of the trotting horse. Muybridge was far from satisfied with the result, but to his surprise, Stanford reacted very enthusiastically after carefully studying the foggy outlines of the legs in the picture. Although Stanford agreed that the photograph was not successful regarding image quality, it was satisfactory as proof of his theory about the horse's motions. Most of the previous depictions and descriptions had indeed been wrong. Before leaving his customer, Muybridge promised to concentrate his thoughts on coming up with a faster photographic process for the project. Although Stanford later claimed he did not contemplate publishing the results, the local press was informed and it was hailed as a triumph in photography by The Daily Alta California. This was the start of Muybridge's experiments with chronophotography, an important step in the development of motion pictures.\nBirths\nSeptember\nSeptember 3: Charles Allan Gilbert, American animator, illustrator, and World War I-era camouflage artist, (pioneer of silhouette animation, worked for John R.

    "Species of beetle\nCaccothryptus brendelli is a species of minute marsh-loving beetle in the subfamily Limnichinae. The species was described alongside five other Caccothryptus species by Natural History Museum entomologist Keita Matsumoto in 2021, using specimens gathered by Martin J. D. Brendell (curator of the Coleoptera Department of Entomology at the Natural History Museum, London) at Kathmandu, Nepal in 1983. One of Brendell's specimens were distinguished from Caccothryptus testudo due to distinct genital structures and labeled C. brendelli after Brendell.\nTaxonomy\nThe Limnichidae (minute marsh-loving beetle) genus Caccothryptus was first described by David Sharp in 1902. In 2014, the genus was divided into five species groups by Carles Hernando and Ignacio Ribera.\nA group of Caccothryptus specimens were collected in 1983 in Kathmandu, Nepal by Martin J. D. Brendell, curator of Coleoptera Department of Entomology at the Natural History Museum, London. These were stored at the Natural History Museum. In 2021, museum entomologist Keita Matsumoto identified a number of distinct species from these specimens. One male specimen from Kathmandu, found under the bark of a dead tree, was labeled as the holotype for Caccothryptus brendelli. C. brendelli was placed in the species group C. testudo and named for Brendell.\nDescription\nThe Caccothryptus brendelli specimens identified by Matsumoto has an elytral length of 3.36\u00a0mm, and an elytral width of 2.44\u00a0mm. Their prothorax is 0.94\u00a0mm in length and 2.07\u00a0mm in width. C. brendelli has an elongated oval body, brown in colour except for reddish-brown tibia and long, white setae, on the dorsum and light yellow setae on the underside. Its tarsi are divided into five segments, of increasing length, with the fifth segment as long as the others combined. It has long, narrow, light brown tarsal claws. The beetle's head, smooth and punctured, is slightly retracted into its pronotum, and features eleven-segment antennae. Little sexual dimorphism exists between the male and female specimen, beyond a longer fifth abdominal ventrite on the female.\nThe beetle's genitals display a number of differences from the original classification of C. testudo, which enabled its classification as a separate species. The apex of C. brendelli's median lobe narrows to a slightly pointed tip along the side. It has a narrow depression between the notches on the tip of the genitalia, both of which are V-shaped from below. The genitals' dorsum are wavy, forming two concave curves along the side.\n",
    "Municipal building in Carterton, Oxfordshire, England\nCarterton Town Hall is a municipal building in Alvescot Road in Carterton, Oxfordshire, a town in England. It accommodates the offices and meeting place of Carterton Town Council.\nHistory\nThe settlement of Carterton was founded by a property speculator, William Carter, in May 1900. Following the establishment of RAF Brize Norton, just to the south of the settlement, in 1937, the settlement grew steadily, and it adopted town status in about 1980. In the early 1980s, the new council decided to commission a town hall. The site they selected, on the southeast side of Alvescot Road, was open land.\nConstruction of the new building started in 1982. It was designed broadly in the neoclassical style, built in yellow brick and was officially opened by the mayor, Ernest Crapper, in March 1983. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of two bays facing onto a small garden adjacent to the building. On the ground floor, there were two segmental headed openings, the left of which contained a recessed doorway and the right of which contained a casement window with a wooden panel below. On the first floor, there was a segmental headed casement window on the left, and a French door with a balcony and iron railings on the right. The building was surmounted by a pitched roof with a weather vane. Internally, the principal room was a small assembly hall which was suitable for meetings but not for social events.\nA war memorial, in the form of a cross patt\u00e9e on a pedestal, which was intended to commemorate the lives of local people who had died in the First World War, and which had originally been erected at the crossroads after the war, was relocated to the garden in front of the town hall at that time. In 2004, a blue plaque, intended to commemorate founding of the town by William Carter a century beforehand, was fixed to the front of the building.\nA small single storey building to the northeast off the town hall, which had accommodated a veterinary practice, was demolished in 2014, allowing the creation of a small market square and landscaping. The town hall was extended to the southeast at that time to create new accommodation for the veterinary practice as well as a new entrance with a porch for the town hall. The previous doorway was partially bricked up and another casement window was installed in its place. The new market square was enhanced by the creation of a sensory garden which was officially opened, adjacent to the town hall, in September 2022.\n",

He was a member of the Communist Party since 1917.\nBiography\nFyodor Ivanovich Kolesov was the son of an employee. He worked as a clerk on the railway in Orenburg, and from 1916 - in Tashkent. From September 1917, he was a member of the executive committee of the Tashkent Soviet. He was one of the organizers of the Tashkent Rebellion (1917), a delegate to the 2nd All-Russian Congress of Soviets in Petrograd in October 1917, where he was elected a member of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, as well as one of the organizers of the armed uprising against the power of representatives of the provisional government in Tashkent in November 1917.\nFrom November 1917 to November 1918, Fyodor Kolesov was the chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (SNK) of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, that is, the head of the Turkestan Republic and a member of the Turkestan Regional Party Committee. During this period, he personally commanded the troops that suppressed attempts to create autonomy in Ashgabat (the so-called Transcaspian Government) and Kokand (the Kokand Autonomy), as well as the Revolutionary troops that tried to overthrow the Emir of Bukhara by force in March 1918.\nThe actions of Fyodor Kolesov in the first year of the Civil War were sharply criticized by the prominent Red commander in the Turkestan Front, Yakov Melkumov in his memoirs.\nHe further participated in the Russian Civil War in 1918\u201320 as a political commissar. He was also a delegate to the 8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party in 1919.\nIn 1923 - 1928, F.I. Kolesov was chairman of the Supreme Economic Council of the Far East, a member of the Dalrevkom (Far Eastern Revolutionary Committee) and a member of the Gomel Provincial Executive Committee.\nIn 1929 - 1933 he studied at the Moscow Architectural Institute and after graduating, worked as an architect.\nHe wrote his memoirs about the Bukharan Revolution, about his prominent role in the establishment of Soviet power in Uzbekistan and Turkestan. He died on 29 July 1940 in his apartment in Moscow. By decision of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks, he was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery as an \u201cHonored Revolutionary\u201d (row 51, place 26). Taking into account Kolesov's important personal role in establishing Soviet power in Central Asia, an honorary rifle salvo was fired at the funeral.\n",
    "Species of South African harvester termite\nMicrohodotermes viator, commonly called the southern harvester termite, the Karoo harvesting termite, the wood-eating harvester termite, houtkapper (lit.\u2009'wood cutter'), and stokkiesdraer (lit.\u2009'stick carrier'), is a species of harvester termite native to the desert shrubland of Namibia and South Africa. The eusocial insects inhabit soil mounds called heuweltjies. In 2024, researchers found inhabited Microhodotermes viator mounds up to 34,000 years old\u2014by far the oldest active termite structures ever dated.\nDescription\nA worker termite\nThe holotype, collected and first described by Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latrielle in 1804, has a clear red-brown head with a width of 3.8\u00a0mm. The unusually large head of M. viator is distinctive among Hodotermitidae. On its head are sharply-defined bright yellow pseudo-ocelli. The body is an opaque yellow-orange, with a dark band in the transverse furrow of the prothorax, and the legs are pale yellow. Claude Fuller described the legs as brown or red-brown, with the tarsi and the tips of the tibiae and femora being yellow.\nLatrielle described the larva as having a light brown body and a large brown head, distinctly faceted black eyes, and yellow ocelli.\nThe species is polymorphic, having different forms for different castes, and sexually dimorphic. Males are often larger than females. Soldier termites have long, thin jaws that curve inward only at their tips, and body lengths of 7\u201313\u00a0mm, while workers have indistinctly striped brown abdomens and body lengths between 6\u20138\u00a0mm. Alates have an average body length of 14.01\u00a0mm.\nDistribution and habitat\nMicrohodotermes viator is found in South Africa and Namibia, particularly on the west coast. It is found mainly in scrubland with annual precipitation of 125\u2013750mm. The precise range of M. viator has not been mapped. M. viator colonies in Namaqualand experience a warm and dry climate, with no perennial rivers in the area.\nBehavior\nMicrohodotermes viator are eusocial insects, forming colonies of several thousand with castes of workers and soldiers. They are foragers of plant material and emerge from their colonies during the day in winter and during the night in summer. A 1993 study suggests that M. viator thwarts predators by emerging to forage at unpredictable times of day, irrespective of temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Foraging M. viator work in groups to cut plants, particularly grass stalks and woody plants (particularly Pteronia), in pieces 1\u20132\u00a0cm long and carry them back to the nest through subsurface tunnels to be stored in underground chambers. They digest cellulose, making them extremely important decomposers in the microorganism-poor desert biomes they inhabit.\nNesting\nThe large spots of reduced vegetation are heuweltjies, which are inhabited by Microhodotermes viator and cover 20% of South Africa's west coast.\nColonies of Microhodotermes viator form nests, including in regularly-spaced circular mounds of earth called heuweltjies (meaning 'little hills'), which when viewed from above resemble large fairy circles. Heuweltjies inhabited by M. viator cover over 20% of South Africa's west coast, including the Fynbos and Succulent Karoo biomes, and can reach up to 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) in diameter and 2 metres (6.6\u00a0ft) in height. There has been debate as to whether the heuweltjies are directly constructed by termites or if their formation is the product of erosion, both termite-influenced and not. The distribution of heuweltjies represents roughly 49% of the distribution of M. viator. M. viator colonies outside of the Succulent Karoo and Nama Karoo biomes do not form mounds; they live in nests a few metres underground. Studies investigating the role of M. viator in heuweltjie formation have found that the termites form them indirectly as ecosystem engineers by enriching the soil around their nests with organic matter, which has promoted growth of widely separated patches of vegetation that in turn influenced wind erosion to form the mounds. The soil chemistry of the heuweltjies is different from the surrounding soil, with mineral enrichments that align with those associated with other termite formations. The even spacing of the mounds is explained by proponents of the zoogenic hypothesis as being a result of competition between colonies for space and vegetation.\nThe superficial sand on heuweltjies inhabited by M. viator is also host to other termites, ants, burrowing bees, mole-rats, and aardvarks, all of whom actively rework the earth. The subsurface structure of the mounds, though, is dominated by the complex of tunnels and chambers constructed by M. viator. A study of mounds on the western bank of Clanwilliam Dam in South Africa, found active M. viator habitation in 78.9% of intact mounds, as indicated by piles of fresh frass.\nA worker moving a stick\nThe structures formed by M. viator are described as having four principal forms: anastomosing tubular tunnels 3\u00a0mm\u20131\u00a0cm wide; hundreds of straight",
    "Historic tree in California\nThe Eagle Tree was a historic California sycamore (Platanus racemosa) tree in Compton, California. It was the marker for the border of Rancho San Pedro. The tree toppled in 2022, from a combination of disease and a long history of vandalism and government neglect. At that time, it was on land owned by the Chevron Corporation. Its name came from the eagles that were commonly found nesting on the tree.\nHistory\nHenry Hancock notes a sycamore tree at the top of an 1859 map as the beginning of the territory of Rancho San Pedro\nThe tree dates back to December 1857 when it was used as the natural boundary marker in Mexican surveys to show the extent of Rancho San Pedro. It was also used for navigational purposes as it was a tall landmark. Many travelers used it as there were many tall fields of mustard in the area. As time passed, the City of Compton was formed and a neighborhood was formed near the tree. However, the Standard Oil Company of California (now Chevron Corporation) found that the best place to drill was along the border of the former ranch, meaning that the tree would have to be removed. The Native Daughters of the Golden West advocated for the protection of the tree, and an agreement was made where the pipeline would share the land with the tree, which was then fenced off. In 1947, the Daughters placed a historic marker and plaque there. The Standard Oil Company sponsored it and is on private property.\nA designation of the tree as a California Historic Landmark was proposed, but it was never completed. The tree and its accompanying plaque were repeatedly damaged in the 1980s. An apartment building was built under the tree. Jesus Arroyo took care of the tree starting in 2009, when he moved into the apartment. One of the branches fell off the tree in 2015, crushing the roof of one of the apartment buildings. Arroyo had called the city earlier about concerns, but they did not do anything. After the branch's fall, the city had a company trim the tree, but the company ended up removing the entire canopy, removing nearly all of the leaves on the tree. An arborist on location discovered a large hole that reached from the top of the tree to the trunk and believed that the tree was suffering from a fatal disease. They recommended that intense care must be taken to keep the tree alive. In 2017, the tree stopped growing leaves, which may have been due to a lightning strike.\nOn April 7, 2022, at approximately 9:20 PM, the Eagle Tree's main trunk fell over and crushed a car parked behind the apartment it covered. The main tree had died, but there was healthy, young growth surrounding the trunk. A young 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m) tall clone tree was found to be growing behind the fallen trunk as well. The 7 short tons (6,400\u00a0kg) trunk was preserved and is located in a space adjacent to the Chevron property, where it is in holding while plans are being made to display it as a historic resource. Arroyo decided to take care of the new growths, but Chevron asked him to take the fence protecting the plants down within a year, as it was blocking access to their property. Chevron soon took down the fence and placed a higher fence covered in tarp and topped with barbed wire that blocked Arroyo's ability to go on the company's property to take care of the plants. On April 7, 2023, a Chevron work crew removed the clone tree, but cuttings for possible propagation were allowed to be taken before. The cuttings were distributed to multiple arborist institutions, like Huntington Library's Botanical Garden, Theodore Payne Foundation and the California Botanic Garden. Chevron explained that the clone tree had the fusarium dieback disease transmitted by a tea shot-hole borer and had to be removed. Many supporters of the tree advocated for a cutting being planted at the former site of the Eagle Tree, as the plaque had been unchanged.\nThe Eagle Tree's cuttings were put in the care of North East Trees and were distributed to cities and historic sites in Southern California to keep the tree's legacy alive. The first cutting was planted at East Los Angeles College in 2024 as a part of an Earth Day celebration.\nSee also\nList of individual trees\n",

    "The International Development and Early Learning Assessment (IDELA) is a method of measuring early development in children at a pre-primary school level.\nIt was developed for Save the Children between 2011 and 2015.\nBackground\nCognitive, socio-emotional and physical development during early childhood is crucial to the child's ability to achieve their potential, and to the social and economic health of society as a whole.\nHowever, poverty, stunting and lack of intellectual stimulus in low- and middle-income countries damage early development of almost half of all children aged 3 to 4, which will affect them through their lives.\nOne of the main reasons is lack of access to early childhood education programs, particularly for poor, rural families.\nExisting tools for ECCD measurement had mostly been used in high-income countries, and were hard to adapt to poorer countries.\nOften they were costly, and many had limitations such as measuring only one skill or age group, or relying on reports from parents or teachers rather than direct measurement.\nObjectives\nBefore IDELA was developed there were no tools for measuring early Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) in low and middle income country that balanced the needs for consistency across different countries, ease of use and psychometric rigor. \nIDELA was to be a feasible, holistic, rigorous, open source instrument that ccould easily be adapted to different societies. \nIt would support continuous program improvement across the many field sites of Save the Children and their partners, increase accountability among ECCD initiatives, and provide data about ECCD outcomes that governments and agencies could use to identify and scale up successful ECCD programs.\nDevelopment\nDevelopment of IDELA began in 2011 based on four early childhood development domains, drawn from existing standards for early childhood education: physical, language/literacy, numeracy/cognitive and social-emotional.\nOver 65 items were considered at first, but these were reduced to 33 during qualitative review.\nBetween 2013 and 2015 data was collected from 11 sites in different countries.\nAlthough there were limitations to the approach, results show that IDELA is a practical and rigorous method of measuring learning and development before children begin their primary schooling.\nAssessment approach\nChildren from 42 to 78 months old can be asssessed in about 30 minutes.\nA trained assessor sits with the child, follows a scripted protocol for each test and observes the child's response.\nAfter six of the most challenging tests, and after the child interview, the assessor records whether the child was persistent, motivated and attentive in trying to complete the task.\nMaterials needed are a pencil, blank paper, small items for counting (such as beans or buttons), nine picture cards related to eight items on the assessment, and\na storybook that contains pictures and text.\nSkills assessed are:\nResults\nA 2019 study of IDELA results in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Uganda and Vietnam confirmed that IDELA was useful for evaluating programs and monitoring progress within a country, but found it did not give a valid basis for comparison between countries.\nA study published in 2021 used data from Ghana to test how well IDELA predicted future skills in reading, as measured by the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA), and in mathematics as measured by the Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA).\nResults showed strong correlation, with scores in the Emergent Literacy domain a strong predictor of EGRA scores, and the scores in the Emergent Numeracy domain a strong predictor for EGMA scores.\nSee also\nAssessment of basic language and learning skills\nEducational psychology\n",
    "\n2017 studio album by The Feelies\n\"I have hearing problems, so I'm drawn more to quieter music now. The songs seemed to require that approach but that also stemmed from the demos we made. We liked the feel and that inspired us to record at my place. We really wanted to get the same feel from those sessions onto the record. Part of it's the technique and part of it's the vibe of being in a room you're familiar with. We've rehearsed here since the late '80s, so we're not looking at the clock, thinking, 'Oh, we just spent $100 just working on this one part.'\"\n\u2014Feelies' guitarist and vocalist Glenn Mercer on differences recording In Between versus the band's earliest output\nIn Between is a 2017 studio album by American alternative rock band The Feelies. It has received positive reviews from critics.\nReception\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, In Between received \"generally favorable reviews\" based on a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 from 13 critic scores. Editors at AllMusic rated this album 3.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Mark Deming writing that this album \"dials back a bit on the tempos as well as the electric guitars\" with more subdued music than the band's late 1980s and early 1990s work, but continued that \"it's never cautious; this is very much the work of one of America's best and most venerable independent bands, and it confirms the Feelies are still a genuine creative force as they approach their 40th anniversary\". Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune stated that the band \"finds the sweet spot between tranquillity and propulsion\" on this release and that they sound \"focused on moving ahead, ever in between stations\". Classic Rock's Julian Marszalek scored In Between 4 out of 5 stars, declaring it a career-best for the musicians whose \"grip of melody remains very much in place throughout, as do their love of jangling intertwining guitars and a strict sense of rhythm\". In The Los\u00a0Angeles Times, Randall Roberts emphasized the continuity between this music and the band's earlier work, stating, \"like most of their songs, the new ones are fueled by seemingly simple but absolutely engaging riff-based melodies, which launch from the starting gates like thoroughbreds at the Derby and run with focused power\".\nJuan Edgardo Rodr\u00edguez of No Ripcord gave this album a 7 out of 10, for music that is \"as unassuming as it is stubbornly unchangeable\" with \"mantric strums with casual but also demanding arrangements\". Editors at Pitchfork scored this release 8.0 out of 10 and critic Marc Masters praised it for being \"both mellow and intense in ways only the Feelies can pull off\". At PopMatters, Ed Whitlock gave In Between an 8 out of 10, calling it a testament to \"strict adherence to a framework to reveal the deepest levels of creativity and mastery of vision\" with the interplay of the band members, with specific praise for each. In The Skinny, Andrew Gordon rated this work 3 out of 5 stars and called it more subdued than the band's previous work and drew comparisons to their 1986 album The Good Earth, as well as fellow New\u00a0Jersey-based indie rock bands Real Estate and Yo La Tengo. In Between received 7.5 out of 10 stars in Under the Radar, where Matthew Berlyant called it \"a complete beauty\", making \"another gem\" in the band's \"flawless discography\".

    "\n2024 single by JoJo Siwa\nFor the same-titled EP by JoJo Siwa or other similarly titled works, see Guilty Pleasure (EP) and Guilty pleasure (disambiguation).\n\"Guilty Pleasure\" is a song by the American singer JoJo Siwa taken from Siwa's fourth studio EP, Guilty Pleasure (EP). She wrote the track with six other writers, most notably Meghan Trainor, and three of them also produced the song, together with DJ White Shadow. Columbia Records released the song as a single concurrently with its parent album on July 12, 2024.\nAn accompanying music video for \"Guilty Pleasure\", directed by Siwa and Marc Klasfeld, was released the same day as the single's release. It stars Siwa and various dancers. The video includes scenes with Siwa dressed provocatively acting promiscuous.\nBackground and release\nSiwa announced the EP, her fourth original EP, on June 30, 2024. \"Guilty Pleasure\" had its debut by Siwa at a recent performance at Trixie Mattel's New York City Pride celebration in Central Park. The reality star was excited to reveal the Guilty Pleasure EP's release date while performing live, even though her audience wasn't entirely responsive. Its music video debuted along with its release.\nComposition and lyrics\nAccording to Her Campus, \"Guilty Pleasure\" is about Siwa suggesting her lover to make a move on her sexually, although it may also be a way of Siwa's acceptance of her infamous music career. Vulture noted it as \"thumping and nonspecific electronic-pop.\"\nCritical reception\n\"Guilty Pleasure\" received mainly positive reviews upon release unlike Siwa's previous single \"Karma.\" Vulture praised the song for it's upbeatness and catchiness, meanwhile The Cut complimented it's nostalgic sound calling it \"a relic from 2012.\"\nMusic video\nSiwa and Klasfeld wrote and directed the music video for \"Guilty Pleasure.\" The music video was released on July 12, 2024, shortly after the single's release and received mainly negative reviews from critics and social media users alike with The Cut calling it \"a horny montage of fog machines, pleather, dancing bears, and power tools.\" The video was choreographed by Richy Jackson whose choreography was also heavily criticized by social media users but was received well by critics. The video features Siwa at a Guilty Pleasure House wearing a bra made of teddy bear heads along with rhinestone straps as she gets rowdy with adult-size teddy bears at a burlesque-style peep show. As the video continues she dances in a warehouse dressed as a construction worker in bedazzled attire and finally dressed as a bejeweled dark angel dances in a church with some people wearing dog collars and others dressed as nuns.\nPersonnel\nThe following people worked on the song:\nJoJo Siwa - lead vocals, songwriter\nKatie Silverman - songwriter, producer\nMichael Smith - songwriter, producer, mixing engineer\nBart Schoudel - recording engineer\nRandy Merrill - mastering engineer\nRelease history\n",
    "French CEO\nChristel Bories, born May 20, 1964 in Bourgoin-Jallieu (Is\u00e8re), is a French business leader.\nBiography\nShe is the daughter of Jean-Louis and Janine Sauvonnet. Her parents worked in Tr\u00e9fim\u00e9taux as engineers when she was born.\nAfter graduating from HEC Paris in 1986, she spent 7 years in consulting, at Booz Allen Hamilton then at Corporate Value Associates (CVA).\nIn 1993, Jean-Pierre Rodier appointed her director of strategy and control at Union Mini\u00e8re (which became Umicore in 2001).\nIn 1995, she followed Jean-Pierre Rodier to Pechiney as director of strategy and management control. At that time, she was the only female member of the group's management team, which was also made up exclusively of polytechnique graduates. In 1998, she succeeded Patrick Kron as director of the packaging sector, which represents 20% of the group's activity.\nFollowing Alcan's takeover bid for Pechiney in 2003, she is the only member of the former Pechiney steering committee to occupy an important position in the new entity. In fact, she is named packaging boss of the merged group. In 2006, Alcan's boss, Travis Engen, appointed her head of finished aluminum products for the automobile and aeronautics industry (Alcan EP).\nIn 2007, Alcan was the subject of a takeover bid by Rio Tinto. Christel Bories retained her position, but the division she managed was put up for sale and ultimately became an independent company, Constellium, which she managed in 2011. However, a conflict of values \u200b\u200bfollowed with the Apollo fund which was the new reference shareholder of Constellium, and Christel Bories resigns.\nIn 2013, she was Deputy CEO of Ipsen, responsible for restoring profitability and changing corporate culture. Following a quarrel with the reigning general manager, they both had to leave the company in March 2016, replaced by the American David Meek.\nAt the beginning of 2017, she was appointed Deputy Managing Director of the Eramet group. She succeeded Patrick Buffet as CEO of Eramet on May 23, 2017. The news caused Eramet shares to rise more than 6% on the stock market.\nIn March 2021, the Duval family and the French State, the main shareholders of Eramet, negotiated about a change in governance and a possible departure of Christel Bories, desired by the Duvals. However, the news caused the stock to fall and displeased employees. The balance sheet of Christel Bories' activity also works in her favor, because she has turned around the nickel extraction activities in New Caledonia and Indonesia, as well as the manganese activity in Gabon. This is why the French Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire refused to support the request of Georges and Cyril Duval.\nBooks\nL'industrie racont\u00e9e \u00e0 mes ados... qui s'en fichent, Dunod, 2013\nPrivate life\nShe married Fran\u00e7ois Bories in 1989, and had 2 children.\nShe practices tennis, skiing and climbing.\nAward\nOfficer of the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite, Knighthood in 2010.\n",
    "Australian musician\nMusical artist\nAlison Lewis, known professionally as Zo\u00e8 Zanias, is an Australian musician, producer, and DJ based in Berlin. Born in Melbourne, she became one half of the electronic duo Linea Aspera after moving to London. The act were considered to be at the forefront of the minimal wave resurgence before their disbanding in 2013. \nAfter a stint in the short-lived band Keluar and a string of EPs, Zanias released her debut solo album, Into the All (2018). She continued releasing solo material through her label Fleisch Records, which she co-founded in 2016. She has collaborated with a number of acts including the likes of Delerium, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and I Hate Models, and has embarked on a number of world tours.     \nBiography\nZanias was born in Melbourne, Australia and raised throughout Southeast Asia. She had moved to London to study archeology when she met musician Ryan Ambridge. Together they founded the electronic act Linea Aspera in November 2011. They released their self-titled debut in January 2012 and their first full-length album later that year. The duo had planned to tour North America in late 2012, but had to cancel due to visa issues. Before their breakup in 2013, Linea Aspera had become a major player in the resurgent minimal wave scene, influencing contemporaries such as Boy Harsher.\nIn 2012, Zanias moved to Berlin and formed the band Keluar with producer Sid Lamar from the techno outfit Schwefelgelb. The band is named after the Indonesian and Malaysian word meaning \"to go out\" and was meant as a hint to Zanias' upbringing in those countries. Their self-titled debut was released in June 2014 through the label Desire. They released a follow-up EP in 2015 titled Panguna. Her first release as a solo artist was the EP 23.10.14 in 2015.\nIn September 2016, Zanias released the EP To the Core which featured the song \"Follow the Body\". The song's music video was directed by Clay Adamczyk and shot in Poland near the Baltic Sea. As of June 2024, the music video has over 1.7 million views on YouTube. At the end of 2018 she released her debut studio album, Into the All, through the label Candela Rising. A year later, she reunited with Ambridge to announce new material for Linea Aspera. Preservation Bias, released in June 2019, featured a number of rare and unused songs from the duo's early years. Their second studio album, LP II, featuring all brand new material, was released the following year.\nZanias released her second album, Unearthed in September 2021 through the label Fleisch Records. Fleisch, which she co-founded in 2016, has released works from artists such as Kontravoid, Multiple Man, and Neu-Romancer. In 2023, Flesich partnered with Metropolis Records to release Zanias' third studio album, Chrysalis. Zanias took inspiration for the album's sound from the lush rainforest habitat of Queensland, Australia, where the album was in part produced. According to Zanias, \"each of the album\u2019s eight songs were inspired by a series of unfortunate events\" and deal with themes such as Capitalism and isolation. She announced a tour in support for the album with Neu-Romancer's Laura Bailey joining her onstage as a live bassist.\nZanias made her first live collaboration as a guest singer for The Jesus and Mary Chain in 2023 and joined the band again at the Cruel World festival in Pasadena in 2024. In February that year, she released her fourth album, Ecdysis, composed entirely of instrumental songs. Later that same year she produced a remix for the Delerium single \"Remember Love\".\nArtistry\nZanias has cited artists such as Grimes, Zola Jesus, and Light Asylum as early inspirations for her work as a solo artist. \"They were completely on their own on stage and  watching them and thinking, 'well, I don\u2019t need a band. I could just do this'\". Other artists she has mentioned influences on her work include HTRK, Fever Ray, Dead Can Dance, Current 93, Tool, and Coil.\nIn an interview with Vice, Zanias described how Berlin's expansive electronic music scene had influenced her style: \"You listen to all these sounds, and the DJs at Berghain and other clubs in Berlin put in a real effort to play interesting sounds  When people put that effort in, you can get really inspired\u2014even by a single really nice snare. It can make you think about how you'd use that sound in a song\".\nPersonal Life\nIn May 2022, Zanias reported on her Instagram that she fell victim to a needle spiking incident at the Berghain nightclub in Berlin. She stated that she lost consciousness and collapsed before being brought backstage by her friends. As she regained consciousness, bouncers removed her and her friends from the premises and refused them reentry. A spokesperson for the Berlin Club Commission stated that they were aware of the situation and agreed that the club did not handle it \"in the best way\".\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nInto the All (2018)\nUnearthed (2021)\nChrysalis (2023)\nEcdysis (2024)\nEPs\n23.10.14 (2015)\nTo the Core",
    "Framework for comparing world religions.\nMeta-religion is a theoretical framework aimed at understanding and comparing various world religions by identifying common principles and values that transcend individual traditions. This concept seeks to foster a critical and rational examination of religious beliefs and practices, promoting a unified perspective that integrates diverse religious experiences. The idea of meta-religion is particularly significant within Islamic thought, where it is seen as a way to harmonize the various religious experiences of humanity under a single, comprehensive framework.\nKey characteristics\nMeta-religion is defined by several key characteristics. It is rational and critical, evaluating each religion based on historical and rational analysis rather than condemning any religion a priori. It considers the possibility that various religions may have a common divine origin, expressed through different historical and cultural contexts. This perspective allows for the recognition of shared ethical principles and values, fostering a dialogue that transcends individual traditions. According to al-Faruqi, meta-religion involves a belief in God or Ultimate Reality as the \"totally other\" and is not about testing the validity of religions through external or functional tests, but rather about understanding the condition of homo religiosus.\nHistorical Development\nThe concept of meta-religion has evolved through the efforts of scholars aiming to reconcile the diverse religious experiences of humanity.  Isma'il Raji al-Faruqi's work in the late 20th century significantly shaped the understanding of meta-religion within Islamic thought. He advocated for a rational approach to studying religions, proposing a meta-religion that acknowledges the potential divine origin of religious experiences while critically examining their historical manifestations. Al-Faruqi also suggested that meta-religion could serve as a basis for meaningful interfaith dialogue, where shared values and ethical principles are emphasized to foster mutual understanding.\nApplications\nMeta-religion can be applied in various fields, including interfaith dialogue, religious studies, and cultural analysis. In interfaith dialogue, it promotes mutual understanding and respect among different religious traditions by highlighting shared values and ethical principles. In religious studies, meta-religion provides a framework for the interdisciplinary study of religion, encouraging exploration of the broader context of religious phenomena. In cultural analysis, it examines the impact of religion on culture and society, analyzing how religious ideas shape art, literature, politics, and social norms.\nCriticisms\nMeta-religion has faced criticism. Some argue that it can oversimplify the complexities of individual religious traditions by focusing on commonalities. Others suggest it may inadvertently privilege certain philosophical or cultural perspectives over others, potentially leading to biased interpretations of religion. Critics like Abdulkader Tayob argue that al-Faruqi's approach manipulates philosophical frameworks like those of Kant to fit Islamic theological commitments, potentially limiting the space for contemplation or alternative religious expressions, such as Sufism or other forms of mysticism. This critique highlights that while al-Faruqi's approach sought to integrate religious values into socio-political contexts, it may have inadvertently sidelined diverse religious experiences and interpretations. Al-Faruqi himself acknowledged these challenges but maintained that a meta-religious approach could provide a valuable framework for understanding and engaging with diverse religious traditions.\n",
    "Peruvian TV hostess. actress and activist\nLilianne Rachel Braun Grodziensky (born January 8, 1971), better known as Lily Braun or as Lily Kubiliun, is a Peruvian television presenter, actress and activist. She is best known for her work in Nubeluz, joining the show in 1993 as a replacement for M\u00f3nica Santa Mar\u00eda and receiving the nickname Dalina traviesa.\nEarly life\nBraun was born in Lima on January 8, 1971, the daughter of Harry Braun and Nejume \"Noem\u00ed\" Grodziensky, both children of Jewish immigrants to Peru. Her father is of Hungarian Jewish descent, while her mother was born in Lima to a Russian Jewish father and a Romanian Jewish mother. Her mother, who lived in Peru until the age of 15, is a practicing Jew and a reiki instructor in Miami with a heavy interest in Buddhism, having studied painting at the School of Fine Arts in Peru, as well as in Israel.\nShe studied at Le\u00f3n Pinelo School, the city's Jewish school named after Antonio de Le\u00f3n Pinelo, graduating in 1987. Two years later, she moved to Miami, marrying lawyer David M. Kubiliun in 1992.\nCareer\nIn 1992, she replaced M\u00f3nica Santa Mar\u00eda as one of the presenters of Nubeluz, a children's television show, forming a duo with Almendra Gomelsky. They were joined by Colombian actress Xiomara Xibill\u00e9 the following year. Santa Mar\u00eda ultimately returned to the show soon after, but the show's popularity caused her mental stress and worsened her depression, leading to her sudden suicide on March 13, 1994. The night prior to her suicide, Braun had been vacationing in Miami with Gomelsky, who was called by Santa Mar\u00eda over her distress caused by an argument with her boyfriend, with Gomelsky suggesting that she purchase plane tickets and visit them. After becoming aware of her suicide, they immediately returned to Peru through an 11 a.m. flight, arriving at 3 p.m. and attending the wake at the Virgen de F\u00e1tima Church in Miraflores and the funeral in La Molina. Gomelsky was tasked with the announcement of her death in Nubeluz. Braun was emotionally affected by the suicide, quitting the show soon after.\nBack in the US, she obtained a degree from University of Florida and started working as a school teacher. She returned to TV as a presenter for local programmes, hosting Telemundo's Sue\u00f1os de Fama in 1998, and starring in the same network's Las Comadres in 2003. She later became a mediator for family cases recognised by the Supreme Court of Florida, later becoming a real estate agent. She currently works at UBQ Materials, an Israeli cleantech company.\nIn 2010, Braun and Gomelsky starred in \u00a1Gr\u00e1ntico, P\u00e1lmani, Zum!, a live show commemorating the 20th anniversary of Nubeluz. Six years later, another anniversary show took place at the amphitheatre of the Park of the Exhibition, also featuring Xibill\u00e9. A final show, Nubeluz, la despedida, was announced in 2024.\nFilmography\nTelevision\nTheatre\nSee also\nNubeluz\n",
    "Sikh website\nSikhNet is a Sikh-centric website operated by the 3HO organization. SikhNet is a tax exempt 501(c)3 not-for-profit corporation in the U.S.A. It caters to what it has termed as the \"cyber sangat\" (\"cyber congregation\").\nHistory\nBulletin board system\nThe origins of SikhNet can be traced back to a bulletin board system (BBS) created by Guruka Singh, launched in 1983. Harbhajan Kaur and Mahan Singh in Millis, Massachusetts were the coordinators of the early SikhNet BBS. The server operated through GEnie with a 300 baud connection.\nIn February 1986, the SikhNet BBS server was upgraded and went online with a 10 Mhz IBM XT clone computer with a 1200 baud (later 9600 baud) modem. The SikhNet BBS was an early version of the open-source BBS software (RBBS v.15) that was hacked for customization purposes. There were around 100 users, with 20 of them being regulars. The SikhNet BBS's log-on screen contained artwork of a Khanda symbol made using ASCII art. A Clipper program was created by Ravi Har Singh Khalsa for accessing SikhNet, it was known as SikhNet-Zapper. The BBS contained a prototype-discussion forum and announcements from 3HO & Sikh Dharma International were posted for the users to view. There were also transcript recordings of Yogi Bhajan's lectures and talks stored on the BBS and daily quotations of the Guru Granth Sahib were displayed. The host-computer of the server shifted from Columbus, Ohio to Yosemite, California to Espanola, New Mexico, mirroring the moves of Guruka Singh and his family.\nThe SikhNet BBS became defunct in October 1994 after Guruka Singh could no longer serve as the Sysop (System Operator), thus the SikhNet BBS was taken offline.\nWebsite\nThe SikhNet website was founded by Gurumustuk Singh Khalsa on 15 April 1996, coinciding with the Vaisakhi celebrations for that year. The website was founded for the purpose of education both Sikhs and non-Sikhs on the tenets of the Sikh religion in a user-friendly, peaceful, accessible, and faith-friendly manner. The website adopted the same name as the predecessor BBS system. Gurumustuk created the original HTML SikhNet website pages whilst in his early 20's for the purpose of providing a cyber space where Sikh youth from around the world could interact, hold dialogue, and support one another. The website sees itself as an avenue outside of the traditional familial and gurdwara spaces where Sikh communities could engage with each-other. The website currently has 16 employees, whom are based in the United States, Canada, India, the United Kingdom, and Peru. The website relies on donations, from its userbase, sponsors, and grantors, to operate.\nThe website serves as a clearing house for news articles and information on Sikh topics. The website hosts many features where Sikh liturgical texts can be examined by users. Furthermore, turban-tying tutorials can be found on the site. The website contains histories and hagiographies dating to the period of the Sikh gurus, recordings of kirtan (sacred hymns) and katha (interpretation), and positive stories of Sikhs from the U.K., Canada, and the U.S.\nIn 2011, the website launched an online game called Karma: the Ogre's Curse, whereby the player must maintain their Sikh religion when tempted by vices through meditation, good actions, and maintaining a Khalsa appearance.\nChange in organizational structure\nOn April 2022, the founder Gurumustuk stepped down as CEO of SikhNet. This came as a result of serious allegations against 3HO leader Yogi Bhajan and Gurmustuk's drastic change from being a baptised Sikh to a clean-shaven man. Former bodyguard of Yogi Bhajan and 3HO critic, Gursant Singh, claimed Gurumustuk was paid a six-figure annual salary from SikhNet donations.\nStatistics\nThe website claims to have 900,000 visits per month, making it one of the largest Sikh websites globally.\nServices operated by SikhNet\nSikhiWiki\nSikhNet Play \u2013 the most popular service\nDaily Hukamnama\nSikhNet News\nSikhNet Animated Stories\nSiri Guru Granth Sahib online\nMatrimonial service\nDownloadable content, such as bani files, kirtan audios, Gurmukhi fonts, etc.\nCommentary\nSikhNet is operated by 3HO (Sikh Dharma of the Western Hemisphere), an organization mostly composed of American-Sikhs of European-descent whom were influenced by Yogi Bhajan. These White Sikhs emphasize strongly upon the Khalsa's outward form by promoting the 5 Ks, wearing traditional Punjabi clothing that is white in-colour, and the wearing of a turban, for both men and women. Whilst the website was founded by White Sikhs, many users of SikhNet are of a traditional, mainstream Punjabi Sikh-background, in-addition to the 3HO Sikhs. SikhNet promotes an image of Punjabi Sikhs who may or may not cut their hair or tie a turban or White Sikhs who keep their hair uncut and wear a turban.\nThe website has been described as Khalsa-centric, a phenomenon described as \"Khalsa-ism\" by Sikhologist Doris Jakobsh.

    "Filipino beauty pageant titleholder\nIn this Philippine name, the middle name or maternal  family name is Toribio and the surname or paternal family name is Esguerra.\nMyrna Toribio Esguerra (born October 2, 2001) is a Filipino model and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Binibining Pilipinas International 2024. The first entrant to represent Abra in the Binibining Pilipinas pageant, Esguerra will represent the Philippines at the Miss International 2025 pageant.\nEsguerra previously competed in Miss Teen Philippines and Miss Abra 2023, being crowned as the winner of the latter pageant. Esguerra is an advocate for environmental preservation and has centered her advocacy on sustainable development.\nEarly life and education\nEsguerra was born on October 2, 2001, in Pidigan, Abra, to a Kapampangan father and Ilocano mother. She has sixteen siblings. In her teenage years, Esguerra moved to Angeles, Pampanga, to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in tourism and management with a specialization in meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE), at the City College of Angeles, where she began her career in pageantry by participating in its annual beauty pageant, winning its 2022 edition. She financed her studies independently from the age of 17.\nModelling career\nEsguerra began her career in modelling at the age of 20, appearing in advertisements for Philippine Airlines, Clark Marriott Hotel, and Omni Aviation. Esguerra also works as a part-time event coordinator and host. Esguerra presented the Mutya Ning San Antonio pageant in 2023 and the preliminary competition of the Miss Abra 2024 pageant.\nPageantry\nEarly pageants\nIn 2019, Esguerra competed in the Miss Teen Philippines 2019 pageant where she failed to enter the top five. Her second stint in pageantry was in 2023, when she competed in Miss Abra 2023, representing Pidigan. She would go on to win the pageant against 26 entrants. At the end of her reign, Esguerra crowned Jeralene Acosta as her successor.\nBinibining Pilipinas 2024\nMain article: Binibining Pilipinas 2024\nOn April 5, 2024, Esguerra was announced as one of the 40 delegates to the Binibining Pilipinas 2024 pageant. Having previously won Miss Abra 2023, Esguerra entered the pageant as the first delegate to represent Abra in the pageant's history. Leading up to the pageant, media outlets praised Esguerra for her \"impactful showmanship\" in pre-pageant contests and emerged as a frontrunner for the crown. In the preliminary contests, Esguerra was named as one of the winners of the national costume competition with her Dulimaman ensemble dedicated to her mother's profession as a weaver.\n\"I will tell the women of the past we have achieved our goal, which is to empower women. Standing here, at the age of 17, I started to finance for my own studies and help my family financially. I was able to do this by all these women who paved the way to empower us to always reach for our goals, no matter what it is. Because in life, we can always achieve our dreams, as long as we believe we can.  And thanks to them all. Thank you.\"\nEsguerra's response in the top 15 question and answer round\nThe pageant was held on July 7, at the Araneta Coliseum. Early in the competition, Esguerra won the Best in Swimsuit and Best in Evening Gown awards, as well as two awards from the pageant's sponsors. Esguerra would progress to the top 15 question and answer round where Miss Universe 1973 Margie Moran asked her \"If a time machine brings you back to 1964, 60 years ago when Binibining Pilipinas began\u2026 what message would you tell the Filipino women of that time about the women of 2024?\". In her answer, Esguerra stated that she will tell the women of 1964 that the next generation had succeeded in empowering women, emphasizing her financial independence from the age of 17 and the support given to her by the women around her.\nEsguerra went on to win the pageant as Binibining Pilipinas International 2024, being crowned by her predecessor Angelica Lopez and Miss International 2023 Andrea Rubio. As a winner of the pageant's 60th edition, Esguerra, along with co-winner Binibining Pilipinas Globe 2024 Jasmin Bungay, received a cash prize of \u20b11,000,000, the largest cash prize in the pageant's history. Online, observers drew parallels between Esguerra's win and that of inaugural Binibining Pilipinas titleholder and namesake Myrna Panlilio, dubbing the former's win as being \"written in the stars\".\nFollowing the pageant, Abra Governor Dominic Valera invited Esguerra to participate in the province's festivities for Cordillera Month on July 15, which would also be celebrated as \"Myrna Day\" in commemoration of Esguerra's victory.\nMiss International 2025\nAs Binibining Pilipinas International 2024, Esguerra will represent the Philippines at the Miss International 2025 pageant.\nAdvocacies\nAn advocate for environmental preservation, Esguerra has worked with the National Cleanup Coalition Philippines and has centered her platform for Binibining Pilipina",

He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1979.  in 1980, Litvinov graduated from the Donetsk State Academy of Music\u00a0, specializing as an orchestra soloist and instructor. From 1980 to 1986, he was a teacher and secretary for the Komsomol. In 1987, Litvinov graduated from the Donetsk Correspondence Mining College, specializing in the underground mining of coal deposits. Following this, from 1987 to 1991 he was the deputy director of the Donetsk National Technical University.  In 1991, Litvinov graduated from the Faculty of Economics of the Donetsk branch of Moscow State University, specializing in management. From 1991 to 1995, he was the deputy chairman of the Board of Directors of Technical Schools of Donetsk Region, and from 1995 to 2000, he was Director of the Representative Office of the Bratsk Aluminum Plant\u00a0 in Ukraine. Following this, Litvinov was the deputy director for Economics and Foreign Economic Relations of the Donetsk company \"Linkom\" until 2012. During this time period he also served three terms on the Donetsk City Council\u00a0 as the deputy chairman, and was head of the Kirov district cell of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU) until 2014, following Euromaidan.\nPolitical career\nFollowing the Donetsk People's Republic's declaration of independence (which Litvinov wrote) on April 7, 2014, Litvinov was a part of the Council of Ministers as the Manager of Affairs until July 29, 2014, following his ascension to the post of Chairman of the People's Council of the Donetsk People's Republic. On October 8, 2014, Litvinov founded the Communist Party of the Donetsk People's Republic (CPDPR) as a successor to the Donetsk Branch of the CPU. Litvinov was ousted from his post on November 14, 2014, by Alexander Zakharchenko, and the CPDPR was subsequently banned from participating in the elections to the People's Council of the DPR. Three communists, including Litvinov, joined the Donetsk Republic Movement, and were elected from it as deputies of the People's Council. On May 6, 2016, by the Resolution of the People's Council, his deputy powers (like those of other communist deputies) were terminated early \"due to loss of confidence\", due to voting against the party's resolutions and positions \nFollowing the Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, the Communist Party of Donetsk was disbanded and absorbed by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation on December 4, 2022 to which Litvinov became a member.\nPolitical views\nLitvinov has characterized himself as a communist of Lenin's New Economic Policy, and an admirer of Socialism with Chinese characteristics. During the Donetsk People's Republic's independence, he considered the paramount task of the CPDPR to be the construction of a Marxist\u2013Leninist people's democracy, with an increased focus on the role of labor councils and respect for personal property rights. He advocated supporting economic relations with Ukraine.\nPersonal life\nLitvinov formerly held Ukrainian citizenship, and currently holds Russian citizenship. He has been sanctioned by the government of Ukraine since 2015. Litvinov has two children and six grandchildren.\n",
    "\nThe Cape Town Press Club is the oldest press club in South Africa. Founded in 1975 as a voluntary association of journalists, it has since become a non-profit organisation supporting freedom of the press. It is based in Cape Town, South Africa and hosts public and private gatherings with invited speakers from public life.\nThe Press Club is a popular venue for speeches by South African politicians and also for speeches by prominent figures in academia and business. It has hosted all five post-apartheid South African presidents. Foreign visitors have included Dick Clark in 1977, David Aubrey Scott in 1977, Jesse Jackson in 1990, David Blunkett in 2008, and Annie Lennox in 2013. Since 2007 the Press Club has held the Barry Streek Memorial Lecture on an annual basis.\nHistory\nThe oldest press club in South Africa, the Cape Town Press Club was relaunched in 1975 after a period of stagnancy. The relaunch was pioneered by Cape Times journalist Tom Copeland and continued by his colleague John Scott. In later decades, Donwald Pressly played an important role in the club's maintenance.\nBecause of its location in the legislative capital of Cape Town, the Press Club was historically dominated by parliamentary reporters, such as Pressly. Full membership in the club was available only to working journalists until the late 1990s, when a single category of membership was established for all interested parties regardless of profession. Nonetheless, on some accounts, a rival press club was established in Pretoria in 1978 due to dissatisfaction with the predominance of public relations professionals in the Cape Town club.\nThe Press Club was formerly based at the Caf\u00e9 Royal on Church Street in downtown Cape Town, but in the 21st century it has lacked a permanent venue. However, it frequently held events at the Kelvin Grove Club in Newlands, a venue sometimes regarded as the \"colonial home of the Mother City's ageing gin-blossomed Wasp elite\" or \"one of Cape Town's bastions of the privileged English liberal establishment\". As a result, journalists teased the Press Club for drawing \"a predominantly white, elderly audience including the city's media stalwarts who keep the Press Club alive\".\nAs of 2012, the Press Club had over 500 members, including 133 businesspeople, 125 journalists, and 86 public relations professionals; to cover its costs, it relied not on membership dues but on corporate sponsorship.\nScholarships\nIn December 2003, the Press Club awarded its first Cape Town Press Club Award for investigative journalism, intended to sponsor in-depth reporting on a story of the recipient's choice. The first award, worth R20,000 and sponsored by Telkom, was given to John Yeld, an environment writer for the Cape Argus, for reporting on property developments in the Western Cape.\nAfter Press Club deputy chairperson Barry Streek died in 2006, the Press Club established the Barry Streek Memorial Bursary, an annual award of R20,000 to a journalism student. Its endowment is funded by donations and by ticket revenues from the Barry Streek Memorial Lecture, which has been held annually since 2007 (see below).\nLeadership\nThe Press Club Committee is elected annually. Its current co-chairpersons are Brent Meersman and Twanji Kalula.\nNotable events\nIn December 1972 at a mixed-race ball hosted by the Press Club, Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi danced with the white wife of journalist AI Venter, provoking a national controversy and calls for a government inquiry. Venter threatened to sue the newspapers which reported that his wife had invited Buthelezi to dance.\nIn May 1976 at the Press Club, Prime Minister John Vorster expressed willingness to negotiate with American President Gerald Ford over Southern Rhodesia and Namibia. Henry Kissinger said in his memoirs that Vorster's remarks provided the impetus for dialogue between the United States and South Africa.\nIn November 1986, Cape Times editor Tony Heard drew \"the biggest-yet attendance at a Cape Town Press Club meeting\" when he gave a speech on press freedom shortly after being arrested for publishing an interview with a banned person, activist Oliver Tambo, in violation of the Internal Security Act.\nIn May 1990 at the Press Club, Thabo Mbeki briefed the media on the first day of negotiations over the Groote Schuur Minute.\nIn March 2007 at the Press Club, Helen Zille announced her campaign to become federal leader of the Democratic Alliance.\nIn April 2007 at the Press Club, Jacob Zuma confirmed that he would stand for the presidency of the African National Congress \"if asked to\".\nIn October 2013 at the Press Club, Marius Fransman claimed that 98 per cent of \"landowners and property owners\" in Cape Town were Jewish, sparking an antisemitism row.\nDuring Jacob Zuma's presidency, Evita Bezuidenhout delivered an annual Luthuli Housekeeping Report at the Press Club as a satirical alternative to the State of the Nation Address.\nIn October 2019 at the Press Club, John Steenhuisen announced his campa",

Mann FAIA (June 28, 1877 \u2013 July 7, 1968) was an English-born American architect and engineer in practice in Hutchinson, Kansas from 1909 until his retirement in 1965. In 1924 he formed the firm of Mann & Company, which remained under family ownership until 1977 and is still in business.\nLife and career\nArthur Robert Mann was born June 28, 1877, in Sheffield, England to George Mann and Eliza Mann, n\u00e9e Lingard. The family immigrated to the United States in 1879, settling in Kansas. He became a naturalized citizen in 1887. Mann was educated at the defunct Nickerson Normal College and the University of Kansas, graduating from the latter in 1906 with a BS in engineering. He worked for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad before moving to Hutchinson, where in 1909 he formed the partnership of Kelso, Mann & Kelso, architects and engineers. During this year he also completed a correspondence course in architecture. The partnership was reorganized in 1910 as Kelso, Mann & Gerow and in 1911 as Mann & Gerow with the withdrawal of the Kelsos and the admission of Theodore M. Gerow. In 1924 Gerow withdrew from the partnership and Mann continued the firm as Mann & Company, a sole proprietorship. In 1934 Mann's son, Robert E. Mann AIA, joined the firm as a partner. In 1965 Mann retired from the partnership, but continued as a consultant.\nIn 1918 Mann was a founding member and first president of the Kansas Society of Architects, the first successful attempt to organize architects in the state. In 1921 joined the American Institute of Architects (AIA) as a member of the newly formed Kansas chapter. He was highly active in the organization, and was Kansas chapter president three times. In 1955 he was elected a Fellow for service to the institute and for public service. Mann was the third Kansas architect to be elected a Fellow under the modern system instituted in 1898.\nLegacy\nMann's architecture firm has continued into the present day. After his retirement architects Winston A. Schmidt AIA and Norman L. Mann AIA, Mann's grandson, became partners in the firm, followed in 1974 by Harry R. Rutledge FAIA and Lynn W. Schwartzkopf AIA. Robert E. Mann retired in 1977, and shortly thereafter Schimidt and Norman L. Mann died in a plane crash while returning from a client meeting. In 1978 the firm was purchased from the Mann estate by Rutledge and Schwartzkopf. In 1981 they incorporated the firm as Mann & Company PA, and in 1987 Rutledge withdrew to join BASCO Associates in York, Pennsylvania. Schwartzkopf has continued to lead the firm into the 21st century.\nAt least seven works by Mann and his partners have been listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places, and others contribute to listed historic districts.\nPersonal life\nMann was married in 1904 to Ida May Smith. They had two children, Dorothy and Robert Eugene. Mann died July 7, 1968, at the age of 91.\nArchitectural works\nKelso, Mann & Kelso, 1909\u20131910\n1911 \u2013 Memorial Hall, 101 S Walnut St, Hutchinson, Kansas\nKelso, Mann & Gerow, 1910\u20131911\n1910 \u2013 P.

    "The Grand United Order of Galilean Fishermen was an African American fraternal order founded in 1856. Open to both men and women, it provided members sick and death benefits. \nHistory\nThe order was founded by Anthony S. Perpener, a Prince Hall Freemason and Grand United Order Odd Fellow, in Washington, D.C., in 1856. Credit for founding the order is also given to Hemsley Nichols of John Wesley Methodist Church in Baltimore, Maryland. The order claims a link to Scottish Rite Freemasonry. It was one of the few fraternal orders open to both men and women in the nineteenth century. \nThe organization spread to Maryland in 1869 and became one of the largest African American fraternal organizations there with over 5,000 members in Maryland by 1890. A Galilean Temple was built in Rockville, Maryland, in 1903 and established a cemetery in 1917. A marker stands at the former location of the Temple. The organization spread to Virginia in 1874 and established a bank and printing office in Hampton, Virginia, in 1901. In 1885, the Fisherman's Hall was built in Charles Town, West Virginia, and is still in use today as a community center. In 1902, the Order's Tabernacle No. 47 purchased a tract of land where the first Rosenwald School in Calvert County, Maryland, would be constructed in 1921.\nIn 1897, there were 56,000 members and had a value of $125,000.\nSketch of Navassa island (1889)\nThe order was a strong proponent of civil rights and in 1889, it raised funds to pay for the legal defense of the eighteen men convicted in the 1889 riot on Navassa Island. The case, Jones v. United States (1890), went all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States. The case was lost, and the men were convicted of murder, but, due to organizing of Black organizations and communities, the sentence was commuted to prison time by President Benjamin Harrison.\nSymbolism\nThe emblems of the order include the fish, Passion cross, rose, and INRI of the eighteenth degree of the Scottish Rite.\nFurther Resources\nGrand United Order of Galilean Fishermen, Gideon Tabernacle, No. 14, Berryville, minute book, 19211934. 1 vol.

    "2000 Canadian comedy film\nViolet is a Canadian comedy film, directed by Rosemary House and released in 2000. The film stars Mary Walsh as Violet O'Brien, a 54-year-old widow who is convinced that she is going to die within the next year because her parents and her older brother all died at age 55.\nThe cast also includes Andrew Younghusband as Violet's son Carlos, a gay university professor visiting from his academic job in Montreal and trying to teach everybody to speak Italian; Barry Newhook as her son Rex, a deadbeat musician; Susan Kent as her daughter Ramona, a potter; and Peter MacNeill as Rusty, a hired hand with a romantic interest in Violet; as well as Berni Stapleton, Janis Spence, Raoul Bhaneja, Janet Michael,  Maisie Rillie, Sherry White, Brian Hennessey, Ron Hynes and Jody Richardson in supporting roles.\nDistribution\nThe film premiered at the 2000 Montreal World Film Festival, and was subsequently screened at the 2000 Atlantic Film Festival.\nDue to the challenges facing independent films in that era, House bought back the film's commercial distribution rights from Alliance Atlantis, and independently organized a commercial run beginning in St. John's in November and expanding to the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver markets in December.\nCritical response\nLiam Lacey of The Globe and Mail wrote that \"the results are wobbly. There are moments, near the beginning of the film, when Walsh appears to be the main character in a Scandinavian identity-crisis drama. By the conclusion, however, Violet turns into a madcap farce, with a dozen subplots resolving all at once. Predictably, the pacing from scene to scene is wildly uneven and the performers are occasionally required to make impossible shifts in tone, from sitcom wisecracking to tearful confessions. The underlying fault here is House's desire to do too much at once.\"\nScott MacDonald of the National Post wrote that \"tt's amiable, amusing stuff mostly, with a lot of very appealing performances, but it's also a very slim premise for a feature. When House resorts to cartoon subplots involving a horrid relative's comic attempts to bump Violet off for an inheritance, the strain starts to show.\"\nFor the Toronto Star, Geoff Pevere wrote that \"sometimes it works, as director House draws uniformly likeable performances from her large cast, and sometimes you just wish everybody would get off their complaining arses and get on with it. At least there's no mystery why, living with this lot, Violet would take to her bed for a year. Too often, this movie leaves you envying her.\"\nAwards\nTom Ronan, Daniel Pellerin, Brad Thornton and Brad Zoern received a Genie Award nomination for Best Overall Sound at the 21st Genie Awards.\n",

    "American domestic worker\nMary Silvina Burghardt Du Bois (1831 \u2013 1885) was an American domestic worker. She was born a free woman as the granddaughter of a freedman landowner who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. She was the mother of the activist and sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois, whose education she supported by working as a servant after her husband left her.\nBiography\nDu Bois was born Mary Silvina Burghardt in 1831 to Othello Burghardt and Sarah Lampman in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. She had African, Dutch, and English ancestry. Her family were part of a small free black community in Great Barrington that had long been landowners in Massachusetts. Her grandfather was Jack Burghardt. Her great-grandfather, Tom Burghardt, was born in West Africa around 1730 and was enslaved by the Dutch colonist Conraed Burghardt. Her great-grandfather served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, which may have led to him obtaining his freedom in the late 18th century.\nShe married Alfred Du Bois on February 5, 1867, in Housatonic, Massachusetts. Her husband was born in Haiti as the illegitimate son of Alexander Du Bois, of Long Cay in The Bahamas, and the grandson of James Du Bois, a Huguenot colonist who fathered several children with enslaved women.\nHer husband worked as a barber and itinerant laborer. He served in Company D of the 20th New York Infantry during the American Civil War but later deserted. She gave birth to a son, William Edward Burghardt Du Bois, on February 23, 1868. Her husband abandoned her and her son in 1870.\nDu Bois moved, with her son, back to the home of her parents in Great Barrington, where they lived until her son was five years old. They attended First Congregational Church of Great Barrington. Du Bois worked as a servant to support her son and received assistance from her brother and neighbors. Despite living in destitution, she insisted that her son receive a proper education.\nDu Bois suffered a stroke in the early 1880s. She died in 1885.\n",
    "Municipal building in Godalming, Surrey, England\nThe Pepperpot is a historic building in the High Street in Godalming, a town in Surrey, in England. The building, which accommodates a meeting room on the first floor, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe town of Godalming was incorporated as a borough by a charter issued in 1575 from Elizabeth I. The first municipal building in Godalming was an 18th-century market hall in the High Street which was used to accommodate French prisoners following the capture of Belle \u00cele in June 1761. After the old market hall become dilapidated, the borough officials decided to commission a new building. The current building was designed by John Perry in the neoclassical style, built in brick with a stucco finish at a cost of \u00a3865 and was completed in 1814.\nThe design involved a symmetrical main frontage with three bays facing onto the High Street. It was arcaded on the ground floor, so that markets could be held, with an assembly room on the first floor. The end elevations were canted so as to give an octagonal shape. The first floor was fenestrated with sash windows although, at the rear, the windows were blind. At roof level there was a two-stage clock tower with clock faces in the first stage and a cupola for the second stage.  The clock was manufactured by Richard Steadman.\nThe warden and other officials of the borough, who had met in the room on the first floor, were replaced by elected officials in accordance with the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The building soon proved too small for public meetings, and in 1861, a public hall was constructed on Bridge Street, which was later extended to form Godalming Borough Hall.\nMeanwhile, at the Pepperpot, a new cantilevered stair tower was added in the 1890s, and the room on the first floor was used to accommodate the Godalming Museum from 1921. The building was grade II listed in 1947. The museum remained on the first floor until 1987, when it moved to a larger building on the south side of the High Street. The room on the first floor subsequently served as a meeting room, while the ground floor continued to provide space for a greengrocer's stall twice a week.\nThe architectural historian, Nikolaus Pevsner, described the Pepperpot as \"an admirable public building for a small town\", the horticulturalist, Gertrude Jekyll, described it as \"the latest building in Godalming which has that precious quality of character\", while the guidebook author, Oliver Mason, described it as a \"much needed focal point\" for the town.\n",
    "\n1998 studio album by Tim Hodgkinson\nPragma: New Works is a 1998 solo album by English experimental music composer and performer Tim Hodgkinson. It is his third solo album, after Each in Our Own Thoughts (1994), and comprises six pieces composed by Hodgkinson and recorded between 1996 and 1998. The album was released on CD in 1998 by Recommended Records in the United Kingdom.\nReception\nIn a review of the album in The Wire, Julian Cowley wrote that while Pragma sounds very different to the \"acerbic rock\" Hodgkinson played in the Work, it is \"a sustained anatomisation of  musical taste, an illumination of how he plays and ... hears. He said the six compositions can be compared to the works of established composers, for example Morton Subotnick on \"Interferogram\". Cowley noted that, as on his previous solo album, Each in Our Own Thoughts (1994), Pragma shows Hodgkinson \"pushing back the limits of his identity as a composer, in a post-classical sense\". He added that Hodgkinson's musical explorations here are characterised \"by the kind of vitality and intelligence that always preclude descent to the merely derivative.\"\nFran\u00e7ois Couture wrote in a review of the album at AllMusic that while the compositions on Pragma have \"impetus\" and \"ardor\", they are not \"memorable\". \"For Looking Inside\" has some \"interesting textures\", and \"Mala; Elated\" has \"good idea that takes on cataclysmic proportions\", but Couture felt that overall they are \"not enough to salvage the album from its self-sufficient aura\".\nReviewing Pragma in Expos\u00e9, Jeff Melton called the album's music \"difficult\" because he felt that \"the listener must have the discipline to hear the 'big picture' and not get caught in a scattering of perceived dissonant ideas.\" Melton said the voices on \"SHHH\" create \"a disturbing, almost ghostly mood\", and described \"For Looking Inside\" as \"controlled mayhem\" that is \"definitely not for the faint of heart\". Melton stated that he is waiting for the horror film industry to discover the potential in Hodgkinson's music, but added it is more likely he \"will still languish with others who only appeal to a small, but educated audience.\"\nTrack listing\nAll music is composed by Tim Hodgkinson\nTrack notes\nSource: \n\"SHHH\" includes extracts from Ana-Maria Avram's Archae, plus random voices recorded on location in public spaces. The track is dedicated to Kay Rala Xanana Gusmao.\nSamples of Marion Coutts' trumpet were used in some of the tracks.\nPersonnel\nSource: \nTim Hodgkinson \u2013 clarinet, guitar, percussion, viola, harpsicord, organ, piano, cello, tape, samples\nCharles Mutter \u2013 violin (\"Interferogram\")\nAlbert Markos \u2013 cello (\"Black Death and Errors in Construction\")\nProduction\nTim Hodgkinson \u2013 producer, liner notes\nTom Lubbock \u2013 liner notes\nSpartak Chernish \u2013 cover photography\n",
    "1983 novel by Australian author A. Bertram Chandler\nKelly Country is a 1983 alternative history novel by the Australian author A. Bertram Chandler.\nSynopsis\nAustralian bushranger and rebel Ned Kelly leads a successful revolution against British colonial rule. The result is that Australia becomes a world power, but the Australian Republic which Kelly founded degenerates into a hereditary dictatorship.\nCritical reception\nWriting in Australian Book Review critic Yvonne Rousseau concluded: \"Chandler has thoroughly researched the political and military possibilities of the period; he has dealt with misgivings as to whether Kelly had the drive to establish a dynasty of Hereditary Presidents, each one respectfully spoken of as 'the Kelly'; he has provided astonishing adventures, constant shifts of scene, and a final revelation which casts an ironic light on history\u2013which highlights an uncertainty very few men can be immune to\u2013and which paradoxically shows the final Kelly (the one who wiped out Hanoi with nuclear weapons) to be a greater-hearted man than the reader has believed.\"\nVan Ikin, in Westerly found that \"The novel cannot help but raise certain questions about Australian history and nationalism, yet these intellectual issues are not tackled with the same zest and imagination that the author applies to scenes of battIe or reconstructions of historical spectacle. This imbalance, however, is quite deliberate: it is clear that Chandler has set out to write a rollickingly readable yarn, peppered with suspense, excitement, and enthusiastic humour. Moreover it is to his credit that he ensures that certain key questions are at least asked (if not answered).\"\nPublishing history\nAfter the novel's initial publication in Australia by Penguin in 1983, it was reprinted as follows:\nDAW, USA, 1985\nOrion, UK, 2016\nThe novel was also translated into German in 1986, with the alternate title Die Australische Revolution.\nAwards\nDitmar Award, 1984, shortlisted\nSee also\n1983 in Australian literature\n",

    "French crime writer\nJean Bommart (Douai, September 12, 1894 - Paris, December 25, 1979) was a French writer of detective novels and spy novels.\nBiography\nBommart completed a year of study in medicine and another in law at university, but the World War I broke out and he joined the French army in Verdun. He was seriously injured there on February 21, 1916.\nAfter the war, he studied at HEC Paris. A journalist for the Havas agency in Belgrade in 1921, he led a diplomatic career for a time and traveled to several Eastern European countries.\nBack in France, he worked in various small jobs, then became a bank employee. After drinking a glass of contaminated water in a pastry shop in the Bourse district, he became seriously ill. Bedridden for three years following this food poisoning, he began to write, drawing inspiration from his memories of action in the secret war, encouraged by the writer Benjamin Cr\u00e9mieux.\nHe quickly achieved success with his character Captain Sauvin, aka the Chinese Fish. A relaxed hero with an unattractive physique, he is not a stunner of beautiful spies, but a clever secret agent, skilled in disguise. Timeless, it appears in all theaters of operations for several decades during world conflicts. We find him both in Hitler's bunker at the fall of Berlin in early May 1945 and unveiling the very first arrival of Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1963. Michel Simon in The Silent Battle of Pierre Billon in 1937 and Rex Harrison in The Silent Battle by Herbert Mason in 1939 played Jacques Sauvin on screen.\nJean Bommart also wrote classic detective novels, two science fiction novels (under the pseudonym Kemmel) and various other works. He was interested in cinema as a screenwriter or dialogue writer.\nWork\nRomans\nLe Poisson chinois series\nLe Poisson chinois, Paris, Librairie des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Le Masque No.\u00a0156, 1934\u00a0; reissue, Paris, Le Livre de Poche No.\u00a02124, 1967.

Her parents soon divorced, however, and, as noted in a 1973 interview, subsequent remarriages led to a decidedly unsettled pre-adolescence. As Coates recalled, \"I was in 10 different schools before 10th grade.\" The resulting anxiety made her all the more appreciative upon discovering that \"he theater is like a family, like a home\u2014all of the things I missed as a child.\"\nAfter finally settling in Santa Monica, Coates studied acting at UCLA. There, she gained valuable experience, in roles such as Shakespeare's Juliet, Margaret in Thomas Dekker's The Shoemaker's Holiday (starring opposite a young William Schallert), and Cybel in Eugene O'Neill's The Great God Brown. During this period, Coates also appeared in summer stock with the Bolton Landing Players, earning kudos as Millie in Frederick Jackson's The Bishop Misbehaves, and as Aunt Connie in Mark Reed's Yes, My Darling Daughter.\nIn 1954, Coates appeared as Agatha in the American premiere of Jean Giraudoux's Electra, staged at the Henry Street Playhouse in New York's Greenwich Village. The following year, she and erstwhile Pygmalion co-star James Noble were wed. Shortly thereafter, and continuing for roughly six years, they became featured performers in Paul J. Curtis's American Mime Theatre.\nIn 1965, her portrayal of Hecuba in Euripides' The Trojan Women earned Coates a Theatre World Award. In December of that year she was narrated \"Sibelius: A Symphony for Finland,\" a 90-minute TV documentary commemorating the composer's centennial, which aired on NET's series Festival of the Arts.\nIn May 1967, Coates co-starred with Martin Sheen, Eugene Roche, Frederick Rolf and Eleanor Phelps on The Catholic Hour, in a series of four episodes addressing the question, \"Is God dead?\"\nIn 1985, Coates undertook what would later be termed, variously, a nine-year sabbatical or retirement, to volunteer in hospitals and on the phones for AIDS Project Los Angeles and the Gay Men's Health Crisis.\nIn 2001, New Haven's Long Wharf Theater hosted what would prove to be the actress's swan song, as Coates portrayed Gladys in Kenneth Lonergan's The Waverly Gallery. Hartford Courant critic Malcolm Johnson writes:This portrait of the mental disintegration of 85-year-old Gladys Green, acted by the tiny Carolyn Coates with shifts from lucidity and humor to crazy jumbles of words, will break the heart of anyone who has ever suffered through the decline of an aged parent or relative.  Coates' sometimes playful, sometimes dithering, occasionally volatile performance, sweet, charged with nostalgia and a confusion complicated by deafness, dominates Tillinger's production.\nPersonal life\nHaving first met her future husband four years earlier in Worcester, Massachusetts, playing Eliza Doolittle to his Henry Higgins in a summer stock production of Pygmalion, Coates married actor James Noble in 1955. Their union produced one child, a daughter.\nOn March 27, 2005, Coates died of cancer at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Connecticut, survived by her husband and daughter. Her remains are interred at the family plot in Muskogee, Oklahoma, alongside those of her husband.\nTV appearances\nFilmography\nPlaylist\nNotes\n^ As per the gravestone photo featured on her Find a Grave page, the middle name Coates was given by her parents was Owen, her mother's maiden name.\n^ On location at Circle in the Square Downtown, performing a scene from Jean Genet's The Balcony; episode also features producer Theodore Mann and director Jose Quintero.\n",

    "Thomas Wallace MC FIC FRS CBE (5 September 1891 \u2013 1 February 1965) was a British professor of horticultural chemistry. He gained fame as one of the world's leading experts on mineral deficiencies in plants.\nEarly life and education\nThomas Wallace had five older sisters, one younger sister, and two older brothers. Their father Thomas Sr. was a blacksmith and agricultural mechanic. As a boy, Thomas Jr. worked as a farm hand and attended a local primary school in Burradon until 1905 when he won a County of Northumberland scholarship to Rutherford College of Technology in Newcastle. In 1910 he matriculated at Armstrong College, University of Durham. There he had a brilliant academic career, studying principally chemistry, but also physics, mathematics, botany, and zoology. He was College Prizeman in inorganic, organic and analytical chemistry and Alder Scholar in zoology. In 1913 he graduated with a B.Sc. degree in chemistry.\nWW I service\nAt Armstrong College, Wallace joined the University of Durham Officers\u2019 Training Corps and distinguished himself by his outstanding conduct. At the outbreak of WW I, he was commissioned in the Special Reserve of Officers and assigned to the 3rd Border Regiment. He was soon sent to France and as an officer, attached to the Royal West Kent Regiment, fought in France and Belgium in the early part of WW I. He received in 1914 the Mons Star.  In 1915 he was reattached to the Border Regiment which was part of  the 29th Division serving in Gallipoli. He participated in the actions at Cape Helles and Suvla Bay. Near Krithea in Cape Helles, he won one of the UK's earliest Military Crosses to be awarded in the Gallipoli campaign. After surviving unwounded in his Gallipoli service, Wallace was in 1916 sent to France as an adjutant in 11th Sussex Regiment.  In July 1916 at Richebourg-l'Avou\u00e9 he was severely wounded, leaving him with permanent, serious joint stiffness in his left knee. After sufficient recovery from his wounds, Wallace was assigned to the Anti-Gas Department of the Royal Engineers. He attained the rank of captain. Wallace's first research was done on the chemistry of gases used in WW I.\nCareer at the University of Bristol\nAfter working for a brief time as an industrial chemist for the Castner-Kellner Alkali Company, Wallace became in May 1919 a research chemist at the Long Ashton Research Station (part of the University of Bristol). Simultaneously, he was the Advisory Officer in Agricultural Chemistry for the Bristol Province. At the Long Ashton Research Station, he was from 1923 to 1943 the deputy director and from 1943 to 1957 the Director. After previously holding appointments as Lecturer and Reader, Wallace was appointed Professor of Horticultural Chemistry in the University of Bristol in 1943 and retained his professorship until 1957 when he retired as professor emeritus.\nWallace was the author or co-author of about 100 scientific articles. In 1921 he published an important contribution to pomology by showing that leaf scorch was sometimes due to a soil deficiency of potassium and could be cured by manurial treatment or adding potash. He did research on many aspects of horticulture. He published on the problem of winter-killing of vegetable crops and frost damage to apple trees. From 1943 to 1958 he was joint editor of the Journal of Horticultural Science.\nWW II and food production in the UK\nIn 1939 Wallace organized the Long Ashton section of the Local Defence Volunteer. The section eventually became a Company of the 7th Somerset Home Guard. He was given the rank of major and became second in command of the battalion which grew to a strength of over 3000 men. During WW II the British government sponsored a campaign for increased food production involving large-scale conversion of pasture for grazing animals into land for raising crops. Such conversion sometimes failed, or partially failed, because the soil had mineral composition unfavourable for food crops. When the land to be sloughed up had a soil type which might prove deficient in some minerals, Wallace recommended the use of indicator plots. The plots had several crops selected in order to display symptoms of mineral deficiencies. Different fertilizer treatments of the three major plant nutrients, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), as well as various combinations of micronutrients, were implemented in the indicator plots for comparison with the control plot (which was fully fertilized with N, P, K, and the micronutrients). In order for Wallace's method to work, it was necessary to have a comprehensive, illustrated book displaying in colour the various possibilities for mineral deficiencies that might occur in the crops planted in the indicator plots. The required book with photographic images in colour was financed by Agricultural Research Council and printed by H. M. Stationery Office in London. The book was given a high priority and published in 1943 with the title The diagnosis of mineral defic",
    "1973 studio album by Abbey Lincoln\nPeople in Me is an album by jazz vocalist Abbey Lincoln. It was recorded on June 23, 1973, at Aoyama Victor Studio in Tokyo, and was initially released on vinyl later that year by Philips Records. On the album, Lincoln is joined by saxophonist Dave Liebman, pianist Hiromasa Suzuki, double bassist Kunimitsu Inaba, drummer Al Foster, and conga player James Mtume. The album was reissued on CD in 1978 by Inner City Records, and again on CD in 1993 by Verve Records. It was also reissued in Germany with the title Naturally by the NewEdition label (2005).\nThe album, the first to extensively feature Lincoln's compositions, appeared after a hiatus of roughly twelve years, during which she wrote songs and worked on vocal training. She also toured Africa with Miriam Makeba, where she was given the names \"Aminata\" and \"Moseka,\" an experience that motivated her to focus on exploring her \"inner voices.\" She recalled: \"what I discovered in Africa was that I hadn't been bastardized and ruined. Everybody knew I was an African woman; they just didn't know where to put me.\" According to Lincoln, the album's title track was her first original song; regarding the process of composing it, she stated: \"It really relieved me of whatever anxieties I had been carrying around, and it helped me to make peace with myself.\"\nReception\nWriting for the New York Times, John S. Wilson described the album as \"a very impressive display of Miss Lincoln's talents as a songwriter as well as a singer,\" and commented: \"she sings with a very positive projection, particularly on her own songs, which are imaginatively phrased statements of her feelings \u2014 the search for a homeland in her haunting lyric to John Coltrane's 'Africa,' and 'People in Me,' in which she joyously shouts out the lists of the mingled bloodstreams that make up the human race.\"\nIn a review for AllMusic, Scott Yanow wrote: \"Every Abbey Lincoln recording is well worth picking up for her sincerity, credibility and talent make each of her dates memorable in their own way.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings called the album \"the one moment where Lincoln's unflinching self-determination founders,\" and stated that it \"finds herself possessed by the spirits of Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Betty Carter and... Diana Ross; and, while there is no reason to believe that all these styles can't be subsumed and synthesized, that isn't what\u2019s happening here.\"\nTrack listing\n\"You and Me Love\" (Abbey Lincoln, Johnny Rotella) \u2013 4:25\n\"Natas (Playmate)\" (Abbey Lincoln) \u2013 2:28\n\"Dorian (The Man with the Magic)\" (Ronnie Mathews, Abbey Lincoln) \u2013 4:33\n\"Africa\" (John Coltrane, Abbey Lincoln) \u2013 7:08\n\"People in Me\" (Abbey Lincoln) \u2013 4:53\n\"Living Room\" (Max Roach, Abbey Lincoln) \u2013 5:18\n\"Kohjoh-No-Tsuki (Japanese Folk Song)\" (Rentar\u014d Taki, Bansui Tsuchii, Abbey Lincoln) \u2013 3:26\n\"Naturally\" (Abbey Lincoln) \u2013 4:39\nPersonnel\nAbbey Lincoln \u2013 vocals\nDave Liebman \u2013 sopranino saxophone\nHiromasa Suzuki \u2013 piano\nKunimitsu Inaba \u2013 double bass\nAl Foster \u2013 drums\nJames Mtume \u2013 congas\n",

The aircraft hit the ground at high speed and its debris were flung over a vast area, but no one else was killed. Masroor's death was a significant loss for the Pakistan Air Force. He was mentioned in Field Marshal Ayub Khan's diary, and Masroor's close friend, former C-in-C of the PAF Asghar Khan, wrote an obituary for him in The Pakistan Times.\nOn 24 May 1968, PAF Station Mauripur was renamed to PAF Station Masroor in his honor.\nEarly life\nMasroor Hosain was born on 29 December 1922 in a Urdu-speaking Muslim family to Manzoor Hosain and Qudsiya Begum. Masroor's younger brother, Khurshid Haider (1925\u20131995) was a Major General in the Pakistan Army.\nPersonal life\nMasroor married Mehr Nigar Abdul Aziz in 1962. She was the daughter of Mahmood Jahan and her husband, the famous Urdu writer, Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz who was better known by his pen name Falak Paima. The couple were close friends with Quaid-e-Azam and Fatima Jinnah.\nMasroor and Mehr had two children, daughter Jolie Asfareen and son Fareed Masroor Hosain. Mehr was Pakistan's leading choreographer and the Director of the PIA Arts Academy when Asghar Khan was heading the airline in 1968. Mehr presented a bouquet to Queen Elizabeth II during a PIA culture show, Sons of the River. In the 1970s, Governor of Sindh Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan hosted Mehr's ballet \"Lalkar\" to the Chinese delegation at the Governor's House.\nMehr died from terminal cancer in 1986, shortly after completing her book, Shadows of Time: A Novel, which was posthumously published in 1987.\nMasroor's cousin, Major General S. Wajahat Husain, served in the Pakistan Army. Masroor's nephew, S. Mazhar Abbas retired as an Air Commodore of the Pakistan Air Force, while Masroor's other nephew, Captain Syed Hassan Zaheer SJ of the Pakistan Army died in the 1971 War.\nRoyal Indian Air Force career\nMasroor was commissioned into the Royal Indian Air Force on 4 September 1944 as part of the 26th Course of the Initial Training Wing, Pune.\nAccident\nOn 12 February 1947, Masroor took off in a Spitfire FR Mk XIV from Ambala Air Force Station. The engine cut off in mid-air and the aircraft was belly-landed near Nizampur, Panipat, 8 miles from takeoff.\nThe forced belly landing severely damaged the fuselage due to the aircraft sliding along the rough ground at high speed.

The team consisting of Squadron Leader Stephen Aratoon Joseph, Flying Officers Masroor Hosain and Zafar Chaudhry, Officer Cadets Saleem-el-Edroos, Asaf Khan Chaudhry and S.M. Ahmad, was tasked to ferry them across to Risalpur. After a briefing by the leader, the formation took off in the early hours of 12 September 1947.\nIt was rare that trainees with less than a hundred hours of flying experience were required to ferry aircraft over a long and difficult route. Moreover, the aircraft were to be flown in formation and the cadets had not practiced the formation flying. At their third stop in Nawabshah, thousands crowded the airfield despite the stifling heat. The fact that the aircraft now belonged to Pakistan excited the crowd immensely. They spent the night in a local rest-house.\nThe next morning, 20 minutes after taking off for Jacobabad, Stephen Aratoon Joseph's aircraft force-landed in the desert due to a \"dead engine.\" The remaining six aircraft continued to Multan via Khanpur, barely arriving before sunset. During landing, Cadet Chaudhry's aircraft sustained damage, leaving only five Tiger-Moths operational.\nUpon reaching Mianwali on the morning of 14 September 1947, the escorting Dakota crew informed them that sugar had been found in the leader's aircraft fuel tank, causing the engine failure. Upon inspection, three aircraft had filters clogged with sugar. Taking off for Risalpur under those conditions would have been disastrous. The aircraft flown by the late Masroor Hosain was the only one deemed serviceable and was flown to Risalpur, landing there in the afternoon.\nOn 21 March 1948, an air show in Lahore was di",
    "1536 earthquake in China\nOn 20 March 1536, Xichang (then known as Jianchang) and Mianning, Sichuan, Ming dynasty,  were struck by an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 7.3 Ms. It had a maximum felt intensity of X (Extreme) on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale, and caused thousands of deaths.\nTectonic setting\nXichang lies on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, which is an area of thickened crust, which has been formed by the ongoing collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The plateau is spreading laterally eastwards, to southeastwards, partly accommodated by a series of major strike-slip faults. The Sichuan\u2013Yunnan block is bounded to the northeast and east by the left lateral Xianshuihe fault system and to the southwest by the right lateral Red River Fault. Xichang is sited at the southern end of the Anninge segment of the Xianshuihe fault system, close to its junction with the Zemuhe segment.\nEarthquake\nEstimates for the magnitude of this earthquake vary in the range 7.3\u20137.5. Although the 1850 Xichang earthquake is thought to have ruptured both the Anninge and Zemuhe segments, the 1536 event probably only ruptured the more northerly Anninge segment. This is supported by paleoseismological investigations. A trench dug across the northern end of the Anninge segment found evidence of a rupture consistent with the 1536 event but a trench across the northern end of the Zemuhe segment lacked any such evidence.\nDamage\nThe extent of damage and casualties was reported by Yuancheng Cao, the official responsible for judging affairs in Sichuan. In Xichang all buildings were destroyed, including government offices, prisons, storehouses and houses (both military and civilian). The city walls, gates, battlements and watchtowers collapsed. Many people were crushed to death, including several senior officials. Further north in Mianning, every house was destroyed and the city walls completely collapsed and thousands were killed. Parts of the city walls also collapsed in Yuexi, Qionglai, Ya'an, Dayi and Meishan.\nSee also\nList of earthquakes in China\nList of earthquakes in Sichuan\nList of historical earthquakes\n",

It was known as the town of Takashima but is now part of the city of Nagasaki, Nagasaki Prefecture. The entire 1.23 square kilometre island, including the areas under the ocean off the coast of the island, was a coal mine. There were 22 mining shafts covering 12,480 hectares. 80% of the coal produced was considered high-quality coking coal, which was consumed in Kyushu and Osaka for gas and coke. The mine was closed on November 27, 1986. It was designated a National Historic Site in 2014.\nAlong with the Hashima Coal Mine, it was registered as one of the assets of the UNESCO Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution: Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding and Coal Mining World Heritage Site in 2015.\nOverview\nThe Takashima Coal Mine began operations in 1695 when a coal seam was discovered in Matsuura County, Hizen Province. This coal was first exploited by Hirado Domain and shipped to customers in Osaka and the Chugoku region. It was also used as fuel in nearby salt farms and as fuel for ceramics, such as Hasami ware.\nIn 1868, during the Bakumatsu period, Saga Domain and Scottish merchant Thomas Blake Glover, established a joint venture and excavated Japan's first Western-style vertical shaft powered by steam engines (the Hokkei-i Pit).  With the end of the national isolation policy, the demand for coal as fuel for foreign steamships calling at Nagasaki increased. In the Meiji period, Got\u014d Sh\u014djir\u014d purchased the mine from the Saga Domain and began operations. British mining engineer, Erasmus Gower, tried to modernize it but failed. In 1881, operations of the mine were taken over by the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu led by Iwasaki Yatar\u014d, who was also from Tosa Domain, and full-scale mining began. On April 25, Iwasaki bought out Got\u014d's shares, and in return, he paid off Got\u014d's outstanding debt of 250,000 yen to the Meiji government. Since then, along with the nearby Nakanoshima coal mine and Hashima coal mine, it was run by various companies within the Mitsubishi conglomerate and was a major supplier for Japan's energy needs into the twentieth century.\nThe Takashima mine was infamous for its employment system, which included exploitation by the company and foremen. With inhumane working conditions, \"troublemakers\" and workers attempting to flee were being lynched to death as a warning to others. These conditions were made known nationwide in an expos\u00e9 in 1888 by Matsuoka Koichi, a reporter who had worked in the mines himself and was a former supervisor at the Takashima coal mine. The article, entitled \"The Tragedy of the Takashima Coal Mine\", were published in the magazine Nihonjin (Issues 6\u201314) and sparked a nationwide campaign. As a result of frequent riots by workers, the employment conditions at the Takashima coal mine were reformed in 1897. However, the poor living conditions in company-run dormitories persisted until after World War II. In 1906, a coal dust explosion occurred at the Kakise Pit, resulting in 307 deaths and injuries.\nIn 1963, the 965-meter-deep Futago Shaft was completed at a cost of 16 billion yen to mine coal from deep areas, but it was abandoned in 1973 due to poor conditions which including a steep incline of 36 degrees, high temperatures and frequent gas outflows. The mining volume peaked in 1966. By 1965, the company had grown to 3,000 employees and production of 1.27 million tons of coal. However, due to the shift from coal to oil, demand for coal decreased, and by 1985, both the number of employees and coal production had halved. In addition, a dust explosion accident occurred in the same year, and the mine was closed in 1986 as part the first industrial restructuring measure to resolve trade friction between Japan and the United States. The accumulated deficit at that time was 35 billion yen.\nSee also\nSites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution: Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding and Coal Mining\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Nagasaki)\n",
    "\nThe Secretariat of Tourism, Environment and Sports  (Spanish: Secretar\u00eda de Turismo, Ambiente y Deportes, formerly, Ministry of Tourism and Sports) of Argentina is a secretariat of the national executive power that oversees and advises on Argentina's national tourism industry and the Argentine state's sports policy.\nIt was a ministry until it was dissolved by the administration leaded by Javier Milei in December 2023.\nHistory\nIt was created on 29 October 2001 as an extension of the Ministry of Culture, as the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sports, by President Fernando de la R\u00faa. The first minister responsible was Hern\u00e1n Lombardi, but his tenure \u2013 as well as the ministry's existence \u2013 was cut short by the resignation of De la R\u00faa and his entire government less than two months later on 20 December 2001.\nThe tourism and sports portfolios were downgraded to a number of secretariat-level agencies of different ministries (chiefly Culture) by the following presidencies until 2010, when it was reinstated to ministerial level by Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who appointed Carlos Enrique Meyer at the helm of the Ministry of Tourism. Gustavo Santos, the minister of tourism appointed by President Mauricio Macri, remained in office as Secretary of Tourism as the ministry was downgraded in a 2018 cabinet reshuffle that saw the number of cabinet ministries reduced from 22 to 11, though this arrangement was short-lived as the portfolio was reinstated as the Ministry of Tourism and Sports on 10 December 2019; Fern\u00e1ndez's appointee to the ministry was Mat\u00edas Lammens, former president of Club Atl\u00e9tico San Lorenzo de Almagro and Buenos Aires mayoral candidate in 2019 for the Frente de Todos.\nThe ministry was dissolved on December 10, 2023, following a presidential decree by President Javier Milei, and restructured as a secretariat under the supervision of the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers.\nAttributions\nAs established by the ruling Ley de Ministerios (\"Ministries Law\"), adopted in December 2019, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports was reinstated (from having previously been part of the Culture Ministry's portfolio) due to tourism being a \"pivotal activity for the development of the nation,\" and due to the need of \"rationally exploiting it\" \"making use of tourist attractions and resources\", as well as coordinating the national sports industry.\nThe Ministry's responsibilities and attributions were outlined in Article 23 (nonies) of the law, which states that, among others, it was within the ministry's competence overseeing the design and execution of plans and programs pertaining to the tourism and high-performance sports in Argentina; promoting tourism and developing Argentina's image on an international scale as well as internally in Argentina itself; coordinating the joint work of the Federal Council of Tourism and the National Council of Sports and Physical Activities; working alongside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to represent Argentina on a global scale in tourism and sports-related areas, as well as working alongside the Ministry of Transport to elaborate and implement national policy dealing with commercial air travel in tourism-related areas; and promoting the \"Argentina Brand\", among others.\nStructure and dependencies\nFrom 2019 to 2023, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports was organized into the following centralized dependencies:\nUndersecretariat of Administrative Management (Secretar\u00eda de Gesti\u00f3n Administrativa)\nUndersecretariat of Public Works (Secretar\u00eda de Obras P\u00fablicas)\nSecretariat of Tourism Development (Secretar\u00eda de Desarrollo Tur\u00edstico)\nUndersecretariat of National Tourism Quality, Accessibility and Sustainability (Subsecretar\u00eda de Calidad, Accesibilidad y Sustentabilidad del Turismo Nacional)\nUndersecretariat of Strategic Development (Subsecretar\u00eda de Desarrollo Estrat\u00e9gico)\nSecretariat of Tourism Promotion (Secretar\u00eda de Promoci\u00f3n Tur\u00edstica)\nUndersecretariat of Tourism Promotion and New Products (Subsecretar\u00eda de Promoci\u00f3n Tur\u00edstica y Nuevos Productos)\nSecretariat of Sports (Secretar\u00eda de Deportes)\nUndersecretariat of Sports Infrastructure and National Competitions (Subsecretar\u00eda de Infraestructura Deportiva y Competencias Nacionales)\nUndersecretariat of Integral Development of Sports Activities (Subsecretar\u00eda de Desarrollo Integral de la Actividad Deportiva)\nAdditionally, a number of decentralized dependencies also report to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, including the National Institute for the Promotion of Tourism (Instituto Nacional de Promoci\u00f3n Tur\u00edstica; Inprotur), the National Antidoping Commission (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Antidopaje, CNAD), and the National Agency for High Performance in Sports (Ente Nacional de Alto Rendimiento Deportivo, ENARD).\nHeadquarters\nThe Ministry of Tourism and Sports was headquartered in the Brunetta Tower (es:Torre Brunetta), a 30-storey-high building located in Suipacha 1111, in the Retiro barrio of Buenos Aires; as of 2018, the ministry owned three floors and ",
    "\nTibold (Tybold or Tibolch)  was the name of a gens (Latin for \"clan\"; nemzets\u00e9g in Hungarian) in the Kingdom of Hungary and later the Kingdom of Croatia. The namesake founder of the kindred, Theobald arrived from the Kingdom of Germany in the late 10th century, during the reign of G\u00e9za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. The clan possessed lands in Somogy and Kri\u017eevci counties along the river Drava. The illustrious Slavonian Szencsei (Sveta\u010dki; de Zempche) family descended from this clan.\nOrigin\nThe kindred that is called the kindred of Bab\u00f3csa came into Pannonia from Samberg.\u2014\u200aIlluminated Chronicle\nSo at that time Count Tibold of Fanberg came to Duke G\u00e9za. He was called Graf Tibold, and some members of the same family are still simply called Graf to this day. The Bab\u00f3csa derive their origins from him, these persons being von Deutschland.\u2014\u200aSimon of K\u00e9za: Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum\nThe ruins of Schaunberg Castle, the most likely place of origin for the Tibolds\nThe Tibold genus was among the so-called advena (\"newcomer\") clans of foreign origin in the Kingdom of Hungary. The mid-13th century historian Master \u00c1kos remembers the origin of the kindred in a single sentence. The chronicler calls the kinship after their primary residence Bab\u00f3csa and writes that they came from \"Samberg\" to Hungary. \u00c1kos' text was preserved by the 14th-century chronicle composition, including the Illuminated Chronicle. The brevity of the chronicle indicates that the members of the family were not prominent figures in national politics in the middle of the 13th century. Another chronicler Simon of K\u00e9za, who compiled his work Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum in the early 1280s, provides more and slightly different details about the origin of the kindred. Accordingly, the ancestor of the kindred was a certain \"Count Theobald of Fanberg\", who was invited to Hungary by G\u00e9za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians in the late 10th century. The chronicler emphasizes that Theobald and his family originated from \"Vandeuchumlant\" (\"von Deutschland\"), i.e. from Germany, describing the country of origin in German. Simon also refers to Theobald with the epithet \"Grauu\" which then became an alternative surname of the family by the 13th century. Historian J\u00e1nos Kar\u00e1csonyi assumed its meaning \"grey\". In contrast, M\u00f3r Wertner argued this epithet came from his title of count (\"Graf\"). This was accepted by other historians, e.g. Elem\u00e9r M\u00e9lyusz.\nHistorians have made several attempts to identify the place of origin (\"Samberg\" or \"Fanberg\"). M\u00f3r Wertner connected Theobald to the House of Schaumburg. He considered that Theobald was among those Bavarian lords and knights, who arrived to Hungary in the accompaniment of Queen Gisela of Bavaria, the spouse of the future Hungarian king Stephen around 996. Elem\u00e9r M\u00e1lyusz rejected the identification with the Schamburg dynasty. Instead, he identified the place of origin with the castle of Schaunberg along the river Danube near Eferding in present-day Hartkirchen, Upper Austria. Erik F\u00fcgedi considered that Theobald was a \"count from Thuringia\".\nAccording to B\u00e1lint H\u00f3man, Theobald participated in the civil war between Stephen and Kopp\u00e1ny for the Hungarian throne in 997 and 998, alongside other members of the German entourage of Gisela. Following the defeat of Kopp\u00e1ny, his territory the Duchy of Somogy was disintegrated. For his military service during the struggle, Theobald was granted landholdings in the southern part of the emerging Somogy County, along the river Drava, by Stephen I. The settlement Bab\u00f3csa became the centre of his estates in the region. Archaeologist K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Magyar considered that Theobald possessed sporadic lands also in the interior areas of the county, and the town Tab is named after him, where he plausibly built a fortified manor.\nEarly history\nSeveral historians \u2013 for instance, B\u00e1lint H\u00f3man, Elem\u00e9r M\u00e1lyusz and Gy\u00f6rgy Gy\u00f6rffy argued that certain Tietpaldus comes, who appears in the account of Berthold of Reichenau as an influential courtier of King Andrew I of Hungary in 1060, belonged to the Tibold clan and he was a son or grandson of its namesake founder. Gy\u00f6rffy even claimed that this Theobald was the founder of the arriving kindred. This Theobald mediated in the forging of alliance between Andrew I and the court of Henry IV of Germany. When Duke B\u00e9la, the younger brother of the ailing Andrew rebelled against him in 1060, Andrew I entrusted Theobald to deliver the royal family \u2013 Queen Anastasia and young princes Solomon and David \u2013 to Melk Abbey under the protection of Ernest, Margrave of Austria. Finally, B\u00e9la dethroned Andrew by force in 1060.\nThe ruins of the monastery in Bab\u00f3csa in Hungary, erected by the Tibolds\nTwo members of the kindred \u2013 Grab and Theobald (possibly father and son) \u2013 served as isp\u00e1ns of Somogy County at the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries (c. 1090 and 1111\u20131113, respectively). Wertner considered that Grab's name derived from the title \"Graf\", in accordance with Simon of K\u00e9za'",
    "Arthur Stanley Grove FLS VMH (July 22, 1864 \u2013 February 2, 1942, Richmond, Surrey) was an award-winning expert on the genus Lilium and a writer on gardening and horticulture for the popular press.\nArthur Stanley Grove was the youngest child of the three sons and two daughters of Sir George Grove and Harriet, Lady Grove. Arthur Grove's godparents were Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Arthur Sullivan, and Olga Elizabeth von Glehn (1839\u20131918), a sister of the talented pianist Marie Emilie \"Mimi\" von Glehn (1842\u20131886). Arthur Grove was trained an engineer, but soon became an enthusiastic amateur gardener. At his garden near Henley-on-Thames, he cultivated a remarkable collection of plants. He made a life-long study of lilies, maintained a wide interest in gardening, and for many years was the chief horticultural contributor to The Times.\nA Supplement to Elwes' Monograph of the Genus Lilium\nFrom March 1877 to May 1880, Taylor & Francis published in seven parts the classic Monograph of the Genus Lilium, written by Henry John Elwes (with some assistance from John Gilbert Baker) and illustrated by Walter Hood Fitch. In 1922, Elwes, elderly and in declining health, asked his friend Arthur Grove to produce a comprehensive supplement. Dame Alice Godman, widow of Frederick DuCane Godman, agreed to underwrite the cost of the work. (Frederick Godman's first wife was Elwes' sister Edith, who died soon after giving birth to her first child \u2014 the child died soon after birth.) Dulau & Company published the supplement (co-written by Grove and the botanist A.D. Cotton). The first seven parts of the supplement were published between July 1933 and February 1940, with 30 hand-coloured lithographed plates, all except two by Lilian Snelling (1879\u20131972).\nAwards and honours\nIn January 1903 Arthur Grove was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) awarded him in 1924 the Victoria Medal of Honour and in 1933 the Veitch Memorial Medal.

    "Referendum to join Switzerland.\nA referendum on whether the Provisional Provincial Assembly of Vorarlberg should announce the intention of the people of Vorarlberg to join the Swiss Confederation and to enter into negotiations with the Swiss Federal Government was held on 11 May 1919. The proposal received substantial support, with 80.7% of voters and a majority in 93 out of 96 municipalities voting in favor.\nOpinions on the integration of Vorarlberg, a predominantly Catholic and rural region with a concentrated industrial sector, into the Swiss Confederation were mixed. A petition for a popular initiative for union failed and only one member of the seven-person Swiss Federal Council, Foreign Affairs Minister Felix Calonder, strongly endorsed the idea. The Swiss government did, however, provide aid to the region, allowing the local government to avoid a serious famine.\nThe Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, signed on 10 September 1919, made no provision for a plebiscite in Vorarlberg and with no support from any outside power, the province was to remain with Austria as the independence of Austria was \"inalienable otherwise than with the consent of the Council of the League of Nations.\"\nBackground\nThe idea of Swiss annexation of Vorarlberg wasn't new. In 1798, the newly formed Helvetic Republic entered into an alliance treaty with France, which included a secret clause stipulating that several territories, including Vorarlberg, would be annexed to Helvetia with French assistance. This move aimed to round off Switzerland's eastern border. French Foreign Minister Talleyrand emphasised France's interest in this for economic, geographical, and military reasons.\nHowever, by the summer of 1801, nothing had come out of it and First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte believed that circumstances did not allow him to help Switzerland acquire Vorarlberg. The situation in Switzerland was too confusing for Napoleon and the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville had ended the war against the Holy Roman Empire and Austria.\n120 years later, on 3 November 1918, following the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the Provisional Provincial Assembly of Vorarlberg declared the region's succession from its union with Tyrol and the formation of an independent country within the framework of the German-Austrian state.\nThe movement for a referendum for union with Switzerland began around the same time with Ferdinand Riedmann, a trained teacher, cinema owner, conservative, and member of the Linz Soldier Soviet of the Common Army. In a speech to his comrades, he advocated for the union of Vorarlberg with Switzerland, and shortly after the Armistice of Villa Giusti, returned to his home province.\nWith the support of local craftsmen, tradesmen, small entrepreneurs, farmers, and petit bourgeois intelligentsia, Riedmann founded the committee to Campaign for Union with Switzerland on 13 November 1918. Amid an uncertain future of Austria following the collapse of Austria-Hungary, widespread economic hardship, and a prevailing sense of neglect by the government in Vienna, many in Vorarlberg viewed Switzerland as a place that offered employment and economic stability. Riedmann also praised the Swiss model of democracy and believed that Vorarlberg shared closer ties in terms of language, culture, lifestyle, and mindset with Switzerland than with the rest of Austria. In its campaigning the group employed anti-semitic rhetoric, referring to Austria as the \"Jewish State of Vienna\" and saying that they did \"not want to know anything about the Jews of Vienna.\"\n\"Confederates, help your brothers in need\", poster of the Swiss Pro Vorarlberg aid campaign, 1919Between its founding and February 1919, the group collected signatures from 71% of the Vorarlberg electorate in favor of union with Switzerland. On 1 March, Riedmann passed the signatures to the then Christian Social Party lead provincial assembly, which on 15 March declared that its affiliation with German-Austria was to be regarded as provisional only and that a plebiscite should determine any union with a larger state, including a possible option for union with Bavaria or W\u00fcrttemberg. Provincial Governor Otto Ender, while leaning towards remaining in German-Austria, commented that:\nI am of the opinion that, when we look at our geographical position, it is obvious that we are open towards Switzerland, not closed off from Germany, but definitely cut off by mountains from German-Austria.\nIn Switzerland, the opinions on the integration of Vorarlberg, a predominantly Catholic and rural region with a concentrated industrial sector, into the Swiss Confederation were mixed. A group of conservatives such as Gonzague de Reynold supported the idea and founded the Pro Vorarlberg movement. Its goal was to collect 50,000 signatures for a popular initiative for a union. The group was only able to collect 29,000 signatures and only one member of the seven-person Swiss Federal Council, Foreign Affairs Minister Felix Calonder, strongly endorsed the ",
    "2017 crime novel by Australian author Jane Harper\nForce of Nature is a 2017 novel by the Australian author Jane Harper.\nThis novel is the second in the author's Aaron Falk series, following The Dry in 2016, and preceding Exiles in 2022.\nSynopsis\nThis thriller is set in the thickly forested mountains north-east of Melbourne, again featuring Federal Agent Aaron Falk. A group from a Melbourne tech company go on a retreat in the mountains, where Alice Russell, one of the women in the group, disappears while navigating the Mirror Falls trail. Falk has been investigating the company for financial irregularities, and the woman was his secret informer.\nCritical reception\nWriting in The Guardian Amanda Coe called the novel \"a gripping procedural, with the narrative chops and assured pace of a Hollywood thriller. Elevator pitch: Deliverance with oestrogen, or a menopausal Picnic at Hanging Rock...As in The Dry, Harper deploys end-of-chapter hooks and narrative misdirections with aplomb. But with a style that is efficient at best (people never smile: instead, their mouths always 'lift at the corners'), Force of Nature begs for an internal dynamism. Perhaps Falk is the problem. In The Dry he's personally connected to a story that forced his exile from his hometown. Here, it's strictly business, and given the nature of that business \u2013 the clue is in 'financial' \u2013 he is more methodical accountant than maverick cop.\"\nIn the Chicago Review of Books Greer MacAllister found a lot to like about the book: \"Nearly all of the main characters of Jane Harper's new Australia-set thriller, Force of Nature \u2014 a loose follow-up to The Dry \u2014 are more unpleasant than pleasant, more misbehaving than misunderstood. And you'll enjoy the book a lot more because of it...Force of Nature is only Harper's second novel, but it clearly displays her background of more than a decade in journalism. Once the core players are introduced, the novel ramps up to a brisk, compelling pace with red herrings and revelations popping up regularly.\"\nPublishing history\nAfter the novel's initial publication in Australia by Pan Macmillan in 2017, it was reprinted as follows:\nPan Macmillan, Australia, 2018\nLittle, Brown, UK, 2018\nFlatiron Books, USA, 2018\nPan Macmillan, Australia, 2023\nThe novel was also translated into Swedish in 2017; Chinese, German, French, Dutch, Danish, Italian, Greek and Croatian in 2018; Norwegian, Hungarian, Spanish, Polish, Japanese, Indonesian, Ukrainian and Czech in 2019; Bulgarian, Finnish, Lithuanian, Russian, Persian, and Romanian in 2020; Portuguese and Latvian in 2021; and Turkish and Arabic in 2022.\nAwards\nDavitt Award \u2014 Best Adult Crime Novel, 2018, shortlisted\nDavitt Award \u2014 People's Choice, 2018, winner\nAustralian Booksellers Association Awards \u2014 BookPeople Book of the Year, 2018, shortlisted\nAustralian Book Industry Awards (ABIA) \u2014 Australian General Fiction Book of the Year, 2018, shortlisted\nIndie Book Awards Book of the Year \u2013 Fiction, 2018 shortlisted \nFilm adaptation\nThe novel was adapted as a film in 2024 under the title Force of Nature: The Dry 2, with Eric Bana in the lead role of Aaron Falk and also featuring Anna Torv and Deborra-Lee Furness.

    "\nPharmaceutical clinical trial\nThe Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) trial is a landmark clinical study that assessed the impact of spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. The findings from this trial significantly influenced the treatment guidelines for heart failure.\nBackground\nHeart failure, particularly with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Aldosterone, a hormone that promotes sodium retention and potassium excretion, plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of heart failure by contributing to fluid overload, myocardial fibrosis, and vascular damage. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist was hypothesized to improve outcomes in patients with severe heart failure.\nStudy design\nRALES trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 1663 patients from 195 centers in 15 countries from March 1995 to December 1996. The average age of the patients was 65 years. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had recently been diagnosed with severe heart failure (NYHA class III or IV) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or less, who were already receiving standard therapy (ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics, and, if tolerated, digoxin). The objective of this trial was to assess the impact of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure.  Patients were randomized to receive either spironolactone (25 to 50 mg) daily or placebo. Both groups were continued on standard therapy. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included hospitalization for heart failure, changes in symptoms of heart failure, and serum potassium levels.\nKey findings\nThe trial was stopped early because the beneficial effect of spironolactone on all-cause death exceeded the prespecified discontinuation requirements. Spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% compared to placebo. Additionally, there was a 35% reduction in the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in the spironolactone group. Finally, patients treated with spironolactone reported significant improvements in heart failure symptoms. Hyperkalemia was more common in the spironolactone group, but the incidence of severe hyperkalemia was relatively low. Gynecomastia or breast pain occurred in 10% of men treated with spironolactone vs 1% of men in the placebo group, otherwise there were no other differences in safety or adverse events.\nClinical implications\nThe RALES trial had a profound impact on the management of heart failure. The results led to the inclusion of aldosterone antagonists, such as spironolactone, in treatment guidelines for patients with severe heart failure. Spironolactone has become a standard therapy for reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The RALES trial has then paved the way for further studies on the role of aldosterone antagonists in heart failure and other cardiovascular conditions.\nConclusion\nThe RALES trial established spironolactone as a vital component of therapy for patients with severe heart failure, demonstrating significant reductions in mortality and hospitalization and improvements in symptoms. The trial's findings have been instrumental in shaping current heart failure treatment guidelines and improving patient outcomes.\n",
    "\nThe history of Jewish mysticism encompasses various forms of esoteric and spiritual practices aimed at understanding the divine and the hidden aspects of existence. This mystical tradition has evolved significantly over millennia, influencing and being influenced by different historical, cultural, and religious contexts. Among the most prominent forms of Jewish mysticism is Kabbalah, which emerged in the 12th century and has since become a central component of Jewish mystical thought. Other notable early forms include prophetic and apocalyptic mysticism, which are evident in biblical and post-biblical texts.\nThe roots of Jewish mysticism can be traced back to the biblical era, with prophetic figures such as Elijah and Ezekiel experiencing divine visions and encounters. This tradition continued into the apocalyptic period, where texts like 1 Enoch and the Book of Daniel introduced complex angelology and eschatological themes. The Heikhalot and Merkavah literature, dating from the 2nd century to the early medieval period, further developed these mystical themes, focusing on visionary ascents to the heavenly palaces and the divine chariot.\nThe medieval period saw the formalization of Kabbalah, particularly in Southern France and Spain. Foundational texts such as the Bahir and the Zohar were composed during this time, laying the groundwork for later developments. The Kabbalistic teachings of this era delved deeply into the nature of the divine, the structure of the universe, and the process of creation. Notable Kabbalists like Moses de Le\u00f3n played crucial roles in disseminating these teachings, which were characterized by their profound symbolic and allegorical interpretations of the Torah.\nIn the early modern period, Lurianic Kabbalah, founded by Isaac Luria in the 16th century, introduced new metaphysical concepts such as Tzimtzum (divine contraction) and Tikkun (cosmic repair), which have had a lasting impact on Jewish thought. The 18th century saw the rise of Hasidism, a movement that integrated Kabbalistic ideas into a popular, revivalist context, emphasizing personal mystical experience and the presence of the divine in everyday life. Today, the academic study of Jewish mysticism, pioneered by scholars like Gershom Scholem, continues to explore its historical, textual, and philosophical dimensions.\nOrigins\nAccording to the traditional Kabbalistic understanding, Kabbalah dates from Eden. It came down from a remote past as a revelation to elect tzadikim (righteous people), and, for the most part, was preserved only by a privileged few. Talmudic Judaism records its view of the proper protocol for teaching secrets in the Talmud, Tractate Hagigah, 11b\u201313a, \"One should not teach\u00a0 the work of Creation in pairs, nor the work of the Chariot to an individual, unless he is wise and can understand the implications himself etc.\"\nTerms\nOriginally, Kabbalistic knowledge was believed to be an integral part of the Oral Torah, given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai around the 13th century BCE according to its followers; although some believe that Kabbalah began with Adam.\nFor a few centuries the esoteric knowledge was referred to by its aspect practice\u2014meditation Hitbonenut (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea\u200e), Rebbe Nachman of Breslov's Hitbodedut (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3\u05b0\u05d3\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea\u200e), translated as 'being alone' or 'isolating oneself', or by a different term describing the actual, desired goal of the practice\u2014prophecy (NeVu'a, Hebrew: \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05b8\u05d4\u200e). Kabbalistic scholar Aryeh Kaplan traces the origins of medieval Kabbalistic meditative methods to their inheritance from orally transmitted remnants of the Biblical Prophetic tradition, and reconstructs their terminology and speculated techniques.\nFrom the 5th century BCE, when the works of the Tanakh were edited and canonised and the secret knowledge encrypted within the various writings and scrolls (\"Megilot\"), esoteric knowledge became referred to as Ma'aseh Merkavah (Hebrew: \u05de\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e9\u05b6\u05c2\u05d4 \u05de\u05b6\u05e8\u05b0\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4\u200e) and Ma'aseh B'reshit (Hebrew: \u05de\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e9\u05b6\u05c2\u05d4 \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05ea\u200e), respectively 'the act of the Chariot' and 'the act of Creation'. Merkabah mysticism alluded to the encrypted knowledge, and meditation methods within the book of the prophet Ezekiel describing his vision of the \"Divine Chariot\". B'reshit mysticism referred to the first chapter of Genesis (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05ea\u200e) in the Torah that is believed to contain secrets of the creation of the universe and forces of nature. These terms received their later historical documentation and description in the second chapter of the Talmudic tractate Hagigah from the early centuries CE.\nConfidence in new Prophetic revelation closed after the Biblical return from Babylon in Second Temple Judaism, shifting to canonisation and exegesis of Scripture after Ezra the Scribe. Lesser level prophecy of Ruach Hakodesh remained, with angelic revelations, esoteric heavenly secrets, and eschatological deliverance from Greek and Roman oppression of Apocalyptic literature among early Jewis",
    "\nOperation Nest Egg was an international law enforcement initiative aimed at dismantling an online network dedicated to the distribution and trade of child pornography. Launched in February 2008, the operation was a collaborative effort involving multiple law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nThe primary focus of the investigation was the bulletin board style website thecachebbs.com which at its peak had around 1,000 members. As of February 2008, postal inspectors had already seized the main servers from Caro.net, a web host based in North Carolina. This caused periodic downtime which prompted the site admins to move the hosting to Atomic Colo in Minnesota. A backup server that was utilized during the periods of downtime was hosted by Future Hosting in Dallas, TX.\nOperation Nest Egg was a spinoff investigation developed from leads related to another international investigation, \"Operation Joint Hammer,\" which targeted transnational rings of child pornography trafficking. Operation Delego was a subsequent spinoff investigation from leads developed through \"Operation Nest Egg,\" the prosecution of another online group dedicated to sharing and disseminating child pornography. Operation Joint Hammer was spawned by Operation Koala which led to 40 arrests in Britain, 21 in France, 11 in Spain, eight in Sweden, five in Belgium, four in Italy, two in Iceland and one in Denmark.\nTrial of Roger Loughry\nA decision was made to go after the leadership of The Cache on conspiracy charges instead of prosecuting each member individually. This meant that the administrators could be consolidated into one criminal case handled by prosecutor Steven DeBrota. This also meant that evidence and discovery were limited to activities directly related to The Cache instead of material from the defendants homes, which in some cases was worse.\nDespite this, DeBrota brought a postal inspector to the stand who testified about the material seized from Roger Loughry's house which contained videos of men having sex with underage girls. Since they did not come from The Cache, however, they were not part of the conspiracy charges against Loughry. DeBrota insisted on showing the videos to the jury. Loughry and his team objected as the material was outside the scope of the case and could be used to sway the jurors' emotions. DeBrota insisted that the material needed to be presented to demonstrate that Loughry misunderstood the definition of child pornography, as Loughry had previously argued that the material on The Cache did not constitute child pornography as it was almost exclusively still image of genitalia. The judge ruled in favor of the prosecutor.\nAfter his sentencing, Loughry got a new lawyer and appealed his conviction on the basis that the videos had prejudiced the jury. On October 11 2011, the appeals court of Chicago ruled that the videos had indeed been \"highly inflammatory and had only minimal probative value. These errors were not harmless.\" The entire case was overturned and Loughry was granted a new trial. In 2013 Loughry was again found guilty on all all 16 charges. He was senteced to 30 years in prison as well as lifetime supervised release.\n",
    "Portuguese politician and teacher (1916\u20132007))\nMaria Judite Pinto Mendes de Abreu (1916\u20132007) was one of the first five Portuguese women to be elected as a mayor of a municipality. She served as mayor of Coimbra from 1976 to 1979 and as president of the municipal assembly of the same city from 1983 to 1986. An opponent of the Estado Novo dictatorship, she was a supporter of General Norton de Matos in the 1949 national election and a member of women's and other organizations that campaigned against the government. After the overthrow of the Estado Novo by the 1974 Carnation Revolution, she was active in the court that judged crimes committed by the dictatorship. Among other honours, she was awarded the Portuguese Order of Liberty.\nEarly life and education\nAbreu was born on 16 February 1916, in the parish of S\u00e3o Juli\u00e3o, in Figueira da Foz in the Coimbra District. Daughter of Maur\u00edcio Augusto \u00c1guas Pinto, an industrial trader, and Guilhermina Andrade Pinto, she was born into a wealthy family that opposed the Estado Novo regime. After five years of schooling in Figueira da Foz she entered the Jos\u00e9 Falc\u00e3o Secondary School \u00a0 in the centre of Coimbra. At the age of 17 she was admitted to the University of Coimbra, graduating in Germanic literature and law. She married Pedro Falc\u00e3o Mendes de Abreu in 1940, in Figueira da Foz, and they had two sons. Her husband died in 1960.\nEarly activism\nBetween 1944 and 1949 Abreu was active in several areas. She was a supporter of General Norton de Matos who was initially the opposition presidential candidate for the 1949 elections. Matos demanded the right to advertise his message and to monitor the counting of votes, but both were refused and he withdrew his candidature before the election. After the defeat of fascism in World War II the Estado Novo allowed some limited opposition groups in order to appear to give it respectability in other countries. In 1945 she joined the Movement of Democratic Unity (MUD), a quasi-legal opposition group. In 1946 she also joined the feminist Conselho Nacional das Mulheres Portuguesas (National Council of Portuguese Women) and was one of the founders of its Coimbra branch. However, the National Council was closed down by the Estado Novo two years later. In 1952, Abreu became a teacher at a private high school as the government had banned her from teaching in public schools because of her political views. From 1961 she was also managing partner of Teatro Avenida, in Coimbra, sometimes incurring the ire of the government by holding meetings there of the organizations she supported.\nBetween 1970 and the Carnation Revolution in 1974, Abreu became a member of the National Relief Commission for Political Prisoners, which provided financial and legal support to families of prisoners. After the revolution she joined the National Commission to Support Anti-Fascist Political Refugees, which assisted the many people who had left Portugal during the Estado Novo rule to reintegrate into the society with food, accommodation, medical assistance, employment, information, clothing and school supplies. She also supported the Organizing Committee of the Humberto Delgado Civic Court, between 1977 and 1978, a body created to denounce and judge crimes experienced during the dictatorship and to arrest PIDE (the secret police of the Estado Novo) informants.\nPolitical career\nAfter the Carnation Revolution she became president of the Administrative Committee of Figueira da Foz from October 1974 to December 1976. In December 1976, she was elected president of Coimbra municipality, as an independent on the lists of the Socialist Party, a position she held until December 1979. In doing so, she became one of the so-called \"Magnificent Five\", the five women who were elected to become mayors in 1976. In addition to Abreu they were Alda Santos Victor, Francelina Chambel, Lurdes Breu, and Odete Isabel.\nWhile in office she was responsible for beginning major works that were to prove decisive for the future of the municipality. She only served one term but then became a councillor between 1980 and 1982. In 1983, she was also the first woman to become president of the Municipal Assembly of Coimbra, a position she held until 1986.\nDeath\nAbreu died in Coimbra on 10 May 2007.\nAwards and honours\nIn 1982 her birth town of Figueira da Foz awarded her the town's medal and made her an honorary citizen. In 1983 she was awarded the Portuguese Order of Liberty by the President of the Republic, Ant\u00f3nio Ramalho Eanes. In 2002, she was awarded the gold medal of Coimbra. In 2022 a room in the Coimbra City Hall was named after her. A street was also named after her in the municipality.\n",
    "Military unit\nThe Missile Ship Fleet , or as it's officially called Shayetet 3, is the main surface combat force of the Israeli Navy . The fleet was established in 1967 and includes, 15 missile ships of the Saar 4.5, Saar 5 and Saar 6 models . In addition, the Ahi Bat Yam auxiliary ship is under its command. It is the only fleet of Israeli Navy operating Surface vessels (as Israeli Navy only uses submarines and missile ships)\nRoles\nThe cruise missions of the missile ships are derived from the mission of the Israeli Navy: \"to give a safe coast and open navigation to Israel\" . In times of war, the Navy's duties are naval warfare against the enemy's fleets, assistance to the ground forces, shelling of installations and traffic routes on the enemy's coast, securing the shipping lanes to Israel and protecting the country's beaches.\nExcept in times of war, the fleet is assigned various tasks: operations to gather intelligence, regular security patrols against hostile sabotage activity and preventing the supply of weapons to terrorist elements and providing backup to ground forces in operational operations. In the 2nd decade of the 21st century, with the establishment of the drilling arrays and gas production, drilling: Tamar, Leviathan and Tanin in the Mediterranean Sea, the navy's missions were expanded and they also include security of the state's assets at sea.\nFleet\nMissile corvettes\nMissile boats\nOrganisation\nThe fleet is divided into four combat squadrons.\nSquadron 31 - Squadron of Sa'ar 4.5\u00a0: INS Tarshish , INS Herev and INS Sufa , INS Hetz.\nSquadron 32 - Another squadron of Sa'ar 4.5: INS Kidon and INS Yaffo , Achi Keshet , INS Romach and the auxiliary ship INS Bat Yam 2, which is used for underwater detection.\nSquadron 33 - Corvette squadron of the Sa'ar 5\u00a0: INS Lahav , INS Hanit and INS Eilat.\nSquadron 36 - Corvette squadron of the Sa'ar 6\u00a0: INS Magen , INS Oz , INS Atzmaut and INS Nitzachon.\nExtra Auxiliary ship - An Auxiliary ship INS Bat Galim 3, was sold to the government company Israel Seas and Lakes Research in 2015, but the Navy retains the right to recruit for wartime service.\nCommand Structure\nThe organization of each ship is done in four departments. Each department is headed by a naval officer in the rank of captain who reports to the ship's commander. The departments are:\nGNK department - activates the detection and communication devices and creates a situational picture for the commander.\nWeapons department - operates and maintains the missile cannons.\nElectronics department - maintains the detection and communication devices and operates the electronic warfare means .\nMachine department - operates and maintains the engines and the electrical and hydraulic systems.\nAnti-submarine warfare - ships designed for anti-submarine warfare do not have a separate department. The means of detection are operated by the GNAK department and the means of armament are operated and maintained by the weapons department.\nHistory\nEstablishment\nOn October 1, 1966, the first command structure of the fleet was established: Squadron 311. In the order of establishment, its mission was defined:\nFighting with missiles and cannons .\nAnti- submarine warfare\nCherbourg Project\nThe Cherbourg Project (or Boats of Cherbourg) was an Israeli military operation that took place on 24 December 1969 and involved the escape of five remaining armed Sa'ar 3 class boats from the French port of Cherbourg (Cherbourg-Octeville since 2000, Cherbourg-en-Cotentin since 2016). The boats had been paid for by the Israeli government but had not been delivered due to the French arms embargo in 1969. The whole operation was planned by the Israeli Navy, and was codenamed Operation Noa, after the daughter of Captain Binyamin \"Bini\" Telem.\nThe boats taken from Cherbourg were still unarmed platforms on their arrival in Israel. They were brought into the navy and armed with Gabriel missiles and ECM and EW systems produced by MABAT and RAFAEL. Their commissioning into the Israeli Navy was overseen by Commodore Yehoshua Lahav Schneidemesser, a Haganah member who had volunteered with the Royal Navy during the Second World War, and who was at the time the division head of Equipment and Platforms.\nThe flotilla's working up was overseen by Captain Hadar Kimhi, who was later promoted to commodore commanding the Naval base of Haifa. New concepts of sea missile warfare were developed by the navy and new ECM/EW techniques were developed with the leadership of Captain Herut Zemach who was awarded the Israel Defense Prize for his efforts, creating a new generation of missile boats. Later, new Israeli Sa'ar boats were developed and built in Haifa Shipyards under the leadership of Haim Schachal, the chief engineer of the Israel Shipyards.\nTwo of the boats were launched a few months before the Yom Kippur War, INS Reshef (Flash) and INS Keshet (Bow), Sa'ar 4 class missile boats. For his leadership, Schachal was awarded the Israel Defense Prize.\nSeizure of militant v",
    "The Port of Tucson (POT) is a Dry port, or inland intermodal facility, located in Tucson, AZ.\nHistory\nBeginnings\nAlan Levin, the owner, founded the company in 1986, began purchasing property around the area of the current POT in the 1990s, and the port began operations in 2004.\nInternational Expansion\nIn April 2013, the port completed a $19 million dollar infrastructure investment to be able to ship and receive international intermodal containers. The expansion includes the installation of 20,000 feet of new rail purchased from Union Pacific. This will give the POT the ability to handle intermodal unit trains of 60-100 cars. This upgrade allows containers to be unloaded from a ship at the Port of LA or Port of Long Beach, shipped via train directly to the POT, and then unloaded for local or regional delivery. This direct rail service capability should reduce truck traffic on I-10 between LA and Tucson.\nOn May 31st 2013, at a press event featuring local business leaders and government officials, the first international container was delivered. It contained Chinese pottery that had passed through the Port of Long Beach.\nThe port also acts as a Foreign Trade Zone where international goods can pass through the port without being subject to taxes or tarrifs. This allows the port to facilitate the exportation of produce grown in Mexico that is then shipped to other countries. An example of this is Kabocha, a squash that is popular in Japan. The squash is grown in Mexico, is trucked into the US through the Nogales-Mariposa port of entry, loaded into international sized containers at the POT, and then sent by rail to a US port for shipping to Japan. The port expects a significant portion of the inbound traffic will come from the Port of Guaymas in Sonora, MX as it is aggressively expanding.\nIn September 2013, the port successfully shipped its first export for Azmira, a pet food company, with delivery to Japan. The ability to export directly was major gain for the company as they are now able to get empty containers from the POT and send shipments without having a driver make the trip to the Port of LA. Further, by moving from trucking to rail service the company is able to move from 40,000 pounds to 55,000 pounds per container.\nProduce Development\nIn 2015, the POT constructed additonal cold storage space to further enhance their on site food handling capabilities.\nService Improvements\nIn May of 2015, the port along with Union Pacific announced improvements made possible though a grant.\nAmazon Move-In\nIn 2018, Amazon announced that they would be building a new distribution facility on site at the POT, though speculation has swirled prior to the announcement. The facility opened in 2019.\nRolling Stock\nThe Port of Tucson maintains several EMD locomotives for switching the industries on site. \n",

    "State of the German Empire\nFree City of Riga (German: Riga Freie stadt, Latvian: R\u012bgas br\u012bvpils\u0113ta) is a city-state, which existed in modern times, one of the German state formations that arose in the medieval Baltic during the crisis of the Livonian Confederation at the end of the 16th century. The main governing body of the city during these years was the Riga City Hall. The city recognized itself as a vassalRzeczpospolita, but managed to avoid direct Polish-Lithuanian annexation for more than 20 years. On January 24 1582 it was annexed to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but for a long time after that, including in the Russian Empire, Riga retained special privileges, called  Riga landfogtia.\nHistory\nPanorama of the Free City of Riga (1581, painting by G. Braun and F. Hohenberg Civitates Orbis Terrarum)).\nAs a result of the Polish conquests, the Danish lands of the former Bishopric of Courland found themselves surrounded by Polish-Lithuanian possessions, which exerted significant military pressure on them. Livonian Order fell. Archbishopric of Riga, the center of which Riga was for many years, ceased to exist.\nLivonia, as it was before, could no longer exist.  One of the outcomes of the Livonian War was the emergence of new vassal states on the ruins of the former stronghold of German Catholics in the eastern Baltic. There were three of them - the Free City of Riga, Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and Duchy of Zadvina, also called Livonian.\nIt was a matter of time before Riga received the status of a free city. In the conflicts of medieval Livonia, the people of Riga rarely took sides, and were often guided solely by their own interests, thus being not a mediator in the conflicts between the Pope and the Livonian Order, but a third party with their own opinion. As a result of the Union of Vilna in 1561, the city-state of Riga appears on the map of Europe.\nIt cannot be said that it was an independent entity. The city recognized itself as a vassal of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and then of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The city of Riga did not agree with the terms of the Grodno union, as a result of which it was supposed to become part of the Duchy of Zadvina, and was looking for opportunities to strengthen its independence.\nOn July 7, 1567, the governor of the Duchy of Zadvina, Jan Chodkiewicz, tried to conquer the free city of Riga, but was defeated in a battle in which about 30 Lithuanians died.  Of the city's defenders, approximately 15 or 16 \"non-German\" soldiers were killed.\nAfter lengthy negotiations with the Polish king Stefan Batory in Drogichin, on January 14, 1581, the Treaty of Drogichin was signed between the city of Riga and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which retained certain privileges for Riga residents, which were later called \u201cCorpus Privilegiorum Stephanorum\u201d. To take the oath of allegiance to Riga, King Stefan Batory arrived at Riga Castle on March 12, 1582. The agreement was signed on April 7.\nIn the early 1580s, Lutheranism was finally established in the city.  Therefore, the subordination of the city to Catholic Poland in 1582 caused the long Calendar unrest of 1583\u20131589, when the Riga Rath, by order of the Polish king, tried to introduce a new Gregorian calendar, proposed by the Pope Gregory XIII.\nReligion\nThree Brothers (Riga), painting by Siegfried Bilenstein. In the background you can see Dome Cathedral.\nIn the 1520s, the Bible was partially translated into Latvian. In 1539 Riga became part of the Protestant cities. \nEven during the time of the Archbishopric of Riga, many Catholic churches were given to the Lutherans. Riga, which was home to many people from those regions of Germany where Protestant ideas had a special development, became one of the first cities in Europe where Protestantism became the most popular religion among the townspeople. During the existence of the Free City, Protestantism increasingly replaced Catholicism.\nIn the 16th century, Calvinist communities also emerged in Latvia.\nTerritory and management\nThe free city of Riga, governed by the German-speaking Riga Town Hall, skillfully maneuvering between the interests of rival states, remained a German enclavein the Polish-Lithuanian state. The city was able to keep under its control the Riga Patrimonial District with a total area of \u200b\u200babout 750\u00a0km2, which was somewhat smaller than the pre-war landfogtia with an area of \u200b\u200babout 1000\u00a0km2. The Free City continued to mint its own coin.  On the coins there was an image of the city's coat of arms and an inscription that confirmed its belonging to the city of Riga (\u201cCIVITATIS RIGENSIS\u201d). The Riga silver dealer (Thaler) held 4.5 Riga silver marks or 18 silver ferdings.  In turn, one ferding contained 9 silver shillings of lower quality or 27 pfennigs.\nMoney of the Free City of Riga\nDuring this period, Riga minted its own money with the image of the city's coat of arms and an inscription that confirmed its belonging to the city of Riga (\"CIVITATIS RI",
    "\nOn October 7, 2023, Ariel Cunio and his girlfriend Arbel Yehud were taken hostage from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas terrorists during a large-scale attack in southern Israel. Ariel, the youngest of four Cunio brothers, and Arbel were captured alongside several family members, including Ariel's brother David, his wife Sharon, and their three-year-old twins.\nEarly Life and Personal Background\nAriel Cunio was born and raised at Kibbutz Nir Oz. He served in a key role in the IDF, earning the admiration of his soldiers for his quiet charisma and leadership. After completing his army service, Ariel and Arbel traveled to South America and Central America. Upon returning to Israel, Ariel enrolled as a computer science major and started working in the hi-tech sector. Ariel also worked as a lifeguard at the Kibbutz pool and had a passion for drawing during his youth.\nOctober 7, 2023 Abduction\nOn the morning of October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Kibbutz Nir Oz. Ariel and Arbel were captured from their home, having recently returned from their trip abroad and adopted a puppy weeks earlier. Ariel managed to send a message to his brother, Eitan, saying, \"We are in a horror film.\" Ariel, Arbel, and several family members were taken captive and transported to Gaza.\nFamily Impact and Appeal\nAriel's grandmother, Ester Cunio, who narrowly avoided abduction by starting a conversation with the terrorists about football star Lionel Messi, is now calling on Messi to help secure the release of her grandsons and other hostages. Six family members, including three children and their mothers, were released in November 2023, but Ariel and David remain captive.\nYehi Yahud, father of Dolev and Arbel Yehud, expressed deep concerns for both his children. Dolev, who has Hashimoto's thyroiditis, does not have his necessary medication, putting his health in severe danger. Arbel's fate is equally worrying, given the potential for mental, physical, or sexual abuse.\nAriel's mother, Silvia Cunio, shared her anguish over the separation of her family. Ariel and Arbel had been together for five years, and their relationship is significant to both families. Ariel's older brother, David, was kidnapped along with his wife, Sharon, and their daughters, Emma and Yuli. The girls frequently ask about their father's return, highlighting the ongoing emotional toll on the family.\n",

For most of World War II, he ran an echelon out of the War Department called the Military Intelligence Service, which was integral for the Allied effort in winning the war against the Axis powers. He is a co-founder of \"The Pond,\" intelligence agency, and also worked closely with the British in London around the time of the development of M.A.G.I.C., where he met Sir John Dill. He was a lifelong diplomat, representing the interests of the USA abroad. After the war, he returned to attache duties, and also went to work for the Philips company. He spent much of his life dedicated to building Christian bible study groups and organizations.\nHe died 1975 in England.\nEarly life\nKroner was born 1891 in the town of Winterville, Georgia, to parents Mr. and Mrs. FH Kroner. He lived in Atlanta for some time, and attended Georgia Tech, obtaining a degree in civil engineering.\nIn 1912, Kroner was Commissioned as a Lieutenant into the United States Army under the authority of President Taft. He was immediately stationed at the Presidio in San Francisco. Briefly in 1914, and again in 1915, Kroner was deployed to El Paso, Texas to participate in the Mexican Border War, returning to the Presidio at the end of each deployment.\nOn 6 July 1915, Kroner was ordered to Tientsin, China, with the 15th Infantry Regiment, to serve in his first appointment as a Military Attache. In Tientsin, he met an Englishwoman (born in China to English parents) named Hilda Way. They were married in September 1916, in Tientsin.\nOn 3 December 1919, shortly after returning from China, Kroner had been appointed the XO of Camp Funston. His home at the camp burned down, and his wife, baby son, and maid barely escaped with their lives. Every single possession the couple owned was lost in the flames; family photographs, wedding presents, letters from friends, and especially many items they had brought with them from Tientzen. While they were being located new accommodations, they stayed with the family of Colonel William H. Tobin. They traveled briefly to Fort Riley where they stayed with Colonel Ralph M. Parker. They spent Christmas in the home of Colonel George Pullen Peed.\nIn May 1927, while Kroner was again stationed at the Presidio in San Francisco, he addressed the Association of the United States Army at the Los Angeles City Club about his experiences in China:\n\"China may be described now as just emerging from the night into the dawn of understanding. Her people through the influence of Europe and America are becoming enlightened to the extent that they are reaching the place where they can think for themselves. By witnessing the World War from a distance they have learned about the successful use of armed forces. They are now employing the same means to meet their own situation... China's most serious menace at present is the Soviet propaganda which is being spread broadcast by agents from Moscow... Russia, seeing the importance of getting a foothold in China, has spared no efforts in spreading dissention among the battling groups.\"\n\u2014\u200aSpeech to the AUSA of Los Angeles, Major Hayes A.

His responsibilities there involved coordinating American efforts in Britain with the British Chiefs of Staff, and \"had made the highest contacts short of Prime Minister Churchill.\" Kroner at this time visited Bletchley Park to observe the codebreaking efforts of Alan Turing and his staff, in an attempt to gain for America intelligences from the British unit there.\nIn early June 1941, Kroner returned from England was advanced to the general department staff for the War Department to be the Chief of the British Empire Section for the G-2.

After paying to join the party, he received an email stating that the party was short of candidates for the 2024 general election, and so McMurdock chose to be a \"paper candidate\" in the election.

She is best known for her work in Nubeluz, joining the show in 1993 as a presenter, receiving the nickname Dalina dulce.\nEarly life\nXibill\u00e9 was born in Medell\u00edn in 1971 to Jaime Xibill\u00e9, the son of Spanish immigrants, and Blanca Aristiz\u00e1bal.

She then studied ballet and theatre. At the age of seventeen, she was the winner of the Chica Palmolive modelling contest in 1990. She performed for the first time in the children's shows Blue Jeans and Imag\u00ednate\u00a0, by Producciones PUNCH. A year later, in 1991, she was chosen as the host of a children's program called Todo el mundo est\u00e1 feliz\u00a0, a Colombian version of Xou da Xuxa.\nHer participation in the aforementioned show caused the producers of PANTEL to cast her as a nubelina, a presenter of the local Nubeluz segment.

    "\nTransport ecology is the science of the human-transport-environment system. There are two chairs of transport ecology in Germany, in Dresden and Karlsruhe.\nVocabulary\nMobility is about satisfying the need to travel. To achieve mobility, means of transport are needed. Mobility corresponds to the human need to travel - recognised by article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - while transport is a means of achieving mobility.\nIn public debate, mobility is often confused with transport. The \"Dresden Declaration\" calls for people's mobility needs to be met in a cost-effective and environmental-friendly way\u00a0\u00b7 .\nSuggested measures\nThen the proposed measures (whether they involve transport modes, the concept of \"traffic avoidance, change of transport mode, technical improvements\", the tautology of transport ecology or the \"4 E\", i.e. Enforcement, Education, Engineering, Economy/Encouragement) are scrutinised for transparency, fairness (polluters pay), unwanted side-effects and the application of the measure (\"are there other examples of application elsewhere? \").\nTraffic avoidance, modal shift and finally technical improvements\nThe concept of \u00ab\u00a0traffic avoidance, modal shift and technical improvements \u00a0\u00bb involves firstly reducing the volume of transport, then promoting intermodality and finally making technical improvements to vehicles and making the energy they consume sustainable.\nThis means in fact implementing the Kaya identity applied to transport (see below).\nEnforcement, Education, Engineering, Economy/Encouragement\nThese methods are also known as \"4E\". Enforcement refers to measures of order, whether obligations or prohibitions. Education refers to training, communication. Engineering is of a purely technical nature, whereas Economy/Encouragement re incentive systems, which may well be financial.\nTautology of transport ecology\nAs long as pollution is proportional to the distance travelled, Udo Becker defines tautology of transport ecology (in German \u00ab\u00a0verkehrs\u00f6kologische Tautologie\u00a0\u00bb) as follows\u00a0:\nwith \u00a0:\n\u00a0: pollution\u00a0;\n\u00a0: Transportation demand (in passenger-km)\u00a0;\n\u00a0: vehicle trafic (in vehicle-km)\u00a0:\n\u00a0: inverse of vehicle occupancy (in vehicle-km per passenger-km) \u00a0;\n is pollution per vehicle-km.\nDemand can be decomposed according to:\nwith \u00a0:\n\u00a0: population\u00a0;\n\u00a0:  number of journeys per person;\n\u00a0:  mean distance of a journey.\nPollution can therefore be expressed as the sum of pollution according to the modes of transport\u00a0:\nwith \u00a0:\n\u00a0: Modal shift (dimensionless quantity)\u00a0;\n\u00a0: inverse of occupancy according to the mode of transport (in vehicle-km per passenger-km) \u00a0;\n is the pollution per vehicle-km according to the mode of transport.\nKaya identity applied to transport\nThe general formulation takes on a more specific form when it comes to decarbonising transport, following Kaya identity.\nPollution being identified to CO2  is replaced by \nwith\u00a0:\n\u00a0: inverse of efficiency according to the mode of transport (for instance in kWh/100\u00a0km per vehicle)\u00a0;\n\u00a0:  carbon intensity of the energy acoording to the mode of transport  (for instance  in g CO2 eq./kWh).\nCO2 emissions can be decomposed according:\n",
    "Unincorporated community in Texas, United States\nDexter is an unincorporated community in Cooke County, Texas, United States. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 18 in 2000. It is located within the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.\nHistory\nThe earliest settlers, Jesse Morris, S. E. and Dick Collum, and Bill Munday, arrived in the town around 1870. Three miles east of the chosen site, Sugar Hill was the initial townsite option selected due to its natural spring, which provided a resting place for travelers. Morris is credited with coming up with the concept to name the town after a well-known racehorse from that era who would race at Dexter Park in Chicago. Dexter had its own post office by 1873, and by the early 1880s, at least 37 establishments, including four blacksmith shops, three hotels, two steam gristmills and cotton gins, and four doctors, catered to the town of 300 residents. When citizens of Cooke County believed the Denison and Pacific Railway would travel through their town, Dexter was projected to surpass Gainesville as the largest town. However, when the rail line ran through Woodbine, Dexter started to lose ground to Gainesville. A large number of residents and companies relocated, primarily to Ardmore, Indian Territory. Dexter voters voted 30 to 18 to incorporate on February 28, 1885. The population was still steadily declining even after this incorporation, even though the municipal government continued to exist until roughly 1900. In the vicinity, there were 70 residents between the late 1960s and 1987. As of 1988, the Dexter Community Church was the only establishment still standing in Dexter. The population was 18 in 2000.\nOn September 8, 1986, an Amoco gas condensate pipeline failed under the Red River near Dexter. Fumes from the leaking pipeline sent 14 people to hospitals for treatment.\nThe Washington House on Sycamore Creek Ranch in the community was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nGeography\nDexter is located on Farm to Market Road 678 near the Red River, 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) northeast of Gainesville, 8.7\u00a0mi (14.0\u00a0km) east-northeast of Callisburg, and 11.5\u00a0mi (18.5\u00a0km) west-northwest of Whitesboro in extreme northeastern Cooke County.\nEducation\nDexter had its own school in the early 1880s. Today, Dexter is served by the Whitesboro Independent School District.\nNotable people\nWilliam H.

    "Coastal defence ship of the French Navy\nTaureau was the first ironclad coastal defence ship  (garde-c\u00f4tes cuirass\u00e9) built for the French Navy (Marine Nationale). Launched in 1865, the vessel was a one-off design that had a primary armament of a single 11-ton bronze ram complemented by a single 240\u00a0mm (9.4\u00a0in) gun. She was variously known as an armoured ram, steam ram and screw-powered turret ship for the defence of roadsteads (batterie \u00e0 h\u00e9lice et \u00e0 tour pour la defense des rades). Despite having a high speed of 12.58 knots (23.3\u00a0km/h; 14.5\u00a0mph) and high manoeuvrability due to having a large rudder and two propeller shafts that enabled her to turn within her own length, the ship spent most of her career in reserve. The vessel was temporarily commissioned on 20 July 1870, ready to be deployed in the English Channel during the Franco-Prussian War, but saw no action. Taureau was removed from the fleet list in 1890 and was sold to be broken up in 1891.\nDesign and development\nTaureau\nTaureau was the first coastal defence ship to serve with the French Navy (Marine Nationale). The ship was designed as a small manoeuvrable strike weapon to engage with the larger ships of the British Royal Navy. As a pioneer for the type, the vessel was known by a number of names during her career.  Initially, she was ordered as a screw-powered turret ship for the defence of roadsteads (batterie \u00e0 h\u00e9lice et \u00e0 tour pour la defense des rades), but this was changed to Special project (B\u00e2timent sp\u00e9cial) in the January 1864 fleet list due to the unique nature of her design. As her launch date approached, she was given the same classification as monitors, coastal guard ship (garde-c\u00f4tes cuirass\u00e9) in January 1865. A year later, she was named the sole first class coastal guard ship (garde-c\u00f4tes cuirass\u00e9 de 1er classe), although this was reverted to simply coastal guard ship two years later. The vessel was also known as an armoured, ironclad or steam ram.\nDesigned by Henri Dupuy de L\u00f4me, Taureau was ordered by the Ministry of the Navy (Minist\u00e8re de la Marine) Prosper de Chasseloup-Laubat on 5 September 1863 and the design approved four days later. The ship was constructed as an armoured tower sitting on an armoured raft with a deck that sat about 0.7\u00a0m (2\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in) above the waterline. The vessel displaced 2,718 long tons (3,044 short tons; 2,762\u00a0t) and had an overall length of 64\u00a0m (210\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in), 59.97\u00a0m (196\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) at the waterline and 59.92\u00a0m (196\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) between perpendiculars, a beam of 14.5\u00a0m (47\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) and a mean draught of 5.356\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft 6.9\u00a0in).\nThe ship was powered by two horizontal simple-expansion steam engines with cylinders that were 1.2\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) in diameter and had a stroke of 0.648\u00a0m (2\u00a0ft 1.5\u00a0in). Fed from eight boilers, the engine was rated at 1,920 indicated horsepower (1,430\u00a0kW) at 82 rpm and drove two propeller shafts. While undertaking sea trials, Taureau reached a speed of 12.58 knots (23.3\u00a0km/h; 14.5\u00a0mph) from 1,796\u00a0ihp (1,339\u00a0kW), a high speed for the time. The warship carried 171 tonnes (168 long tons; 188 short tons) of coal to give a range of 1,260 nautical miles (2,330\u00a0km; 1,450\u00a0mi) at a speed of 10 knots (19\u00a0km/h; 12\u00a0mph). The ship's complement numbered 150 sailors of all ranks.\nTaureau had an armament built around a bronze ram that weighed 11 long tons (12 short tons; 11\u00a0t) and was mounted to the bow. It projected 3.2\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) ahead of the overall length and had its tip 2.5\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) below the waterline. As designed, the vessel was to also have a fixed forward-facing turret with two 240\u00a0mm (9.4\u00a0in) Mod\u00e8le 1864 rifled breech-loading guns that were to be used to clear the way for the ram to strike. This was changed to a single rotating open turret mounting a single 240\u00a0mm M1864 gun that was mounted within a wooden barbette and fired over the top of the tower.\nThe ship had a waterline armour belt that was 150\u00a0mm (6\u00a0in) thick, 1.85\u00a0mm (0\u00a0in) high above the waterline and 0.35\u00a0m (1\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) below. The turret was had 120\u00a0mm (5\u00a0in) thick armour. The main deck was protected by 50-millimetre (2\u00a0in) iron plates on 120-millimetre (5\u00a0in) of wood. All the armour was iron. The curved sides of a metal shell rose above the armoured hull as a wall to protect from boarding. This was complemented by the shape of the dome covering the deck, which was designed to be impossible to walk on. The subsequent B\u00e9lier class were similar, but could be distinguished by their two funnels.\nConstruction and career\nNamed on 3 October 1863, Taureau was laid down on 5 October by Dyd and Indret at Toulon and launched on 10 June 1865. The ship was commissioned on 19 August 1865 and completed the following August. In coastal waters, Taureau proved to be highly manoeuvrable, able to turn in place by driving one shaft forward and the other in reverse. This was enhanced by the large rudder, short length and shallow draft. However, the vessel performed less well at sea and rolled badly.\nAfter joining the navy, Taureau was initially dep",

    "2010 Canadian film\nFile 13 (French: Fili\u00e8re 13) is a Canadian crime comedy film, directed by Patrick Huard and released in 2010. The film centres on Thomas (Claude Legault), Beno\u00eet (Paul Doucet) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois (Guillaume Lemay-Thivierge), three bumbling police officers who unexpectedly stumble into an opportunity to try to capture Fecteau (Jean-Pierre Bergeron), a high-ranking figure in the sponsorship scandal who has managed to elude arrest for several years.\nThe supporting cast includes \u00c9lisabeth Locas, Marie Turgeon, Anik Jean, Andr\u00e9 Sauv\u00e9, Sharlene Royer, Laurent Paquin, Carmen Ferlan, Monique Spaziani, Luc Senay, Jean Petitclerc, Annick L\u00e9ger, Widemir Normil, Daniel Boucher and Emmanuel Auger.\nProduction\nThe film was made by the same production team, and featured the same three primary stars, as The 3 L'il Pigs (Les 3 p'tits cochons), but was not a sequel.\nIt was originally slated to be directed by Louis Choquette, under the title Operation Tablet, with Huard coming in as director after Choquette dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Choquette had cast Legault as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois and Lemay-Thivierge as Thomas, with Huard choosing to swap their roles as he felt they fit the actors better.\nIt went into production in Montreal in fall 2009.\nRelease\nThe film had been slated to premiere on August 6, 2010, with its premiere advanced to August 4 at the last minute.\nAlthough the film was commercially successful, surpassing the $1 million benchmark for commercial success in the Quebec market within 10 days of its release, it was poorly received by critics, who virtually all compared it directly to The 3 L'il Pigs and asserted that it had failed to capture the same qualities that made the earlier film successful. It has not been publicly stated whether the critical failure of File 13 was a factor in Huard not returning as director of The 3 L'il Pigs 2 in 2016.\nAwards\nSimon Poudrette, Christian Rivest and Dominique Delguste received a Jutra Award nomination for Best Sound at the 13th Jutra Awards in 2011.\n",

    "2011 live album by Evan Parker, Okkyung Lee, and Peter Evans\nThe Bleeding Edge is a live album by saxophonist Evan Parker, cellist Okkyung Lee, and trumpeter Peter Evans, three musicians from different continents, playing instruments of different families (woodwind, string, brass). Featuring five improvised duos and six trios, it was recorded on May 4, 2010, at St. Peter's Church in Whitstable, England, and was released on CD in 2011 by Psi Records.\nReception\nIn a review for Musicworks, Stuart Broomer wrote: \"these aren\u2019t simply virtuosos improvising, they're virtuoso improvisers, their skills specifically focused on the mutual creation of spontaneous music. There is everywhere here an alertness to the instant, to the new inference, but what makes it special is the individual and collective ability to knit this music together in extended units, initiating content as a matter of form, part of a continuum that will still be working itself out a few minutes and a thousand notes later.\"\nRegarding the opening trio, John Eyles of All About Jazz stated: \"It goes without saying that each of the players is a first-rate improviser, very experienced and adept at playing in such circumstances. None of them is used to taking a back seat and, rather than them competing for the limelight, they are all the focus of attention constantly. Their experience shows in the ways in which they react to each other and subtly adapt their playing to accommodate the other two.\"\nThe editors of The New York City Jazz Record included the album in their \"Best of 2012\" feature, and reviewer Ken Waxman commented: \"The Bleeding Edge confirms that there's no generation gap among creative stylists... With each sequence blended into a sound mosaic, the edges here may be bleeding, but with minimum bloodiness and maximum improvisational circulation.\"\nThe Free Jazz Collective's Daniel Sorrells called the album \"a display of musical minds and talents stripped of contextual baggage... challenging, sophisticated music that will reward anyone who opens themselves to it.\" He remarked: \"It's uncommon to find a recording in which the individual strengths of each player are so constantly apparent, yet also so difficult to unravel from one another... The Bleeding Edge is an album to sit with.

    "\nCarrozzeria Ernesto Pavesi (short: Pavesi) was a coachbuilding company from Milan, Italy, that produced armored vehicles and also carried out further body conversions on customer request. Since the 1960s, Pavesi has produced a series of special bodies for the Maserati and De Tomaso brands belonging to Alejandro de Tomaso's group of companies.\nHistory\nDeTomaso Pantera fitted with a targa roof by Pavesi\nThe company was founded in Milan in 1929. Pavesi initially manufactured bodies for commercial vehicles and hearses. After Ernesto Pavesi's son Gianpaolo joined the company management, the business expanded its activities to include the manufacture of luxury bodies for passenger cars. Before the Second World War, Pavesi bodied chassis for Alfa Romeo, Isotta Fraschini and Lancia; it also produced some bodies for Bugatti chassis.\nAfter the war, Pavesi refined Rolls-Royce and Ferrari vehicles for customers. In the 1960s, Pavesi developed conversions for production vehicles, which in turn were produced in small series. These include station wagon versions of the Alfa Romeo 1750. During this time, Pavesi became a specialist in targa roofs. Pavesi produced Targa versions of the Iso Grifo, the Fiat Dino and the De Tomaso Pantera.\nAnother field of activity was the manufacture of armored cars for the Italian police and other government agencies \u2013 some Italian presidents drove vehicles that Pavesi had armoured \u2013 but also wealthy private customers. Pavesi worked for De Tomaso on a factory contract basis in the 1970s and 1980s. At the start of the 21st century, bodywork construction declined significantly. The company was recently involved in the restoration of vintage cars. It ceased operations in 2012.\nConversions by Pavesi\nDeTomaso Longchamp converted to a spyder by PavesiIn the late 1960s, Pavesi produced a Targa version of the Maserati Ghibli. The vehicle remained a one-off.\nFrom 1981, Pavesi produced the Spyder version of the De Tomaso Longchamp on behalf of de Tomaso. Pavesi received the complete coup\u00e9 bodies from Embo, removed the roof and installed a fabric top. 14 factory convertibles were created this way; in addition, Pavesi also converted a number of older Longchamp coup\u00e9s into convertibles at the customer's request. In addition to the Longchamp Spyders, there are also one or two convertibles based on the Maserati Kyalami, which is essentially identical to the Longchamp. There is much to suggest that Pavesi also carried out these conversions.\nPavesi also converted four De Tomaso Panteras of the second series into Targa coupes on behalf of the factory. In addition, numerous older Panteras were converted accordingly at the customer's request.\nThree or four Maserati Quattroporte IIIs were converted into two-door sedans by Pavesi.\nPavesi also armored a large number of De Tomaso Deauville and Maserati Quattroporte limousines. Some of these vehicles were used by Italian politicians. Sandro Pertini, for example, preferred an armored Deauville.\nLiterature\nAlessandro Sannia: Enciclopedia dei carrozzieri italiani, Societ\u00e0 Editrice Il Cammello, Torino, 2017, ISBN 978-8896796412\n",
    "German dancer, choreographer and composer (1909-1993)\nErnest Berk (12 October 1909 \u2013 30 September 1993) was a dancer, modern dance choreographer and composer of electronic music. He left Nazi Germany in 1934 to live and work for most of his career in the UK, returning to Berlin in the 1980s.\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Koln, Berk received his musical education from the Rheinische Musikschule, and was taught dance by Mary Wigman and the Brazilian dancer Chinita Ullmann. While in Germany he ran his own dance company and produced a ballet for Max Reinhardt at the Salzburg Festival. Escaping Nazi Germany with his wife Lotte in 1934 after they were banned from performing, he settled in the UK.\nDancer and choreographer\nFrom 1935 Berk produced ballets for the Glyndebourne Festivals, for Covent Garden and for the West End theatre. During this period he founded the Modern Dance Group in London and produced Buddha the Enlightened, a ballet commissioned by the poet John Masefield. With composer (and fellow \u00e9migr\u00e9) Peter Ury (1920\u20131976) he collaborated on several ballets, including The Family Suite. Sakuntala, a ballet in Indian style, was staged at the Adelphi Theatre in April 1946, set to classical Indian music chosen by V. K. Narayana Menon.\nIn 1947 Berk was choreographer for the Edinburgh International Festival, its first year. With Nesta Brooking (1906\u20132006, owner of the Brooking School of Dance) he created the Dance Theatre company, whose ballet Trilustrum (1947) combined elements of the ballet with modern dance and won a special award at the Choreographic Competition in Copenhagen.\nComposer\nHe became interested in electronic music, producing musique concr\u00e8te from a home studio he established in Camden in 1955. His first piece for magnetic tape was End of the World (1957), one of the first electronic works composed in England. His music was often used to accompany his own expressionist dance works, but he soon also began producing electronic soundtracks for theatre, television (such as the 1963 BBC drama A Little Bit Of Gold Said Jump) and film.\nIn 1968 his work was presented at two pioneering London electronic music concerts - at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on 15 January 1968, and later at the Planetarium - alongside the music of other early electronic music contemporaries in the UK, such as Peter Zinovieff, Brian Dennis, Hugh Davies, Delia Derbyshire, Tristram Cary, Daphne Oram and George Newson. In 1970 he established a new studio at 52 Dorset Street, London W1.\nOver 200 electronic pieces emerged between 1957 and 1984. Two ballet soundtracks (Initiation and Gemini) were issued on a private record in 1970 and later commercially released by Trunk Records in 2019. Huddersfield Contemporary Records issued a double CD of his music, Diversed Tapes, in 2024.\nInfluences\nAs well as dancing and choreography Berk was skilled as a mime artist and percussionist. Berk's choreography was influenced by the Dresden expressionist school, and the subject matter of his ballets were shaped by his left wing politics. His music shows his awareness of the folk traditions of India and China. Berk amassed a large collection of folk percussion instruments from those continents. There were collaborations with other experimental artists, such as pianist John Tilbury, composer Basil Kirchin, visual artist John Latham, and filmmaker David Gladwell.\nLater life and return to Germany\nIn 1933 Berk married the dancer Liselotte Heymansohn (Lotte Berk), with whom he often collaborated, and there was a daughter, Esther. They separated in the 1960s, and Lotte Berk went on to develop methods of exercise that attracted celebrity interest from Britt Ekland, Barbra Streisand and Joan Collins. In 1970 Berk married a second time, this time to another dancer, Alisa Park, nearly 40 years his junior. \nTogether they formed the Dance Theatre Commune and taught at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and at the Stanhope Institute for adult education.\nReturning to Germany in the mid-1980s, Berk taught music therapy and improvisation in Berlin at Hochschule der K\u00fcnste. Much of his archive - gifted to the Historisches Archiv der Stadt K\u00f6ln - was destroyed in 2009 after a building collapse.\n",

The disruption to the transport infrastructure also has an impact on transit traffic with the interruption of the A13 motorway and on tourism in parts of the Swiss Alps.\nFloods from 1 June\nSee also: 2024 Germany floods\nIn early June, there was heavy rainfall, especially in southern Germany, but also in neighboring regions, which caused flooding in numerous regions. Rivers such as the Rhine and the Reuss caused local flooding, the water level in Lake Constance rose; danger levels 4 and 5 (high and very high danger) were reached, respectively, before being lowered to level 3. The danger on Lake Constance remained elevated until the end of June. The ground was still wet in many places; there was a lot of fresh snow in the high mountains.\nHeavy rainfall, especially on Saturday, 1 June and Monday, 3 June, caused rivers and lakes to rise; there was a flood alert on the Sitter and Goldach in eastern Switzerland, danger level 3 (significant danger) was in effect on Lake Constance and the Upper Rhine, and danger level 4 (high danger) on Lake Constance on 4 June. the Untersee in Berlingen and the Rhine in Bad Zurzach overflowed their banks. Lake Lauerz in the canton of Schwyz overflowed its banks and the flooding of the Reuss caused flooding on the Maschwander Allmend in the cantons of Zug and Zurich. In the cantons of Zurich (450 operations), Thurgau (150 operations) and St. Gallen (90 operations), fire brigades were called out over the weekend because of water in buildings and flooded streets. Apart from the flooding, there were various landslides. In St. Gallen, the CSIO Nations Cup was cancelled on Friday. Compared to Bavaria, however, the whole thing went relatively smoothly, although heavier rainfall had been forecast beforehand.\nHeavy rainfall on 9 and 10 June caused water levels to rise and local flooding throughout western and northern Switzerland. In addition to Lake Constance, there is also flooding on Lake Zurich and Lake Lucerne and their outflows. On 11 June, a flood warning of danger level 5 was issued for the Untersee, making it the highest of all danger levels (very high danger). On 13 June, the flood levels at Upper Lake and Lower Lake of Lake Constance were each at level 4; after a temporary easing, the water levels rose again during the storm on 21 June 2024.\n21 and 22 June\nAround 20 June, there was another weather situation with a low pressure area and a strong southerly flow, which brought moist air masses into the Alpine region.

In the Grisons mountain valley of Valle Mesolcina, 125\u00a0mm of rain fell within 24 hours.\nThe unstable weather situation prevailed for several days; on the evening before 25 June, a heat thunderstorm brought large amounts of rain, especially in the canton of Vaud (117\u00a0mm in 3 hours in L'Auberson) and in the canton of Basel-Landschaft (53\u00a0mm in 3 hours in Liestal).\nRhine region\nThe flooding of the Rhine caused the water level of Lake Constance to rise again, as it had at the end of May 2024, so that the Swiss authorities declared danger level 4 for the lake shores and the Upper Rhine. All people were asked to stay away from the lake and river banks for their safety. Until Monday, 24 June, the water in Lake Constance continued to rise; at the Berlingen gauge on the Untersee, the water level was measured at 396.95 m above sea level (normal monthly average: 396.07 m above sea level).\nValais\nIn Valais, so much water flowed from the mountain torrents into the Rh\u00f4ne that it reached its highest levels near Sion and in the Lower Valais; at the Fully gauge station, a discharge of 819 m3/s was measured on 22 June 2024, which corresponds to a once-in-a-century event. In the Chablais above Lake Geneva, the discharge of the Rh\u00f4ne temporarily reached 1200 m3/s, according to information from the cantonal management staff of the canton of Vaud. At the mouth of the Rh\u00f4ne in Lake Geneva, large masses of driftwood collected on a floating barrier. In Chippis, more than 200 residents had to leave their houses in the vicinity of the river. The Nufenen Pass was temporarily closed on 21 June as a result of a landslide.\nIn Mattertal, the level of the Mattervispa rose so much that the stream flooded streets near the banks in Zermatt and the ground floors of several buildings. The Triftbach, which flows into the Mattervispa in the center of Zermatt, also overflowed its banks. Landslides interrupted the route of the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn between Visp and T\u00e4sch and also the cantonal road in the Mattertal, so that Zermatt was cut off from the outside world.

    "Prevention of autosomal recessive disorders is focused on making it less likely that two carriers for the same hereditary disease will have children together.\nBackground\nAutosomal recessive pattern, showing how two unaffected carriers can have a child with the disease.\nSome genetic disorders are caused by having two \"bad\" copies of a recessive allele. When the gene is located on an autosome (as opposed to a sex chromosome), it is possible for both men and women to be carriers. A child of two carriers has a 1/4 chance of being affected by the disorder.\nDue to carriers being unaffected (or barely affected), the bad recessive alleles can persist in the gene pool for quite a while, even if the disorder is 100% lethal.\nOutbreeding\nMost modern societies have laws regarding incest, with avoiding the genetic disorders caused by inbreeding as one of the major motivations.\nBoth social acceptance and legality of first-cousin marriage is mixed. Some jurisdictions narrowly tailor their laws to preventing inbreeding: in Maine, first cousins can marry with proof of genetic counseling, while in Arizona and several other states, first cousins can marry if they are old or infertile.\nCarrier testing\nCarrier testing can help guide the decisions of couples who are at high risk, e.g.:\nBoth of Jewish descent \u2013 Several disorders including Tay\u2013Sachs disease. The organization Dor Yeshorim offers testing in many countries.\nBoth Cypriot \u2013 Thalassemia. Testing is fully subsidized and mandated in both jurisdictions on Cyprus.\nBoth Maldivian \u2013 Thalassemia. Testing is fully subsidized and mandated in the Maldives.\nBoth from affected parts of Africa \u2013 Sickle-cell disease. Carrier testing is not widely available in many African countries and disease burden remains high.\nCouples who learn that they are both carriers may decide to part ways, adopt, or use preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select unaffected embryos.\nRelation to eugenics\nWhen a population is in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium, the proportions of each genotype are directly determined by allele frequencies as shown in this chart. Mate choice is one of the ways to move a population out of equilibrium, allowing genotype frequency to change even if the underlying allele frequencies remain constant.\nThese practices are not designed to change allele frequencies and have little impact on future generations beyond the first. As a result, these practices are generally not considered to be a form of eugenics despite overlapping goals.\nSee also\nDisability-selective abortion \u2013 controversial alternative to prevention\n",

    "Species of flowering plant\nEriophorum virginicum, the tawny cottongrass, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. It is native to eastern North America but was introduced in British Columbia in western Canada. It is most common in eastern Canada, New England, and the Great Lakes region. It is the only species of Eriophorum in North America that occurs in the southeastern United States, where it is uncommon. Despite its name, it is a sedge, not a grass, and it is sometimes called tawny cottonsedge to emphasize this fact.\nDescription\nEriophorum virginicum is a perennial herbaceous plant that spreads by means of underground rhizomes.\nTaxonomy\nEriophorum virginicum was first described by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Evidently Linnaeus based his diagnosis on a specimen collected in Virginia, hence the specific epithet virginicum and the common name Virginia cottongrass.\nDistribution and habitat\nEriophorum virginicum is native to eastern North America, from Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada to South Carolina in the United States (U.S.), ranging as far west as Minnesota. It was introduced in British Columbia in western Canada. In the U.S., it is most common in New England and the Great Lakes region. It is the only species of Eriophorum in North America that occurs in the southeastern U.S., where it is least common.\nEriophorum virginicum is an obligate wetland (OBL) species. In New England, it prefers bogs, acidic fens, and wet meadows.\nEcology\nEriophorum virginicum flowers in the early summer. After the flowers are pollinated, cotton-like fruiting heads develop during mid-summer and early autumn. In Minnesota, fruiting occurs from July to September.\nGrowth stages\nWith flower buds, observed in Strafford, Vermont on July\u00a02\nWith flowering head (inflorescence), observed in Franklin County, Massachusetts on July\u00a08\nWith fruiting head (infructescence), observed in Jackson County, Wisconsin on August\u00a017\nWith persistent plant parts, observed in Benson, Vermont on June\u00a027\n",

    "Jewish archeological site in Israel\nUmm el-Umdan (Arabic for 'Mother of Pillars') or Khirbet Umm el-Umdan (khirbet = ruins of) is a  Jewish archeological site within the municipal boundaries of the Israeli city of  Modi'in, between the city of Modi'in and Latrun. Archeological excavations at the site discovered the remains of a Jewish village. The findings show that he place was inhabited during the Persian, Hellenistic, Roman,  Byzantine, and Early Muslim periods. The village was destroyed during the Bar Kokhba revolt.\nEtymology\nThe Arab name of the site derives from the coloumns and column remains scattered in the area, Umm el-Umdan = Mother of columns. The pillars were visible at the site when  Clermont-Ganneau first visited the place in 1874\u201375.\nArcheological findings\nThe excavations conducted at the site since 2001 revealed mainly the remains of a Second Temple period Jewish village. The village was established in the 4th or 3rd century BC and continued up to the Bar Kokhba revolt, The archeological findings include narrow streets, remains of buildings, ritual baths, rock-cut tombs and a synagogue. After the Bar Kokhba revolts the top part of the site reveals evidence of terraces, winepresses and burial caves from the late Roman and Byzantine periods. The lower part of the site was used as a burial area in the late Muslim period.\nSynagogue\nThe Umm el-Umdan synagogue is the oldest one within modern Israel that has been found to date. It was first built during the Hasmonean period and stood between the end of the 2nd and the late 1st century BCE, when it was rebuilt during the Herodian period. The synagogue of the late Roman period was destroyed in the Bar Kokhba revolt.\nThe Umm el-Umdan synagogue should not be confused with a second 1st-century BCE synagogue discovered at nearby Qiryat Sefer/Modi'in Illit at the site of Khirbet Badd 'Isa, on the Ascent of Beth-Horon (see here and here).\nFindings\nTwo column rows with 4 columns on each side, whose bases were unearthed, split the later-phase synagogue into three naves. Underneath this late structure, the remains of a  Hasmonean-period structure were found, probably also a synagogue and beneath it, the remains of a smaller building from the Hellenistic period.\nMikveh\nThe mikveh at Umm el-Umdan\nWest of the synagogue a mikve was discovered, dated to the Herodian period (the second phase of the synagogue). During the Hasmonean period (the first phase of the synagogue) there was already a sitting bath in the courtyard; it seems that during the Hasmonean period there was a bath in the courtyard west to the synagogue.\nBurial caves\nBurial complexes dating to the Second Temple period were found to the east and south of the village. The most notable one was discovered 100 meters east of the village. A luxurious burial complex that was used during the Hasmonean period pre-dating the use of ossuaries up to the 1st century CE when ossuaries were already in use. The finding indicate that burial customs are the same as seen in Hasmonean burial complexes in Jerusalem, Jason's Tomb and even Tomb of Shahin.\nIdentification\nThe location of the Hasmonean village of Modi'in was never firmly established. Today, researches suggest that based on the archeological finding at Umm el-Umdan it can be identified as the village of Modi'in. Furthermore, its location almost perfectly matches the location seen in the Madaba map.\nSee also\nAncient synagogues in Israel\n",

From 2001 to 2004 he studied at the Kremenchuk Flight College of the National Aviation University. He graduated as an airplane pilot, and completed his final courses at the university in 2006. From 2005 to 2010 he worked in the State Automobile Inspection of Ukraine\u00a0 as an investigator.\nBerezin worked at the Kremenchuk division of the International Society for Human Rights from 2010 to 2012, and subsequently worked as a teacher at the Kremenchuk Enhanced Military and Physical Training Lyceum\u00a0. In 2014, following the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War, he joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He fought in the War in Donbas for a year before leaving the military. In 2016 he became head of the \"Municipal Guard\" of Kremenchuk, and the same year he co-founded the Natural-Ecological Control non-governmental organisation and the All-Ukrainian Union of Anti-Terrorist Operation Veterans, Military Activities, and Peacekeeping Missions.\nPolitical career\nBerezin was a candidate in the 2016 by-elections, participating as a member of the European Party of Ukraine in Ukraine's 151st electoral district. He won 0.86% of the vote, compared to the winner, Ruslan Bogdan, who gathered 21.64% of the vote. During the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election Berezin was part of the campaign staff of Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

He is described by anti-corruption non-governmental organisation Chesno as part of a group of Servant of the People deputies closely connected to oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi. Berezin voted for the legalisation of medical cannabis, as well as for banning the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate). He supported Draft Law 5655, which Chesno criticises as placing reconstruction following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in control of property developers rather than citizens in general.\nAnti-corruption media portal Antikor has criticised Berezin for his closeness to Kremenchuk mayor Vitalii Maletskyi\u00a0, who has been involved in several corruption scandals.\n",

    "The Croatian Association of Visual Artists in Split (HULU Split) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan professional association for visual artists, founded in 1945. Being the only association of that sort in the Split-Dalmatia County, HULU plays a central role in the contemporary art scene of Split, often as the primary and only bearer of cultural life in the city.\nWith over 500 members of professional artists and art historians, the Association manages several key exhibition spaces like the Kula Gallery, the Small Chapel Apse and Salon Gali\u0107, organizing around thirty exhibitions each year.\nHistory and development\nThe foundations for the Split branch of the Croatian Association for Visual Arts were laid with the artistic efforts of an underground group that opposed fascist exhibitions during the Second World War. After the war, the Association became the main cultural force in Split, organizing traditional exhibitions like the annual May Day exhibitions.\nOn November 22, 1945, the cultural and scientific workers of the Ivan Lozica society established a special association of Dalmatian visual artists, known today as HULU Split. In February 1946, the association organized its first group exhibition. It opened on May 1, 1946, in Salon Gali\u0107, and continued yearly on thr same date and place, under the name of May Day (Prvomajske izlo\u017ebe).\nIn 1946, the same members of the Ivan Lozica society founded an evening school dedicated to educating attendees the practical knowledges of the artistic process, which matured in the School of Applied Art of Split.\nIn 1951, HULU was granted a permanent exhibition space in the House of Culture, and later in Kre\u0161imir Street. In the decades that came, it was entrusted to manage significant public spaces including the Protiron on the south of the peristyle in Diocletian's Palace, the crypt under the Cathedral of Saint Domnius, Diocletian's cellars and the Kula Gallery with art-based events. Other prominent spaces that the association handled count the Fine Arts Gallery, the Archaeological Museum and the Museum of the People's Revolution.\nIvan Gali\u0107 confided his exhibitional space to HULU in his will, and it has managed Salon Gali\u0107 since 1961. It has hosted over a thousand exhibitions there since, and ensured Salon Gali\u0107 as an enduring and relevant artistic destination in Croatia.\nIn 1969, the Association launched today one of the most important art happenings in Croatia, the Split Salon. As artistic pluralism started becoming a hallmark of the contemporary art scene, colourful and eclectic principles mirrored numerous mid-sixties efforts anchored by HULU Split, like the Youth Salon (1973), the Biennale of\nContemporary Croatian Graphics (1974), and the Small Formats Biennale (1977).\nAt the end of the seventies HULU became an independent society called the Croatian Society of Fine Artists, and three years later, in December 1982 a social\norganization. A move testemanting the budding need in Split to court tourism is the Diocletian Sales Gallery, promoting art for tourists, for which the Association was instrumental to open during the eighties.\nThe exhibitional corpus between 1945 and 1992 was the subject of a notable study conducted by then-president of the exhibitional branch of thr association Du\u0161ko Ke\u010dkemet in 2000 titled Likovne izlo\u017ebe u Splitu 1945-1992.\nIn 2022, HULU Split organised a charitable manifestation, in conjunction with the cultural association of Ukrainians in Croatia Cvit, with its member's paintings up for auction in that raised 125000 Croatian kuna (around 16000 euros) for Ukraine.\nAwards and accolades\nThe Association's objectives include the promotion of the Croatian visual\narts scene, the advocation for artistic freedom and continuous progress, public education, the presentation of the Croatian visual artistic contributions on both a local and international level, and the protection of the independent artists' moral and material rights. Successful in its ambitions, HULU Split received numerous accolades and distinctions.\nHULU was awarded, alongside the Zagreb-based visual arts associaton HDLU the title of a national professional association and received numerous other local and national merits. Those include the Split City Coat of Arms Award for Outstanding Achievements and Contributions of Significant Importance to the Development and Reputation of the City of Split, an accolade of Special Interest by the Split-Dalmatia County Council and the Honorary Award for its long-standing link with the Croatian Community of Independent Artists.\nIt has also been recognised for its humanitarian work, receiving praise for hosting artists' contributions during the Croatian War of Independence through the activities of the ART guard unit of the Association of Croatian Artists Split, and a charitable art auction featuring its members paintings that it had organised to raise funds for the needs of the Children's Clinic at KBC Split.\nPartners and collaborators\nHULU Split has collaborated ",
    "2003 school shooting in Brazil\nOn 28 January 2003, a mass school shooting occurred at Escola Estadual Coronel Benedito Ortiz in Tai\u00fava, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. 18-year-old ex-student Edmar Freitas opened fire on people inside the school, wounding eight people before committing suicide. The shooting was motivated by students bullying Freitas during his time at the school.\nShooting\nAt 2:40 p.m. (BRST) on 28 January 2003, 18-year-old Edmar Freitas, armed with a .38-caliber revolver and a knife and carrying a bag of ammunition, scaled a 2.7 metres (8.9\u00a0ft) side wall and entered the school courtyard, where around 50 students had gathered during passing period. He opened fire inside the courtyard at random, wounding five students, one of whom, 17-year-old Pedro Russo J\u00fanior, was rendered quadriplegic. Freitas then walked into the school and continued firing, wounding a teacher and a sixth student. Freitas headed to the janitor's office and shot and wounded the janitor, then pointed his revolver at the janitor's wife, Maria do Carmo, who begged him not to shoot her. Sparing do Carmo, Freitas turned his gun on himself and shot himself in the ear, dying instantly.\nContemporary reports suggested that Freitas fired indiscriminately, although a teacher suggested in 2019 that he specifically shot some victims and spared other people. Di\u00e1rio do Grande ABC also reported that the gunman had attempted to take a staff member hostage.\nPerpetrator\nEdmar Aparecido de Freitas (5 December 1984 \u2013 28 January 2003), aged 18, was an ex-student of the school, having graduated in 2002. Classmates stated that Freitas was normal, but shy and withdrawn. In his early teenage years, he was bullied at school for his obesity, which continued even after he had lost weight. Classmates reportedly said that Freitas talked about shooting people and blowing up the school, although investigators did not confirm these suggestions.\nInvestigators searching Freitas's house discovered a .22-caliber revolver and magazines covering Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, subjects Freitas was known to have interest in. They determined that he committed the shooting due to bullying and anger at his classmates.\nAftermath\nIn 2005, a regional judge ruled that the school's security was inadequate at the time of the shooting, stating that no guard was present to stop the shooter. The Brazilian government was ordered to compensate 305 days of wages to the victims for physical and mental damage. The government filed an appeal in 2006, which was still being deliberated as of 2011.\nWellington Menezes de Oliveira, the perpetrator of the 2011 Rio de Janeiro school shooting, mentioned Freitas in a video, along with Seung-Hui Cho and an Australian teenager who retaliated against bullying.\n",

He served as chief architect of Moscow from 1955 to 1960. He was awarded the title People's Architect of the USSR (1975).\nBiography\nBorn into a peasant family in the village of Prokhory (now Spassky District, Primorsky Krai).\nHe graduated from a vocational school, then entered the workers' school in Vladivostok. The workers' faculty teachers paid attention to his artistic abilities and sent him to the Moscow Vkhutemas (since 1926 - VKHUTEIN, since 1930 it has been divided into several universities, including the Institute of Proletarian Fine Arts, the Moscow Architectural Institute, the Stroganov Art and Industrial Institute, etc.) He applied to the Faculty of Architecture, which he graduated in 1931. The curator of his graduation project was the constructivist architect Alexander Vesnin.\nAfter graduation, he began working in the construction section of the Supreme Economic Council of the RSFSR, and in the mid-1930s he moved to the architectural and design workshop No. 5 of the Moscow City Council under the leadership of Daniil Fridman. In 1934, he developed a project for the Volgostroy club, built in Rybinsk. This is the only structure he completed outside of Moscow. At the same time, the young architect designed the first houses in the capital - the residential development of Kotelnicheskaya and Goncharnaya embankments (1934\u20131937). In collaboration with Daniil Fridman, he created the lobby of the Dzerzhinskaya metro station in 1935. The original stylistic solution of this structure was the double arched portal In 1937-1939 he supervised the construction of the eastern building of the Moscow Orphanage. Thus, he completed the composition proposed by the author of the project, Karl Blank, in the middle of the 18th century.\nAlthough the architect's own style had not yet been fully formed, architect Karo Alabyan drew attention to his work in the article \"Against formalism, simplification, eclecticism\", which was published in the April issue of \"Architecture of the USSR\" in 1936. The article set the standards of Soviet architecture and at the same time criticized all \"anti-Soviet\" styles. The author called \"simplistic eclecticism\" unacceptable and included Loveyko among the \"simple people\". This assessment influenced the young architect, so his works of the 1940s and early 1950s are strikingly different from his earlier ones.\nAfter the start of the war, he remained in the capital to participate in the development of Moscow defensive structures.\nSince 1944, he again began designing civil buildings and in 1946 headed the Architectural and Construction Workshop of the Moscow City Council. In the post-war decade, he developed projects in the \"Stalinist architecture\" style. At that time, \"Seven Sisters with their vertical composition were recognized as a standard, a symbol of the \"emancipation of the mighty forces\" of the country. Following architectural fashion, the architect decorated the main facades with massive porticos and colonnades. Among his similar works are the administrative building of the NKVD (current address - Gazetny Lane, 6), a residential building on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment, 2/1, and the Sovietsky Hotel.\nChief architect of Moscow\nIn 1955, he was appointed head of the Architectural and Planning Department of Moscow. During his five years in office, he continued to develop projects that were adopted under his predecessor Aleksandr Vlasov. The main task of the Moscow authorities was the construction of new districts on the outskirts of the capital. It was in the second half of the 1950s that the design of individual buildings was abandoned; the microdistrict became the main unit of urban development.\nDuring the time of Loveyko, the leader began the widespread use of new construction materials. So, instead of brick, large concrete blocks began to be used from 1955, and from 1958, expanded clay concrete panels were also used. Another feature of mass development was the limitation of the height of residential premises to 2.5 m. In one private conversation, the architect admitted that small apartments in \"dull boxes\" are only part of the problem. In his opinion, houses with load-bearing partitions and walls made of thin vibrating panels should have collapsed within 20 years. He could not influence the situation, since Nikita Khrushchev insisted on reducing the cost of construction.\nAs the chief architect of Moscow, he was involved in the development of promising highways. In 1960, he announced the need to create the Third and the unrealized Fourth and Fifth road rings in the capital. He also proposed rebuilding the Garden Ring to avoid the intersection of ring and radial roads. He saw the solution to this problem in creating tunnels at street intersections. It is notewo",
    "Tribe of true bugs\nThe Zoraidini is a group (tribe) of planthoppers in the family Derbidae. They are found in tropical and subtropical parts of Africa, Asia, Australia and in parts of the western Pacific. Almost 300 species in 27 genera are recognized (as of 2024). They are characterized by their long and narrow forewings and the short hind wings, usually not longer than half the length of the forewings and often even shorter. The forewings are typically around 8\u201310\u00a0mm long and the body is usually not more than half that length. In most species, the wings are raised when the insects are at rest, and are often spread out at an angle of about 45\u201390\u00b0. The head is compressed and the face is narrow in frontal view. The antennae are often long and the eyes cover about half the face. Like in other derbids, the adults suck the sap of plants while the nymphs live mainly in decaying organic matter. A few species are regarded as minor agricultural pests.\nType species: Derbe sinuosa Boheman, 1838 (the type species of the genus Zoraida)\nDistribution\nThe species of Zoraidini are found in tropical and some sub tropical regions of Africa, Asia, Australia and western Pacific islands. In Africa, most species have been described from tropical parts of western and central Africa, but some also from eastern countries like Ethiopia and as far south as Mozambique and Madagascar. In Asia, Australia and the Pacific, the distribution of species from the tribe Zoraidini ranges from India and Sri Lanka in the West to the western Pacific (Indonesia, Guam, the Philippines) as far south as Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and northern Australia. In eastern Asia, they have been also reported from subtropical regions as far north as parts of Japan and south-eastern Russia. Most species have been only reported from a few locations, but some have a wider distribution. For example, Proutista moesta is known from many parts of southern Asia and the western Pacific, ranging from the Seychelles, India and Sri Lanka in the West over the southern Asian mainland and Indonesia to the Philippines, southern China, Taiwan, southern Japan and Guam in the East.\nDescription\nZoraida horishana - Left: head in frontal view, Right: venation in forewing (top) and hind wing (bottom)\nThe tribe Zoraidini is characterized by a combination of several features which include:\nThe forewings are long and narrow, at least double as long as the hind wings, while the hind wings are unusually short and also narrow.\nThe head has a narrow face in frontal view and the eyes are only about half as long as the face and do not reach the clypeus.\nThe antennae are typically long, often longer than the face.\nA species of Zoraidini (Peggia?) with arrow pointing at the very short hind wing\nThe long and narrow forewings, combined with the very short and also narrow hind wings, are the most important features of the tribe Zoraidini. The length of the hind wings is always given as not longer than half the forewing length. In the type specimen of Zoraida sinuosa (Derbe sinuosa) the length of the hind wing is about 40% the length of the forewing. However, in some genera and species, the hind wings can be much smaller, less than one fifth of the forewing length. The photograph on the left shows a specimen with such very small hind wings (indicated by an arrow). That specimen comes close to the genus Peggia. Peggia nitida (St\u00e5l, 1870), the only species described in that genus, has a hind wing length which is only about 10% of the forewing length.\nLike in other groups of the subfamily Otiocerinae, the hindwings always have a stridulation plate on the inner margin, and in the case of the Zoraidini, the stridulation area is characterized by having an outer convex margin. In cases where the hindwings are extremely small, they are unlikely to have a role in the flight of the insects and probably only serve as a communication (stridulation) organ. The forewing venation in the tribe Zoraidini is characterized by an open clavus, meaning that the clavus vein does not reach the hind margin, but joins the veins of the cubitus (see illustration above). The media has 4 to 6 branches, one or more of which are usually forked. The forewings are 3 to 5 times longer than wide, on average 3.5 times.\nThe main feature of the head is the narrow, compressed face (frons), typically with the ridges on the side (facial carinae) nearly or completely meeting throughout most of its length. The facial carinae very rarely extend much further in front of the eyes, unlike in some other groups of Derbidae and the profile of the head is typically flat and usually evenly rounded. The size of the eyes covers about half the length of the face and the lower margins of the eyes do not approach the clypeus like in the sister tribe Sikaianini. The antennae are often long like in the type genus Zoraida and they are not branched like in other groups of Derbidae. In some species they are broad and extremely flat. There are no cup-",
    "American lawyer and legal scholar\nPhilip A. Lacovara (born July 11, 1943) is an American lawyer and legal scholar. He is best known as counsel to special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate Scandal.\nEarly life & education\nPhilip Allen Lacovara was born on July 11, 1943, in New York City. His father was a trusts and estates lawyer.\nLacovara earned a BA in Political Science and Philosophy from Georgetown University in 1963. He earned a JD from Columbia University School of Law in 1966, graduating first in his class at the age of 23. At Columbia, Lacovara worked as research assistant to Herbert Wechsler, then-director of the American Law Institute.\nCareer\nMoving to Washington D.C. after law school, Lacovara served as a clerk with Washington D.C. Circuit Court Judge Harold Leventhal. He then worked as special assistant to then-Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall and his successor, Erwin Griswold. In 1968, at 25, Lacovara argued several cases before the Supreme Court under Solicitor General Griswold.\nin 1969, Lacovara entered private practice, joining New York City law firm Hughes, Hubbard, & Reed as an associate. He took a leave of absence in 1971 to work as Special Counsel to New York City Police Commissioner Patrick Vincent Murphy under Mayor John Lindsay.\nIn 1972, Lacovara returned to D.C. as Deputy Solicitor General of the United States under Solicitor General Griswold. He worked briefly under Solicitor General Robert Bork after Griswold's resignation in 1973.\nWatergate Special Prosecutor's Office\nIn Spring 1973, special prosecutor Archibald Cox appointed Lacovara as counsel to the special prosecutor in the Watergate special prosecutor's office.\nThat summer, Col. Alexander Butterfield testified that President Richard Nixon had secretly recorded his own conversations in the Oval Office and elsewhere. The Senate Watergate Committee and Prosecutor Cox issued subpoenas for the tapes, but President Nixon claimed the recordings were protected by executive privilege and refused to comply. Federal Judge John Sirica ordered President Nixon to turn over the tapes, which was upheld on appeal by the Circuit Court, but President Nixon continued to refuse, offering instead to provide written summaries of the subpoenaed tapes and allow Mississippi Senator John Stennis to hear the tapes and confirm the summaries' accuracy. Prosecutor Cox refused what became known as the Stennis compromise.\nOn Saturday October 20, 1973, in an event that became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, President Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Cox, but Richardson instead resigned. Richardson's second-in-command, Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus, received the same order, but he too tendered his resignation. Solicitor General Bork became Acting Attorney General, and complied with President Nixon's order to fire Cox.  That same evening Lacovara, who briefly worked with Bork in the Solicitor General's Office, called Bork, who alerted Lacovara of Cox' dismissal, but said he had no orders to dismantle the special prosecutor's office or fire other prosecutors. Lacovara relayed this information to deputy prosecutor Henry Ruth and the rest of the staff, who agreed to retrieve their files and continue their work. FBI agents blocked their entry into the office, however, and told them the president had officiall disbanded the office of the special prosecutor.\nAs news broke that Sunday, the White House received an unprecedented deluge of telegrams protesting the President's actions. By Tuesday, Judge Sirica had forbidden the FBI from seizing materials from the special prosecutor's office, ordered the grand juries hearing the Watergate indictments to continue their work, and was in the process of preparing a contempt citation against the President. On Wednesday October 24, President Nixon reversed course, and agreed to provide the tapes to the court, as ordered. Leon Jaworski was named the new special prosecutor on November 2.\nJaworski subpoenaed sixty-four taped conversations, but Nixon again appealed, claiming the materials were protected by executive privilege, and that the office of Special Prosecutor lacked the right to sue the office of President. Jaworski appealed directly to the Supreme Court.\nOn July 8, 1974, Lacovara delivered 35 minutes of oral argument before the Supreme Court in United States v. Nixon.\n1973-present\nIn 1981 President Reagen appointed Lacovara as the Presidential appointee to the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission.\nPersonal life\nIn 1962, while still an undergraduate student at Georgetown, Lacovara married his wife, Madeline. They had seven children.\n",
    "Japanese crystallographer (1884-1952)\nSh\u014dji Nishikawa (Japanese: \u897f\u5ddd \u6b63\u6cbb, Nishikawa Sh\u014dji, 5 December 1884 \u2013 5 January 1952) was a Japanese physicist and a founding father of crystallography in Japan.\nEducation and career\nNishikawa was born in 1884 in Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo Prefecture, as the son of an important silk dealer. He grew up in Tokyo and later studied at the Faculty of Science at the Imperial University of Tokyo (now University of Tokyo). His PhD in physics was supervised by Suekichi Kinoshita, with an initial focus on radioactivity. During this time, Nishikawa was inspired by Torahiko Terada to turn his interest turned to crystallography, which was experiencing a worldwide boom with the then new method of X-ray diffraction for structural analysis. The first publications of Nishikawa came out between 1913 and 1915, at a time when the British Nobel Prize winners in physics William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg were doing groundbreaking pioneering work in this field. Between 1916 and 1919, Nishikawa stayed in the United States and worked at Cornell University, where he was a mentor of the then graduate student Ralph Wyckoff. Before returning to Japan in 1920, Nishikawa also spent six months with William H. Bragg at University College London. Back in Japan, he led the first research group at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (now known as RIKEN) and worked there until 1949. In 1924, Nishikawa became a professor at the University of Tokyo, where he worked until his retirement in 1945.\nNishikawa pioneered in the application of space groups in crystal structure determination, using spinel compounds as examples. His other significant scientific contributions include the analysis of the phase transformation of quartz and the experimental evidence of deviations from Friedel's law for certain crystal structures. In 1950, Nishikawa co-founded the Crystallographic Society of Japan and became its first president until his death two years later. One of Nishikawa's students was Seishi Kikuchi, who in 1928 described the Kikuchi lines that appear in electron diffraction and were named after him.\nNishikawa was elected into the Japan Academy in 1937. He received the Japanese Order of Culture in 1951 and was recognized as an honorary citizen of Hachi\u014dji, where he was born.\nPersonal life\nNishikawa was married to a teacher named Kiku Ayai and they had four sons and a daughter. Both of his two sons later became physicists. The first son, Tetsuji Nishikawa (1926\u20132010), was one of the founding fathers of the The High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (also known as KEK) and was its general director from 1977 to 1989. A younger son, Ky\u014dji Nishikawa (born 1934), is an emeritus professor at the Hiroshima University specialized in nuclear fusion and plasma science. Nishikawa died of apoplexy at his home on January 5, 1952.\n",

Her parents, who had fled the Sri Lankan Civil War, were assisted by Labour Party MP Jeremy Corbyn in their immigration case. The family later moved to Harrow where Kumaran was educated at Newton Farm Nursery, Infant and Junior School, Bentley Wood High School and St Dominic's Sixth Form College. She has Bachelor of Arts degree in politics and a Master of Science degree in public policy from Queen Mary University of London. Kumaran was a volunteer hospital radio presenter and producer at Radio Northwick Park, a charity radio station for promoting health and wellbeing within the local community through its broadcasting and NHS befriending service. From 2018 to 2022, she mentored first and final-year politics students from underprivileged backgrounds at Queen Mary University of London.  \nCareer\nKumaran worked for NHS Professionals between December 2007 and January 2009. She was a parliamentary researcher and caseworker for Labour MP Dawn Butler between March 2009 and August 2010. She worked for the Labour Group on Islington Council from September 2010 to December 2014. She was senior campaign adviser for Sadiq Khan (May 2015 to October 2015) and a political adviser at the Local Government Association (October 2015 to November 2017). She then served as a Senior Adviser to Mayor of London Sadiq Khan from November 2017 to August 2020. Kumaran was Deputy Director of Parliamentary Affairs for Labour leader Keir Starmer from September 2020 to March 2022 where she was a part of the Prime Minister's Questions team and Shadow Cabinet Relations. She was Director Diplomatic and International Relations for C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, leading on relations for bolder climate action with the United Nations, governments, mayors and philanthropic organisations around the world from April 2022 to May 2024.\nKumaran contested 2010 local elections in the London Borough of Harrow as one of the Labour Party candidates in the three-member Pinner South Ward but was not elected. In November 2013 Kumaran was selected by the Labour Party to be its candidate in Harrow East. During the 2015 general election campaign she and the Liberal Democrat candidate were attacked by Dharma Sewa Purvapaksha, an organisation founded by Conservative Party member Mukesh Naker, for their parties\u2019 support in 2013 for legislation to outlaw caste discrimination. Kumaran's Conservative opponent Bob Blackman described the anti-discrimination legislation as \"divisive and much hated\". At the election Kumaran was defeated by Blackman. She did not contest 2017 general election, citing the impact on her family and friends of the communal politics employed by Conservative MP Bob Blackman during the 2015 election campaign in Harrow East. In May 2024 Kumaran was selected to be the Labour Party's candidate in the newly created constituency of Stratford and Bow. At the election she was elected with a majority of 11,634.\nPersonal life\nKumaran resides in London with her husband. She speaks English, Tamil, French, and German. She serves as an Advisory Board Member on the Labour Climate and Environment Forum.\nElectoral history\n",
    "Egyptian commanders of the Yom Kippur War\nThe October War, or the Tenth of Ramadan War, is also known in Syria as the Tishreen Liberation War, while Israel calls it the Yom Kippur War. It is the fourth Israeli war launched by Egypt and Syria against Israel on Saturday, October 6, 1973, corresponding to the 10th of Ramadan 1393 AH with a surprise attack by the Egyptian army and the Syrian army on the Israeli forces that were stationed in Sinai and the Golan Heights.\nOctober War leaders in war operations room 1973.\nOn the Egyptian front: The Egyptian army achieved the desired strategic goals behind the military surprise of Israel. There were tangible achievements in the first days after the launch of the war, as Egyptian forces penetrated 20\u00a0km east of the Suez Canal. But at the end of the war, the Israeli army recovered and was able to initiate Operation Abirey-Halev, cross to the western bank of the canal, and impose a siege on the Third Field Army, but it failed to achieve any strategic gains, whether by controlling the city of Suez or the Third Army. During the war, many Arab countries helped Egypt and Syria, whether militarily or economically. Egypt decided to adhere to the Security Council resolution for a ceasefire on October 22, 1973, while Israel agreed on October 24. The first and second disengagement agreements were concluded. Then, after several discussions between Egypt and Israel, a comprehensive peace agreement was reached at Camp David in 1978.\nA photo of the Supreme Command of the Egyptian Armed Forces after the clashes stopped, February 1974\nThe Egyptian military leadership witnessed many changes after the Six-Day War of 1967 until before the October 1973 War:\nMinistry of War: Amin Howeidi took over the Ministry of War (July 21, 1967 - January 25, 1968), then General Mohamed Fawzi (January 25, 1968 - May 13, 1971) as a result of his resignation. Then Lieutenant General Mohammed Ahmed Sadek (May 14, 1971 - October 26, 1972) was referred for retirement, after which Lieutenant General Ahmad Ismail Ali took over on October 26, 1972, and assumed command of the army during the war until his death on December 25, 1974.\nChief of Staff of the Egyptian Army: It was under the command of Lieutenant General Abdel Moneim Riad (June 11, 1967 - March 9, 1969), where he was martyred. Then Major General Ahmad Ismail Ali assumed the position (March 10, 1969 - September 10, 1969) but was referred for retirement following Operation Raviv incident. Then the position was held by Lieutenant General Mohammed Ahmed Sadek (September 10, 1969 - May 12, 1971). Then Lieutenant General Saad el-Din el-Shazly (May 16, 1971 - December 12, 1973) until he was dismissed to leave the position to Lieutenant-General Mohamed Abdel Ghani el-Gamasy (December 12, 1973 - 1974).\nMilitary Operations Authority: Major General Mohamed Abdel Ghani el-Gamasy (January 1, 1972 - December 12, 1973).\nNavy: Rear Admiral Mahmoud Abdel Rahman Fahmy (September 11, 1969 - October 24, 1972) was then referred for retirement and was replaced by Rear Admiral Fouad Mohamed Abou Zikry.\nAir forces: Major General Madkour Abu el-Ezz (June 11, 1967 - November 10, 1967), then Major General Pilot Mustafa el-Hanawi (November 10, 1967 - June 22, 1969), who was referred to retirement as a result of an Israeli air penetration over Cairo, then Air vice-marshal Ali Mustafa Baghdady until April 22, 1972, then he was dismissed and took over.

    "American film\nThe Foreigner is a 1978 American independent no wave film directed by Amos Poe starring Eric Mitchell with semi-improvised appearances by Patti Astor, Anya Phillips and Debbie Harry.\nIts postmodern faux film noir style was influenced by the French New Wave films of Jean-Luc Godard, and the low budget Underground films of Andy Warhol and Jack Smith and the ensemble casting of Rainer Werner Fassbinder and John Cassavetes. \nIt also was heavily influenced by No Wave DIY post-punk style of music and contains an onscreen appearance of The Cramps in a scene shot in CBGB's. This early version of The Cramps, billed in the film as The Erasers (not the actual No Wave band Erasers), perform a live version of the Iggy Pop/David Bowie song Funtime. Prior to that, Debbie Harry of Blondie sings a cappella a Kurt Weil song in the alley behind the Mudd Club. Ivan Kr\u00e1l, of the Patti Smith Group, provided the ambient electro soundtrack.\nCinematography\nThis rather nihilistic 16mm film has a look of grimy glamor as it was shot on the streets of New York City on a shoestring budget with a small cast and crew. The dialog is sometimes inaudible while the black and white cinematography of Chirine El Khadem (with art direction of Sam Blank) is often exceptionally good, with some severe upward angle-shots of the World Trade Towers and artistic non-narrative camera work at the conclusion of the film as the protagonist (Max Menace) races on foot through the crowded sidewalks of Broadway. Also there are beautiful shots of the empty temporary beach on the site of what would become Battery Park City. Starkly beautiful scenes were also shot in the abandoned streets of the decaying Lower East Side.\nPlot\nA Frenchman named Max Menace (played by Eric Mitchell in a white suit and black tie) is a blond secret agent who arrives in New York City on an unstated (perhaps political assassination) mission. The plot remains vague throughout, just as the reasons why many people want him dead. Regardless, boredom sets in for Max as he waits at the Hotel Chelsea for his assignment, so he begins wandering around the city encountering some wanton women and a variety of post-punk weirdos and creeps. This aimless waiting and wandering comprises the bulk of the movie, much like the 1964 Red Desert film by Michelangelo Antonioni. Here too, alienation thrusts the anti-hero into an unstructured and purposely-meandering storyline that ends with his murder at Battery Park, with a view of the Statue of Liberty in the distant background.\nCast\nEric Mitchell (Max Menace)\nPatti Astor (Philly Harlowe)\nTerens Sellers (Zasu Weather)\nDuncan Hannah (King Bag)\nKitty Sondern (Kitbag)\nSteven Kramer (Jimmy Uptight)\nDeborah Harry (Dee Trick)\nRobin Crutchfield (Mousebag)\nAnya Philips (Doll)\nAwards\nBerlin International Film Festival (1982)\n",

It was the first studio album from the band in 14 years and their first after reforming from being broken up for a decade, coming back with this album being funded by PledgeMusic; it has received positive reviews from critics.\nReception\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Magic Hour received \"generally favorable reviews\" based on a weighted average score of 67 out of 100 from 8 critic scores. At The A.\u00a0V. Club, Chris Mincher gave this album a C\u2013 and praised the band for avoiding the temptation to sound too modern, but stating that the resulting work is \"relatively simple, at times almost amateurish\". Editors at AllMusic rated this album 4 out of 5 stars, with critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that \"the lower budget can't help but bring to mind the group's lo-fi beginnings\" and the music also \"recall the noir funk of 1992's In Search of Manny\" and he finished by stating that the \"result is terrific, a record that builds upon the group's legacy and is easily the equal of anything the band did in the '90s\". In CMJ New Music Report, Eric Davidson stated that there are minor complaints such as how \"there are few odd turns or possibly embarrassing (daring?) missteps here that might\u2019ve added some urgent energy and help create a little more discussion around this comeback\" and stated that the band's genre blending and musicianship \"work together perfectly, still and always, apparently\". Ann Powers of NPR stated that \"the group gives instructions in fun, love, loyalty and self-appreciation with ten songs that go down as easy as drummer Kate Schellenbach's backbeats\" on this release and is \"timeless\" music.\nEditors at Pitchfork scored this release 5.6 out of 10 and critic Douglas Wolk characterized it as \"just a return to very familiar territory without the urgency and mystery of Luscious Jackson's 90s-era music\" that he considers not being an obvious cash-grab and sounding like it was fun for the musicians to make. Writing for PopMatters, Sean McCarthy rated this release a 6 out of 10, stating that it \"goes easy on the ears\" and the musicianship is high quality but criticized the songwriting stating that \"almost all of the songs feel like they\u2019re taking place within the confines of a dance floor\". In Record Collector, Magic Hour received 4 out of 5 stars and Kris Needs wrote that it was good to have the band back, as \"Luscious Jackson return as a welcome blast of old school New York grit, happily still brandishing their smouldering, idiosyncratic magic\". Will Hermes of Rolling Stone gave this work 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing that \"on this tight, 10-song reunion... vocals still waver charmingly off-key, grooves still conjure a Nineties Lower East Side rent party\" and he welcomed the band back to recording. Magic Hour was album of the week in the South China Morning Post, where Jon Pareles stated that it \"doesn't discourage nostalgia for an era of teasing, non-bombastic dance music ut it doesn't depend entirely on nostalgia either: there's always another catchy refrain on the way\".\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Jill Cunniff, Gabrielle Glaser, and Kate Schellenbach, except where noted\n\"You and Me\"\u00a0\u2013 3:03\n\"#1 Bum\"\u00a0\u2013 2:52\n\"Show Us What You Got\"\u00a0\u2013 2:41\n\"Are You Ready?\" (Cunniff, Glaser, and ADW Young)\u00a0\u2013 2:53\n\"Aaw Turn It Up!\" (Cunniff, Glaser, Adam Horowitz, and Shellenbach)\u00a0\u2013 2:44\n\"So Rock On\"\u00a0\u2013 3:37\n\"Love Is Alive\"\u00a0\u2013 3:14\n\"We Go Back\"\u00a0\u2013 3:07\n\"Frequency\" (Cunniff and Schellenbach)\u00a0\u2013 3:10\n\"3 Seconds to Cross\"\u00a0\u2013 3:59\nPersonnel\nLuscious Jackson\nJill Cunniff\u00a0\u2013 guitar, bass guitar, vocals, recording, programming, production\nGabrielle Glaser\u00a0\u2013 guitar, keyboards, vocals, production\nKate Schellenbach\u00a0\u2013 drums\nAdditional personnel\nAdamLewin.com\u00a0\u2013 artwork\nGabriele Corcos\u00a0\u2013 percussion on \"You and Me\", \"Love Is Alive\", and \"3 Seconds to Cross\"\nDarren Embry\u00a0\u2013 recording on drums\nPiper Gregoire\u00a0\u2013 \"are we just dancing\" vocal on \"Frequency\"\nAdam Horovitz\u00a0\u2013 production on \"So Rock On\"\nJim Kissling\u00a0\u2013 mixing on \"Are You Ready?\"\nPeter Mayer\u00a0\u2013 violin on \"So Rock On\"\nLara Meyerratken\u00a0\u2013 keyboards on \"You and Me\" and \"We Go Back\", backing vocals on \"So Rock On\"\nDoug Seymour\u00a0\u2013 photography\nJamie Staub\u00a0\u2013 mixing, additional production\nADW Young\u00a0\u2013 production on \"Aaw Turn It Up!\"\nSee also\n2013 in American music\n2013 in rock music\nList of 2013 albums\n",
    "Spanish singer (born 2002)\nMusical artist\nMiguel Cantos G\u00f3mez (born 25 May 2002), known mononymously as Saiko, is a Spanish singer in the reggaeton and trap genres.\nEarly life\nMiguel Cantos G\u00f3mez was born in the Granada suburb of Armilla, on 25 May 2002. From a very young age he became interested in music, participating in rap battles in his town. He began rapping at the age of fourteen, forming a duo with his brother in 2017.\nMusical career\nIn 2020, Saiko began his solo career. His first single was released under the name \"Te quiero fuera\". It was the year in which he began working with his current manager \"La mano de oro\", who helped him progress as an artist. It was not until the release of \"Polaris\" in 2022 when the artist from Granada became famous, despite having previously collaborated with artists such as Lola \u00cdndigo and Alejo in \"Humedad remix\" or with Quevedo in \"Jordan I\" or in \"Turbulencias\", the latter together with other artists such as Juseph, Fabio Colloricchio or La Pantera, and with Kabasaki as producer. Polaris was a huge success, which was certified gold in Spain.\nOnce Saiko achieved the gold record, in April 2023 he released a new single entitled \"Supernova\", which quickly became very famous as its chorus was that of the song \"Un violinista en tu tejado\" by Melendi, reaching number 1 on the singles chart in Spain. He also achieved gold record \"Las Bratz (Remix)\", in a single in which he collaborated with JC Reyes, or Juseph, Aissa Aslani, El Bobe and Nickzzy. Once Saiko saw the success of \"Polaris\" he released \"Polaris Remix\" in which he collaborated with Quevedo, Mora and Feid, all artists already established in the genre.. As expected, the song becomes one of the songs of the summer of 2023. Such the success of \"Polaris Remix\", Saiko established himself in the industry, collaborating with Omar Montes in \"Arena y Sal\", with Mora and Sech in \"Caf\u00e9 Malib\u00fa\", and again with Mora in \"Reina\", a single from the Puerto Rican's new album, which soon became number 1 in Spain, debuting in the Spotify top 50 directly as number 1 and number 15 globally.\nOn 14 September, Saiko gave a free concert with Quevedo in Madrid, and on 21 September, he gave a concert at the Granada Bullring, selling out all tickets in just five minutes. That same day he released the single \"Buenas\" with Quevedo, which quickly reached number 1 in Spain. On 14 December 2023, Saiko released his EP \"Saliendo del planeta\" with singles such as \"Corleone\" with Yandel and production by producer Sky, as well as the single \"Siempre vas a volver\" with Polim\u00e1 Westcoast, Saiko would define the project as a preview of his next album \"Sakura\".\nThrough an Instagram post, Saiko announced on the tracklist of his first album, Sakura, on 17 April 2024. On the same day, he released the video clip for one of the new songs on the album: \"Yo lo so\u00f1\u00e9\" with Omar Montes and the participation of Ilia Topuria. Sakura was released on 26 April on all platforms. In total it includes 16 songs, including collaborations with artists such as J Balvin, Bryant Myers, JC Reyes, Dei V, Mora and Dellafuente, among others. Dellafuente's being the most important for him on a sentimental level due to everything that has followed the singer.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nSakura (2024)\nExtended plays\nSaliendo del planeta (2023)\n",
    "Malaysian convicted serial killer and rapist\nBetween 2009 and 2012, Rabidin Satir, nicknamed \"Rambo Bentong\", is suspected of committing several murders in Bentong, Pahang, Malaysia, although only two victims were confirmed. On 8 March 2009, Rabidin intruded the home of a 17-year-old schoolgirl Annie Kok Yin Cheng (\u90ed\u5a49\u6676 Gu\u014d W\u01cenj\u012bng), raping her before he slit her throat, killing her on the spot. Three years later, on 3 November 2012, Rabidin battered a 31-year-old forestry department employee Khairul Hazri Jamaludin to death with his homemade rifle.\nRabidin, who had also committed several more rapes and property offences during his three-year crime spree in Bentong, was arrested 11 days after murdering Khairul and subsequently charged for crimes he committed. Between 2013 and 2015, Rabidin was found guilty of killing both Kok and Khairul and sentenced to death, and also received multiple jail terms with caning for some other offences he committed prior to his arrest. Between 2016 and 2024, Rabidin lost his appeals against the death penalty for each of his two murder convictions, and is on death row since 2024.\nPersonal life\nRabidin Satir, a Malaysian, originated from Kampung Libang Ulu in Tambunan, which was located in Sabah, East Malaysia. His family made a living by farming and they were both affluent and well-respected in their hometown. His brother was also a well-respected imam in the kampung itself.\nIn 2007, Rabidin later moved to West Malaysia and he settled in the forested areas of Bentong, a town in Pahang. It was there in Bentong, between 2009 and 2012, Rabidin would turn to a life of crime and brought about a reign of terror in the quiet town of Bentong throughout these three years.\nMurder of Annie Kok Yin Cheng\nAnnie Kok Yin Cheng, the first murder victim of the Rambo Bentong case\nOn the early morning of 8 March 2009, at Kampung Ketari in Bentong, a teenage girl was found murdered in her home due to a possible robbery-murder bid.\n17-year-old Annie Kok Yin Cheng (6 June 1991 \u2013 8 March 2009), whose stepfather Sew Kok Wee (\u5f90\u56fd\u8f89 X\u00fa Gu\u00f3hu\u012b) was the kampung headman, was last seen the night before at her home using her computer. Kok's sister showed up on the following day, stumbling upon the body of her younger sister, who had a gaping knife wound on her neck and whose body was covered in a blanket. Kok was later found to have been raped after a post-mortem examination was conducted on her body; her clothes were also being partially removed, which showed that she was likely being sexually assaulted. According to her stepfather, his stepdaughter was a quiet girl who often stayed at home using the compuer and liked watching television, and her mother, whose was formerly married once to Kok's real father before her divorce and second marriage, also told police that her daughter's wallet was missing. An update in August 2009 revealed that an unknown male's DNA was discovered on Kok's private parts.\nThe police also found that at least six lighting devices were dismantled in Kok's house, which made them theorizing that the killer was someone known to the deceased, and possibly a premeditated crime. Following the revelation of Kok's murder, many residents of her kampung in Bentong hyped up security measures by using stronger metal gates and railings to protect themselves from possible intruders. Kok left behind her birth mother, stepfather, a birth sister, two half-brothers and one half-sister fathered by her stepfather, and her step-grandfather.\nFor the following three years, the death of Kok remained unsolved, and there were rampant rumours accusing Kok's stepfather as the true killer of the case, even though there were evidence proving that Kok's stepfather and his friend were both at Kuala Lumpur and outside Bentong when his stepdaughter was killed, and Kok's mother also believed in her husband's innocence and brushed off the rumours, which only dissipated after the arrest of Rabidin three years later in 2012. Official sources confirmed that Rabidin's DNA matched to the semen traces found on Kok's body, and he had committed the crime by intruding Kok's home and attacked her in her sleep, resulting in Kok's rape and murder.\nMurder of Khairul Hazri Jamaludin\nOn 3 November 2012, a couple was attacked at the quarters of Bentong Forestry Department, with the husband, who worked at the department, being killed while the wife was raped but survived the brutal attack.\n31-year-old Khairul Hazri bin Jamaludin (1981 \u2013 3 November 2012) and his 28-year-old pregnant wife Yuslailee binti Mat, with whom he was married for three years, were sleeping at the quarters of the forestry department when Rabidin had intruded the place with a home-made shotgun and robbed the couple on gunpoint. Rabidin also wielded his rifle at Khairul, who tried to defend himself and his wife. Khairul was overpowered by Rabidin, who repeatedly used the butt of his gun to severely bludgeon Khairul on the head several times until he became semi-uncon",
    "Restaurant in Portland, Oregon, U.S.\nTokyo Sando is a restaurant in Portland, Oregon. Spouses Taiki Nakajima and Andrea Nakajima began operating the food cart from the Portland State University campus in downtown Portland in February 2020, just prior to the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. The business later relocated to 2nd Avenue and Stark Street. In 2023, the owners announced plans to close permanently due to increases food costs and declining revenue. However, in 2024, Tokyo Sando re-opened in the Southwest 5th Avenue food cart pod. The business has garnered a positive reception.\nDescription\nTokyo Sando serves Japanese-style sandwiches from a food cart in downtown Portland's Southwest 5th Avenue food cart pod. Willamette Week has described the food as a fusion of Japanese and Pacific Northwest cuisine. Sandwiches use Japanese milk bread; varieties include katsu chicken or pork with cabbage and tonkatsu sauce, as well as egg salad with dijon mustard, green onion, Kewpie, and a house-made mayonnaise.\nHistory\nOwners and spouses Taiki Nakajima and Andrea Nakajima opened Tokyo Sando on February 2, 2020, initially operating from a food cart at the intersection of Southwest 4th Avenue and Hall Street on the Portland State University campus in downtown Portland. Like many businesses, Tokyo Sando experienced hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic. By May 2021, Tokyo Sando was operating at 2nd Avenue and Stark Street (also known as Harvey Milk Street). Cash and credit card machines were stolen from the cart in July. According to Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB), \"Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the food truck developed a sizable clientele, evident in its following of more than 21,000 accounts on Instagram and an overall Yelp rating of 4.5 based on 300-plus reviews.\"\nIn November 2023, the owners announced plans to close permanently on December 17. The couple wrote: \"We struggled to keep the business operating in the challenging times, but tried to stay open 7 days a week, because we didn't know what else to do, other than keep open the cart. Now, due to the condition of what Portland has become, we don't know why we're making Japanese food in Portland.\" Taiki Nakajima cited increased food costs and declining revenue as reasons for the closure. He shared plans take an extended break in Japan and possibly return.\nIn January 2024, Taiki Nakajima teased the possible return to Portland on social media. Tokyo Sando began operating from the Southwest 5th Avenue food cart pod (rebranded Midtown Beer Garden) in February. In a statement, the cart's owners said, \"We think we want to fall in love with the city of Portland again.\"\nReception\nIn 2021, during the pandemic, Andrea Damewood included the miso pork katsu sandwich in Willamette Week's list of five \"makeshift picnics perfect for a Portland summer\". Jean Chen Smith recommended Tokyo Sando in SFGate's 2023 guide to Portland. Following the 2023 closure announcement, OPB said the business was \"leaving a shokupan-shaped hole in Portland's heart\".\nSee also\nFood portalOregon portal\nHistory of the Japanese in Portland, Oregon\nList of Japanese restaurants\n",
    "Supplement contamination causing kidney injury and death\nThe Kobayashi red yeast rice scandal (Japanese: \u7d05\u9eb9\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea\u4e8b\u4ef6) is an ongoing widespread supplement contamination that was first noted on 22 March 2024, resulting in numerous health problems to people taking the supplements in Japan and Taiwan. Up to 80 people died after taking the supplements, with at least 500 more hospitalized.\nIncident\nOn 22 March 2024, authorities reported that five people had died after consuming three products produced by Kobayashi Pharmaceutical, including \"Red Koji Cholesterol Help\". More than 240 people were hospitalized due to taking the supplement, and a total of 94,000 consultations were made, leading\u00a0to a mandated recall as they were suspected of containing toxic and harmful substances. Kobayashi Pharmaceutical red yeast rice supplements were also supplied to other companies and used in confectionery, bread, sake, miso, and several other products, expanding the distribution of contaminated red yeast rice. The damage spread to Taiwan where Kobayashi Pharmaceutical red yeast rice was sold. Six cases of acute kidney failure and other health problems were reported, prompting a recall of the ingredients and products using them from about 100 companies. Taiwanese companies recalled 154 products linked to the contaminated red yeast rice supplements.\nOn 28 June 2024, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced that 76 new deaths suspected to be related to taking the supplement had been discovered. As of 28 June 2024, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical had received 170 inquiries from about the deaths of family members, of which 76 were from people who had taken the product and died, and another three were from doctors positing no causal relationship between taking the supplement and deaths. On 2 July, the city of Osaka requested the government of Mie Prefecture to investigate a case relating to the death to provide further information on the contamination and its spread.\nHealth issues\nAccording to Dr. Ryuta Fujimura of the Department of Nephrology at the Higashiosaka Municipal Medical Center, who examined the hospitalized patients, the symptoms common to the victims were severe damage to the renal tubules which became crusted, chronic fatigue, loss of appetite, vomiting, and frequent urination, as well as an extreme deterioration in kidney test results, which were consistent with Fanconi syndrome.\nGood Manufacture Practice (GMP) certification requires an external inspection every year. Kobayashi Pharmaceutical did not have GMP certification, and had no opportunity to have a third party check it. Under the guidelines for voluntary recalls, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical had a policy of not recalling products until a causal relationship could be established to some extent, possibly resulting in further widespread health issues.\nOf the 76 deaths where a causal relationship is suspected, in addition to kidney-related diseases, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical claimed that some were due to other diseases (cancer, cerebral infarction, pneumonia, aortic dissection, etc.) requiring further inquiry. On 30 June 2024, The Japanese Society of Nephrology announced that approximately 85% of over 100 patients reported have not returned to normal kidney function over a month after ceasing the supplement.\nCauses\nAs of June 2024, the precise cause has not been determined, but it has been discovered that the batches manufactured between June and August 2023 and in which the health damage was confirmed contained puberulic acid and two unknown compounds with a basic structure similar to that of lovastatin (monacolin K), which was an active ingredient in the supplement. Animal experiments confirmed that puverulic acid causes kidney damage.\nDue to prior research indicating the risk of causing kidney disfunction, in Switzerland, sales of red yeast rice are illegal, France and the European Union have expressed safety concerns, Germany issued a warning not to consume it, and Taiwan recommends that people with chronic diseases seek professional medical advice before taking it.\nThe mold used to make red yeast rice is called \"koji mold\", with there being several types of koji mold. The type most commonly used in Japan is Aspergillus oryzae, which is classified as part of the Aspergillus genus. It is used in sake, soy sauce, miso, mirin, amazake, and other products, with no reported health problems. In contrast, red koji mold is a species classified as Monascus, and is used in Chinese and Taiwanese fermented bean curd. Some red koji molds produce a mycotoxin called citrinin, which is known to cause kidney disease, but the product uses red koji mold that does not have the gene to synthesize citrinin, and in fact no citrinin was detected. On March 29, the possibility that the \"unknown substance\" was puverulic acid was first postulated.\nThe Japanese Society of Nephrology conducted a survey of doctors and reported that as of 4 April, 95 people who had taken \"Red Koji Cholesterol Help\" ",
    "US Supreme Court case on federal judiciary's jurisdiction over immigration courts\n2024 United States Supreme Court case\nWilkinson v. Garland, 601 U.S. ___ (2024), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that federal courts have the jurisdiction to review the determinations of immigration judges as a mixed question of law.\nLegal background\nWhen a non-permanent resident of the United States has been designated for removal, the United States Attorney General can cancel their deportation if they have lived in the country for at least ten years, maintained good moral character, not committed any serious crimes, and their removal would impose an \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\" on their spouse, parent, or child if those relations are either US citizens or permanent residents.\nAs determined by the Board of Immigration Appeals in the 2001 case In re Monreal-Aguinaga, such hardship must be \"substantially different from, or beyond, that which would normally be expected from the deportation of an alien with close family members here.\"\nIn the United States, Courts of Appeals and the Supreme Court can only review questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, which are expected to be handled by the original trial court. The 2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, reiterated that Congress' prior efforts to protect immigration court fact-finding from judicial review did not preclude \"review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.\"\nIn the 2020 case Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, the Supreme Court applied this provision to allow judicial review of whether immigration courts were appropriately applying undisputed facts to legal standards. The majority opinion cited the 2001 case Immigration and Naturalization Service v. St. Cyr, which identified a presumption in favor of judicial review over any administrative action.\nHowever, in the 2022 case Patel v. Garland, the Supreme Court held that the choice of whether to assess a detainee's intent to commit one of the prohibited serious crimes in their cancellation hearing was a question of fact insulated from judicial review.\nImmigration court rulings\nThis case dealt judicial review of the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review\nFleeing from police violence in his birth country of Trinidad and Tobago, Situ Kamu Wilkinson intentionally overstayed his travel visa in 2003. In 2013, he had a child with his girlfriend in Pennsylvania, both of whom are US citizens. Due to his busy schedule as a construction worker, Wilkinson agreed to have his girlfriend move to the neighboring state of New Jersey for his asthmatic son to receive additional childcare support from his girlfriend's mother.\nWhile repairing a house in 2019, Wilkinson was arrested by police officers after their search of the building identified crack cocaine. Upon reporting to the courthouse to contest the drug charges, Wilkinson was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for overstaying his visa. While those criminal drug charges were ultimately dropped, Wilkinson was forced to defend himself against deportation proceedings. Aside from claiming a right of asylum, withholding from removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, Wilkinson applied for cancellation of removal based on the emotional and financial hardship that his deportation would impose on his son.\nDespite accepting the facts presented by Wilkinson and his family in their testimonies, Immigration Judge Robert M. Lewandowski ruled that his deportation would not impose an \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\" because his son could receive welfare and already lived apart from his father, Wilkinson could continue sending money from Trinidad and Tobago, and Wilkinson's girlfriend could begin working while her mother provides childcare. Upon review, the Bureau of Immigration Appeals upheld Lewandowski's verdict without issuing an opinion.\nThird Circuit ruling\nRepresented by immigration lawyer Rhonda F. Gelfman, Wilkinson appealed his decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Writing for the unanimous three-judge panel, Judge Stephanos Bibas cited Patel v. Garland to dismiss Wilkinson's appeal of the hardship determination as a discretionary judgement that the federal judiciary lacks jurisdiction over.\nAdditionally, Bibas denied Wilkinson's claim that the Attorney General cannot order deportation because his life would be threatened in Trinidad and Tobago because of his membership in a particular social group. Citing the Third Circuit's precedent from the 2018 case S.E.R.L. v. Attorney Gen. U.S., this exception to deportation proceedings only applies to groups that are socially distinct within their country, Bibas reasoned that victims of police violence is not a satisfactory classification.\nSupreme Cou",
    "\nThe Battle of Kalamata took place on 14 September 1685 between the expeditionary army of the Republic of Venice in the Morea, led by Hannibal von Degenfeld, and the forces of the Ottoman Empire, led by the Kapudan Pasha. The battle ended in a Venetian victory, which allowed the Venetians to complete the conquest of the Mani Peninsula, solidifying their foothold in the southern Morea.\nBackground\nKalamata is attested since the 12th century and had a castle, which became the seat of a major barony of the Frankish Principality of Achaea after 1205. During the Ottoman conquest of the Morea in 1458\u20131460, Kalamata passed under Venetian rule, but was lost to the Ottomans during the First Ottoman\u2013Venetian War of 1463\u20131479. In 1659, during the Ottoman\u2013Venetian war over Crete, in an attempt to distract Ottoman attention away from the Siege of Candia, the Venetian commander Francesco Morosini landed in Kalamata, and was joined by the restive local population, the Maniots and Arvanites. The Ottomans withdrew without offering much resistance: the castle was sacked and the town's inhabitants carried off by the Venetian fleet to serve as rowers in its galleys, but the venture, as with all similar raids instigated by Morosini at this time, did not have any major repercussions as the Venetians could not hold onto the isolated and exposed areas they captured.\nIn March 1684, with the Ottoman Empire smarting from its defeat at the Battle of Vienna and its military forces embroiled in a costly war with the Habsburg empire and Poland, Venice joined the anti-Ottoman Holy League with the aim of conducting a parallel campaign in Greece, and thus exact revenge for the recent loss of Crete. The opening actions of the conflict in Greece saw the capture of Santa Maura (Lefkada) and the mainland fortress of Preveza in 1684, but the main aim of Francesco Morosini, newly appointed as the Venetian commander-in-chief, was to capture the entire Morea as recompense for the loss of Crete. Based on his experiences from 1659, he hoped for assistance from the native population, which was showing signs of revolutionary stirrings. This was especially the case for the Maniots, who resented the loss of privileges and autonomy, including the establishment of Ottoman garrisons in local fortresses, that they had suffered due to their collaboration with the Venetians during the Cretan War. The Maniots entered into negotiations with the Venetians but the Ottomans pre-empted them: in spring 1685 the serasker (Ottoman commander-in-chief) of the Morea, Ismail Pasha, invaded the Mani Peninsula and forced the local population to submit, giving up their children as hostages. As a result, when Morosini's fleet approached the Morea in June 1685, Maniot envoys had met Morosini and asked him not to land at Mani, warning that the Maniots would not rise up until the Venetians had taken hold of a major fortress as a base of operations and refuge for their local allies. Morosini chose the fortress of Coron (Koroni) as his first target, lying across the Messenian Gulf from Mani. After defeating the Ottoman relief efforts and a 49-day siege, Coron was captured on 11 August and its garrison massacred.\nBattle\nIn the final stage of the siege, 230 Maniots under the Zakynthian noble Pavlos Makris had taken part, and soon Mani rose up in revolt, encouraged by the Venetian presence at Coron, and besieged the Ottoman garrisons in the castles of Zarnata and Kelefa. The Maniots, divided by mutual jealousies and rivalries, proved ineffective, and Morosini was forced to send ships and men to assist and rally them to a more determined pursuit of the sieges, and stop the garrisons' resupply over the sea. Zarnata surrendered on 10 September, its garrison of 600 being allowed safe passage to Kalamata, where the Kapudan Pasha had landed an army of six thousand infantry and two thousand sipahi cavalry, and established an entrenched camp between the Kalamata Castle and the mouth of the Nedon River. Morosini called upon the Kapudan Pasha to surrender Kalamata, but the latter refused. In the meantime, the original Venetian army in the Morea, some 8,200 men strong\u20143,100 Venetian mercenaries and 1,000 Schiavoni, 2,400 soldiers hired from the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, 1,000 men provided by the Knights Hospitaller of Malta, 400 Papal troops, and 300 men from the Grand Duchy of Tuscany\u2014was reinforced with the arrival of 3,300 Saxons and placed under the command of general Hannibal von Degenfeld.\nWhen Degenfeld held a council of war, he and most of his commanders held that the Ottoman camp was too strong to be assailed, and that an opinion advising against an attack was to be sent to Morosini. However, Duke Maximilian William of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, who commanded the Hanoverian contingent, opposed this view, urging the council to simply implement Morosini's orders to attack the Ottoman army. This swayed Degenfeld, who gave the order to attack. The Venetian army was drawn up in a line east of the",

    "1987 unsolved rape-murder of a schoolgirl in Malaysia\nOn 12 April 1987, nine-year-old Malaysian schoolgirl Ang May Hong (\u6d2a\u7f8e\u51e4 H\u00f3ng M\u011bif\u00e8ng) was last seen by her eldest brother when the siblings split up while on the way to buy breakfast at a market near her house in Jalan Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Ang's eldest brother, who went back home due to a stomachache, noticed her disappearance when he returned to find her at where he last saw her.\nAfter searching for three hours, Ang's family discovered the naked body of Ang at an empty house in a nearby desolated area. A metre-long piece of wood with nails had been stuffed into her private parts, rupturing her inner organs, and an autopsy report confirmed that Ang was sexually assaulted by her killer(s) before her death, and it was also speculated that at least eight people were involved in her murder based on the teeth marks left on her body.\nIn spite of extensive police investigations and public calls for justice, the murder of Ang remains unsolved till today. The rape and murder of Ang May Hong remains as one of the most horrific murders left unsolved in Malaysia.\nDisappearance and murder\nThe empty house, allegedly a regular haunt for drug addicts, where the naked body of Ang was discovered by her mother.\nOn 12 April 1987, at Jalan Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, a nine-year-old girl was found murdered three hours after she disappeared from a market near her home.\nOn that morning itself, two siblings, 11-year-old Ang Yeow Thian (\u6d2a\u8000\u6dfb H\u00f3ng Y\u00e0oti\u0101n) and his nine-year-old sister Ang May Hong, were walking together from their house to buy breakfast at a nearby market. On the way, Yeow Thian, the eldest of three sons and four daughters in his family, suddenly had a stomachache and decided to head back home to use the bathroom. Yeow Thian told Ang, the family's second child, to stay put and wait for him first while he went back temporarily to ease himself. Ten minutes later, Yeow Thian returned to the meeting point to find his sister, but Ang was nowhere to be found. Full of panic for his sister, Yeow Thian spent at least three hours searching for her, and during this period, he also informed his family about Ang's disappearance. Ang's 37-year-old father and bak kut teh seller Ang Seng Hoo (\u6d2a\u6210\u5bcc H\u00f3ng Ch\u00e9ngf\u00f9) and his wife went to search for their daughter, and several of Ang's neighbors also helped the family to search for the missing girl.\nEventually, after reaching an empty house at a nearby desolated area, where it was allegedly a place of gathering for drug addicts, Ang's 38-year-old mother Yong Yoke Chin (\u6768\u7389\u6e05 Y\u00e1ng Y\u00f9q\u012bng) stumbled upon the naked body of Ang May Hong, and to her horror, Ang's body was not only naked, but a metre-long piece of wood with nails was forcibly inserted into her private parts, and a piece of wire was tightly looped around her neck, and there were multiple bruises and bite marks all over the girl's body. The gruesome discovery left her family devastated. At the time of her death, nine-year-old Ang May Hong was a Standard Three student of Keow Nam Primary, Setapak, and she was survived by her parents, three brothers and three sisters.\nAn autopsy report later showed that Ang was strangled to death by her attacker(s), and she had been raped and sodomized prior to her death. The wooden stick found inside her body had penetrated the internal organs and the heart. After her remains were released back to the family for funeral preparations, Ang's family originally wanted to dress her in red with hopes for her to haunt her murderers for eternity as a ghost but decided against it for fear of her not resting in peace, and dressed her in her favourite blue pyjamas instead.\nInvestigations\nThe Royal Malaysia Police classified the case as murder, an offence that carries the death penalty in Malaysia. Based on the post-mortem examination, the police believed that there were no less than eight people responsible for murdering Ang, based on the number of bite marks found on Ang's neck, body and private parts. There were speculations that the murderer(s) were drug addicts and the description of one of the possible culprits was a Chinese man who could speak Tamil. The autopsy report also revealed that Ang might have bitten one of her alleged assailants before her death. The police also publicly appealed for witnesses to come forward with any crucial information to solve the case, as they believed that there could be witnesses who saw the crime due to it happening in broad daylight.\nThere were a total of three suspects arrested for Ang's murder, one of whom matched the description of the suspect and another was a long-time customer of Ang's father's restaurant. The trio's dental profile were used to make plaster dentures to compare to the teeth marks left on Ang's corpse. Eventually, the police released the three suspects as there was insufficient evidence to connect any of the trio to the girl's murder, and none of their dental profile matched to the teeth",

The people who did this are anti-peace forces. You need to stop doing this. You weren\u2019t successful in the past and you won\u2019t be successful in the future\". The Prime Minister Chief of Staff Fitsum Arega posted on Twitter that an unidentified assailant launched the attack at the rally. The rally organizer, Seyoum Teshome, said that \"the target was the prime minister because the suspect was aiming to throw the grenade by the right side of the stage where he was sitting\".

    "American military diplomat\nWarren Joseph Clear was a lifelong American military diplomat and soldier. His relationship with Japan was complicated. Stationed as a military attach\u00e9 at the American Embassy in Tokyo in the 1920s, Clear also became a member of the staff of the War Department during World War II, where he was devoted to an American victory over Japan.\nEarly life\nIn 1922, Clear was embedded with the Imperial Japanese army as a student Japanese language attache and military observer, learning Japanese customs and trading American knowledge. During that time, as a \"young man,\" Clear was \"tricked\" into an arranged fight with a jiu-jitsu fighter in the Japanese Army. Clear knocked the man out with a haymaker. After the bout, General Kazushige Ugaki arranged for Clear to teach 300 of his men the basics of American boxing.\nUgaki later wrote to Clear:\n\"I am much relieved that you won. With regards to our junior officers, occidental prestige rises or falls on such small things as physical combat between two individuals. They place too much emphasis on such things. They have little sense of proportion. The higher their regard for your military efficiency the harder they will strive to surpass it.\"\nRKO made a film in 1943 called \u201cBehind the Rising Sun,\" starring Robert Ryan, portraying the role of Warren Clear. The film recreated the boxing incident.\nOn 1 September 1923, Clear was living in Tokyo when the Great Kanto Earthquake stuck. It was followed by a devastating fire that swept through the city. This remains the deadliest earthquake in Japanese history. While Clear was in the city rendering first aid and assistance to the Japanese, his apartment burned down, with all of his possessions inside. It took seven years for Clear's claim of $737 to be approved and paid out by the United States government due to a misspelling of Clear's middle initial. His original travel orders spelled his name with the letter \"G\" instead of \"J.\"\nOn 25 January 1925, Clear married Harriet Agnes Aldridge. He was stationed at the American Embassy in Tokyo.\nIn the early 1930s, Clear returned to the United States and got stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco, where he gave speeches to the San Francisco Club and other organizations on the lessons he had learned in his time with the foreign army.\nClear was then transferred to the War Department in Washington, D.C., where he reported to the G-2, and worked alongside Millard Preston Goodfellow.\nWorld War II\nAs the 1940s approached, the soldier was turned spy for a new agency called the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI). William J. Donovan and Goodfellow recruited him and sent him to the Philippines to report on Japanese movements in the Pacific region. He was in the islands in this capacity during the invasion by the Imperial Japanese military, having to resort to eating horses and pack mules to stay alive for several months in the jungles with his men.\nThe quote, \"There are no atheists in foxholes\", was attributed to Clear among other quotes. The phrase became popular after an article Clear wrote in Reader's Digest discussing the invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese and the defence of the Bataan Peninsula; where he attributes it to a Sergeant.\nClear was ordered to protect the vital military intelligence he had gathered above all else. When he escaped the Philippines, he had to leave most of his possessions behind. This included President Roosevelt's beloved stone lions. Clear escaped the Philippines by meeting the submarine USS Trout on a rubber dinghy and sailed on board to another location. However, the airplane carrying him to Australia was shot down by Japanese bombers, and Clear had to compose his entire mission report to the COI from memory.\nIn his famous recounting of the events at Bataan in Reader's Digest, Clear wrote:\n\"As long as they could pull a trigger or fix a bayonet, our men held their ground. Veterans of scores of bloody fights, many of them had been wounded, once, twice, three times, but still had staggered back to stand again with their comrades... But courage alone was not enough. Lack of food was our undoing.\"\nIn 1943, Clear narrated the documentary \"Divide and Conquer.\"\nClear returned to duty at the War Department for the rest of the War.\nLater life\nClear retired in Monterey and Pebble Beach, California, where played golf and participated in many tournaments.\nClear died in 1990, at the age of 84, in Monterey, California. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, where his coverstone mistakenly labels his rank as \"2nd Lieutenant.\"\n",

    "American judge (born 1947)\nAlbert J. Matricciani, Jr. was a United States judge in the state of Maryland, both at the trial and appellate levels of Maryland's state court system. As a trial level judge, Matricianni was in charge of the Baltimore Circuit Court's Family Law Division for five years, and was later instrumental in creating the statewide Business and Technology Case Management Program. He was President of the Baltimore City Bar Association, and served in leadership in numerous entities and organizations of a legal or charitable nature.  \nJudicial service\nMatricciani was an Associate Judge on the Maryland Court of Special Appeals (now the Appellate Court of Maryland), Maryland's intermediate appellate court, from 2008 to 2014; and an Associate Judge on the Circuit Court for Baltimore City from 1995 to 2008. He was appointed to the Circuit Court by Governor William Donald Schaefer in December 1994. He was appointed to the Court of Special Appeals in 2008 by Governor Martin O'Malley.\nMatricciani as head of Family Division and involvement in family law\nFrom 1996-2001, Matricciani was the Judge-in-Charge of the Circuit Court's Family Division. From 1996 to 1998, he was Vice-Chair of the Family Violence Council. From 1998 to 2001, he chaired the Family and Domestic Relations Law Committee of the Maryland Judicial Conference. In 2000, the Women's Law Center of Maryland awarded Matricciani the Rosalyn B. Bell Award. This award recognizes outstanding achievement in family law.\nMatricciani's role in creating Maryland's business court\nMaryland's Circuit Courts are trial level courts of general jurisdiction, and since 2003 have included a business court, the Business and Technology Case Management Program (BTCMP), with specialized jurisdiction over business, commercial, and technology-based litigation. At that time, the BTCMP's emphasis on jurisdiction over technology disputes was an innovation.\nMatricciani played a central role in the actual development and shaping of this new business court. In 2000, Maryland\u2019s General Assembly passed legislation creating a task force to study creating a BTCMP, and it later issued its report recommending that a BTCMP be implemented in Maryland's trial courts. Following that recommendation, Maryland\u2019s highest court (then the Court of Appeals and now known as the Maryland Supreme Court) took on the role of establishing an implementation committee, to design and create this new business court. \nIn 2001, Maryland\u2019s Chief Judge Robert M. Bell delegated the creation of this new business court to Maryland\u2019s Conference of Circuit Judges (the conference). The conference then created the Conference of Circuit Judges Business and Technology Case Management Program Implementation Committee (the implementation committee), consisting of one judge from each of Maryland\u2019s eight circuit courts. Matricciani was selected as the committee judge from the Baltimore City Circuit Court.\nThe implementation committee established multiple working groups, ultimately involving over 150 people.  During this time, Matricciani also chaired the Advisory Council to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (the advisory council). This advisory council provided the implementation committee \u201cinvaluable assistance\u201d in its developing the BTCMP. The advisory council, chaired by Matricciani, met regularly in 2001, and \u201caddressed and attempted to reach consensus on many of the critical issues relating to the establishment of a Business and Technology Case Management Plan in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and a uniform plan in all of the circuit courts throughout the State. In doing so, it ... rendered great assistance and at times insight\u201d to the implementation committee and its working groups.\u00a0 \u00a0\nMatricciani was a Director of Baltimore City's BTCMP from 2001 to 2008, and was one of the first judges assigned to the BTCMP in Baltimore City's Circuit Court when that program became operational in 2003. The first five legal opinions published on the statewide BTCMP website are all issued by Matricciani.\nMatricciani's role as a business court judge was also national. In 2005, he was a founding member of the American College of Business Court Judges. He was also in the first class of state business court judges serving as Business Court Representatives to the American Bar Association's Business Law Section.\nLegal practice\nMatricciani was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1974. He was an attorney with the Legal Aid Bureau from 1974 to 1980, and worked with various private law firms from 1974 to 1995. Before becoming a judge in 1995, he was a partner at the law firm Whiteford, Taylor & Preston, LLP in its litigation department from 1987 to 1995, and after serving as a judge he was at that firm as Senior Counsel from 2014 to 2018.\nEducation\nMatricciani received his B.A. from Villanova University in 1969, his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1973, and an M.L.A. from Johns Hopkins Universi",

Like all streams in the Judean Desert, when it enters the eastern escarpment, approaches the Israeli Great Rift Valley cliffs, and enters the Ein Gedi Nature Reserve, it breaks into a massive waterfall 184 meters high. In this section begins the diverse canyon segment of the stream. \nwater pools in the stream\nThe upper part of the canyon is always dry except during rains and is therefore called the \"Dry Canyon.\" This section contains a cliff with many pools at its base that remain filled with water even in summer. This part of the stream ends at \"Window Waterfall,\" offering a view of the Dead Sea and the Moab Mountains, with two massive cliffs framing the view, giving it its name. At the top of Window Waterfall is \"Window Pool,\" a pool of floodwaters that fills and is suitable for bathing after a major flood. From the pool, one can observe the waterfall's view. Additionally, two more perennial springs are near the stream: the first is \"Shulamit Spring,\" visible as no more than a trickle among a pile of reeds on the path leading from the stream towards the second and more famous spring, Ein Gedi Spring.\nIn its lower part, the stream's waters flow year-round and it is open to the public for a fee. \"Ein David\" is the main spring that feeds the stream with its waters. The spring's source is rainwater that falls in the Judean Mountains, percolates into the groundwater, flows eastward underground, and emerges at the top of Shulamit Waterfall, the first and highest waterfall (about 22 meters) in a series of four waterfalls that flow year-round in the stream.\nGallery\nBurial caves in the river cliff\nRock hyrax\n",

The story concerns a gentleman jewel thief who steals as much for excitement as necessity, and the efforts of a detective to catch him.\nThe play was first produced by Liebler & Company, staged by Eugene W. Presbrey, with settings by Gates and Morange, and starred Kyrle Bellew. It had a tryout and some limited engagements starting in September 1903, before premiering on Broadway during October 1903. The production ran for 168 performances through March 1904, before prior scheduling commitments forced it to close.\nThe play had a brief Broadway revival in 1910, and was later adapted for silent films of the same title in 1917 and 1925.\nCharacters\nCharacters are listed in order of appearance within their scope.\nLead\nRaffles is a gentleman athlete in his thirties, a renowned amateur cricket player.\nCapt. Bedford is a middle-aged amateur detective, who is after the Cracksman for sport.\nSupporting\nHenry Manders is Raffles' younger chum and old school fag, called by him \"Bunny\".\nLord Amersteth is owner of Amsterth Abbey in Milchester, and sponsor of the local cricket team.\nLord Crowley is 20, the son of Lord Amersteth, who has invited Raffles to play cricket with him.\nCrawshay is a \"professor\", Raffles' term for a professional burglar.\nMrs. Vidal is in her mid-thrities, the beautiful wife of Raffles' friend.\nGwendolyn Conron is a young woman, daughter of Lady Melrose and Lord Amersteth, and enamored of Raffles.\nFeatured\nLady Melrose is the wife of Lord Amersteth, the owner of a fine diamond and sapphire necklace.\nLady Ethel\nMarie is a French woman with little English, maid to Lady Melrose.\nMerton is an official detective.\nGoldby is butler to Lord Amsterth.\nBarraclough is Raffles' valet.\nSynopsis\nThis synopsis is constructed from newspaper reviews of 1903. The first two acts take place in the library of Lord Amersteth's country house, while the last two are set in Raffles' apartments at \"The Albany\" in London.\nGuests at Lord Amersteth's country home discuss the mysterious \"Cracksman\" who has escaped detection. Captain Bedford has come to Milchester in belief that Lady Melrose's famous necklace will be the next target. Raffles had been invited to Milchester by Lord Crowley, for his 21st birthday celebration, and brought along Bunny. Raffles and Captain Bedford make a wager of \u00a3100 that the latter will not capture the famous Cracksman. Raffles had spotted Crawshay earlier. Raffles steals the necklace first, leaving Lady Melrose's jewelbox for Crawshay to take. Captain Bedford is dubious about Raffles' alibi, but does not hold him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Vidal has learned of Raffles' secret identity and threatens to expose him unless he accepts her as his mistress. He refuses, but does succumb to the charms of Gwendolyn, who will not be put off with Bunny.\nBack in London, Bunny for the first time learns that Raffles is the Cracksman and has the necklace. They are interrupted by Crawshay, who has followed them. However, Captain Bedford has also followed. Raffles now contrives to help Crawshay escape, lest he peach to Bedford. Gwendolyn visits Raffles, but although in love he will not yield to her. Only after Captain Bedford confirms Raffles is the cracksman, does he return the necklace. Bedford moves to arrest him, but allows him the gentleman's way out. Raffles withdraws behind a curtain, presumably to commit suicide. A pistol shot is heard, but Bedford finds no body behind the curtain. Raffles has escaped thru an extra bedroom door, that comes out into a Grandfather clock in the main room. Bedford tells Bunny that he's glad Raffles got away.\nOriginal production\nBackground\nLiebler & Company was a partnership between investor T. A. Liebler and producer-manager George C. Tyler. Eugene Wiley Presbrey was a playwright who also worked as a stage director for Liebler & Company. Tyler persuaded E. W. Hornung to allow a revision to his original attempt to dramatize Raffles. Hornung mailed his first draft from England to Presbrey in America. Presbrey revised it considerably; among other changes, he added a character called Captain Redwood from an 1886 play, Jim the Penman, to provide Raffles with a significant opponent. The role of Captain Redwood in Jim the Penman had been created by E. M. Holland, who was signed early on to play the same role in Raffles, though the character's name was changed to Captain Bedford. Presbrey used plot elements of two short stories in The Amateur Cracksman, \"Gentlemen and Players\" and \"The Return Match\", which are connected by the affair of Lady Melrose's diamonds. When Presbrey was finished, he mailed the revised p",
    "Syrian Catholic charitable and humanitarian aid organisation.\nCaritas Syria (Arabic: \u0643\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062a\u0627\u0633 \u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627, French: Caritas Syrie) is a Syrian Catholic charitable and humanitarian aid organisation. \nIt is a member of the global Caritas Internationalis confederation and of the regional Caritas Middle East and North Africa.\nHistory and work\nCaritas Syria was founded by the Council of the heads of the Catholic Churches in Syria in 1954, at the time of the Syrian Republic. It was previously known by the French name Commission commune de bienfaisance (\"Joint Charity Commission\"). For a long time, the level of activities of the organisation was relatively limited and localised. In the 1990s, Caritas Syria provided aid to the many Iraqi refugees arriving in the country in the aftermath of the Gulf War. Similar support was given following the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and during the Iraqi civil war (2006\u20132008).\nWith the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Caritas Syria significantly scaled up its work across the country, quickly becoming an important humanitarian actor. The organisation provided relief in the form of food and basic items and was active in the sectors of education, support for the elderly, psycho-social support for children, housing assistance, and repairs of houses damaged by the fighting.\nIn 2015, Caritas provided support to over 205,000 persons in Syria. This support included distributing food and other essential items for everyday use, such as clothes, dishes, blankets, and cleaning agents. Additionally, Caritas offered assistance with rent payments and medical needs, along with education for children and help for the elderly. In general, Caritas Syria provides assistance both in the form of in-kind distributions and of Cash and Voucher Assistance.\nA Caritas employee was killed during a bombing of Aleppo in April 2015; a Caritas volunteer died during another bombing the following year.\nAfter the 2023 Turkey\u2013Syria earthquakes, Caritas Syria also mobilised quickly its network of staff and volunteers to provide help through 71 centres in the most affected area, notably Aleppo and Latakia. They distributed thousands of food packages and hygiene kits and more than 10,000 blankets. Caritas Syria also contributed to the reconstruction of 20 schools and 330 individual shelters. \nDespite being a Catholic organisation, Caritas Syria serves all persons independently of their religious or political affiliations. The organisation works with various religious communities and cooperates with Shiite and Sunnite humanitarian organisations. Activities of Caritas Syria have been funded among other by UN agencies such as UNHCR and other member organisations of the Caritas Internationalis confederation.\nOther Caritas organisations, Caritas Switzerland, also maintains a country office in Damascus and cooperates with Caritas Syria.\nPresidents\n2001-?: Youssef Absi\n2010-2018: Antoine Audo, Chaldean Eparchs of Aleppo\ncurrently: Jean-Abdo Arbach, archeparch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Homs, Hama and Yabroud\n",
    "Family of sugars with a six-carbon ring\nChemical compound\nCyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol is a family of chemical compounds with formula C6H12O6, whose molecule consists of a ring of six carbon atoms, each bound to one hydrogen atom and one hydroxyl group (\u2013OH).  There are nine stereoisomers, that differ by the position of the hydroxyl groups relative to the mean plane of the ring. All these compounds are sometimes called inositol, although this name (especially in biochemistry and related sciences) most often refers to a particular isomer, myo-inositol, which has many important physiological roles and medical uses.\nThese compounds are classified as sugars, specifically carbocyclic sugars or sugar alcohols, to distinguish them from the more common aldoses like glucose.  They generally have sweet taste.\nThese compounds form several esters with biochemical and industrial importance, such as phytic acid and phosphatidylinositol phosphate,\nIsomers and structure\nThe nine stereoisomers of cyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol are distinguished by prefixes: myo-, scyllo-, muco-, D-chiro-, L-chiro-, neo-, allo-, epi-, and cis-inositol.\nAs their names indicate,  L- and  D-chiro inositol are chiral, a pair enantiomers (mirror-image forms).  All the others are meso compounds (indistinguishable from their mirror images).\nRacemate\nThe designation rac-chiro-inositol has been used for the racemic mixture (racemate) of equal parts of the two chiro isomers.   It crystallizes as a single phase, rather than separate D and L crystals, that melts at 250\u2005\u00b0C (which is 4\u20135\u00a0\u00b0C higher than the melting point of the pure enantiomers) and decomposes between 308 and 344\u00a0\u00b0C.   The crystal structure is monoclinic with the  group. The crystal cell parameters are a = 1014.35 pm, b =  815.42 pm, c = 862.39 pm, \u03b2 = 92.3556\u00b0, Z = 4. The cell volume is 0.71270 nm3, or about 0.178\u00a0nm3 per molecule (which is a bit smaller than the typical volumes of other isomers).\nRing conformation\nAs in cyclohexane, the C6 ring of these compounds can be in two conformations, \"boat\" and \"chair\".  The relative stability of the two forms varies with the isomer, generally favoring the conformation where the hydroxyls are farthest apart from each other.\nMelting points\nSome of the stereoisomers crystallize in more than one polymorph, with different densities and melting points \u2014 which range from 225\u00a0\u00b0C for myo-inositol to about 360\u00a0\u00b0C for polymorph \"B\" of scyllo-inositol.  There is a clear correlation between the melting points and the number and type of chains of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyls.\nBiochemistry\nAll isomers except allo- and cis- occur in nature, although myo-inositol is substantially more abundant and important than the others.\nIn humans, myo-inositol is synthesized mostly in the kidneys, from glucose 6-phosphate.  Small amounts of myo-inositol are then converted by a specific epimerase to D-chiro-inositol, which is an important messenger molecule in insulin signaling.\nA 2020 study found detectable amounts of epi-,  neo-, chiro-, scyllo-, and myo-inositol in the urine of women, pregnant or not.  Concentrations of myo and scyllo increased significantly in the third trimester of pregnancy,  with scyllo varying between 20% to 40% of myo. Concentrations of epi, neo, and chiro were always a few percent of those of myo, except that chiro- reached 20% of myo in the second trimester of pregnancy.\nThe bacterium Bacillus subtilis can metabolize myo-, scyllo-, and D-chiro-inositol.and convert to and from these three isomers.\nPhytic acids\nmyo-Inositol hexakis-dihidrogenphosphate, or phytic acid\nPlants synthesize inositol hexakis-dihydrogenphosphate, also called phytic acid or IP6, as a storage of phosphorus  Inositol penta- (IP5), tetra- (IP4), and triphosphate (IP3) are also called \"phytates\"\n",
    "Violent F5 tornado in 1968\nOn May 15, 1968, an extremely powerful and violent multi-vortex tornado hit the communities of Hansell, Hampton, Charles City, Elma and Aredale, all located in the state of Iowa. It killed 13, injured 462, and was one of the largest tornadoes ever recorded in the state. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed, primarily in the town of Charles City. Damage estimates were of more than $20 million, and an unconfirmed winspeed estimate of 528\u00a0mph made this tornado potentially the strongest ever recorded.\nTornado summary\nThe tornado was first sighted by a farmer northeast of Hansell at around ~4:10, and it immediately began to track northeastward, heading towards Aredale. The tornado crossed the intersection that connects Timber Avenue and 175th Street. It then crossed Vine Avenue, damaging structures at an unknown intensity. It entered the Thorn Apple Woods, damaging trees before crossing 200th Street northeast of the woods. It also crossed Franklin Avenue before entering the limits of Aredale. The tornado hit the Bailey Farm southwest of Aredale, heavily damaging a farm but causing no fatalities. The tornado then tracked through the McKinney Farm, destroying almost every building on the property. At around this time, another tornado was briefly reported on the ground, but disappeared shortly after.\nThe tornado then left the limits of southern Aredale, and hit the Landers Farm, located 5 miles northeast of Aredale. Debris from the farm was found over half a mile away. The tornado then began to track through relatively unpopulated areas, crossing multiple unknown streets before tracking parallel to 110th Street for a brief period of time. The tornado began to turn to the north, hitting Floyd Line Street and crossing multiple other streets, downing power lines and damaging structures. The tornado began to rapidly intensify as it hit Kirkwood Road, and crossed  280th Street before beginning to run almost diagonally to Marble Rock.\nAs the tornado tracked passed areas west of Marble Rock, a funnel cloud as briefly seen before lifting.   Another tornado then touched down east of Marble Rock, and would stay on the ground until around 4 miles southwest of Charles City. The tornado crossed the intersection of Miner Avenue and 260th Street, again intensifying. The tornado would pass just south of Oakwood, crossing multiple roads before tracking directly across Avenue of the Saints and entering the city limits of Charles City. The tornado then crossed 215th  Street at F5 intensity, entering downtown Charles City.\nThe tornado began to turn northward in the center of Charles City at ~4:47 PM. The tornado caused extreme damage on 2nd Street, and directly impacted the Charles City City Hall.  It obliterated a row of housed located on the southern end of Kelly Street, before crossing Blunt Street. Heavy damage was documented and observed in northern Charles City, and an unconfirmed windspeed of ~528\u00a0mph was recorded here, which ould make the tornado the strongest in recorded history. As the tornado began to track out of Charles City, it hit 13th Avenue, damaging structures and other buildings.\nThe tornado crossed Triumph Avenue and Underwood Avenue northeast of Charles City, and narrowly avoided the Northeast Iowa Regional Airport. The tornado passed west of Doubleday, causing damage to farms and other structures. The tornado then passed Victory Avenue and crossed an unnamed river before moving south of Nilesville. The tornado also tracked directly east of Colwell, causing an unknown amount of damage to structures.\nThe tornado then started to track through sparsely populated areas of rural northern Iowa, damaging farms but killing nobody. The tornado tracked west of Alta Vista before hitting eastern Elma, heaving damaging many buildings in its' path. The tornado also moved in-between Saratoga and Davis Corners, crossing State Highway 9, before turning slightly northward directly west of Lime Springs. The tornado lifted at ~5:40 PM.\nIn all, the tornado tracked a total of 62.1 miles, killing 13 and injuring 462. The tornado had a maximum width of 0.34 of a mile, and reached F5 intensity at least twice along its' path.\nAftermath\nDamage\nThe tornado caused extreme damage in Charles City and Elma, where a total of  256 businesses and 1,250 homes ere either damaged beyond repair or destroyed. Eight churches, 3 schools were damaged or destroyed, the police station located in north-central Charles City was heavily damaged, and 1,250 vehicles were destroyed. About 60 percent of the city was damaged by the tornado. Cars were thrown, trees ere uprooted, and homes were completely swept away at F5 intensity. The damage costs totaled an estimated $30 million, most of which was centered in Charles City but also spread out across its' entire path.\nFatalities\nThe tornado killed 13 people and injured 462 others. All 13 deaths from the tornado occurred in Charles City. Of those injured, 76 people required hospitalization. ",
    "American theater impresario\nNeely Dickson (May 19, 1877 \u2013 January 25, 1946) was an American theater impresario, drama teacher, and founder of the Hollywood Community Theater (1917\u20131922) and its subsequent school.\nEarly life and education\nShe was born Nelie May Dickson on May 19, 1877 in Franklin Township, Allamakee County, Iowa, to Nancy Elmira Lamira Dickinson Dickson (1853\u20131917) and John Hussic or Huzzie Dickson (1843\u20131910). Both of her parents had similar surnames. Her father was born in Glasgow, Scotland. She had two brothers and four sisters, including Grace (1887-1969), who relocated to Los Angeles to live with her sister and work in the theater as an art director in charge of lighting, sets, and costumes. Nelie changed the spelling of her first name to Neely sometime before 1917, and may have lowered her age by five or six years when she launched her business in Hollywood. Dickson graduated from Northwestern University's School of Oratory circa 1895.\nTheater\nShe received some of her funding from a noted playwright, William C. deMille, older brother of Cecil B. DeMille, who assured an all-star cast for opening night. She started the new theater in a building that had previously been a bowling alley, and was noted in magazines and the news as being modest. The Los Angeles Times hailed the theater as \"one of the most artistically conducted little theaters in America.\" She received published, public praise for her accomplishment from many stars in England and the United States that included Sir J. M. Barrie, John Galsworthy, Charlie Chaplin, King Vidor, Douglas Fairbanks, and Katherine MacDonald.\nAs part of a nationwide little theatre movement, her theater may have inspired Harold Lloyd's 1931 effort, the Beverly Hills Little Theatre for Professionals. They both served as important incubators for new actors, and a means of helping established stage performers navigate to the burgeoning medium of cinema by getting them in front of Hollywood talent scouts. She advertised special coaching for those struggling to make the transition from silent to talking pictures.\nHer theater thrived for five years before losing its lease, and she continued as a successful teacher, sometimes continuing to use the Hollywood Community Theater name for subsequent productions. Actors such as Lawrence Tibbett, Edward Everett Horton, Dana Andrews, and Academy Award winner Conrad Nagle got their start in Hollywood films by debuting in her productions. Other actors who studied with her included Betty Grable, Robert Taylor, Julie Haydon, Rosella Towne, and Paulette Goddard.\n",
    "\nJuan Manuel L\u00f3pez de Jes\u00fas (born December 27, 2005), often known by his nickname \"Juanmita\", is a Puerto Rican amateur boxer. As a juvenile he was a multiple-time national champion and medalist at the 2022 IBA Youth World Boxing Championships as a minimumweight and light flyweight. L\u00f3pez qualified to the 2024 Summer Olympics by winning Section 3 of the flyweight (51\u00a0kg) division of the 2024 World Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament 1.\nEarly life\nL\u00f3pez is the son of Juan Manuel L\u00f3pez, a 2004 Olympic boxer and former three-division world champion whose career spanned the 2000s and 2010s, and B\u00e1rbara de Jes\u00fas. Like his father, he was named after his grandfather. L\u00f3pez and his sister, Belissa, were born during a decade-long prenuptial relationship, which ended after a brief marriage. Due to his constant exposure to boxing, he was always interested in practicing, being often seen in the gym. L\u00f3pez began mimicking other boxers when he was four years old. However, his father tried to veer him away, enrolling him in other sports including karate, baseball and basketball. These ultimately failed to capture L\u00f3pez's long term interest and by his own admission, he did not excel in either. His mother supported the decision to become a boxer, with some resistance from his father. L\u00f3pez officially began training when he was six years old, making headlines in 2012. He shared his father's team at Jos\u00e9 Aponte Gymnasium at Caguas, Puerto Rico, where Belissa also trained. There, his sparring partners were often professional boxers, such as World Boxing Organization (WBO) minimumweight world champion Oscar Collazo, complementing his formation by participating in camps abroad. Even as a teenager, L\u00f3pez also enjoyed studying his father\u2019s fights and scouting videos of his opponents, being regarded by longstanding trainer \u00c1lex Caraballo as a student of the sport. However, he was concerned with \u201cliving under  shadow\u201d, fashioning his boxing style to be different and more technical in order to \u201cforge  own path\u201d.\nAmateur career\nYouth tournaments\nL\u00f3pez made his amateur debut on October 11, 2015, winning his first bout. He was successful during the early part of his career, during which he competed in local tournaments. On August 9, 2016, L\u00f3pez won the Puerto Rico vs. Florida 9 de agosto 2016. In 2019, L\u00f3pez finished second in his youth division at the Puerto Rico National Championships. On July 10, 2019, L\u00f3pez won his division at the Billy Thompson Tournament. He finished the year by defeating the Dominican Representative at the Rep\u00fablica Dominicana vs. Puerto Rico tournament held on December 6, 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic halted sports in Puerto Rico for some time, during which L\u00f3pez was a student-athlete at the Albergue Ol\u00edmpico school at Salinas from which he graduated with honors. While attending this institution, he won the Juegos de Puerto Rico, organized by the Department of Sports and Recreation (DRD). In October 2021, L\u00f3pez entered the XI Copa Cintur\u00f3n de Oro, advancing by defeating Alan Dumacela of Ecuador (5:0). He won the juvenile 48\u00a0kg division by defeating Anthony Pupiales of Ecuador (5:0). On January 25, 2022, L\u00f3pez became the Puerto Rico Youth National Champion. At the Copa Independencia, an exhibition tournament for the national team, L\u00f3pez finished second. The first week of April 2022, he won the Torneo de Desarrollo and Torneo de Barranquitas, both local events. During the summer, L\u00f3pez won the Puerto Rico International Cup and Copa Ol\u00edmpica. L\u00f3pez competed at the minimumweight division (46\u201348\u00a0kg) of the 2022 IBA Youth Boxing Championships, winning his debut over Luka Beshliogli of Georgia (5:0). In his next fight, he defeated Csaba Zsigo of Hungary by third-round stoppage. L\u00f3pez outpointed Talat Yagli of Turkey (5:0) to advance. He secured the bronce medal, losing to Vishvanath Suresh of India by decision 1:4. The Puerto Rico Olympic Committee (COPUR) gave him the 2022 Best Amateur Boxer Award for his performance during the year. In February 2023, he repeated as youth national champion. In June 2023, L\u00f3pez entered the Puerto Rico International Cup, where he represented his gym and won the flyweight division by defeating incumbent youth flyweight world champion Ari Bonilla of Mexico (3:2).\nAdult competition, Olympics\nAfter winning a bronze medal at the Continental Championship, the Federation began considering him and Carlos de Le\u00f3n as top priority for the upcoming Olympic trials, integrating both to the training sessions of the senior national team despite neither being 18 years old at the moment. In December 2023, L\u00f3pez won the adult Puerto Rico National Championship at the Juan Evangelista Venegas Tournament, winning the opportunity to fight for a berth at Paris 2024. In his senior debut he bested former national flyweight champion Yadiel D\u00edaz (3:2). L\u00f3pez, who had gathered an amateur record of 55-10 (5 Kos) which included a three year undefeated streak in Puerto Rico, joined the adult national team despite no",

He is known for founding the Acton Bowen Outreach Ministry, and appearing as a regular faith and religion correspondent on Fox News, and for reportedly being a spiritual advisor to Justin Bieber. However some claims of Bowen's connections with Justin Bieber are disputed.\nCareer\nActon Bowen's career consisted of working as a youth pastor and public speaker. In 2007 he published a \"Escape the noise,\" a devotional book geared towards students that made the New York Times best seller list. He worked at CrpssPoint Community Church in Gadsden, AL, from 2003-2010. In 2011 he founded the Acton Bowen Outreach Ministry, a non-profit organization geared towards youth. Bowen's non-profit organization listed various high-profile politicians as board members and advisors, such as Trent Garmon who at the time was the attorney for former Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore.\nAccording to an article published by the Associated Press In 2012, Bowen worked as an Olympian chaplain alongside 1984 gold medalist Carl Lewis, during the 2012 Summer Olympics. Also in 2012, Bowen toured with music artist Daniel Bashton\nArrest and conviction for 28 counts of child sexual abuse\nIn April 2018, Acton Bowen was arrested by the Hoover police department on one count of deviant sexual intercourse (or second degree sodomy) with a minor who was between the ages of 12 to 15.\nFollowing his initial arrest, Bowen was charged with sex crimes against minors in Etowah County, Alabama, and Jefferson County, Alabama, as well as in Bay County, Florida. Initially, Acton Bowen denied these allegations, claiming he was innocent.\nIn May 2018, Bowen's attorney's requested that judge David Kimberly, who was overseeing the case, remove themselves from the trial. His attorney's argued that there was a conflict of interest, because Bowen's wife at the time was the daughter of Joe Neighbors, who was actively serving as a district judge over in Etowah County. Judge Kimberly recused themselves, and Cullman County Judge Wells Turner II was appointed by the Alabama supreme court to oversee the case.\nOn December 1, following a pre-trial which included witness testimony stating child victims had been abused from 2006 to 2018, Bowen plead guilty to 28 charges related to sexually abusing six teenagers in Etowah County. He was sentenced to 1,000 years in prison for his crimes following his conviction\nIn 2021, Bowen requested the Alabama State Supreme Court to review his case, and possibly reduce his 1,000 year prison sentence. His request was denied.\nPersonal life\nActon Bowen is was born in Gadsden Alabama. In 2015 Bowen married Ashley Neighbors. The wedding took place at the home of Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler, and was officiated by Jay Haizlip, who starred in Preachers of LA, a reality television show that aired on the Oxygen (TV channel). In April 2018, Ashely Neighbors filed for divorce against Bowen following his criminal allegations.\nWhile Bowen's relationship with Justin Bieber is disputed, Devan Leos who was the star of the Disney XD show Mighty Med, made a public statement during an interview with OK!

    "Species of lichen\nCarbacanthographis coccospora is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling) crustose lichen in the family Graphidaceae. Found in Brazil, it was described as new to science in 2002.\nTaxonomy\nCarbacanthographis coccospora was described by the Dutch lichenologist Andr\u00e9 Aptroot in 2002, from samples he collected in the Serra do Cara\u00e7a, Minas Gerais, Brazil. He originally classified it in the genus Graphina. Diagnostic characteristics of the species are its unique globose to ellipsoid, 4\u20136 loculate ascospores and an exciple that is fully carbonised. Aptroot and Robert L\u00fccking transferred the taxon to the genus Carbacanthographis in 2009.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Carbacanthographis coccospora is crustose, metallic greyish in appearance, and can grow up to 5\u00a0cm in diameter. It has a thickness of up to 0.5\u00a0mm and is typically surrounded by a glossy hypothallus about 1\u00a0mm wide. The thallus contains sparse, Trentepohlia (alga)-like green algae.\nApothecia (fruiting bodies) are mostly immersed within the thallus, lirelline (elongated with a slit-like opening), simple, and range from 0.5 to 1.5\u00a0mm in length.

For the events of Keir Starmer's tenure as prime minister, see Premiership of Keir Starmer.\nThe Starmer ministry began on 5 July 2024 when Sir Keir Starmer was invited by King Charles III to form a government, following the resignation of Rishi Sunak after the general election on 4 July 2024.\nBackground\nKeir Starmer formed his government throughout 5\u20137 July, after his party won 411 seats in the 2024 general election, with the new Cabinet first meeting on 6 July and the new Parliament being called to meet on 9 July.  It has been noted for its female political representation, appointing women to a record half of the Cabinet (including Rachel Reeves as the first female Chancellor of the Exchequer in British history) and three of the five top positions in the British government, including Angela Rayner as Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government. It has also been noted for having the lowest proportion of privately educated ministers in British political history. \nStarmer also appointed three politically independent experts: scientist Patrick Vallance as Minister of State for Science, rehabilitation campaigner James Timpson as Minister of State for Prisons, Parole and Probation, and international law expert Richard Hermer as Attorney General for England and Wales. The government includes a few ministers from the New Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including Hilary Benn, Yvette Cooper, David Lammy and Ed Miliband in the Cabinet, and Jacqui Smith and Douglas Alexander as junior ministers.\nCabinet\nChanges\nChanges from Starmer's final Shadow Cabinet to Cabinet.\nThangam Debbonaire (Shadow Culture Secretary) lost her seat and Lisa Nandy was appointed in her place.\nNandy's role (Shadow International Development Cabinet Minister) was a full member of Shadow Cabinet despite the department having merged into the Foreign Office under the previous government and not reformed by Starmer. Anneliese Dodds attends Cabinet as Minister of State for Development.\nDodds served in Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary and party chair, and she is also the junior Minister of State for Women and Equalities, while Bridget Phillipson succeeds her as the senior Minister for Women and Equalities.\nEllie Reeves (Deputy National Campaign Coordinator) was a member of Shadow Cabinet in her previous role that has no government counterpart, and was appointed to succeed Dodds' role as party chair and Minister without Portfolio outside Cabinet.\nJonathan Ashworth (Shadow Paymaster General) lost his seat. Nick Thomas-Symonds (Shadow Minister without Portfolio) was appointed in his place alongside Minister for the Cabinet Office as well as Minister of State for the Constitution and European Relations, but will not attend Cabinet.\nEmily Thornberry (Shadow Attorney General) was not appointed to Cabinet nor any junior ministerial role and returns to the backbench. Richard Hermer was appointed Attorney General from outside parliament and will be given a life peerage to the House of Lords to serve.\nHermer (Attorney General), Alan Campbell (Commons Chief Whip) and Darren Jones (Chief Secretary to the Treasury) merely attend Cabinet, roles that were full members of the Shadow Cabinet.\nThe Lord Kennedy of Southwark (Lords Chief Whip) was a member of Shadow Cabinet, but he not was appointed to Cabinet while remaining in the same role.\nList of ministers\nPrime Minister and Cabinet Office\nDepartments of state\nLaw officers\nParliament\nNon-ministerial appointments\nParliamentary Private Secretaries\nPrime Minister's Office\nParty Officers\nSecond Church Estates Commissioner\n",

    "\nBernard Lerer is an Israeli psychiatrist, researcher, academic and author. He is Professor of Psychiatry at the Hebrew University Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, and Director of the Hadassah BrainLabs Center for Psychedelic Research.\nLerer's research focuses on understanding the biological basis of severe psychiatric disorders and developing safer, more effective treatments, particularly through novel pharmacological approaches and brain stimulation, and investigating the mechanisms of electroconvulsive therapy for depression. He has received the AE Bennet Award of the US Society of Biological Psychiatry (1984), the Distinguished Mentor Award of the Israel Society for Biological Psychiatry (2012), the Pacific Rim Association for Clinical Pharmacogenetics Werner Kalow Prize (2014), the Israel Psychiatric Association Lifetime Achievement Award (2015), and the Lifetime Achievement Award of the International Society for Affective Disorders (2019).\nEarly life and education\nLerer was born in South Africa, completed medical school at the University of Cape Town and residency in psychiatry at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Following a period of research training at Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem with Haim Belmaker, he became a post-doctoral research fellow in biological psychiatry and psychopharmacology at Wayne State University, Detroit under the mentorship of Samuel Gershon.\nCareer\nLerer began his academic career as an instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School from 1976 to 1979, then became a Lecturer from 1979 to 1984, Senior Lecturer from 1984 to 1986, and associate professor from 1986 to 1991, since when he has been serving as a professor. Concurrently, he also held positions at Wayne State University (1982\u20131984) and the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (2008\u20132009).\nLerer assumed leadership roles at hospitals, initially heading the Clinical Psychiatry department at Herzog Hospital in 1984 and subsequently directing the hospital's research laboratory. By 1990, he had established the Biological Psychiatry Laboratory at Hadassah, while also serving as a Clinical Unit Chief in the Department of Psychiatry. In 2013, he co-founded the Hadassah BrainLabs, National Knowledge Center for Research on Brain Disorders, and in 2023, the Hadassah BrainLabs, Center for Psychedelic Research.\nLerer served as Academic Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the Hebrew University and as Vice Dean of the Faculty of Medicine from 2000 to 2002. He has been the Founder and Chair of the Israel Society for Biological Psychiatry, the Founding Editor of the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, and Director of the National Institute for Psychobiology in Israel.\nResearch\nLerer has contributed to the field of psychiatry by studying the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia, psychopharmacogenetics, the mechanisms of antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the long-term effects of early life stress, and optimizing ECT.\nGenetics and pharmacogenetics of psychiatric disorders\nLerer's work led to several findings in the genetics and pharmacogenetics of psychiatric disorders, including the identification of Ahi1 as a gene contributing to schizophrenia susceptibility. He edited the first book on the pharmacogenetics of psychiatric disorders, titled Pharmacogenetics of Psychotropic Drugs. Viewing gene-environment interaction as a key to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, he conducted several studies in this area and, in 1999, published a widely cited paper on the role of early parental loss in susceptibility to depression and other psychiatric disorders.\nThyroid hormone and antidepressants\nLerer analyzed the potential role of thyroid hormone in augmenting antidepressant action, conducting preclinical studies on this topic. In 2007, he published a randomized controlled trial in depressed patients demonstrating the efficacy of triiodothyronine (T3) augmentation of antidepressant effects.\nPsychedelic drugs\nLater in his career, Lerer shifted his focus towards the potential role of psychedelic drugs and psychedelic derived neuroplastogens in treating therapy resistant psychiatric disorders. He established a research group devoted to this topic. His efforts have yielded several original papers including one that explored the pharmacology of the head twitch response, a rodent correlate of the psychedelic trip in humans, one that analyzed the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the anti-obsessive effects of psychedelics and a study that differentiated the effect of psilocybin and psilocybin-containing mushroom extract on neuroplasticity.\nWorking with medicinal chemists, Lerer has designed and synthesized novel, non-hallucinogenic psychedelic-derived compounds. The treatment approaches he and his group have developed include a novel non-hallucinogenic treatment approach for chronic schizophrenia that is based on an original h",
    "French civil servant (1948\u20132024)\nJean Daubigny (18 May 1948 \u2013 2 July 2024) was a French civil servant.\nIn his highest role, he served as Prefect of Paris\u00a0.\nBiography\nBorn in Troyes on 18 May 1948, Daubigny was the son of a school principal. After he attended the Sciences Po and the \u00c9cole nationale d'administration, he entered the prefectural corps, his first post serving as Prefect of Vaucluse\u00a0. He went on to serve as Prefect of Loire\u00a0, Prefect of R\u00e9union\u00a0, Prefect of Marne\u00a0, Prefect of Haute-Garonne\u00a0, Prefect of Ille-et-Vilaine\u00a0, Prefect of Loire-Atlantique\u00a0, and Prefect of Paris. After serving as prefect of Loire-Atlantique, he was appointed director of Minister of the Interior Manuel Valls's cabinet. He then replaced Daniel Canepa\u00a0 as Prefect of Paris. He was then replaced by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Carenco on 1 April 2015. He was considered very affable and diplomatic, which caused his slow decision-making and brevity in Valls's cabinet.\nControversies\nIn 1983, Daubigny, while serving as chief of staff to the Prefect of Police, ordered the destruction of the second series of samples from the Robert Boulin affair\u00a0, which led to a complaint being filed against him for destruction of evidence. However, while the courts ruled that the evidence should not have been destroyed, there was no malicious intent found behind Daubigny's actions.\nTax evasion case\nOn 16 November 2016, Daubigny was arrested in connection with a tax fraud case. He and his wife allegedly failed to file their income taxes with the authorities for several years, evading approximately \u20ac190,000, as well as allegedly failing to pay local housing and property taxes. In September 2017, he was tried for tax fraud from the years 2011 to 2014, with previous years having surpassed the statute of limitations. The charges potentially carried a one year suspended prison sentence and a \u20ac50,000 fine, though he claimed that a blockage prevented him from opening administrative mail; he had not declared his income in 2016 or 2017 and had not asserted his pension rights even though he no longer worked. On 3 November 2017, he was sentenced to an eight month suspended prison sentence. In 2019, he was barred from wearing the Legion of Honour for three years.\nDeath\nJean Daubigny died on 2 July 2024, at the age of 76.\nDecorations\nLegion of Honour (Knight in 1992, Officer in 2001, Commander in 2008) (suspended for three years 2019\u20132022)\nCommander of the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite (2008)\nOfficer of the Ordre des Palmes acad\u00e9miques\nOfficer of the Order of Agricultural Merit\nCommander of the Ordre du M\u00e9rite Maritime (2014)\nOfficer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2016)\nGold M\u00e9daille d'honneur de l'administration p\u00e9nitentiaire\u00a0\nBronze M\u00e9daille de la jeunesse, des sports et de l'engagement associatif\u00a0\nCommander of the Order of Civil Merit\n",
    "English aerospace company\nSent Into Space is an English aerospace company known for providing services that allow members of the public to send objects to the upper stratosphere for marketing or publicity purposes. The company uses weather balloons attached to a craft and has served many large companies.\nHistory\nThe company was founded in 2011 in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, by Chris Rose and Alex Baker. The two met at the University of Sheffield, as they were both pursuing a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering. The two were having a conversation at a pub when they thought it would be interesting to attach a camera to a weather balloon that was launched up to space. After six months of experimenting, they launched the balloon on 17 December 2010, from Rose's backyard. They uploaded a video of their process and photos the camera took to YouTube, which went viral. Many companies and individuals saw this video and requested for the duo to launch their own items to space, so they decided to start a company for it.\nServices\nSent Into Space has been used for publicity stunts, cinematography, scientific research, aerospace research, and education. It has been certified by the Civil Aviation Authority. The company also provides its services to scientists desiring to research the atmosphere. In one mission, the craft was built to take a sample of the atmosphere and discovered a diatom.\nThe company's balloons are made from latex and are biodegradeable. They also use hydrogen as a lifting gas instead of helium as it is a renewable resource. The company also utilizes 3D printing for many of their equipment. The balloons reach 38\u00a0km (24\u00a0mi) on average, taking a few hours to reach that height. The air pressure this high causes the balloon to keep expanding, reaching 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) from an original 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) until it bursts. Then, a parachute is deployed and the craft takes about an hour to reach the ground. Sent Into Space has a software that predicts where it will land.\nAura Flights, formerly Ascension Flights, is an offshoot of the company exclusively for scattering ashes in the atmosphere. It was launched in 2017 after the technology was first developed in 2015. It appeared on the television programme Dragons' Den, but rejected an offer from Deborah Meaden.\nList of objects sent into space\nThis is a select list of the 1,000+ objects the company has sent into space for notable clients.\n",

Israel has been the largest recipient of US financial support to foreign aid since World War II, receiving a cumulative $158 billion through 2023 at current inflation-adjusted prices.\nOn 2016, the United States and Israel signed their third 10-year Memorandum of Understanding on military aid by undertaking $38 billion through 2028, including $33 billion in foreign military aid, plus $5 billion for missile defense, as part of a record. Israel used this aid to finance orders for 75 F-35 joint strike fighters, and stealth aircraft, It has used missile defense programs, including the jointly developed Iron Dome, Arrow, and David's Sling systems. the US sends to Israel Iron Dome air-defense missiles, small-diameter bombs, and JDAM kits which convert unguided bombs into GPS-guided weapons, advanced weaponry such as CH-53 heavy-lift helicopters, and KC-46 aerial refueling tankers.\nlaser-guided missiles for its Apache gunship fleet, as well as 155mm shells, night-vision devices, bunker-buster munitions and new army vehicles.\nThe United States also provides high-level military consultancy to Israel.\nGermany\nAccording to the SIPRI, Germany is one of the main suppliers of armaments to Israel, accounting for 30% of Israel's arms imports between 2019 and 2023.\nAccording to the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development ( BMZ ) report, Germany's defense exports to Israel worth about $353 million have so far increased almost 10 times from last year. the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) reported, that Germany supplies components of air defense systems and communication equipment to Israel. The arms exported included 3,000 portable anti-tank weapons and 500,000 rounds of ammunition for automatic or semi-automatic firearms. Most of the export licenses were granted for land vehicles and technology for the development, assembly, maintenance, and repair of weapons.\nItaly\nAccording to the SIPRI, Italy is one of Israel's three biggest armaments suppliers along with the US and Germany, accounting for 1% of Israel's arms imports between 2019 and 2023. \nCiting to Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), despite the government's assurances that they are under a law that bans the sale of arms to countries that are at war or are believed to be violating human rights, the sale of \"arms and ammunition\" reached $14.8 million last year. Italy's exports include helicopters and naval artillery.\nUK\nThe total value of UK exports to Israel is unclear. In 2022, UK-approved arms export licenses to Israel were worth $52.5 million, but 10 \"open\" licenses were also issued with an unlimited value, the actual value of the export is unclear.

Later, Britain's two premier human rights organizations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch joined the campaign. Calls for an end to arms sales to Israel heightened after three British citizens were killed in World Central Kitchen aid convoy attack by Israel in central Gaza.\nAccording to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, BAE Systems, the largest defense contractor in Europe and the seventh-largest in the world, provides about 15% of the c",

The group still remain active politically, separate from its militant actions, under the named Harakat al-Sadiq wa al-Ataa. The group targeted many bases and soldiers of the U.S. military and the Syrian Democratic Forces. The group has also attacked the The Global Coalition in order to attack Islamic State forces in both Syria and Iraq. The group has also been described as an ally of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps by doing attacks on their behalf.\nThe group allegedly had links to many kidnappings and murders of protesters during the 2019 Tishreen movement including the kidnapping of prominent leaders like Sajad al-Iraqi and Ali Jasb. The group has publicly threatened to terrorize Iraqi civilians who support the United States as a way to undermine what it calls \"American interests in Iraq\". The United States has claimed that the group had involvement in the Tower 22 drone attack against a U.S. base in Jordan in which 3 U.S. soldiers were killed and 34 were injured.\nOn June 17, 2024, the United States Department of State designated the group as a terrorist organization and the leader of the group, Haydar Muzhir Ma'lak al-Sa'idi, as a specially designated terrorist for their targeting of U.S. bases in the Middle East and the involvement of strikes against Israel during the Israel\u2013Hamas war with many of the strikes coming from south Baghdad.

    "\nThe Abe\u00efbara massacres were several massacres carried out by the Malian Armed Forces and Wagner Group against Tuareg civilians in and around Abe\u00efbara, Mali between June 20 and 29, 2024. At least seventy people were killed in the massacres.\nBackground\nFollowing renewed conflict between former Tuareg rebel groups now under the coalition CSP-PSD and the Malian junta aided by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group that began in August 2023, Malian and Wagner forces launched an offensive on the Tuareg rebel capital of Kidal, capturing it in November 2023. Remaining CSP-PSD fighters fled to the rural towns of Abe\u00efbara, Tinzaouaten, and the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains. The Abeibara area also has a presence of the jihadist coalition Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM).\nIn June 2024, Malian and Wagner forces conducted an operation around Abeibara. Their convoys left the towns of Kidal and Tessalit, and settled in Imaswaqassen, a village four kilometers from Abeibara. Clashes broke out with the CSP-PSD in this area between June 21 and 22, and JNIM detonated nine IEDs near and on the Malian and Wagner forces.\nMassacres\nMalian and Wagner forces launched reprisal attacks on civilians, assuming they were harboring CSP-PSD or JNIM militants. These killings took place between June 20 and 29. The son of the chief of Abeibara stated that the Malian and Wagner forces killed old men and shepherds and looted everything valuable they owned. The massacres took place in a forty kilometer radius in the villages of Aghli, Emadjlal, Hidjous, Akomas, Ouzen, and several others. Photos began circulating online of bodies in the streets of the villages. Tuareg civil rights organization Kal Akal dubbed the massacres as an ethnic cleansing campaign against Tuaregs. Malian and Wagner forces also poisoned water wells to kill livestock and civilians in Abeibara.\nThe exact death toll of the massacres is unknown. JNIM reported that 15 people were killed. RFI reported that all of the people were killed were civilians, with the exception of one CSP-PSD fighter and one to six JNIM jihadists. Wassim Nasr reported at least seventy civilians were killed or missing, citing local groups. Some of the bodies were put in mass graves, while others were tied up and scattered in the bush in isolation. No clan of Tuareg was targeted in particular; Ifoghas Tuaregs, Imghad Tuaregs, and Daoussahak were all targeted and killed. Many of the Imghad and Daoussahak were refugees from the M\u00e9naka offensive in 2022 and 2023.\n",

    "\nKhirbet Beit Sila is an archeological site of a Jewish outpost then settlement that was turned into a Christian church during the Byzantine period. The site that is located 2\u00a0km from Ramallah, 3\u00a0km from Giv'at Ze'ev and northwest of Jerusalem, consists of two central areas, one of the ancient buildings and church of Theodore of Sykeon, the second of the necropolis and early structures.\nIdentification\nThe first suggestion of identification was that of A.T. Richardson, that due to the phonetic similarity proposed Beit Sila is Shiloh. Based on his excavations W.F. Albright identified Shiloh at Khirbet Sailun.\nExcavation history\nDuring the 1990's the site of Beit Sila was part of a survey conducted by Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. It was followed by two seasons of excavations that took place between 1997-1998 by the Staff Officer for Archaeology in Judea and Samaria. The excavation revealed a settlement with three main time periods: Hellenistic, Early Roman, and Byzantine.\nArcheology\nThe excavation discovered the site's timeline has three main periods:\nHellenistic period\nBased on the ceramic, coinage and foundations of several building at the site, its establishment dates back to the Seleucid period. Other buildings are dated probably to the Hasmonean period, to the days of Alexander Jannaeus, when an outpost was established there overlooking the secondary road to Jerusalem. Other findings include winepress, columbarium, rock-cut tomb with two benches and collecting pits.\nEarly Roman period\nSignificant discoveries were made at the site dating to the Early Roman period, revealing an active settlement with distinct features. Excavations unearthed the remains of a substantial building that had a public use, measuring 40 by 15 meters, dating from the first century BCE to the first century CE. Next to the building a mikveh was found. Several buildings continued in use with floors raised during this period, likely modified during the First Jewish-Roman war. Artifacts discovered included finely crafted stone vessels, a notable large container (kalal), and a silver half-shekel coin bearing the inscription \"half-shekel\u2014Jerusalem is holy,\" dated to 66 CE. At the settlement's necropolis nine of the 24 rock-cut tombs revealed ossuaries decorated with rosettes, cooking pots and glass bottles, all confirming the Jewish identity of the site's inhabitants during this period.\nByzantine period\nFollowing the outcome of the  First Jewish-Roman war the site was abandoned for 400 years. Then it was reinhabited, buildings were reoccupied with minor modifications, as were two Byzantine-era burial caves. Significant changes occurred in the center of the site, notably the construction of a church. This church was built atop the remains of the Early Roman period's main structure, likely around 500 CE, and remained in use until the Muslim conquest in the early seventh century. Subsequently abandoned and looted, the church was later repurposed by nomads.\nChurch of Theodore of Sykeon\nLintel at Beit Sila\nOil press at Khirbet Beit Sila\nThe excavations revealed an impressive basilica style church with impressive mosaics and inscriptions.\nThe mosaics\nExcept for the apse, all the mosaics within the church feature intricate geometric patterns. In the bema and apse, however, the mosaics showcase diverse designs, incorporating geometric, floral, and animal motifs in a palette spanning white, brown, yellow, gray, blue, black, and red hues. The apse mosaic is particularly notable, featuring two rows of medallions. The outer row consists of 13 medallions, with the central one positioned precisely at the apse's midpoint. Notably, the central medallion of this inner row portrays the head of a fish, symbolizing Jesus.\nThe Liturgical Furniture.\nExcavated marble fragments from the church reveal a diverse array of artifacts. These include a finely carved marble chancel screen and an altar table bearing a burial inscription. Beneath the altar, within a cavity thetre was a there was a reliquary enclosed by a marble slab adorned with a cross holding a strand of hair measuring 19cm. in addition, within a niche a limestone reliquary was discovered. Other discoveries include remains of an offering table near the chancel screen in the bema, and in its north west part a well-preserved ambo made of bituminous limestone. The ambo, standing on its four legs within the mosaic floor, featured a hexagonal platform with an inscription and five panels adorned with stylized crosses and geometric designs. Ornamentation and comparisons with similar churches suggest the church dates to the late sixth century CE, with the ambo standing out due to its exceptional preservation.\nThe Inscriptions.\nWithin the church building five inscriptions were discvered. Two inscriptions were found on the  mosaic pavement, while the other three were carvued om a liturgical furniture. The translation of the inscription was done by L. Di Segni. Inside the tabula ansata of the mosaic carpetthe ",

    "American author and frontiersman (1844\u20131908)\nJoseph Henry Taylor (January 1844 \u2013 April 9, 1908) was an American author, soldier, fur trapper, hunter, and printer. Born in Chester County, Pennsylvania, he served in the Union Army and lived on the Western frontier. He self-published four books on frontier life and nature and was among the first white settlers of Washburn, North Dakota.\nEarly life and military service\nTaylor was born to Quaker parents William and Elizabeth Taylor in Nottingham, Chester County, Pennsylvania, most likely in January 1844. Sources give different birth dates, ranging from 1843 to 1845. Taylor trained as a printer and enlisted in the Union Army on April 20, 1861. Mustered out in August, he promptly reenlisted and served until captured by Confederate forces in Virginia in May 1863. Paroled on condition that he never again fight against the Confederacy, he joined a mounted battalion to patrol Iowa's northern border against feared Sioux attacks. He mustered out in December 1863 and subsequently worked as a hunter and trapper.\nLife on the frontier\nWhile in Iowa, Taylor became engaged to the daughter of another settler. In 1865, he moved to Yankton, South Dakota, to launch and edit the Dakotan, the first Democratic newspaper in the Dakota Territory, under the aegis of Congressional delegate John Blair Smith Todd. While he was away, his betrothed married another man. Heartbroken, Taylor became a frontiersman and wanderer, earning his living as a trapper and hunter along the Platte River and Missouri River and living several years alongside Plains Indians.\nIn 1869, Taylor settled on a homestead in Painted Woods, a settlement south of Washburn, North Dakota, and by 1877 had become a full-time farmer and rancher. As postmaster of Painted Woods, he had his neighbors deposit their mail into a hollow tree trunk rather than having them visit his cabin, reflecting what contemporaries deemed his retiring disposition. In 1887, he opened a small printing office and became editor of the McLean County Mail. He became a justice of the peace for Burleigh County in 1873 and was elected register of deeds for McLean County in 1898. Late in life, he resumed a long-distance correspondence with his former betrothed. Between 1891 and 1904, he self-published four books on frontier life and nature, printing the volumes in his own shop.\nDeath and legacy\nTaylor died of heart failure in his Washburn print shop on April 9, 1908. His remains were embalmed and taken east to be interred in the family burial plot in Oxford, Iowa. His original cabin was moved to Washburn in 1932 and was featured in the town's 50th anniversary celebration. The cabin remains in downtown Washburn and is open to the public as a historic house museum.\nAfter his youthful engagement ended in heartbreak, Taylor never married or had children. He had four brothers and a sister, all of whom also moved to Iowa or even further westward. One brother, Maris Taylor, served as North Dakota's surveyor general.\nBibliography\nTaylor, Joseph Henry (1904). Beavers: Their Ways and Other Sketches.

    "\nThe Siege of Chania happened during the initial stages of Cretan War (1645\u20131669). The Ottomans besieged the Venetian-held city of Chania, and after 56 days of siege, the Ottomans captured the city.\nBackground\nThe Ottoman armada set sail from Istanbul on 30 April 1645. Led by Silahdar Yusuf Pasha, the armada had 416 ships, including ships rented from Dutch and English, and reportedly 50,000 men, including 7,000 janissaries. The Ottoman armada stopped at the Venetian island of Tinos for watering and supplies, they sailed and stopped at Navarino for three weeks. The Venetians thought the Ottomans were heading for Malta. The Tripolitan and Tunisian fleets joined the Ottomans. Yusuf then revealed the true campaign target to his men, Crete. The Ottomans set sail on June 21 and arrived two days later in the bay of Chania, beginning the war for Crete.\nThe Ottomans achieved their first victory by capturing the island of Agioi Theodoroi. The island was defended by Blasio Zulian and 30 men with poor cannons. The small Venetian garrison sunk 2 Ottoman ships. Blasio then set up mines on the fort, blowing himself up, his men, and the fortress to pieces, allowing the Ottomans to capture the fort.\nSiege\nThe Ottomans then advanced both by land and sea towards Chania. They arrived there on 27 June, encamping on the hillsides facing the city and taking over the harbor. The Ottomans landed 7,000 janissaries, 14,000 Siphais, 3,000 sappers, and thousands of Timariots. The Venetian garrison consisted of 12,000 men, an inadequately recruited militia. The Ottomans began unloading their cannons, munitions, and supplies, and they commenced the siege. A barricade was established on Constantine Hill, and Rumelia Beylerbeyi Hasan Pasha and the Kru\u0161evac, Vlor\u00eb and \u0130lbasan Sanjakbeys entered the barricade with seven cannon batteries and Janissaries of Murad A\u011fa. The most intense fighting took place on July 9, when the Ottoman led by Hassan Agha, who fell in battle, routed the Venetians and killed more than 50 of them, and on July 17 when some of the Venetian soldiers escaped during the battle into the sea were killed and captured. The Venetians made a brave but unfruitful defense of the city which lasted for 56 days. The Venetians surrendered to the Ottomans on August 22. The Venetians were allowed the leave for Souda unharmed, and four days later the Ottomans occupied the city, converting Church of Saint Nicholas and two other Churches to mosques. The Ottomans also captured 12 galleys in arsenal. Yusuf then garrisoned the city with 8,000 men.\nAftermath\nThe news reached Istanbul and the city held three days of celebrations with cannons. The news of Chania's fall reached Zakynthos on August 30 just as Tuscan, Spanish, Papal, and Maltese fleets were about to set sail to rescue the city. A vigorous attack on Chania would have saved Crete from the Ottomans; however, the Christian forces were under the papal captain-general Niccolo Ludovisi, who ordered a retreat towards Souda. The Christian forces attacked Chania on October 1 but failed.\n",

    "Sikh online magazine\nsikhchic.com is a Sikh online magazine covering Sikh culture, art, and humour. It is one of the leading online magazines for Sikhs.\nDescription\nSikhchic has been described by scholar Susan E. Prill as serving educated, diasporic Sikhs, most of whom have not been formally initiated into the Khalsa order. The focus of the website is primarily on Sikhs in public culture and Sikh art. sikhchic hosted a satirical cartoon called Sikh Park on its site. Furthermore, the site contains column sections on various aspects of Punjabi Sikh culture. Sikh history-related topics are also covered by the magazine. Sikhs in films, artwork created by Sikhs, and Sikh-designed fashion, are further topics of interest. The website also provided detailed discussion on Punjabi cuisine, music, and humour.\nThe mission statement of sikhchic is as follows:\nThe definition of \"Sikh\", for the purposes of our magazine, is unabashedly a broad one, which includes any and all who are of Sikh origin and/or consider themselves Sikh. We do not attempt to judge others as to who is a good Sikh and who isn't, or who falls in or out of any particular definition.\u2014\u200aSikhChic editorial team, From The Editor's Desk ... (3 July 2007 )\nSikhchic attempts to avoid content that delves too deeply into politics, religion, and news as there already exists a plethora of websites covering those topics. Sikhchic claims to not shy away from controversial or difficult topics, and publishes in the spirit of chardi kala, but they do avoid divisive issues. The editors believe in an open and tolerant attitude towards defining who is a Sikh and that Sikh culture should be given free-reign to develop on its own, not suppressed. The website therefore highlights any Sikhs who have been successful in Western and Indian pop-culture and society.\nHistory\nTapishar Sher Singh conceived of a media outlet serving Sikh interests and aspirations. Whilst growing up in India, he often heard his fellow Sikhs discussing how the most dire need for the Sikh community is media that represents them. He cites two newspapers: The Tribune and Hindustan Times, as being originally founded by a Sikh with the community's funds, having their vision in-mind, but are no longer controlled by Sikhs. He further claimed that existing Sikh media periodicals, such as The Khalsa Samachar, The Sant-Sipahi, The Sikh Review, and Nishaan, do not have the reach needed to bring the wider Sikh community together. He envisioned that with the coming of the Internet age, the low population of Sikhs and their minority status was no longer a valid reason for their voice to be looked-over, as anyone can publish on the Internet.\nSikhchic was launched in 2006.

    "Taiwanese actress\nZine Tseng (Chinese: \u66fe\u9756; born 1993/1994) is a Taiwanese actress best known for her role as Ye Wenjie in the American Netflix sci-fi series 3 Body Problem.\nEarly life\nTseng was born in 1993 or 1994 in the Tamsui District of New Taipei City, Taiwan, to a Taiwanese father and Hunanese mother. She began practicing martial arts at a young age due to the influence of her grandfather, including learning Northern Praying Mantis and nunchucks. She split her childhood time between Taiwan and China, and later moved to the United States, where she completed high school. Tseng continued her studies at the USC School of Dramatic Arts in 2013 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in theater. From 2017 to 2019, she starred in David Henry Hwang's play Chinglish on the invitation of a friend, which sparked her interest in acting. Instead of returning to Taiwan to start a cafe in Taitung City as initially planned, she enrolled at USC again to pursue a Master of Fine Arts in acting and intended to pursue a career in stage performances. However, she deferred her studies for a year in 2021 due to COVID-19 and ultimately quit the program in her second year when she was cast in 3 Body Problem.\nCareer\nTseng made her onscreen acting debut with the 2024 American Netflix sci-fi series 3 Body Problem, adapted from the Chinese novel of the same name. She shared a main role with Rosalind Chao, portraying the younger version of Ye Wenjie, a Chinese astrophysicist who contacted extraterrestrial beings during the Cultural Revolution. While still enrolled at USC in 2021, Tseng was approached by a classmate who majored in directing to audition for the role, and she was selected by director Derek Tsang from a pool of 3,000 contestants. She was required to move to London for an eight-month shoot, leading her to discontinue her master's studies. Tseng also worked on the Mandarin dialogues for the scenes set in China. Her performance was critically acclaimed, with Palmer Haasch of Business Insider calling it \"a brilliant debut performance\" and Therese Lacson of Collider describing it as \"magnificent\", and it earned her Outstanding Performance in a Drama Series at the 1st Gotham TV Awards.\nTseng signed with Artist International Group in August 2023, and she has expressed interest in making her debut in Taiwanese cinema. In 2024, Tseng is cast in a lead role as Princess Gulun Shou'an, a Chinese scholar and martial artist, in Guy Ritchie's upcoming series Young Sherlock.\nPersonal life\nAfter the filming of 3 Body Problem, Tseng returned to Taiwan and is currently residing in the mountain regions of Tamsui.\nFilmography\nTelevision\nAwards and nominations\n",

    "\nThe Battle of Grusz\u00f3wka was an armed clash on 31 August 1943, where Polish self-defence forces smashed the forces of the Banderites sotnias and inflicted heavy losses on them.\nBefore the battle\nBefore the battle was fought, Zasmyki had been constantly harassed by Ukrainian forces, who murdered the population, as on 23 August in the colony of Pi\u00f3rkowicze, where civilians returning to their homesteads to get food were attacked by UPA units. After such incidents, the Poles issued a harsh letter to the Ukrainians, but the Banderites sent an ultimatum to the self-defence headquarters in Zasmyki, and as late as the evening of 31 August a Ukrainian peasant arrived in Zasmyki reporting preparations for an attack on Polish forces and masses of peasants.\nBattle\nAn attack by Ukrainian troops on Zasmyki was expected at the end of August 1943. The defence of this vast settlement was a difficult task due to the limited number of troops and the lack of adequate fortifications. In this situation, the commanders of the Polish units, \"Jastrz\u0105b\" and \"Sok\u00f3\u0142\", decided to carry out an offensive action to pre-empt the actions of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). They adopted the tactic of defence by attack and decided to surprise the Ukrainian forces gathered in Grusz\u00f3wka.\nIn the evening of 30 August 1943, after reviewing the unit, replenishing ammunition and separating the sick, the 50-man unit set off. Together with the unit of cadet \"Gronski\", they set off along a circuitous route through the Litynski forest to the enemy's rear. The march, which lasted all night, was arduous, but the guides led the unit to the right place. On the morning of 31 August, the unit, having passed through bushes near a small lake, made a sudden attack on a dormant UPA unit.\nThe surprise was complete. The Ukrainians did not expect an attack from behind, from the side opposite Zasmyki. The Poles attacked from close range, using small arms and grenades, which forced the UPA to retreat into the bushes. In the first phase of the battle, Private Stanislaw Romankiewicz \"Hare\" was killed. His colleagues managed to load him onto a farm wagon, but during the retreat he was hit by a fatal series from an enemy erkaem. A Ukrainian machine gun, previously well dug in, hampered the Polish advance. Sergeant Jan Czajkowski \"Lipiec\" took advantage of the cover of thick pines and approached at a distance of several metres, neutralising the enemy with a long series from the machine gun. The captured Tokarev machine gun passed into the hands of Polish soldiers.\nLieutenant \"Sokol\" directed the third squad to the edge of the forest on the left side of the road. Despite enemy fire, a dozen Polish soldiers managed to come into close contact with the UPA positions. The systematic approach of the Polish soldiers forced the Ukrainians to flee. On the left wing, the team of PFC Edmund Gaw\u0142owicz \"B\u0142ysek\" was attacked by several dozen peple. As a result of a grenade explosion, the squad leader was seriously wounded and called for help. On the right wing, cadet Tadeusz Korona \"Gro\u0144ski\" captured carts with ammunition and a field kitchen full of poultry prepared for the UPA. Agricultural equipment intended for the murder of the Zasmyk population was also captured. The fighting gradually quietened down and the scattered UPA fighters tried to re-group, but they no longer posed much of a threat.\nAftermath\nThe victory of the Polish unit was complete. The threatening grouping of bandits was broken up and dispersed. The Poles captured a hand-held machine gun, a dozen rifles and a considerable amount of ammunition.\n",
    "Badminton tournament\nThe knockout stage for the 1967 Thomas Cup began on 31 May 1967 with the first-round knockout and ended on 10 June with the final tie.\nQualified teams\nThe teams that won their zonal tie qualified for the final knockout stage.\nBracket\nFirst round\nThe first inter-zone tie in Jakarta pitted Denmark against Malaysia. \"On paper\" they were the two strongest teams in the tournament with recent major event champions such as Erland Kops, Henning Borch, and Svend Andersen (Pri) for Denmark, and Tan Aik Huang, Ng Boon Bee, and Tan Yee Khan for Malaysia. With wins by Kops in singles and Andersen and Per Wals\u00f8e in doubles, Denmark was able to stay even (2\u20132) on the first night of play. On the second night, however, a familiar pattern recurred for the tropically challenged Danes as they wilted in the heat to drop all five matches. In the other semifinal Japan's tiny but \"jet-propelled\" Ippei Kojima won all four of his matches to trump a crowd-pleasing performance by 35-year-old Jim Poole and lead his team to a 7\u20132 victory over the USA.\nJapan vs United States\nDenmark vs Malaysia\nSecond round\nThe inter-zone final between Malaysia and Japan was less suspenseful than the 6\u20133 final score might indicate. Though two of the first five matches were very close Malaysia won all five to clinch the contest early. The powerful doubles team of Boon Bee and Yee Khan remained undefeated in the series while Masao Akiyama performed well in defeat for Japan.\nMalaysia vs Japan\nChallenge round\nIndonesia vs Malaysia\nThe most unusual finale in Thomas Cup history, the challenge round of the 1967 competition was full of firsts and lasts. It was the last actual challenge round since a subsequent rules change would end the defending champion's privilege of having only to defend the Cup against a single challenger. Politically, it was first Thomas Cup finale in which the former Malaya (minus Singapore but with additional territories) competed as Malaysia, and the first finale in which domestic turmoil caused Indonesian players of Chinese ethnicity to take \"Indonesian\" names. Thus veteran doubles player Tan King Gwan became Darmawan Supatera and Ang Tjin Siang became Muljadi. It was the first Thomas Cup appearance of Indonesia's badminton wunderkind Rudy Hartono (two months before his eighteenth birthday). It was the last appearance for Indonesia's past Thomas Cup hero Ferry Sonneville. For reasons unclear, he was pressed into service in one of the top two singles slots ahead of younger men who were by then almost certainly stronger players than the 36-year-old Sonneville. Most notably, it was the first and thus far the last final tie of Thomas Cup not to determine a champion on the court.\nThe first day's play ended with a 3\u20131 advantage to Malaysia. With relentless attacking play Hartono stunned Tan Aik Huang 15\u20136, 15\u20138, but Malaysia won both doubles matches and the singles between Yew Cheng Hoe and Sonneville. On the second night Tan Aik Huang routed Sonneville to bring Malaysia to the verge of victory. At this point, however, young Hartono comfortably beat Yew Cheng Hoe to keep Indonesia's chances alive. Then Muljadi pulled away in the second game after winning a close first to beat Malaysian veteran Teh Kew San at third singles. Still up 4\u20133, Malaysia sent the world's number one doubles team of Ng Boon Bee and Tan Yee Khan onto the court to gain the vital fifth point. They seemed to be doing so easily until, up 10\u20132 in the second after steamrolling Muljadi and Agus Susanto in the first game, a few errors crept into their play. This encouraged ebullient Indonesian fans to try to promote a Malaysian collapse by making deafening noise on Malaysian serves, using flash photography at well timed moments, and ever more loudly cheering Malaysian errors. With no help from Indonesian authorities, IBF (BWF) officials intermittently appealed for \"fair play\" but in vain because the crowd's tactics were working. Plainly rattled, Boon Bee and Yee Khan let a 10\u20132 lead slip away into a 13-18 second game loss. \nAt this juncture, during what would normally have been a five-minute break between games, tournament referee Herbert Scheele requested Indonesian authorities to clear the stadium and have the match continued with the crowd locked out. When this request was refused Scheele, at some personal risk, halted play. Eventually, a less than candid announcement that the match had been voluntarily suspended did help to clear the stadium, but play was never continued. Indonesia rejected a subsequent IBF (BWF) ruling that the tie be resumed in New Zealand. Thereby, it forfeited the remaining matches. Officially, if not convincingly, by a 6\u20133 margin Malaysia regained the Thomas Cup.\n^1  Play suspended and match eventually conceded to Malaysia\n",

    "Map of the M\u00fcnchner Stadtb\u00e4che on the left bank of the Isar\nCity streams running through the city Munich or the M\u00fcnchner Stadtb\u00e4che in German are a system of now defunct waterways which used to flow through the city of Munich. Originally natural streams branching off Munich's major waterway, the Isar River, they were later canalized and played a crucial role in the economic development of Munich in the Middle Ages up to the 19th century. Most of the streams have since been drained or culverted underground, but many of the numerous fountains within Munich today and streams in the English Garden, can be traced back to these original city streams.\nHistory\nHistorical city map of Munich by Tobias Volckmar (1613) with highlighted city streams\nThe geology of Munich and its surrounding area of a gravel plain, which the Isar river runs through. As a result of this type of ground the Isar often split and changed course in the area. In the Middle Ages the Isar also branched into several side steams in the area which also changed course often.\nThe medieval residents of Munich harnessed these streams as an way of powering their mills and canalised the streams to fix their course. As the city grew new canal were built, taking water from the streams only to rejoin them downstream. Resultantly, Munich developed a networked of streams. Individual parts of the network were usually named after the mills along them, with a single streams often changing their name several times along its course. The streams off the left bank of the Isar were mostly branches of the Gro\u00dfer Stadtbach.\nCovering of the Schwabinger Bach 1890\nA variety of medieval industries grew along these streams, alongside grain mills were workshops using waterwheels for stamping, hammering, sawing, and grinding. The streams were also used to feed a moat surrounding Munich's city walls.\nWith the growth of the town, the streams became polluted by industry and full of waste. This made them unfit to be a source of drinking water in the city, which was instead obtained from groundwater wells. From the 16th century onwards, the water power of the streams was also used in Brunnh\u00e4user, which were pumphouses used to extract the groundwater into water towers and then piped into houses. The waste dumped within the streams as well as sediment from the Isar often reduced the speed of the streams and the amount of power available to the pumps and mills so the canals had to be dredged often.\nThe onset of the industrial revolution and the invention of the steam engine led to the city streams losing their industrial function. With the construction of drinking water pipes and sewer system, the city began the process of draining or filling in defunct streams or culverting others underground. By 1900, only small sections of some streams remained above ground. Finally, in the 1960s around 17.5\u00a0km of city streams existed but several tracts were seen as an \"unacceptable obstacle\" to the expansion of the Munich U-bahn. Thus by 1967, only 5.5\u00a0km of city streams were left.\nPresent day condition of the streams\nExposed Westerm\u00fchlbach in the area of the former Rodenstock site, now with residential buildings (2016)\nWhile the city streams originally branched directly from the Isar, today they are fed by the Isar-Werkkanal, which is diverted from the Isar at Baierbrunn, south of Munich and runs alongside the left bank of the Isar.\n A part of the water from the Isar-Werkkanal downstream is redirected back into the Isar through hydroelectic plants, with the small amount remaining continuing to run into channel that used to be the Gro\u00dfer Stadtbach. This then runs into the old Westerm\u00fchlbach. The Westerm\u00fchlbach stream was preserved as it used to function as a cooling water inflow for the M\u00fcllerstra\u00dfe heating plant, which was decommissioned in December 2001. The Westerm\u00fchlbach still largely runs above ground today.\nNear Sendlinger Tor, the Glockenbach today flows underground into the Westlicher Stadtgrabenbach, which encircles the old town to the west and surfaces for a short section in Hofgartenstra\u00dfe. There it splits into the K\u00f6glm\u00fchlbach which was recreated in 1992 on its medieval course as an aesthetic feature of the Bavarian State Chancellery. The stream flows underground at the English Garden and becomes the Schwabinger Bach through the English Garden.\nStadtm\u00fchlbach\n After the closure of the city streams a new water inlet from the Isar had to be constructed to provide water for the stream network within the English Garden. This is from an underground a canal from the Isar with its inlet at Mariannenbr\u00fccke. Today, the Fabrikbach splits into the Stadtm\u00fchlbach and the Stadts\u00e4gm\u00fchlbach, which can be seen in the courtyards of the Wacker building on Prinzregentenstra\u00dfe.

His major work is the Monument to Grand Duke Gediminas, a public sculpture in Vilnius in captal city of Lithuania, commissioned in 1992 and erected in October 1996.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nKa\u0161uba was born in Minsk on 15 August 1915, where his parents, who fled Lithuania during the World War I, lived. After returning to Lithuania, the family settled in Liudvinavas and later moved to Marijampol\u0117. It was there where the sculptor grew up. Ka\u0161uba became interested in the arts as a child, apparently encouraged by his older brother, who taught painting at school.\nAfter studying at Rygi\u0161ki\u0173 Jonas Gymnasium, he moved to the newly opened Marijampol\u0117 School of Crafts and graduated from the woodcarving class in 1934. A year later, after working for a while in the workshop of sculptor Juozas Zikaras, he enrolled in and graduated from the Kaunas School of Arts in 1939.\n\nLife in Lithuania\nIn 1942\u20131943, Ka\u0161uba became a lecturer in applied and decorative arts and sculpture and later the head of the department in Kaunas Institute of Applied and Decorative Arts. He assisted Juozas Mik\u0117nas and Jonas Prapuolenis in the creation of their works.  In 1937, at the Paris World Exhibition, Ka\u0161uba was awarded gold and silver medals for his statue of R\u016bpintoj\u0117lis and for carved ornaments on the furniture of Prapuolenis. During the Second World War, fearing the approaching Soviet army and possible deportation to Siberia he fled to Germany in 1944 with his future wife Aleksandra Fled\u017einskaite and arrived in the United States in 1947.\nLater life\nAfter arriving in the United States, Ka\u0161uba and his family struggled like many other Lithuanian \u00e9migr\u00e9s. By that time he and his wife Aleksandra had two children. Ka\u0161uba worked for a furniture company in New York until 1961.\nCareer\nKa\u0161uba's most famous work - Monument to Grand Duke Gediminas.\nAt the beginning of his career, Ka\u0161uba created monumental sculptures, during the Second World War, a relief  - \"Liberation of Prisoners\" (1942), for which he was awarded a prize at the Lithuanian Artists Exhibition in Kaunas.  Since 1952, he has mainly created reliefs in lead.  In the 1980s he created sculptures (mainly portraits of women) in plaster, bronze and cast stone. In the 1980s, he created reliefs \"The Journey\", \"The Journey of Being\", \"Day by Day\".\nKa\u0161uba exhibited his works at the 1964 World's Fair in New York, Ka\u0161uba created wall relief panels of images of saints for the Vatican Pavilion, using and reviving the medieval technique of repouss\u00e9, which had not been used before in America. He participated in numerous other exhibitions in various cities around the world. In 1975, he was awarded the grand prize of the New York \"Culture Hearth\" for the project \"Monument to Christianity. Mindaugas\".  In 1984, he received the Lithuanian-American Community Prize in Brooklyn, and in 1992 - the Grand Prize for the project \"Monument to Gediminas\".

In 1994 Ka\u0161uba was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Vilnius Academy of Arts.\n",
    "Spanish voice teacher, tenor, writer and journalist\nEmilio Yela de la Torre, better known as Emilio Belari, (c. 1837 \u2014 18 May 1907) was a Spanish voice teacher, tenor, writer on vocal pedagogy, and journalist.\nLife and career\nEmilio Belari was born Emilio Yela de la Torre in Madrid  in c. 1837. His family was part of the Spanish nobility, and his mother was the cousin of Agust\u00edn Fernando Mu\u00f1oz y S\u00e1nchez, 1st Duke of Ri\u00e1nsares who married Queen Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies.\nBelari began his professional life working as a journalist for newspapers in Spain. He worked for future Spanish Prime Minister Pr\u00e1xedes Mateo Sagasta who was an editor of the newspaper La Iberia, and the two men developed a close friendship. He then trained as an opera singer and performed as a leading tenor at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre italien de Paris\u00a0; drawing acclaim on the European stage.\nBelari then studied medicine and after completing his medical degree used his knowledge of human biology and singing to become a celebrated voice teacher and writer on vocal pedagogy. He began teaching singing out of a studio in Paris. He placed an emphasis on understanding the science of human anatomy, such as the vocal cords, within his approach to teaching vocal music. Under his birth surname, Yela de la Torre, he published the book La voz\u00a0: su mecanismo, sus fen\u00f3menos y su educaci\u00f3n seg\u00fan los principios de la f\u00edsica, la anatom\u00eda y la fisiolog\u00eda (English: The voice: its mechanism, its phenomena and its education according to the principles of physics, anatomy and physiology) in 1872. In 1883 his book The Secrets of the Voice in Singing was published under the surname of Belari. This latter book was recently republished by the Frankfurt academic publisher Outlook Verlag in 2024.\nIn c. 1882 Belari came to the United States with his own touring opera company. It was not successful. He became a highly regarded teacher of singing in New York City where he taught for twenty-five years until his death. He taught several famous vocalists, including Lillian Nordica. Other notable pupils included soprano Nita Carritte and bass, voice teacher, and choral conductor Edward M. Zimmerman. He also was the voice teacher of numerous upper society ladies of New York, among them Arabella Huntington (wife of Collis P. Huntington) and Louise Whitfield Carnegie (wife of Andrew Carnegie).\nBelari died on 18 May 1907 at the age of 70. His death resulted from a fall out of his bedroom window in an apartment on the seventh floor of a building located at 824 W. 57th St. It was deemed a suicide by the New York City coroner, although the initial police investigation was unable to definitively make that claim. The Musical Courier obituary did not claim the event was a suicide stating instead that friends of Belari considered the fall \"an accident\" and \"a mystery\".\n",
    "Species of frog\nRanitomeya toraro, the Apurin\u00e1 poison frog, is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae. It is endemic to Colombia and Brazil and possibly nearby Peru.\nTaxonomy\nScientists used to classify this frog as conspecific with Adelphobates quinquevittaus and Ranitomeya ventrimaculata under the names Dendrobates quiquevittatus and Dendrobates ventrimaculatus but reevaluated the classifications in 2011.\nDescription\nThe adult frog measures 15 - 17  mm in snout-vent length. The toes of all four feet have climbing disks. The skin of the frog's head and back is black. It has stripes, like other frogs in Ranitomeya, but they are thinner and narrower. This frog has stripes from its eyelids to its vent and one in the middle from the snout to the vent. There is a yellow spot on the snout. There is a ventrolateral stripe that is green-blue in color near the front legs and yellow near the groin. The chin is yellow in color with black spots. The belly and legs are black with light blue patterns that form ovals.\nHabitat\nThis frog lives in undisturbed primary and secondary forest in Amazonia. The frogs have been found on leaf litter, on logs, and on branches as high as 35 cm higher than the ground.\nLife cycle\nScientists have observed two clutches of eggs, one above a pool of water in a bromeliad plant, and one single egg above a pool of water in a bananeira-brava plant. They have also observed tadpoles swimming in the pools in P. guayanese  and Heliconia plants, one tadpole per pool. Scientists think the tadpoles might engage in conspecific cannibalism. They have also seen adult male frogs carrying tadpoles on their backs. Other frogs in Ranitomeya carry their tadpoles to transport them from one pool of water to another.\nThreats\nThe IUCN classifies this frog as least concern of extinction because of its large range and population. Scientists believe it might be at some risk of capture for the international pet trade, but no one has been caught selling it yet as of 2023.\n",

    "\nGerman rapper (born 1997)\nMusical artist\nAugust Jean Diederich (born 3 November 1997), famously known as Ski Aggu, is a German rapper. He is known for wearing ski goggles.\nEarly life\nSki Aggu grew up in Berlin-Wilmersdorf. His grandfather is the SPD politician and political scientist Nils Diederich.\nAccording to himself, he lived in Ireland for a while, where he intensively pursued the martial art Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and eventually became the Irish champion in his weight class. Martial arts also feature in his online presence and music videos in the form of poses.\nMusic career\nSki Aggu performing (2023)\nSki Aggu began releasing music on SoundCloud in 2018. His early work already focused on partying, though the tone was darker and more melancholic. Ritter Lean\u00a0 frequently appeared on his tracks.\nHe released his first single Wei\u00dfwein & Pappbecher in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, he has been releasing new tracks regularly. His second song, Super Wavy, a collaboration with YFG Pave, remained his most streamed song on Spotify until the release of Party Sahne in 2022.\nAfter some club concerts from summer 2021, Ski Aggu performed at several festivals in the German-speaking region a year later, such as the Heroes Festival\u00a0 in Geiselwind, splash!, Poolbar Festival and Frequency. For the track Hubba Bubba released in 2022, he collaborated with Berlin music producer Southstar.\nHe achieved his breakthrough in October 2022 with the song Party Sahne, featuring producers Endzone\u00a0 and Ericson.

    "Judicial Innovation Fellowship Logo\nThe Judicial Innovation Fellowship' is a technology policy fellowship that places technologists in state, local, tribal and territorial courts. Tech experts and professionals spend one year with a court focused on improving court administration to the benefit of the public. An access to justice program, the projects JIF (pronounced \"Jif\", like the peanut butter)fellows focus on helping court modernize their technical infrastructure, process, and design of public facing websites and tools that are built for people who cannot afford an attorney. The program is piloted at the Institute for Technology Law and Policy at Georgetown Law.\nBackground\nThe program was initially proposed in 2022 as a Day One proposal published by the Federation of American Scientists and written by Cori Zarek, Miguel Willis, Jameson Dempsey, Tanina Rostain, and Jason Tashea.  Originally, the authors proposed that \"Congress should create and fund a Judicial Innovation Fellowship that brings experienced technologists and service designers into state, tribal, and federal courts to improve judicial administration, transparency, and access to justice, like programs in the U.S. federal executive and legislative branches (such as the United States Digital Service and TechCongress.\" Congress did not create the program. Instead, the program was seeded by the New Venture Fund with supplemental funding provided by the Pew Charitable Trusts, the State Justice Institute, and the Utah Bar Foundation. JIF co-founder Jason Tashea was made the founding director in 2023.\nLogistics\nJIF published a \"roadmap\" based on over 100 interviews with experts in justice sector reform, government technology, and fellowship programs.  The document identified common pain points experienced by courts across the United States, including the need for improved user-centered design, cybersecurity, data infrastructure, and calendaring and scheduling.\nIn 2023, JIF launched a national call for proposals and fellows. Three pilot sites were chosen, which each received a fellow with a skillset pertinent to the project. Some fellows had hybrid placements, while others worked full-time in their courts. Fellows are employees of Georgetown Law and received salaries between $85,000 and $95,000.\nProjects\nFor its first cohort of fellows, JIF placed three fellows across three courts. Those courts were the Utah State Courts, the Kansas State Courts, and the Hamilton County, Tennessee General Sessions Court. The projects in Utah and Kansas focused on bringing user-centered design to public-facing, online tools developed by the courts, like electronic court filing.  In Hamilton County, the project focused on improving court data infrastructure and software documentation regarding both civil and criminal legal case management.\n",
    "Tribe in Pakistan and Iran\nGichki or Gitchki is a Rajput tribe living in the Makran region of Pakistan and Iran. The tribe, initially settled in the Gichk valley of Panjgur and now mostly Balochi-speaking, formed ruling class of the state of Makran from 1740 until 1955.\nOrigins\nThe ancestors of Gichki, stated to be Rajputs, arrived during the 16th century in Makran from north where they had settled after coming from Punjab or Rajasthan. Ethnically they are not of Baloch stock and instead have roots in the Indus Valley. Since they were not pastoralists unlike the Baloch or as numerous as the already settled population of Makran, some scholars consider it likely that Gichki migrated as a group of mercenaries, and conquered Makran through diplomacy and by establishing alliances with the ruling families. The historian Fiorani Piacentini believes that the close association of Gichkis with Zikrism, a local heterodox sect, also played an important role in their rise to power.\nHistory\nThe political turmoil in Makran during the 17th and 18th centuries attracted several bands of raiders from the neighbouring regions; among them were Buledi, Gichki, and Nausherwanis, who later established their state in Kharan. According to a locally well-known tradition from Makran, the ancestors of Gichki were forty Rajput horsemen from north; in an alliance with Buledi, Gichki killed the then ruler of Kech, a certain Malik Mirza. Soon conflict broke out between the two tribes and Gichki ousted Buledi as well, hence gaining complete control over Makran. Fabietti considers the factuality of some of the details mentioned in this account uncertain, although he believes that the migration of Gichki Rajputs and the struggle between them and Buledi probably had a historical basis.\nHistorically, Gichki appeared in Makran in the 16th century. They drove out Buledi after 1740 under their chief, Mulla Murad. Gichki were Zikris like Buledi, and Mulla Murad Gichki is considered one of the major Zikri figures. He organised Zikrism as a faith and chose Koh-e-Murad as its central pilgrimage site. During the rule of Murad's son Malik Dinar Gichki, Makran was invaded nine times by the Khan of Kalat, Nasir Khan Brahui and Gichki were forced to pay half of their revenue to him. The advent of British rule weakened the influence of Kalat, allowing Gichki Nawabs to assert their internal independence again. The last Nawab, Mir Baian Gichki acceded to Pakistan in 1947.\nSocial organization\nDespite their origins, Gichki are considered members of the Baloch society and speak Balochi, a trend which they share with other ethnic groups of non-Baloch origins such as Jats, Lasi, Dihvar and Brahuis. Gichki are divided into two major branches, Isazai and Dinarzai, which previously ruled Panjgur and Kech respectively. They were initially Zikris, and only gradually converted to Sunni Islam after Mir Nasir Khan of Kalat undertook military campaigns against them. Gichki castles in Kech were surveyed by Fiorani Piacentini et al. between 1987 and 1991, who described their architecture as a blend of Rajput heritage of Gichki Nawabs and the Persian culture followed by them.\n",

    "Spanish bullfighter (1964\u20131985)\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Cubero and the second or maternal family name is  S\u00e1nchez.\nJos\u00e9 Cubero S\u00e1nchez (Spanish pronunciation: ; 16 April 1964 \u2013 30 August 1985), known as el Yiyo, was a Spanish bullfighter. He died at the age of 21 during a bullfight at the bullring in Colmenar Viejo when a bull named Burlero gored him in the heart.\nLife\nBorn in Bordeaux, France, to a Spanish emigrant family, Cubero was brought up in Madrid's Canillejas neighbourhood. He was a prominent alumnus of the Escuela Nacional de Tauromaquia (\"National Bullfighting School\") at the Venta del Bat\u00e1n, a complex in the Casa de Campo, Madrid's biggest public park. In 2016, it was given the name Escuela Taurina de la Comunidad de Madrid el Yiyo (ETCM Yiyo) in Cubero's honour. In February 1980, he made his d\u00e9but with picadores in San Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes, where he shared billing with Carlos Arag\u00f3n and Antonio Amores. This same year, he led the ranking among novice bullfighters (novilleros) and thereby won the famous Zapato de Oro (\"Golden Shoe\") of Arnedo.\nCubero received the alternativa as a bullfighter on 30 June 1981 at the Plaza de Toros de Burgos, a bullring in Spain's north. Standing as \"godfather\" was \u00c1ngel Teruel, while Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Manzanares stood as witness; the fight was with the bull Comadrejo, raised by J. Buend\u00eda. Cubero's confirmation came on 27 May 1982, at the Feria de San Isidro (\"Saint Isidore's Fair\"\u00a0\u2014 a yearly event at the Las Ventas bullring in Madrid). Standing as \"godfather\" this time was Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Manzanares, while Emilio Mu\u00f1oz stood as witness; the fight was with the bull Bohemio, raised by F\u00e9lix Cameno.\nMonument in homage to el Yiyo in Colmenar ViejoCubero twice came out of the Great Gate at Las Ventas, on 1 and 9 June 1983, although he had also appeared at Spain's foremost bullring as a novillero in 1981.\nOn 26 September 1984, el Yiyo shared the billing in Pozoblanco with Francisco Rivera, known as \"Paquirri\", on the day when the latter was fatally wounded by a bull named Avispado, which he had assumed to be dead. In popular culture, this billing is held to be cursed (Cubero would himself be killed in the bullring less than a year later, in a very similar way).\nDeath\nHaving become a bullfighting benchmark and giving many fans hope for his prospects, and thus enjoying great popularity, on 30 August 1985, Cubero substituted for Curro Romero at the Colmenar Viejo bullring to perform alongside Antonio Chenel (\"Anto\u00f1ete\") and Jos\u00e9 Luis Palomar, with bulls supplied by Marcos N\u00fa\u00f1ez. That afternoon's sixth bull, named Burlero, gave Cubero a fight that ended with an estocada (the sword thrust meant to kill the bull) from which the bullfighter bounced away. He rolled over the ground and his subalternos came out to help, but the bull made straight for Cubero and wounded him, taking the young bullfighter by the armpit. The bull's horn gored Cubero right in the heart, splitting it in two; Cubero was killed almost instantly, but still managed to say to his friend in a weak voice \"Pali, este toro me ha matado\" (\"Pali, this bull has killed me\"), before dying. He was twenty-one years old. His funeral was held at Las Ventas in Madrid; on hand were authorities, fellow bullfighters and fans, and he was borne shoulder-high among the crowd to the Cementerio de la Almudena, where he was buried.\nBy way of homage, there is a sculpture of Cubero outside the Colmenar Viejo bullring, and another sculpture in his memory outside Las Ventas, Luis Sanguino's work. In 1985, the well-known journalist and writer Antonio D. Olano wrote the book Yiyo.

    "Albanian football club\nFootball club\nKFF Ada were an Albanian women's professional football club based in Velipoj\u00eb. They last competed in Kategoria Superiore Femra during the 2012\u201313 season, finishing 1st in an eight-team league.\nAda Velipoj\u00eb would go on to become the most successful club in the history of women's football in Albania. Aside from the inaugural 2009 season, in which the club did not participate, it has dominated professional competition for more than a decade, remaining undefeated.\nHistory\nThe history of Ada began on 6 March 1996, when football enthusiasts Laz\u00ebr Matia and Alfred Pjetri, along with Prend Perdreca, Filip K\u00ebrcunga and Marash Qytetza, founded an amateur team in Velipoj\u00eb. The club was named Ada, after the small island located at the confluence of the Buna river estuary, in the Adriatic Sea, marking the boundary between Albania and Montenegro. Initially, Ada started as a small club for young boys, but it soon attracted notable coaches such as A. Bushati, R. Rragami, F. Pa\u00e7rami, E. Rakigi, F. Axhani, A. Medja, P. Ndoja, S. Bizi, and A. Cungu. Founders Matia and Pjetri also played for the team and under Pjetri's coaching, Ada reached its peak by eliminating a strong Dinamo side in the 2004\u201305 Albanian Cup, by a score of 3\u20132.\nOn 9 August 2007, the duo established a women's team, along with a youth academy for players aged 10 to 19. Despite having an assembled core of players at the time, Ada did not participate in the first women's championship, which was won by Tirana AS. However, a formidable team was quietly being put together.\nAda made its official debut in national women's football during the 2010\u201311 season, in what was considered one of the strongest championships. Strengthened by top players from the Shkod\u00ebr region, Ada competed against Tirana AS, FC Kinostudio, and Juban Danja. The team, led by ex-footballer Fatmir Axhani and featuring players like goalkeeper Brilanta Koki\u00e7i along with Fatjona Borova, Desara Shpuza, Ornela Smajli, Loreta Pa\u00e7o, Desantila Hoxha, Erida Bajrakurtaj, Jesmira Tula, Emeralda Franja, Donilda Sufaj and players from Kosovo, Fitore Govori and Advije Veliu, won the championship without suffering a single defeat.\nAda's dominance continued, setting an extraordinary record of remaining undefeated. This success led to many of its players being called up to the national team by coaches Altin Rraklli, Ilir Sopi and Armir Grima.\nHonours\nDomestic\nKategoria Superiore Femra\nWinners (3): 2010\u201311, 2011\u201312, 2012\u201313\nAlbanian Women's Cup\nWinners (1): 2010\u201311\nSupercup\nWinners (1): 2013\n",
    "American academic and poet (1866\u20131947)\nLewis Worthington Smith (November 22, 1866 \u2013 December 1947) was an American professor and writer. Smith led the Drake University Department of English for 34 years. His works include poems and books about writing. His work was well-received and often republished.\nPersonal life and death\nSmith was born on November 22, 1866, in Malta, Illinois to Dwight A. Smith and Sarah Elizabeth (Lewis) Smith. He attended Beloit College in Wisconsin, and he later attended Cotner University in Nebraska from which he received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in 1889. For Smith's undergraduate course, he was an educator at Fairfield College. Smith married Jessica Belle Welborne on August 24, 1897. Cotner University gave Smith a Master of Arts degree in 1901.\nSmith died in Des Moines, Iowa in December 1947.\nCareer\nAfter graduating, Smith taught in Nebraska high schools and colleges. He was an associate professor of English at Cotner University, an English professor at Tabor College in Iowa, and an English professor at Drake University in Iowa. Smith led the Drake University Department of English for 34 years. His wife influenced him to organize an Iowa Authors Homecoming in 1914, along with Iowa Day in 1916. Smith was more known for his literature than for his professorship. His work was published in well-known magazines. In 1906, Smith published In the Furrow and it was his first book of poetry. His next publication was the comedy-drama play titled \"The Art of Life\", and the play was performed in 1909 and 1910. Smith's book of war poetry titled The English Tongue was published in 1916 by the Four Seas Company. His other works include The Writing of the Short Story and Modern Composition and Rhetoric. Smith's work was well-received and was often republished, but he lost much of his audience in the 1920s due to changing tastes and styles. He retired from Drake University in 1940. Smith received royalties from his textbook The Mechanism of English Style for 20 years.\nReception\nThe Inlander praised Smith's 1902 work The Writing of the Short Story for \"applying formula and symbolic representation to such abstract things as visualization\", although the reviewer criticized the book for not treating a short story as any different from a novel's structure. Educational Review stated that the book is great for teachers to use, but that the theory might be too much for non-psychology students. The book was reviewed favorably by The Chautauquan for not only how it helps people build short stories, but also how it included the psychology behind it.\nGerald Stanley Lee said that \"In the Furrow may not quite always satisfy the outer ear, but there is about it a kind of stern hardy singing that many of us have looked for in vain as of late.\" The Bay State Monthly stated that In the Furrow is a \"dainty little volume\" which has poems that \"are varied in theme, and each one is really poetical thought, well expressed.\"\n",
    "The Grand Hotel Campo dei Fiori is a hotel located on Monte Tre Croci, in Campo dei Fiori, Varese, Italy. It was designed by Giuseppe Sommaruga between 1908 and 1912. It is in the Art Nouveau style. It was closed in 1968. As of 2024, it is in a semi-abandoned state. It is opened three times a year by the  FAI.\nHotel in Varese, Italy\nHistory\n The Albergo Paradiso\nPlans for a hotel on Campo dei Fiori began back in the late 1880s, and in 1894, the \u2018Albergo Paradiso' opened. \n The Kitchen in 2024\nThere was also a small restaurant, opened by Carlo Ciotti in 1886. The hotel was situated where the current hotel is. Due to the hotels success, it was demolished to build the much larger and luxurious hotel, Grand Hotel Campo dei Fiori.\n The original design of the hotel, 1908\nGiuseppe Sommaruga started designs for the hotel in 1908, with construction beginning in 1910. The hotel officially opened in 1912. A restaurant (called Ristorante Belvedere) and funicular station were also constructed.\nThe restaurant in 2022\nTo construct the hotel they used items including mines and charges of dynamite to excavate the rock, and the overall operation profoundly changed the landscape of the area, as a vast garden was built around the buildings. After its opening, for about half a century the complex was a destination for a large influx of elite tourism, interrupted only by the two world wars. In 1944 it was used as a Military Hospital. In 1947 a fire devastated the top floor, which was hastily repaired with a prefabricated structure.\n The Lobby in 2024\nOver the next two decades, the hotel, aided by the total disinterest of the owners and the negligence of the janitors, was gradually stripped of many period pieces of furniture (some of enormous value), of which only a part was saved. Presumably around the 1980s (but there is a lack of reliable sources on this) the prefabricated mansard implanted in 1947 was replaced by a sturdier masonry roof covered with bituminous sheathing and copper foil (or similar material), at as of 2024 still present today.\n The Main Hall in 2024\nDuring the 1980s, the Castiglioni family (owners of the Cagiva and of the Pallacanestro Varese) bought the hotel and supported the idea of re-opening. Instead they inserted antennas on the roof, which is was greatly hated by locals.\n The hotel in 2022\nIn 2017 it served as the filming location of the film Suspiria.\n The hotel during the Alpine Festival, 2022\nAs of 2020, the Government of Varese has been thinking of re-opening the hotel, due to more interest and events in the city. Every August, the hotel's gardens are used for the annual Alpine festival \nStructure and Location\n The hotel viewed from Sacro Moment\nThe hotel building is divided into three sectors: a central body extending towards the Varese valley and two asymmetrical, staggered side wings forming an open V towards the north. This was chosen by Sommaruga, as it looks like an Eagle taking flight.\n Detail of the sculptures in the lobby, 2024\nAs previously mentioned, the current appearance of the building is significantly marked by the repairs to the fire that destroyed the top floor: the difference between the mansard roof with its sheet metal roof and the walls below is clearly visible. On the fa\u00e7ade, three wrought-iron lampposts, the still legible sign and the four monumental central chimneys, just above the three entrance doors, stand out. A burgundy-coloured frieze embraces the entire building at first floor level.\n The stairwell, 2024\nThe rear fa\u00e7ade is the best preserved part of the building. It is higher than the north fa\u00e7ade, as the surrounding ground is on a lower level}.\nThe old Entrance to the Grand Hotel Campo dei Fiori\nOn this front one can recognise the basement, marked by walls made of bare stone limestonea and large circular windows with grilles, which houses the rooms reserved for staff (kitchens, laundries, dormitories, etc.). In the centre of the rear fa\u00e7ade is a majestic stone portico, leaning towards the Varese valley, which supports the ballroom and under which is the secondary entrance to the building. According to the original plan, this structure was to have been the arrival station of the funicular, but the idea was later abandoned due to the excessive noise of the engines. Noteworthy are the decorations carved in stone and cement, the elaborate wrought-iron railings and the doccioni in the shape of a dragon, the work of Alessandro Mazzucotelli and, lastly, the imposing brick vaulting, details that give the portico a mysterious 'Gothic' appearance.\nView of the veranda of the hotel\nBeyond the portico, on the east wing of the building, one glimpses, on the first floor, the restaurant hall, partially built in a veranda cantilevered away from the building.\nGallery\nBedroom in the Grand Hotel Campo dei Fiori in 1917\n Main hall of the Grand Hotel Campo dei Fiori in 1917\n Restaurant of the Grand Hotel Campo dei Fiori in 1917\n Lobby of the Grand Hotel Campo dei Fiori in 1917\n A room in t",
    "Military operation during the Russian invasion of Ukraine\nThe Russian Winter Offensive of 2022\u20132023  was a military campaign executed by Russian troops during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 22 December 2022, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Federation Valery Gerasimov announced that the Russian army would focus on capturing the Donetsk Oblast. In early February 2023, Russian troops began their winter offensive on the western section of the front in the Donetsk Oblast and on the Kupiansk\u2013Svatove\u2013Kreminna\u2013Lyman line. According to military experts, Russia wanted to quickly break through Ukrainian defenses and seize the Donetsk Oblast. However, the Russian offensive was slow, and according to American and British intelligence estimates, in the winter of 2023 the Russian army managed to achieve only minor progress at the cost of huge losses of its own.\nBackground\nIn the fall of 2022, the Ukrainian Armed Forces successfully launched the Kherson and Kharkiv counteroffensives. After that, a relative stalemate took place in all fronts, which led both partiers regroup their forces and prepare new offensives. At the same time, journalists noted that Donbass was a relatively favorable place for Russia to attack. This was facilitated by the established system of logistics and fortifications in the People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Also, the idea of \u201cliberating\u201d or annexing those republics was an understandable motivation for not only for Russian forces, but also for the local people. In November 2022, British Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace called on Ukraine to continue its offensive during the winter months: \u201cGiven the advantage the Ukrainians have in training, equipment and quality of fighting manpower against the demoralised, poorly trained, poorly equipped Russians, it is in Ukraine\u2019s interests to maintain the momentum over the winter\u201d.\nUkrainian soldiers of the Territorial Defense Forces with an ATGL-H mounted grenade launcher, December 2022.\nCourse of events\nDonbas\nMain article: Battle of Donbas (2022)\n\u00a0\u00a0Russian\u2013occupied territories as of January 2023.\nIn the winter of 2022\u20132023, the Ukrainian Armed Forces decided to launch a strategic defense, conducting only local attacks in the area of the city of Kreminna in the Luhansk Oblast. However, Ukraine's actions in the Kreminna area were not particularly successful. According to the Governor of Luhansk Oblast (at that time Serhiy Haidai), one of the main problems for Ukrainian forces in the Kreminna area was the large-scale attacks on this territory by Russian troops. In mid-winter, Russian forces, reinforced by mobilization, made their own attempt at an offensive near Kreminna, but they also did not have much success and by the end of winter the major battles in this direction resulted into stalemates.\nRussian forces, although active in various parts of the front, focused their efforts on capturing the Donetsk Oblast. On 16 December 2022, the ISW wrote that the Russians could be preparing an offensive in Donbas in the winter. They wrote that with the onset of cold weather, Russia intensified its actions along the entire front line in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, and pointed to problems in the combat readiness of Russian troops. In particular, British Admiral Tony Radakin then stated: \u201cRussia is facing an acute shortage of artillery ammunition. There is no mystery about this. Putin planned a 30-day war, but Russian guns have been firing for almost 300 days\u201d.\nOn 22 December 2022, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Federation Valery Gerasimov announced that the Russian army would focus on capturing the Donetsk Oblast. On January 11, 2022, Gerasimov became commander of the joint group of forces in Ukraine, replacing Sergey Surovikin. After he was put in charge, Gerasimov led his first army and immediately got a victory during the Battle of Soledar.\nOn February 6, 2023, the British Financial Times, citing \u201cvery reliable intelligence\u201d from sources in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, wrote that over the next ten days, the Russian army would launch a large\u2013scale offensive in the areas of the cities of Kreminna and Lyman. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also spoke about a new possible Russian offensive on 5 February.\nOne of the most important and bloody battles that took place was the Battle of Bakhmut, where the Russians took over the village at the cost of abnormous losses (see this section). The main striking force of the Russians in this direction were fighters from the PMC Wagner led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, which included those recruited from among Russian prisoners. Unlike the regular Russian armed forces, which actively used armored vehicles, the Wagner assault squads attacked mainly on land, explaining the huge losses that they suffer. At the beginning of their attacks, the Wagner group artillery sought to \"suppress\" the positions of the Ukrainian forces and bring the assault groups to their positions. After the Ukrainian ",

It is used in the HarmonyOS NEXT version of the proprietary HarmonyOS operating system, replacing previous versions that utilized the AOSP compatibility layer, the Linux kernel, and the LiteOS kernel.\nThe HarmonyOS Kernel utilizes a microkernel architecture, which aims to improve security and performance by isolating critical components of the system.\nKernel design\nHarmonyOS NEXT Architecture\nHarmonyOS kernel is a microkernel at rich executed environment level for software outside hardware-based HarmonyOS TEE kernel, called tee_OS, enabling greater modularity and larger portions of the OS to benefit from memory protection at kernel mode. While retaining the speed of monolithic mainline Linux kernel compatibility subsystem of modular OpenHarmony standard system within its kernel abstraction layer as compatibility layer with POSIX APIs and third-party musl-libc integrated support for bigger advanced devices for some critical tasks at user mode of HarmonyOS operating system commercial distro. The kernel has Linux ABI compatibility by placing an ABI-compatible shim in IC0 (kernel space), which redirects Linux system calls to IPC and serves as a central repository for global state. The kernel also reuses Linux drivers through driver containers, which balances between compatibility and critical path performance, while having control plane and data plane separation to improve performance. HarmonyOS kernel capabilities in context switching, network, application startup time, load, frame loss, interrupt latency, etc., and also performance optimised in smart routers and smart vehicles.\nAs of June\u00a021, 2024, HarmonyOS kernel runs on ARM64 devices on Developer Beta 1 version with current version 1.9.0.B100.\nHarmonyOS kernel offers core capabilities and security benefits to the upper layers, including process and thread management, memory management, file system management, network management and Peripheral management. Alongside, HarmonyOS kernel, the integrated Hardware Driver Foundation (HDF) underpins an open hardware ecosystem for HarmonyOS. It standardizes peripheral device access and streamlines I/O driver development and management. Other layers of the multi-layered operating system of OpenHarmony-based HarmonyOS that sits on top of HarmonyOS kernel includes the middle System Service Layer where the system service layer provides essential services enabling the framework layer to support application functionalities.

    "Wolfram mine in the Northern Territory\nHatches Creek wolfram field was an active wolfram, also known as tungsten, mining centre in Australia that operated between 1915 and 1957 and mining activities recommenced in 2019. Located on the Barkly Tableland in the Northern Territory, it is 375 kilometres (233\u00a0mi) northeast of Alice Springs. \nIt is on the lands of the Alyawarre, Kaytetye and Warumungu peoples and their rights to this land have upheld by a successful Native Title Claim.\nThere is a nearby homeland, called Hatches Creek, where an Aboriginal family group lives.\nHistory\nWolfram was first discovered the Hatches Creek during an 1896 - 1906 expedition by Allan Arthur Davidson but the discovery raised little interest.\nAs wolfram prices rose in the early 20th century interest increased and, in 1915, the first mining leases being registered by Thomas Hanlon and Richard Edwin Warne (Mineral leases 222 - 230) who would later forfeit them in 1918. Development of the mining field was slow due to the remoteness of the area and reduced prices. By 1920 the area was largely abandoned.\nMining revived in the 1930s and in 1937 NT Administrator Aubrey Abbott visited the field and found 60 men at work there; this number had increased to between 150 and 200 by the following year. In 1938 a visiting journalist from Walkabout wrote of it:\nThe field is not without its romance; some of the adventures have gone out there practically broke and returned to civilization with small fortunes, while others have gone out there with money and have been glad to cadge a ride back to Alice Springs on a motor-lorry.\u2014\u200aB Pickhaver, Hatches Creek, Walkabout (1 June 1938)\nThis increased population at the field led to difficulties obtaining water and the nearby Kangaroo Waterhole almost dried up and many of the miners experienced dysentery and other stomach disorders. One of the residents and miners' during this period was Gloria Ouida Lee who worked alongside her husband Fred 'Lofty' Purdy.\nDuring World War II wolfram became increasingly important and the mining area was taken over by the government under the National Security Regulations in 1942 when Australia was essentially cut-off from overseas supplies. The main exporters had been America, Japan, Great Britain and Germany who stopped exporting it; this is as one of the primary uses for wolfram was to extract tantalum which was used in the manufacture of spinnerets for the silk trade and for electric light filaments.\nBecause of the War of the miner's on the field were called up for military service and most of the miners remaining were ineligible to be called for military service because of age or physical infirmity. To address this, in November 1943, 500 indentured Chinese labourers from Nauru were sent there to mine.\nThese labourers were evacuated from Nauru (via Townsville), where they had been working on a phosphate mine due to a possible invasion by the Japanese. In Australia they were called the Native Labor Company (Chinese) and other miners in this group were sent to Wauchope (a small town near Karlu Karlu) where wolfram mining was also taking place. Existing miners on the wolfram field were not happy when they arrived and accused them of throwing them off their mines. They also claimed that there had been an 83% reduction in wolfram production following the disruption of their arrival and where accused of adopting a go-slow form of passive resistance.\nUltimately the Consul for China, Mr TM Chen (who was based in Brisbane), intervened and, after visiting the site, believed that the labourers were being kept in shocking conditions although, in response to this it was argued that their condition of living was comparable to other miners working there. It was also alleged that they were not receiving wages, that food and water were being denied and strike actions banned. The Chinese labourers were withdrawn by late 1944 as 'requirements for wolfram had been met\".\nDuring the war years Darby Jampijinpa Ross also worked on the field before starting work as part of a Native Labour Gang based from Alice Springs.\nMining continued at Hatches Creek after the war and, in 1952, there were plans to established a township there. These plans never eventuated but, in 1953, both a Hatches Creek Miners' Association was formed, led by Simon Rieff, a school was opened and local advocated for a hospital. Despite this mining continued to wain in the region and in 1954 it was reported that only 61 people remained there and predictions were made that it would become a \"ghost centre\" and by 1957 it was considered closed.\n",

    "\nThe 2012 Colorado Republican presidential caucuses took place on 7 February 2012. It was part of the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries.\nThe Republican caucuses were held on \"Republican Party Precinct Caucus Day\" (February 7, 2012). Caucus locations opened on 9 PM, February 7, 2012, with 36 delegates at stake; 33 of which are tied to the caucuses while 3 are unpledged RNC delegates. The event occurred alongside the Minnesota Republican caucuses as well the Missouri Republican primary. The race was widely expected to be won by Mitt Romney even on the day of the caucus, but a strong surge by Rick Santorum across all three races that day carried him to a close victory. However, the delegates were not legally bound to follow voter preferences, and most voted for Romney.\nBackground\nSee also: Colorado Caucus\nThe Colorado legislature adopted the caucus system in a special session called by Governor John F. Shafroth in August 1910 as part of a package of progressive reforms. It was seen as a way to limit the power of party bosses and to attract more grassroots involvement. The caucus system was abolished in favor of presidential primaries in 1992 but restored in 2002 with the defeat of Amendment 29 and cost considerations. The fully restored Colorado Caucus was in 2004.\nOf the candidates in the 2008 Colorado Republican presidential caucuses, two candidates - Mitt Romney\u00a0and Ron Paul - would return to contest the state in once again 2012.

    "Deep-sea port in Andhra Pradesh, India\nRamayapatnam Port is a deep-sea port at Ramayapatnam in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. The port is being constructed by the Ramayapatnam Port Development Corporation Limited under the Andhra Pradesh Maritime Board, an organization of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. It is estimated that the cost of construction of the port will be more than \u20b93.7 thousand crore.\nThe port consists of an artificial harbour surrounded by Breakwaters. Cargo will be handled through container berths, coal berths and multi-purpose berths located within the harbour. It will have a maximum depth of 16 metres (52\u00a0ft) and will be able to accommodate panamax vessels. According to the Andhra Pradesh Maritime Board, the draft of the port will be around 15.5 metres (51\u00a0ft), which accommodate 85,000 deadweight tonnage vessels at the harbour's jetties.\nLocation and meteorology\nThe Ramayapatnam Port is situated on the shore of the Bay of Bengal at 15.019167\u00b0 north latitude and 80.052500\u00b0 east longitude. It is located about 13 kilometres (8.1\u00a0mi) southeast of Ulavapadu and 80 kilometres (50\u00a0mi) south of Ongole. Distance from Krishnapatnam Port to Ramayapatnam port is 83 kilometres (52\u00a0mi), and is located north from Krishnapatnam. There are no protected areas\u2014ecologically sensitive areas, marine national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, etc.\u2014within a 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi) radius of the port.\nThe Ramayapatnam region is characterized by a hot subtropical climate, with harsh summers and annually recurring monsoon monsoons. Ramayapatnam experiences seasonal temperature variation; the climate is hot and humid with seasonal rainfall varying between 18-40\u00b0C. April and May are the warmest months, while December and January are the coldest months. The average monthly temperature is above 30\u00b0C from April to July and the maximum monthly temperature is 42\u00b0C in May. August to March temperatures are below 30\u00b0C, and January and December are the lowest monthly temperatures of 20\u00b0C. The port receives most of its seasonal rainfall from the southwest monsoon from June to September and the northeast monsoon (October to December). The near shore is relatively  steeper due to the effect of high waves during the monsoon season. Due to low pressure in the Bay of Bengal, cyclones with wind speeds above 60 km/h occur in the coastal area of \u200b\u200bRamaypatnam, especially during May and September to November, but cyclones are more frequent in October.\nThe area is covered by coastal alluvium consisting of occasional layers of sand and clay. The upper layer consists of sand with fresh water aquifer at a depth of 6 metres (20\u00a0ft)to 7 metres (23\u00a0ft), and the next layer consists of silt and clay with saline aquifer. Hard rock schist lies at greater depth. The area near Tettu village west of the port area is covered by laterite followed by schist layers. The port falls under Class III seismic zone as per Seismic Zone Map of India IS: 1893 Part 1, 2002, which indicating a moderate risk of earthquakes. According to the bathymetric survey, the water depth is 20 meters at a distance of 13 kilometres (8.1\u00a0mi) from the shoreline.\nPort details\nHarbour\nThe harbour of the Ramayapatnam deep sea port an artificial harbor, which is protected by breakwaters. The water depth of the harbour basin is 16 metres (52\u00a0ft), which will accommodate large ships. The approach channel forms a turning circle in the harbor with a depth of 15.2 metres (50\u00a0ft), which is used to change the direction of the vessel as required before berthing the vessel at the jetty.\nApproach channel\nThe approach channel connect the 16 metres (52\u00a0ft) deep water body to the harbour, which is constructed by dredging the seabed at a depth of 5 m within 300 metres (980\u00a0ft) to 600 metres (2,000\u00a0ft) from the seashore, 10 m between 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi) and 15 m between 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi). An 11.83 kilometres (7.35\u00a0mi) long approach channel at open sea will be used for the movement of ships to the port's harbour. The approach channel has a depth of  16 metres (52\u00a0ft) and a minimum width of  200 metres (660\u00a0ft), allowing vessels with a draft of 15.5 m to arrive and depart the harbor without tidal assistance. However, the highest and lowest tides observed in the harbor area are  1.2 metres (3.9\u00a0ft) and 0.5 metres (1.6\u00a0ft) respectively.\nConnectivity\nThe nearest national highway from the port is National Highway 16, which is at a distance of 4.5 kilometres (2.8\u00a0mi). The National Highway provides road connectivity between Kolkata and Chennai, which is connected to the cities of Guntur, Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. The port is connected to National Highway 16 through a 4-lane road, which is planned to be widened to 6 lanes later. The total length of this road is about 5.75 kilometres (3.57\u00a0mi).\nThe port is connected to the existing Howrah\u2013Chennai main line near Tettu railway station. The railway is about 7.3 km long.\n",
    "2019 stage musical by Laura and Linda Good\nLadyship is a stage musical with music, lyrics and book by Laura Good and Linda Good of the alt-pop band, The Twigs, based upon the conviction and transportation of women convicts from England to Australia in 1789.\nIt premiered off-broadway at The Alice Griffin Jewel Box Theater on July 10, 2019, as part of The New York Musical Festival, as a main stage production, and was directed by Samantha Saltzman.\nHistorical basis\nLadyship is based upon true events during the time when approximately 25,000 convict women were sent from England to Australia from 1788 to 1868 under the British government's Transportation Act. The boat journey from England to Australia was treacherous and often took between ten months to year or longer. On board, women convicts were often subjected to poor conditions, violence, meager food, sickness, disease, and some gave birth during the journey. However, if they survived the boat journey and completed their sentences of seven years or more, women could potentially keep any money they earned, own land, and start their own businesses, which they were not legally allowed to do in Britain at the time.\nSynopsis\nAct I\nIn 1789 London, England, Irish teenage sisters Alice and Mary Reed have been accused of committing a petty crime and are standing trial for stealing a handkerchief. Facing a corrupt justice system, they find they have no say in who determines their fate (\u201cWho Decides\u201d). The sisters are thrown into an over-crowded jail full of poor, starving young women, and are unfairly sentenced to seven years transportation to Australia (\u201cSeven Years\u201d). They meet Abigail Gainsborough, a card sharper, and Mrs. Pickering, a mother in debt, and soon learn they are all victims of a government plan that tries to rid the streets of the poor by doling out punishments that severely outweigh the crimes (\u201cThe Bloody Code\u201d). Alice and Mary see a girl hiding in the corner, Kitty MacDougal, an orphan falsely accused of theft, and they survive the night by hanging to a glimmer of hope (\u201cA Way Out\u201d).\nAfter the female convicts are loaded onto a ship bound for Australia, they are herded into a dark jail cell on the Orlop Deck \u2013 the foul bottom of the ship. Captain Josiah Adams, aided by his privileged nephew Lt. Brandon Adams and Deck Officer Zeke Cropper, has to make sure the women arrive alive, so they can be workers and wives to the male convicts already there. A mixed-race seaman, Marcus \"Finn\" Findley, catches the eye of Mary. Abigail spars with Lady Jane Sharp, a disgraced high-society woman, who joins the others in wondering how they will endure the arduous ten-month journey. Kitty imagines a better future (\u201cSo Many Stars\u201d). Harassed by the ship's seamen, the women become increasingly emaciated (\u201cPour Another Rum\u201d). Good-hearted Finn tries to help the women and begins to fall in love with Mary (\u201cReady to Begin\u201d).\nAs weeks pass and hope fades, Abigail suggests there is a way to get protection, warmth and better food by becoming \u201ctemporary wives\u201d to the seamen, an old seafaring custom (\u201cOnly the Strong Survive\u201d). After Sunday service on deck, the Captain orders the women to dance for exercise (\"The Emerald Wye\u201d). As night falls, some of the women consider Abigail's suggestion, while Mary waits for Finn. A drunken Lieutenant attacks Mary, and Alice and Finn contemplate revenge (\u201cNever Burns Away\u201d). The women comfort Mary as time passes (\"Sparrow, Sparrow\"). As the ship reaches its first port, Rio, Abigail suggests the women make money using every skill they have, even if it's prostitution. Lady Jane and Kitty hope to use their sewing skills instead, while Alice ponders what to do (\u201cEverything Has a Price\u201d). As Finn prepares to run away with Mary, she tells him she is pregnant.\nAct II\nAfter a month docked in Rio (\"At\u00e9 Logo\"), Lady Jane confronts the Captain about what the future will be for the women convicts and their unborn children (\u201cI Need An Anchor\u201d). Alice overhears the hard truth that Mary's baby will be taken away upon arrival to the new colony and informs Mary (\u201cNo Matter Where We\u2019re Bound\u201d). Undaunted, Alice encourages the women to fight back against their oppressors (\u201cI\u2019m Done\u201d). As a storm approaches, an angry Lieutenant throws Mary down on the deck. The ship rocks, lightning flashes, and Finn and the Lieutenant fall overboard. Alice must choose who she helps.\nAlice comforts a shaken Mary (\u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Anchor\u201d), but the fall causes her to go into labor. The women encircle Mary, encouraging her to summon her inner strength (\u201cDig Deep\u201d). Mary almost dies in childbirth, but survives with support of the women on board. Alice vows to do whatever it takes to protect those she loves (\u201cI\u2019ll Find a Way\u201d). As the ship approaches Sydney Cove, the women join and steel themselves for what lies ahead (\u201cFinale\u201d).\nCast and characters\nSongs\nOff-Broadway (2019)\nAct I\n\u201cThe System\u201d\n\u201cThe Bloody Code\u201d\n\u201cA Way Out\u201d\n\u201cSeven Years\u201d\n\u201cSo Many Stars\u201d\n\u201cSeven Years (Reprise)\u201d\n\u201cPour ",
    "Period of Government of the United Kingdom from 2024 to present\nThis article is about Keir Starmer's tenure as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. For the people in his government, see Starmer ministry.\nKeir Starmer's tenure as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom began on 5 July 2024 when he accepted an invitation from King Charles III to form a government, succeeding Rishi Sunak of the Conservative Party, after the Labour Party had won the 2024 general election.\nDomestically, Starmer has said he will focus on economic growth, planning system reforms, infrastructure, energy, healthcare, education, childcare, and strengthening workers' rights, all of which were outlined in the Labour Party's 2024 election manifesto. He has stated his intention to establish the Border Security Command to replace the Rwanda asylum plan. In foreign policy, Starmer has supported Ukraine in its war against Russia and Israel in its war against Hamas.\nLabour leadership bid\nMain article: 2020 Labour Party leadership election (UK)\nOn 4 January 2020, Keir Starmer announced his candidacy for the Labour Party leadership election. By 8\u00a0January, it was reported that he had gained enough nominations from Labour MPs and MEPs to get onto the ballot paper, and that the trade union Unison was backing him. Unison, with 1.3 million members, said Starmer was the best placed candidate to unite the party and regain public trust. He also gained support from former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.\nDuring the leadership election, Starmer ran a left-wing platform. He positioned himself in opposition to austerity, stating that the outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn was \"right\" to position Labour as the \"party of anti-austerity\". He indicated he would continue with the Labour policy of scrapping tuition fees as well as pledging \"common ownership\" of rail, mail, energy and water companies and called for ending outsourcing in the NHS, local governments and the justice system.\nStarmer was announced as the winner of the leadership contest on 4\u00a0April 2020, defeating rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy, with 56.2% of the vote in the first round. As opposition leader, contrary to his leadership campaign, he moved the party toward the political centre, and also emphasised the project of eliminating antisemitism within the party. Starmer's leadership has been widely compared to Tony Blair's leadership and New Labour, having taken the party rightward to gain perceived electability.\n2024 general election landslide victory\nMain article: 2024 United Kingdom general election\nLabour entered the 2024 general election with a large lead over the Conservatives in opinion polls, and the potential scale of the party's victory was a topic of discussion during the campaign period. In June 2024, Starmer released the Labour Party manifesto Change, which focuses on economic growth, planning system reforms, infrastructure, what Starmer describes as \"clean energy\", healthcare, education, childcare, and strengthening workers' rights. It pledges a new publicly owned energy company (Great British Energy), a \"Green Prosperity Plan\", reducing patient waiting times in the NHS, and renationalisation of the railway network (Great British Railways). It includes wealth creation and \"pro-business and pro-worker\" policies. The manifesto also pledged to give votes to 16 year olds, reform the House of Lords, and to tax private schools, with money generated going into improving state education.\nIn July 2024, Starmer led Labour to a landslide victory in the general election, ending fourteen years of Conservative government with Labour becoming the largest party in the House of Commons. Labour achieved a 174-seat simple majority and a total of 411 seats, the party's third-best result in terms of seat share following the 1997 and 2001 general elections. The party became the largest in England for the first time since 2005, in Scotland for the first time since 2010, and retained its status as the largest party in Wales.\nIn his victory speech, Starmer thanked party workers for their hard work \u2013 including nearly five years of revamping and rebranding Labour in the face of Conservative dominance \u2013 and urged them to savour the moment, but warned them of challenges ahead and pledged his government would work for \"national renewal\":\nWe did it! You campaigned for it, you fought for it, you voted for it and now it has arrived. Change begins now. And it feels good, I have to be honest. Four-and-a-half years of work changing the party. This is what it is for \u2013 a changed Labour Party ready to serve our country, ready to restore Britain to the service of working people. And across our country people will be waking up to the news, relieved that a weight has been lifted, a burden finally removed from the shoulders of this great nation. And now we can look forward. Walk into the morning, the sunlight of hope, pale at first but getting stronger through the day, shining once agai",
    "\nManoel Ant\u00f4nio Vital de Oliveira (28 September 1829 - 2 February 1867) was a Brazilian naval officer and surveyor, known as the \"Father of Brazilian Hydrography\".\nHe was born in Recife in the state of Pernambuco. His father was Ant\u00f4nio Vital de Oliveira and his mother was Donna Joanna Florinda de Gusm\u00e3o Lobo Vital. He graduated from the naval school at Rio de Janeiro in 1843 and became a midshipman in 1845. In February 1849 he was involved in the suppression of the Praieira revolt, taking part in a battle in his home town of Recife. He was promoted to sub-lieutenant in December 1849 and to Lieutenant in 1854.\nVital de Oliveira's 1862 chart of the coast of Brazil including Recife\nVital de Oliveira's first survey was of the coast of Brazil between Pitimbu and S\u00e3o Bento in the sloop of war Parahybano. The chart from this survey was accompanied by a detailed description. In 1858 he published a chart of das Rocas, a coral atoll in the South Atlantic. In 1862 he published five charts covering the coast from Mossor\u00f3 to the S\u00e3o Francisco River. These charts were subsequently re-published in 1864 as United Kingdom Admiralty charts.\nIn 1862, Joachim Raimundo de Lamare\u00a0, Minister of the Navy, decided to commission a complete chart of the Brazilian Coast, and appointed Vital de Oliveira, then commanding Ipiranga, to start preliminary work on this. De Lamare also prepared a plan for a permanent Hydrographic service, but both projects were interrupted by the outbreak of the Paraguayan War, and the Hydrographic service was not formed until 1876. Vital de Oliveira's survey work thus anticipated by nearly two decades the formation of an official Hydrographic Service by the Brazilian Navy.\nthe Silvado\nVital de Oliveira's first assignment during the Paraguayan War was to travel to France to take possession of the ironclad Nemesis and take it to Brazil in 1866. Crossing the Atlantic, he met with tempestuous weather, but brought the ship safely into Rio de Janeiro. The ship was renamed the Silvado, and joined the war under the command of Vital de Oliveira, who had been promoted to Post-Captain on 21 January 1867. On the 2 February, the Brazilian fleet, with Silvado as its flagship, started a bombardment of the fortifications at Curupaiti. The Paraguayans returned fire, and Vital de Oliveira was killed while directing the bombardment from the bridge of his ship.\nThree naval ships have been named after him:\nThe corvette Vital de Oliveira, which was the first Brazilian ship to circumnavigate the globe, in 1876.\nThe auxiliary ship Vital de Oliveira, which was sunk by a German U-boat torpedo attack on 20 July 1944.\nThe research vessel Vital de Oliveira which entered service in 2015.\nVital de Oliveira was named Patrono da Hidrografia da Marinha by decree on 21 January 1976. His date of birth is marked in Brazil as \"Hydrographer's Day\".\n",

Its title refers to Meleys and Sunfyre, the dragons of Rhaenys and Aegon, respectively. The episode was written by series co-creator and showrunner Ryan Condal and directed by executive producer Alan Taylor. It first aired on HBO and Max on July 7, 2024.\nIn the episode, Ser Criston continues to rally Greens allies and executes Black supporters. He rides to Rook's Rest to attack the last Black stronghold on the Blackwater Bay. Meanwhile, Rhaenyra returns to Dragonstone and learns about Criston's plan. She agrees to send Rhaenys with her dragon Meleys to confront Criston and his troops. Feeling his council disrespects him, especially after discovering Aemond's secret communications with Criston, Aegon decides to fly to Rook's Rest with his dragon Sunfyre. Unbeknownst to each other, Rhaenys, Aegon, and Aemond (with Vhagar) converge on Rook's Rest, leading to a climactic battle involving the three dragons.\nIn the United States, \"The Red Dragon and the Gold\" gained a viewership of 8.1 million during its premiere night, surpassing the season premiere, with 1.2 million viewers on linear television alone. The episode received widespread acclaim from critics, with many dubbing it one of the series' best outputs. They complimented the direction and visual effects, but particularly the episode's writing for Daemon's scenes in Harrenhal, the increasing friction between Aemond and Aegon, and the Rook's Rest battle sequence, the latter of which was considered the episode's highlight. Acting performances of Eve Best, Matt Smith and Tom Glynn-Carney were a subject of praise.\nThe episode marks the final appearance of Best as Princess Rhaenys Targaryen.\nPlot\nAt Harrenhal\nDaemon dreams of being in the Red Keep's throne room where he decapitates a young Queen Rhaenyra for berating him, though her severed head continues accusing him of treason. Later, he follows a figure who looks like himself but is dressed as Aemond. Awake, Daemon meets Alys Rivers, a mysterious woman and a Riverlands bastard of House Strong. She claims Harrenhal is haunted because weirwood trees were cut to build it. After drinking her sleep potion, Daemon experiences missing time and hallucinates seeing his late wife, Laena Velaryon, during a council meeting.\nOscar Tully, the adolescent grandson and heir of the aged and incapacitated Lord Grover Tully of the Riverlands, arrives at Harrenhal to meet with Daemon in his grandfather's place. He hesitates making any decisions for the Riverlands while Grover still lives. An impatient Daemon suggests hastening his death, alarming Oscar. Ser Willem Blackwood, one of Rhaenyra's former suitors and a vassal of House Tully, also meets with Daemon. He pledges an army in exchange for subjugating House Bracken.\nOn Driftmark\nRhaenys meets Alyn, thanking him for rescuing Corlys. Corlys arrives, and Rhaenys implies that she knows Alyn is his illegitimate son. She tells Corlys he should be elevating Alyn rather than hiding him \"beneath the tides\", but Corlys dismisses her inquiries. They travel to Dragonstone after Baela encounters difficulty steering the Black council in Rhaenyra's absence.\nAt Duskendale\nSer Criston Cole captures Duskendale and beheads its master, Lord Darklyn, who refuses to renounce his loyalty to Rhaenyra and scorns him as 'Kingmaker'. Criston orders his troops to ride to Rook's Rest, the last Black stronghold on Blackwater Bay, during the day as a surprise maneuver. Gwayne believes a night attack is safer and cautions a daytime assault will attract Rhaenyra's dragons from nearby Dragonstone.\nIn King's Landing\nArchmaester Orwyle prepares an abortifacient tea for Alicent, who claims it is for someone else. She asks Orwyle if Viserys truly wished Aegon to be his heir, but Orwyle denies any knowledge. Larys arrives and notices the empty tea bottle, which Alicent says was for indigestion after feasting too much. Larys slyly remarks that she should be allowed some indulgences. \nWhile meeting with his council regarding Criston's military advances, Aegon is irked that Daemon seized Harrenhal and scolds Larys, the castle's lord, for allowing it. Larys remarks that the castle itself is useless but he still controls its gold. Aemond asserts capturing Rook's Rest will geographically isolate the Blacks from the Seven Kingdoms, but Aegon remains steadfast on reclaiming Harrenhal. He is angered upon learning that Aemond and Criston planned the campaigns without his knowledge or authority, including pursuing Duskendale and Rook's Rest rather than Harrenhal. Aemond berates Aegon in High Valyrian, further humiliating him as Aegon can barely speak it. \nAlicent discovers that Aegon has had Viserys' history books removed. Aegon vents his anger to Alicent over the council excluding him from important matters. She",
    "A village of Rittersgr\u00fcn in Saxony, for the village of the same name in Bohemia.\nVillage in Saxony, Germany\nRittersgr\u00fcn is a district of the municipality of Breitenbrunn/Erzgeb. in the Saxon Erzgebirge district. The scattered settlement with around 1600 inhabitants grew up around several hammer mills, which operated on the course of the P\u00f6hlwasser from the 15th to the 19th century and were supplied with ore from numerous surrounding mines. Due to its location on an important Erzgebirge pass, the settlement was repeatedly plundered by passing mercenaries during the Thirty Years' War. After the decline of the hammer mill industry in the middle of the 19th century, the village's economy was dominated by cardboard and sawmills. In 2007, Rittersgr\u00fcn was incorporated into Breitenbrunn/Erzgeb. Today, Rittersgr\u00fcn is primarily known as an excursion and winter sports resort. The main attractions include the Saxon Narrow Gauge Railway Museum and a well-developed network of hiking trails.\nGeography\nGeographical location\nRittersgr\u00fcn stretches from northwest to southeast in the P\u00f6hlwasser valley, around seven kilometers south of the large district town of Schwarzenberg, at an altitude of up to 820 meters. Situated on the Rittersgr\u00fcner Pass, which has been actively used since the 16th century, the settlement is flanked to the west by the 792-metre-high Hirtenberg and the Kohlung to the south, and to the east by the 700-metre-high Sonnenberg and the 836-metre-high Ochsenkopf. State road 271 runs through the village from Raschau to Oberwiesenthal, into which a connecting road from Breitenbrunn, around 2.5 kilometers away, joins in the village. The border to the Czech Republic runs to the south of the village, over which there are border crossings for skiers, pedestrians and cyclists.\nSettlement form\nRittersgr\u00fcn is not one of the woodland villages typical of the Ore Mountains, as the rocky subsoil hardly allowed for agriculture. The starting point for the settlement of the valley section was the hammer mills located on the P\u00f6hlwasser. While the houses on the left side of the river are mostly grouped along the S 271, the scattered settlement on the Hammerberg above the former Rothenhammer forms the settlement core on the opposite side.\nCommunity structure\nThe political municipality of Rittersgr\u00fcn was only created in 1856 through the merger of the municipalities of Oberrittersgr\u00fcn, Unterrittersgr\u00fcn and Rothenhammer Rittersgr\u00fcn in the Schwarzenberg court office. The Ehrenzipfel group of houses, which probably originated in the 17th century, has always belonged to Rittersgr\u00fcn. In 1921, the previously independent estate district of Arnoldshammer became part of Rittersgr\u00fcn. Oberglobenstein had already been incorporated in the middle of the 19th century, and in 1978 the whole of Globenstein became part of Rittersgr\u00fcn. This was followed in 1994 by Tellerh\u00e4user with the district of Zweibach. Today, only Rittersgr\u00fcn and Tellerh\u00e4user are designated as districts of Breitenbrunn under municipal law.\nRittersgr\u00fcn 1791: Scattered settlement along the P\u00f6hlwasser\nGeology\nRittersgr\u00fcn is located in the southwest of the Paleozoic Ore Mountains, a few kilometers from the highest peak in Saxony, the Fichtelberg. The ore deposits around Rittersgr\u00fcn formed the basis for the mining development of the municipality. Magnetite skarns with tin content and non-ferrous magnetite skarns in andalusite-bearing muscovite schists were mined in the pits near Ober- and Niederglobenstein. Magnetic iron ore, zinc blende and limestone were mined in a wooded area of the Hirtenberg. The slope of the Hirtenberg is covered with wooded and meadow-covered weathered soils of light-colored mica schist. In the Rothen-Adler-Stollen in the south-eastern area of the settlement known as Hammerberg above the Rothenhammer, red ironstone was mined from the original magnetic ironstone; pyroxene, calcite, fluorspar and brown spar were also found. Massive mica schist rocks form the summit of the Ochsenkopf. The Sonnenberg was built on a non-ferrous metal skarn with magnetite and tin content. The ore minerals included zinc blende, chalcopyrite, magnetic pyrites and magnetic iron ore.\nClimate\nDue to its altitude, the temperatures in Rittersgr\u00fcn are below those of the lower-lying municipalities in the surrounding area all year round. In the winter months, the higher areas of Rittersgr\u00fcn are often covered in snow for long periods. The average annual precipitation of 1024.4\u00a0mm is roughly on a par with Oberwiesenthal (1058.7\u00a0mm), significantly higher than in the neighboring town of Schwarzenberg (871.3\u00a0mm) and considerably higher than in the major Saxon cities of Dresden (583.7\u00a0mm) and Leipzig (584.6\u00a0mm). Due to the dry air in the area surrounded by dense forest, Rittersgr\u00fcn was a high-altitude climatic health resort in the first half of the 20th century. The flood of the century in August 2002, when the P\u00f6hlwasser overflowed its banks in many places, caused considerable damage. Rittersgr\u00fcn",
    "French Catholic priest and cardinal\nPierre de la Forest or Petrus Foresta, (1305\u20131361) was a French Bishop of Tournai, Bishop of Paris, Archbishop of Rouen and Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He was also Chancellor of France.\nBiography\nHis family\nPierre de la Forest was born in 1305 in La Suze to Philip de la Forest and Marguerite de la Chapelle, sister of Geoffrey, Bishop of Le Mans. He had four brothers, and his cousin Jean was Abbot of La Couture in Le Mans.\nHis ecclesiastical career\nDe la Forest obtained a license in utroque (canon and civil law) and was then professor of law at the Universities of Orleans and Angers. In 1334, he became canon of Saint-Pierre de la Couture in Le Mans. Shortly afterwards, he obtained the archdeaconry of Montfort and the deanery of Ern\u00e9e. He also became a lawyer in Parlement.\nWhilst serving as Archdeacon of Montfort, de la Forest was elected bishop of Le Mans on the death of his uncle in 1347, Pope Clement VI did not recognize the election, and appointed in his place Jean de Craon, Archdeacon of Passais. He became Chancellor of the Duke of Normandy in October of that year. In July 1349, he was appointed Chancellor of France.\nAt about the same time, de la Forest was appointed Bishop of Tournai. In 1350, he was made executor of the King of France's will. In December of that year, he was transferred to the Bishopric of Paris. In September 1351, he was sent to attempt to conclude a peace treaty with the English. In February 1352, he was again transferred, this time to the Archbishopric of Rouen. He acquired La Loupelande in Maine and was ennobled for his service in 1354.\nPierre de la Forest was sent on two notable diplomatic missions during his career: to Avignon (1354) and to Bordeaux (1356). During the riots led by \u00c9ttienne Marcel in 1358, he sought to preemptively fire Marcel, as well as Simon de Buci who was the ambassador to the English, but the regent Charles did not take his advice.\nPope Innocent VI invested Pierre de la Forest as cardinal during the consistory of 23 December 1356. He entered the Papal curio in Avignon in 1357. Innocent VI then appointed him  Papal Legate to Sicily and then to France\nHe wrote his will on 22 June 1361 and died of the Plague in Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon on 27 June 1361. His heart was buried there, while his body was buried in the choir of Le Mans Cathedral near the tomb of his uncle. A statue of Pierre de la Forest was also placed in the choir.\n",
    "\nAn AI Safety Institute (AISI), in general, is a state-backed institute aiming to evaluate and ensure the safety of the most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models, also called frontier AI models.\nAI safety gained prominence in 2023, notably with public declarations about potential existential risks from AI. During the AI Safety Summit in November 2023, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) both created their own AISI. During the AI Summit Seoul in May 2024, international leaders agreed to form a network of AI Safety Institutes, comprising institutes from the UK, the US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, Australia, Canada and the European Union.\nTimeline\nIn 2023, Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, expressed his intention to \"make the U.K. not just the intellectual home but the geographical home of global AI safety regulation\" and unveiled plans for an AI Safety Summit. He emphasized the need for independent safety evaluations, stating that AI companies cannot \"mark their own homework\". During the summit in November 2023, the UK AISI was officially established as an evolution of the Frontier AI Taskforce, and the US AISI as part of the NIST. Japan followed by launching an AI safety institute in February 2024.\nPolitico reported in April 2024 that many AI companies had not shared pre-deployment access to their most advanced AI models for evaluation. Meta's president of global affairs Nick Clegg said that many AI companies were waiting for the UK and the US AI Safety Institutes to work out common evaluation rules and procedures. An agreement was indeed concluded between the UK and the US in April 2024 to collaborate on at least one joint safety test. Initially established in London, the UK AI Safety Institute announced in May 2024 that it would open an office in San Francisco, where many AI companies are located. This is part of a plan to \"set new, international standards on AI safety\", according to UK's technology minister Michele Donelan.\nAt the AI Summit Seoul in May 2024, the European Union and other countries agreed to create their own AI safety institutes, forming an international network.\nUnited Kingdom\nThe United Kingdom founded in April 2023 a safety organisation called Frontier AI Taskforce, with an initial budget of \u00a3100 million. In November 2023, it evolved into the UK AISI, and continued to be led by Ian Hogarth. The AISI is part of the United Kingdom's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.\nThe United Kingdom's AI strategy aims to balance safety and innovation. Unlike the European Union which adopted the AI Act, the UK is reluctant to legislate early, considering that it may lower the sector's growth, and that laws might be rendered obsolete by technological progress.\nIn May 2024, the institute open-sourced an AI safety tool called \"Inspect\", which evaluates AI model capabilities such as reasoning and their degree of autonomy.\nUnited States\nThe US AISI was founded in November 2023 as part of the NIST. This happened the day after the signature of the Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. In February 2024, Joe Biden's former economic policy adviser Elizabeth Kelly was appointed to lead it.\nIn March 2024, a budget of $10 million was allocated. Observers noted that this investment is relatively small, especially considering the presence of many big AI companies in the US. The NIST itself, which hosts the AISI, is also known for its chronic lack of funding. Biden administration's request for additional funding was met with further budget cuts from congressional appropriators.\nSee also\nAlignment Research Center\nFoundation model\nRegulation of artificial intelligence\n",

    "Portrait from a 1876 album gifted to Darwin\nLudwig Heinrich Jeitteles (12 January 1830 \u2013 25 January 1883) was an Austrian zoologist and prehistorian. He worked as a high school teacher and took an interest in archaeology, zoology and natural history in general. He also took an interest in the study of earthquakes.\nLife and work\nJeitteles was born in Vienna, the son of Andreas Ludwig Jeitteles (1799\u20131878), a professor at the University of Vienna belonging to a German Jewish family from Prague. Andreas Ludwig Jeitteles was a support of German and had anti-Slavic tendencies. A sibling was the Germanist librarian Adalbert (1831\u20131908). Ludwig Heinrich studied at a grammar school in Olomouc before studying law in Olomouc University (183901851). He then studied natural sciences at the University of Vienna (1851\u20131855) and qualified as a teacher in 1855. He then taught at grammar schools in Marburg (1856), Graz (1857), Troppau (1858), Kaschau (1858\u201361) after which he lived in Vienna. In 1870 he moved to the Salzburg teacher training centre and in 1874 to Vienna. Here he taught at the institute for the training of female teachers.\nSkull of Canis matris optimae\nIn his sparetime Jeitteles conducted researches in natural history, archaeology and on earthquakes. He also studied the bird collections of Emil Holub. He became very interested in earthquakes following the January 15, 1858 earthquake and produced a map based on the timing of the quake using which he made suggestions on the geological structures of the region. He corresponded widely with scholars on a variety of topics, including with Oswald Heer (1809\u20131883), Ferdinand Keller (1800\u20131881), Rudolf Virchow (1821\u20131902), Friedrich von Kenner (1834\u20131922), Charles Darwin and others. From the 1860s he took an interest in prehistoric dog breeds and collected canid skulls. He named a species of dog found in a Bronze Age archaeological excavation site near Olomutz as Canis matris optimae. He considered it to be the ancestor of the German shepherd dog. He also took an interest in the paleohistoric domestication of chicken.\nJeitteles married Marianne Baroness Duval de Dampierre in 1880. He suffered from nervous headaches for years and shot himself dead on 25 January 1883.\n",
    "French engraver\nJazet by Charles Landelle (private collection).\nJean-Pierre-Marie Jazet (31 July 1788 \u2013 16 August 1871) was a French engraver known for his etchings, aquatints and mezzotints.\nLife\nHis father was Jean-Marie Jazet, verifier of the crown's buildings, who was mortally wounded in 1793 by an exploding cannon whilst serving in the Paris National Guard, when Jean-Pierre-Marie was only five. His mother was Jeanne Marquant, sister of Suzanne Marquant, second wife of the painter and engraver Philibert-Louis Debucourt.\nAfter his father's death, Jean-Pierre-Marie was raised by his mother's brother Debucourt, becoming one of his best pupils. For his art, Jazet learned and used burin, aquatint, stipple and etching. Jean-Pierre-Marie Jazet mainly produced his compositions at night. He mainly worked on genres favoured by his uncle and sold them to print dealers to help his mother financially. Later, still faithful to his master, he accompanied him until his death - Debucourt, who could no longer work, had spent considerable sums and his nephew helped him to end his life peacefully.\nJazet began exhibiting in 1817. He began his peak period two years later with engravings after Jacques-Louis-David's The Coronation of Napoleon, Antoine-Jean Gros's Standing Portrait of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Lassalle, Horace Vernet's The Bivouac of Colonel Moncey and Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Heim's Distribution of Prizes at the 1824 Salon. His many engravings, particularly those realised after Vernet's works and on subjects from Napoleon I's life and the First French Empire, then his regular exhibiting at the Paris Salon gained him a major reputation.\nTo sell prints drawn from matrices which formed his oeuvre and to keep up and expand his presence in the art market, Jazet was mainly his own editor, working from 71 fauborg Saint-Martin then 7 rue de Lancry. Next he published via Aumont & Cie and Charles Bance. When his son-in-law Th\u00e9odore Vibert began working with Adolphe Goupil, Jazet himself published almost exclusively via Goupil Vibert & Cie, then  Goupil & Cie after Th\u00e9odore Vibert's death in 1850. Jazet's commercial policy and foreigners' presence on the Parisian art market allowed his works to be published far beyond France. He died at Yerres.\nConsidered for years as one of the best French engravers, he last exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon after a major output, principally in aquatint. Art criticism early in the 20th century held that he raised that medium to such a level of perfection that it ended up losing its natural expression. His last works were sometimes qualified by a \"regrettable weakness\".\nMarriage and issue\nJean-Pierre-Marie Jazet married F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Moreau. Their two sons Alexandre-Jean-Louis (born 10 May 1814) and Eug\u00e8ne-Pontus (born 1 May 1816) were both engravers, whilst their daughter Louise-Georgina (born 29 September 1822) married Th\u00e9odore Vibert, with whom she had Jean-Georges Vibert and Alice Vibert, the latter marrying \u00c9tienne-Prosper Berne-Bellecour.\nRecognition\n2nd class medal, 1819\nKnight of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, 8 October 1846\nGallery\nWorks by Jean-Pierre-Marie Jazet\nMarshal Monsey at the barri\u00e8re de Clichy, after Horace Vernet, mus\u00e9e Carnavalet.\nThe Death of Napoleon, after Charles de Steuben.

    "Building in Los Angeles, California, U.S.\nUnited States historic place\nThe Hollywood Professional Building, also known as SEVENTY46, is a historic eight-story building at 7046 W. Hollywood Blvd. in Hollywood, California. The Los Angeles Department of City Planning describe the building as exhibiting \"character defining features of Neo-Gothic style architecture\" and the United States Department of the Interior describe the building as \"an excellent example of Neo-Gothic commercial design.\"\nHistory\nBuilt in 1924, the Hollywood Professional Building was designed by Richard D. King and constructed to be an office building for Herman P. Rehbein, vice-president of the Bernard Oil Company. Originally, the building was five stories tall, but when ownership was transferred to Toberman & Company in 1929, the new owners added three stories to the top of the building. Toberman & Company maintained ownership of the building until 1961.\nFrom 1930 to 1935, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had offices in this building, and from 1938 to 1956, the Screen Actors Guild was headquartered here, with future United States president Ronald Reagan's office in the building when he was president of the union from 1947 to 1953.\nIn 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, with Hollywood Professional listed as a contributing property in the district. In 2007, the building was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.\nIn 2004, CIM Group acquired the building, after which they repurposed it to a loft-style apartment complex that they named SEVENTY46. In 2013, CIM sold the building to a private investor and developer.\nArchitecture\nThe United States Department of the Interior describe the Hollywood Professional Building as \"an excellent example of Neo-Gothic commercial design,\" and the Los Angeles Department of City Planning further describe the building as exhibiting \"high artistic value\" and \"character-defining features\" of the neo-gothic style. The building was the first on Hollywood Boulevard to feature neo-gothic architecture.\nThe building is rectangular in plan and has a recessed centered entrance with bronze framed, glass paneled doors with transoms above. The building's facade is sheathed in ivory colored glazed terra cotta, with the second and eighth floors featuring pointed piers. The facade also features numerous decorative trefoils, quatrefoils, and circular tracery. Windows are large hopper style steel sash, grouped in threes and separated by fluted piers. A modified crenellated parapet serves as the capital of the composition. The building's interior lobby features four groin vaults and travertine wainscoting.\n",

It has received positive reviews from critics.\nReception\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, All That You Can Dream received \"generally favorable reviews\" based on a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 from 4 critic scores. Editors at AllMusic rated this album 3.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Mark Deming writing \"All That You Can Dream doesn't sound like a homemade album\" in spite of being recorded in home studios due to the COVID-19 pandemic and that the recording shows subtle themes of political outrage and cultural criticism where Phillips \"delivers his messages with the graceful impressionistic croon that has been the hallmark of his work\". Lee Zimmerman of American Songwriter noted the anxiety and frustration associated with recording during the pandemic and continued that \"by turns both anxious and emphatic, the new album finds Phillips surveying a wide sweep of emotion even while contemplating the confounding questions everyone\u2019s facing at a time where there are mooted possibilities of finding simple solutions\". James McNair of Mojo gave this release 4 out of 5 stars, stating that Phillips has \"surpassed himself with this intimate late flourish  11 searching, beautifully rendered songs which rhythm section Jay Bellerose and Jennifer Condos finesse with artful subtlety\". No Depression's Jon Young called this recording \"wonderfully understated chamber-folk shaped by his weary yet graceful voice and insightful songs\" that is \"intensely personal and thoroughly relatable at once\". Writing for Uncut, Andrew Mueller rated All That You Can Dream a 7 out of 10, stating that the result of the recording circumstances is \"unsurprisingly... a downbeat, ruminative affair\", continuing that \"this is no hardship, given the agility and empathy\" of Phillips' delivery.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Grant-Lee Phillips\n\"A Sudden Place\"\u00a0\u2013 4:13\n\"Cruel Trick\"\u00a0\u2013 4:27\n\"Peace Is a Delicate Thing\"\u00a0\u2013 5:20\n\"All That You Can Dream\"\u00a0\u2013 4:54\n\"Rats in a Barrel\"\u00a0\u2013 4:52\n\"Cannot Trust the Ground\"\u00a0\u2013 3:35\n\"Cut to the Ending\"\u00a0\u2013 3:06\n\"You Can't Hide\"\u00a0\u2013 4:12\n\"My Eyes Have Seen\"\u00a0\u2013 4:01\n\"Remember This\"\u00a0\u2013 4:03\n\"All by Heart\"\u00a0\u2013 4:44\nPersonnel\nGrant-Lee Phillips\u00a0\u2013 guitars, piano, Mellotron, pump organ, keyboards, vocals, production, artwork, art direction\nJohn Baldwin\u00a0\u2013 audio mastering at John Baldwin Mastering, Nashville, Tennessee, United\u00a0States\nJay Bellerose\u00a0\u2013 drums, percussion\nJennifer Condos\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar\nRichard Dodd\u00a0\u2013 cello on \"A Sudden Place\"\nJamie Edwards\u00a0\u2013 piano on \"A Sudden Place\", \"Cut to the Ending\", and \"My Eyes Have Seen\"; Chamberlin on \"My Eyes Have Seen\"\nNathan Golub\u00a0\u2013 art direction\nEric Heywood\u00a0\u2013 pedal steel guitar on \"Remember This\"\nSee also\n2022 in American music\nList of 2022 albums\n",
    "Italian jeweler (1937\u20132023)\nAttilio Codognato (Janaury 5, 1938 \u2013 November 13, 2023) was an Italian Jeweler. His family has operated the jewelry shop Casa Codognato in Venice for more than a century. Codognato ran the business from 1958 until his death in 2023. For several years he operated an art gallery, the Galleria del Leone, in Venice.\nLife and career\nAttilio Codognato was born in Milan on January 5, 1983, son of Mario Codognato.\nHis great-grandfather Simeone Codognato established the jewelry shop Casa Codognato in 1866, near Piazza San Marco in Venice. In 1897, his grandfather Attilio Codognato took over the business. He quickly established a reputation for making unique memento mori pieces out of unusual combinations of precious metals and stones, including skulls and snakes.  In 1928, he was succeeded by his son Mario Codognato.\nCodognato's father died when he was 11 years old. He moved to Venice as a young adult. When he was 21, he met the jeweler Enzo Salvati, who became his mentor.\nCodognato began operating the family business, Casa Codognato, in 1958. His clients included the Italian and Russian royal families and celebrities such as Maria Callas, Coco Chanel, and Elizabeth Taylor, which established Codognato as a symbol of ultra-exclusivity.\nCodognato was an avid art collector. His collection included works by Andy Warhol, Lucio Fontana, Cy Twombly, Robert Rauschenberg, and Bruce Nauman. Codognato founded Galleria del Leone in Venice in 1962. In 1963, he organized an exhibition of Christo and Jeanne-Claude's work, featuring various objects. The gallery closed in 1972, and he began publishing prints in 1973. In 1977, Codognato and art dealer Doug Christmas put together a Warhol exhibition at Il Prisione in Venice.\nIn 2016, an exhibition of Casa Codognato jewelry was mounted at the Serge Sorokko Gallery in San Francisco to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the business.\nCasa Codognato died following a period of ill health on November 13, 2023. He is survived by his son, Mario Codognato, and his daughter, Cristina Codognato, who is known as \"Kika.\"\nReference\n^ \"About us\". Attilio Codognato.

    "1963 American avant-garde film\nTwice a Man is a 1963 American avant-garde film directed by Gregory Markopoulos.\nSynopsis\nThe film opens with a black screen and the sound of rain. Paul stands at the edge of a roof, considering suicide, until the artist-physician places his hand on Paul's shoulder. Paul takes the ferry across the New York Harbor and visits his mother.\nAt his mother's house, memories and dreams of Paul, the artist-physician, and Paul's mother as a young and old woman are shown. In the film's ending, Paul collapses while dancing, and the artist-physician goes to kiss him, their faces merging in superimposition. Once the artist-physician moves away, the image of Paul cracks as if a broken mirror, and a white screen remains.\nCast\nPaul Kilb as Paul\nAlbert Torgesen as the artist-physician\nOlympia Dukakis as the young mother\nViolet Roditi as the elder mother\nProduction\nMarkopoulos's casting of Olympia Dukakis marked her first screen role. He shot the film in New York in March 1963, using a camera from Charles Levine. Markopoulos originally planned to include sync sound in Twice a Man but revised this several times while making the film. He prepared a script where dialogue was related to the images but not synchronized. He decided to instead use voice-over for a few of the characters before paring this down to voice-over for the mother only. His revised script reduced the dialogue to words and phrases that could be arranged as needed in the soundtrack. Markopoulos edited the scenes in order, with a highly intricate style in which shots may be broken up by sudden, rapid bursts of images.\nThemes\nTwice a Man is a modern retelling of the Greek myth of Hippolytus. Paul's ferry ride is symbolic of crossing the River Styx. Events at the house make reference to the offering of a lock of hair, the incestuous relation with Phaedra, and the heavenly rebirth. Critic P. Adams Sitney characterizes Twice a Man as a mythopoeic film, connecting it to other contemporary works in American experimental cinema\u2014Dog Star Man, Scorpio Rising, and Heaven and Earth Magic\u2014with a similar interest in myth-making.\nRelease\nA 1965 advertisement for Du sang de la volupte et de la mort and Twice a Man\nA silent version of Twice a Man screened at the Gramercy Arts Theatre on June 15, 1963, as part of a fundraiser organized by the Film-Makers' Cooperative to finish the film. Jonas Mekas documented the premiere in several shots of his film Lost, Lost, Lost. Twice a Man was first shown with its completed soundtrack on October 4, 1963.\nMarkopoulos submitted the film to the third Knokke-Le-Zoute Experimental Film Festival\u00a0 in Belgium, where it won a $2,000 prize. Because of an incident at the festival where Flaming Creatures could not be screened, Mekas floated the idea of prize recipients refusing their awards; however, Markopoulos decided to accept it.\nIn 1967, Markopoulos made a double projection of the film called Twice a Man Twice, in which one copy of the original film is played forward and the other in reverse. He included segments from Twice a Man in cycles 4, 8, 15, and 19 of his final project Eniaios.\nReception\nJonas Mekas praised the film in his column for The Village Voice, calling it \"the most important and most beautiful film to open in New York this year\". Critic Fred Camper credited it as \"the film that got me interested in cinema.\"\nRon Rice's The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man includes a parody of Twice a Man. His rough cut of the film, which was unfinished when he died in 1963, ends on the ferry where Twice a Man begins. Director Werner Schroeter cited the film's \"curiously slow, long-drawn-out sequences and frankly gay images of men\" as an influence on his 1969 film Eika Katappa\u200a\u00a0.\n",

    "2008 studio album by Benny Powell\nNextep is an album by trombonist Benny Powell. Featuring ten original compositions by Powell, his band members, and his ex-wife, it was recorded on February 9 and 10, 2007, at Alleycat Studio in South Orange, New Jersey, and was issued on CD in 2008 by Origin Records, Powell's last release as a leader. On the album, Powell is joined by saxophonist and flutist T. K. Blue, pianist Sayuri Goto, double bassist Essiet Okon Essiet, and drummer Billy Hart.\nIn an interview, Powell stated: \"The album is a culmination of New Orleans Second Line marching music, and rhythms from South Africa and the Caribbean. I called it Nextep because our next step is to be recognized as composers of original songs.\"\nReception\nIn a review for DownBeat, John Ephland wrote: \"This album is ripe with personality. Every cut evokes the aura of its leader... And each cut is different from the one that came before it... with this combination of players and repertoire, we get something worth listening to.\"\nAllMusic's Adam Greenberg stated: \"it's a special treat when a trombone actually works in the front of an ensemble. Here though, it's not just the trombone behind the album's success; it's the core trio behind the compositions... and their sparkling solos, as well as a solid rhythm section that can easily maneuver from a Caribbean groove to a late-night blues riff without missing a step.\"\nDan McClenaghan of All About Jazz commented: \"Powell assembles an ensemble of players of diverse backgrounds and gives them a free reign, and comes up with a gem of an album... Nextep is a wonderful example of a band full of players with disparate approaches coming together and creating beautifully fresh-sounding music, with the supple-toned trombonist Benny Powell at the helm.\" AAJ writer Andrew Velez remarked: \"Powell has said he thinks this is his best CD to date. Overflowing with strong, original music, it is absolutely first class all the way.\"\nWriting for JazzTimes, Will Smith noted: \"Powell may have lost a step or two with regard to his solo work on Nextep... yet he's still out there offering an abundance of music worth hearing with an often sprightly, burnished sound, and is clearly not slowing down... With widely varied music tinged by New Orleans, South African, Brazilian and Caribbean rhythms, the blues and bop, Powell and sidemen... move through this batch of original works with a relaxed grace and charm.\"\nTrack listing\n\"Free to Be Me\" (T.K.

    "American amateur botanist and lichenologist (1874\u20131930)\nCharles Albert Robbins (February 9, 1874 \u2013 January 22, 1930) was an American amateur botanist and lichenologist, known for his extensive work on the genus Cladonia. Despite lacking formal scientific training, Robbins made contributions to the field of botany, particularly in the study of lichens.\nLife and career\nBorn on February 9, 1874, in Stoughton, Massachusetts, Robbins was the son of Charles Orlando and Rosella Robbins. After receiving a primary school education, he entered the grocery business. In the early 1890s, he moved to Onset, a summer resort area in Wareham, Massachusetts, where he spent the remainder of his life. For nearly three decades, Robbins operated a grocery and provision business in partnership with Arthur B. Hammond.\nRobbins developed an interest in natural history around the age of 30, initially focusing on ornithology. His passion for botany, particularly the study of lichens, emerged later in life. By 1915, he began seriously collecting lichens, with a growing emphasis on the genus Cladonia.\nCladonia apodocarpa was described by Robbins in 1925.\nDespite his lack of formal training, Robbins became recognized as one of America's foremost experts on Cladonia. His work included:\nAssembling what was likely the largest private collection of Cladonia in the United States at the time.\nDescribing three new species and numerous forms of Cladonia.\nCollaborating with prominent lichenologists, including Alexander William Evans and Heinrich Sandstede.\nContributing specimens to Sandstede's exsiccata series, Cladoniae exsiccatae.\nRobbins conducted extensive field studies in the Wareham area, documenting approximately 46 species of Cladonia in the region. He was known for his meticulous approach to specimen collection and identification.\nIn addition to his work on lichens, Robbins studied flowering plants, with a particular focus on asters and goldenrods. He discovered several previously undocumented plant populations in Massachusetts, including Aster concolor and Luzula campestris var. acadiensis.\nPersonal life and legacy\nRobbins married Nellie Barnard of Onset in 1897. He died on January 22, 1930, shortly after retiring from his business. His Cladonia herbarium was donated to the Farlow Herbarium at Harvard University, with some materials going to Yale University. In 1972, Lawrence Mish recorded a list of the Cladonias of southeastern Massachusetts, making special reference to Robbin's collection; the publication cites 116 taxa and their distribution. Two of his personal daily diaries that he kept from the ages of 13 through 15 (1886\u20131888) are housed at the University of Michigan library,\nAlthough his death prevented the completion of his planned treatment of Cladonia in New England, Robbins' work significantly advanced the understanding of this genus in North America. According to Sidney Fay Blake, Robbins exemplified the important contributions that dedicated amateur botanists can make to scientific knowledge. Alexander William Evans dedicated the species Cladonia robbinsii in his honor in 1944.\nSelected publications\nRobbins, C.A. (1919). \"A colony of Cape Cod piping plover\".

She is known for her research in the biosynthesis of biotin compounds, focusing particularly on those that include the radioactive isotope Selenium-75 (\u2077\u2075Se). Her work has significantly advanced our understanding of biotin's role in cellular processes. It has shed light on the potential applications of selenium-labeled compounds in biochemistry and medicine.\nBackground\nBiotin, or vitamin B7, is a vital coenzyme involved in various metabolic processes, including fatty acid synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and gluconeogenesis. Selenium is an essential trace element with important biological roles, including antioxidant defense and thyroid hormone metabolism. Due to selenium's radioactive properties, incorporating selenium into biotin compounds provides a unique tool for studying biotin's function and distribution in biological systems.\nResearch and Methodology\nFrost focused on the biosynthesis of biotin compounds containing the isotope \u2077\u2075Se. Her research included the following key steps:\nIsotope Selection and Handling: Selecting \u2077\u2075Se for its suitable half-life and radiation properties, ensuring safe handling and use in laboratory settings.\nChemical Synthesis: Development of a chemical synthesis pathway to incorporate \u2077\u2075Se into the biotin molecule without disrupting its biological activity.\nBiological Integration: Studying how the synthesized \u2077\u2075Se-biotin compound is incorporated into biological systems, including its uptake, distribution, and metabolic fate in cells.\nAnalytical Techniques: Using advanced analytical techniques, such as chromatography and mass spectrometry, to track the \u2077\u2075Se-biotin compound in biological samples and investigate its interaction with cellular components.\nFindings and Implications\nThe research conducted by Frost yielded several significant findings:\nThe \u2077\u2075Se-biotin compound retained the biological activity of natural biotin, thereby enabling its utilization in various biochemical assays.\nThe incorporation of \u2077\u2075Se allowed precise tracking and quantification of biotin within complex biological systems.\nThe study provided valuable insights into the involvement of biotin in cellular processes and its potential therapeutic applications.\nApplications\nBiochemical Research: The capability to track biotin in cells and tissues has substantially advanced our understanding of its metabolic pathways and interactions with proteins.\nMedical Diagnostics: The utilization of \u2077\u2075Se-labeled biotin compounds holds promise for diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring, particularly in the investigation of biotin deficiency and related disorders.\nDrug Development: Frost's research insights could aid in the development of biotin-based therapies and selenium-containing drugs for various medical conditions.\n",

    "Political strategy\nOrthodox Jewish bloc voting is a political strategy used by Orthodox Jewish communities in the United States, predominately in New York and New Jersey, to vote as a bloc as directed by local leadership. While Orthodox Jews typically vote for Republican candidates on the national level, community leaders will often endorse local Democratic candidates if they are viewed as likely to win, or if they could effectively represent the Orthodox community's interests in a majority Democratic caucus.\nNotable instances\nIn the 2000 United States Senate election in New York, the Hasidic village of New Square gave Democrat Hillary Clinton 1,400 votes, compared to just 12 for her Republican opponent. Clinton's husband President Bill Clinton subsequently pardoned four New Square men convicted of defrauding government aid programs, which prompted allegations of vote trading. Clinton denied that clemency for the men had come up when she visited New Square on the campaign trail, and federal prosecutors determined in 2002 that no wrongdoing had occurred.\nIn the 2016 United States presidential election in New York, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's highest statewide totals both came from Orthodox areas: Clinton won 96% of the vote in a district of New Square, while Trump won 90% of the vote in a district of Monsey. In the 2020 election, Trump won 99% of the vote in the Satmar town of Kiryas Joel.\nIn 2022, Republican New York gubernatorial nominee Lee Zeldin won the state\u2019s heavily Orthodox 48th Assembly district by 66 points, but the district concurrently elected Democratic assemblyman Simcha Eichenstein.\nIn the 2023 New Jersey General Assembly election, Democrat Avi Schnall, an Orthodox rabbi, flipped a strongly Republican state legislative seat thanks to near-unanimous support from Orthodox leaders. Schnall won the heavily Orthodox town of Lakewood with 86% of the vote, a town which simultaneously gave Republican state senator Robert Singer (also endorsed by Orthodox leadership) 92% of the vote.\nIn the 2024 New York 17th district congressional race, Orthodox Jewish voters who supported incumbent Mike Lawler registered en masse to vote in the Working Families Party primary, electing a placeholder candidate over Democrat Mondaire Jones, who was seeking the line. Jones' loss of the Working Families line was seen as helping Lawler's prospects for the general election.\nEffects\nBloc voting has been noted to increase the political influence of Orthodox Jewish communities. In 2022, the New York Times wrote that city and state officials in New York had \"avoided taking action\" over Hasidic yeshivas that violated state laws, \"bowing to the influence of Hasidic leaders who push their followers to vote as a bloc and have made safeguarding the schools their top political priority\". Due to bloc voting, local and statewide candidates in New York treat Hasidic community endorsements as critical, and few elected officials embrace positions that would antagonize them.\nSome Orthodox candidates in New York, due to high popular support, have run unopposed on both the Democratic and Republican lines.\nDecline\nThe prevalence of Orthodox Jewish bloc voting has been noted by some commentators to be declining in recent years, as Orthodox Jews increasingly vote based on personal conviction or participate in national ideological movements.\n",
    "\nPort in India\nKeni Port is a proposed deep-sea port at Keni village in Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka. The Karnataka Maritime Board signed an agreement with JSW Infrastructure in November 2023 to build the port. It is estimated that the port will be constructed at a cost of more than \u20b94 thousand crore.\nThe port will consist of a harbor protected by Breakwaters, and deep channel. Cargo will be handled through port's container terminal, dry bulk cargo terminal and multipurpose cargo terminal. It will have a maximum depth of 20 meters and will be able to accommodate panamax and capesized vessels. A statement from the state government estimated that the port's net draft 18 meters, allowing Capesize vessels with 200,000 DWT (deadweight tonnage) to enter the proposed port.\nPort details\nHarbour\nThe harbor of the Keni deep sea port will be an artificial harbor, which is protected by Breakwaters. The prescribed water depth for the harbor basin is 16.5 metres (54\u00a0ft) (1st phase), which will accommodate large ships; the maneuvering basin between the harbor basin and the approach channel will be 15.4 metres (51\u00a0ft) deep. The land required for the construction of infrastructure for cargo handling will be land reclaimed from the sea by filling with sediment.\nApproach channel\nAn 7.3 kilometres (4.5\u00a0mi) (1st phase) long approach channel at open sea will be used for the movement of ships to the port's harbor. The approach channel has a depth of 16.1 metres (53\u00a0ft) and a minimum width of 150 metres (490\u00a0ft), allowing vessels with a draft of 14.5 metres (48\u00a0ft) to arrive and depart the harbor.\nConnectivity\nThe location of the port is well connected to the hinterland through National and State Highways. The nearest national highway from the port is National Highway 66, which is at a distance of 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi).\nThere are plans to connect the port to the existing Konkan railway line. Ankola railway station is the nearest railway station from the port, at a distance of 8.2 kilometres (5.1\u00a0mi).\nFootnotes\n^ In 2016, a techno-economic feasibility report was prepared by AECOM India Private Limited for Ministry of Shipping / Indian Ports Association to build a deep-sea port at Keni village, which was referred to as the Port at Belekeri in the report. However, the Karnataka Maritime Board established Keni port limits at locaton of the proposed Belekeri port in 2022.\n",
    "\nThe Battle of Derbent was the major battle during the \u00d6zdemir Operation of the Anglo-Turkish War (1918\u20131923), which lasted with Turkish victory.\nBackground\non 16 December 1921, the British army had a Severely loose in the Battle of Baba\u00e7i\u00e7ek. For the revenge of this loose, the British army attacked Erbil and Revandiz since January 1922. After these attacks started to increase, commander-in-chef Mustafa Kemal Pasha ordered to create a militia. The militia had been created on February 1, 1922. The leader of this milita was going to be \u015eefik \u00d6zdemir. \u015eefik \u00d6zdemir Bey left Ankara on 9 March 1922 and arrived Diyarbak\u0131r in  22 April, and after that he and his detachment arrived Revandiz on 22 June 1922, after a difficult and tiring journey. The detachment entered Revandiz amidst the enthusiastic welcome of the people, festivities were held, the tribes around came to the city and greeted \u00d6zdemir Bey and the detachment; Sacrifices were made and prayers were said. \u00d6zdemir Bey immediately established an organization in the region and acted in line with the general wishes of the people. The people, who had been without a government for a long time, applauded and loved \u00d6zdemir Bey as the representative of Mustafa Kemal Pasha. The people showed loyalty to \u00d6zdemir Bey by calling him \u00d6zdemir Pasha.\nWhen British soldiers realized \u00d6zdemir's hegemony is increasing day by day in Al-Jazeera, the British attacked \u00d6zdemir's forces on 10 July 1922 at Rewandiz with 12 planes, but it was unsuccessful. \u00d6zdemir decided to attack Derbent -which was a strategical place in Al-Jazeera- after this battle.\nBattle\nDuring the battle, \u015eefik \u00d6zdemir had 700 soldiers and volunteers while British had 7,000 soldiers.

    "\nThe Stanford University endowment, includes real estate and other investments valued at $36.5 billion as of August 31, 2023, and is one of the four largest academic endowments in the United States. The endowment consists of $29.9 billion in a merged pool of assets and $6.6 billion of real estate near the main campus. Along with Stanford's pension assets, working capital, and non-cash gifts, the endowment is managed by Stanford Management Company (SMC), a Stanford-owned investment management company.\nHistory\nNineteenth century\n1895-1899\nThe history of the Stanford University endowment predates the university's founding. The endowment began in 1885 when Leland Stanford and his wife Jane conveyed approximately $20 million to the university. Upon Leland's death, the federal government filed a claim against his estate for $15 million which threatened the university's financials. Jane, who had assumed full control of the university and its finances, managed to keep the university afloat by selling personal assets and contributing personal funds. In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Stanford Estate in the case United States v. Stanford which relieved financial pressure on the university.\nTwentieth century\n1900-1950\nIn the early 20th century, Stanford University, founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford, relied heavily on the initial endowment of lands and the wealth left by the Stanfords. The initial years saw modest growth in the endowment, primarily through traditional philanthropic avenues. However, it was during this period that the foundation for later growth was laid. For example, Stanford's early association with the fledgling technology industry began with faculty members like Frederick Terman, who is often credited with fostering the early development of Silicon Valley.\nDuring this period, Stanford's endowment grew from approximately $10 million in 1900 to about $20 million by 1950.\n1950-1970\nThe post-World War II era marked a significant phase in expanding Stanford's endowment. The federal government's increased funding for research, especially in defense and technology, benefited the university substantially. By the 1950s, Stanford had established the Stanford Industrial Park, later known as the Stanford Research Park, which attracted technology firms and facilitated partnerships between the university and the burgeoning tech industry.\nThis period also saw substantial donations from alumni and industrialists who increasingly recognized Stanford's pivotal role in innovation and technology. By 1970, Stanford's endowment had grown to approximately $100 million.\n1970-1990\nThe 1970s and 1980s were transformative decades for Stanford's endowment, driven significantly by the university's strategic involvement in the growth of Silicon Valley. Stanford's faculty, students, and alumni played crucial roles in founding numerous high-tech companies, including Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems. The university's proactive policies in allowing faculty to commercialize their research and in taking equity positions in start-ups resulted in substantial financial gains.\nOne of the landmark contributions to Stanford's endowment came from Bill Hewlett and David Packard, founders of Hewlett-Packard, who were instrumental in establishing the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. These foundations donated significantly to Stanford, enhancing its financial stability and capacity for future growth.\nIn addition to direct donations, Stanford's endowment benefited immensely from its venture capital and private equity investments, particularly those connected to the tech industry. The university's participation in venture capital funds, such as those managed by Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins, yielded impressive returns. By 1990, Stanford's endowment had surged to approximately $1 billion.\n1990-1999\nBy the 1990s, Stanford's endowment had grown to be one of the largest in the world, thanks in large part to the success of its investments in Silicon Valley companies. In response to the growing complexity of investment markets and the need for specialized asset management, the university founded the Stanford Management Company in 1991. Before the establishment of SMC, Stanford's financial assets were managed internally by the university's Office of the Treasurer, which is now a function of the SMC. The creation of SMC aimed to professionalize asset management, bringing in specialized financial expertise to optimize investment strategies and enhance returns.\nThe university continued to receive substantial philanthropic contributions from tech entrepreneurs and investors. For instance, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both Stanford graduates, made significant contributions to the university, further bolstering its endowment. Moreover, the university's strategic decision to retain ownership stakes in successful start-ups continued to pay off handsomely. Notab",

    "American sailor\nDaniela Moroz (born 2 February 2001) is an American sailor who became the World champion at Formula Kite six times between 2016 and 2022.\nLife\nMoroz was born in Berkeley in 2001. Her parents were Czech immigrants. They had both left their country in 1983 pretending to go on holiday but never returning to their country which was in turmoil. Her parents never met until they were both in California and they met because they shared a common interest in surfing. They dated because of their common life story and they married in 1993.\nMoroz won six gold medals at the Formula Kite World Championships between 2016 and 2022, a gold medal at the 2023 Pan American Games and four gold medals at the Formula Kite European Championships between 2017 and 2021.\nShe won her first world title at Weifang Binhai in China in 2016 when she was sixteen. She competed closely with the 18 year old Russian Elena Kalinina. Moroz went into the lead on the sixth and last day in light winds changing the predictions as Kalinina had dominated on day five. Moroz improved her performance to win with Kalinina is second and the British Stephanie Bridge\u00a0 in the bronze position.\nIn 2021 the Formula Kite World Championships was in Torregrande in Sardinia. She beat the leading British surfer Ellie Aldridge and the French surfer Lauriane Nolot. At the world championships in 2022 in Sardinia, she again beat Lauriane Nolot.\nNolot won the Test Event which was a rehearsal for the Paris Olympic Games in Marseille. Moroz came fourth. It was nearly the first time that she had not made the top three at a regatta and she decided to take a break. She had been travelling and living in hotels for years. Her previous technique of training harder and longer than her fellow competitors was no longer the solution. She consulted sports psychologists and retired from the sport between August 2023 and 2024. She rediscovered her love for kite surfing during that time. She runs her Olympic campaign which involves not only training but contacting sponsors to gather the money required to fund her work.\nAfter the 2024 World championships event in May in Hy\u00e8res Moroz was dropped to fourth place overall after Ellie Aldridge's win at the event moved her to third place. Lauriane Nolot was in the overall date at that time with Jessie Kampman in secind position.\n",
    "Crocker Cemetery, also known as St. John's Chapel Cemetery, is located in Sarasota, Florida at 2039-2045 Bee Ridge Rd, Sarasota, FL 34239. It was established by Peter Crocker in 1901.\nHistory\nPeter Crocker, T.T. Hamlin, and L.C. Demings were the three original trustees of St. John's Church and Cemetery. They were deeded the 2 acres of land from the Florida Mortgage and Investment Company on June 27th, 1901, for $1. The property was meant to be used for a church and a graveyard. The cemetery saw its first burial in 1907 and remained an active site until 1999. On February 19th, 2001, the cemetery received historic designation.\nTrustees\nIn 1951, J.B. Morris, Sherman Smith, and Isaac Snow were appointed as the new trustees. The next nine rounds of trustee appointments included Hardy Albury, Thomas Foster, Francis Forde, Paul Shetler, Quincy Mixon, John Dibler, Sue Whetzel, Walt Westervelt, and Jon Purdum. The most recent trustees, Sue Whetzel, Walt Westervelt, and Jon Purdum took on their roles in 1998.\n1901\nPeter Crocker, T.T. Hamlin, and L.C. Demings\n1951\nJ.B.

In 1997, the trustees appointed Bill Whetzel as cemetery coordinator to head the restoration of the cemetery. Whetzel dedicated himself to restoring the property, overseeing a decade of efforts that included regular grounds maintenance, restoration of headstones for unmarked graves, installation of new signage, and securing historical designation. Whetzel also received the help of volunteers from different organizations to assist in the restoration.\nIn order to obtain the funds necessary for the restoration, the trustees leased the unused portions of the property to Boston Market and Johnny's Car Wash.\nChallenges\nThe cemetery faced several issues throughout the 1980s and 2000s.\nIn 1985, the county began the process of widening Bee Ridge Road. This involved paving over part of the cemetery property that had graves present. Since the county and the trustees could not come to an agreement, the issue was taken to court. It was ruled that the county would pay the trustees $35,000 in damages, a funeral director be present to oversee the reinternment of the bodies, $60 to be paid for each new gravesite, and replace affected fencing.\nIn 1993, the trustees were taken to court by John Dibler for unknowingly appointing him as a trustee. The court ruled that Dibler was to be removed from the board and all obligations.\nFive years after Bill Whetzel became cemetery coordinator, the county's property appraiser, Jim Todora, imposed a property tax on the parcels leased out to Boston Market and Johnny's Car Wash. The trustees refused to pay the taxes since the income from the rents collected was only just enough for the cost of maintaining the cemetery grounds. They went up against the Value Adjustment Board and they were denied a reassessment. Whetzel emailed the County and City of Sarasota demanding that the property tax assessments would be revised, and no taxes would be owed. When that did not work, he went to Pelican Press to have the story published in the paper. As a last-ditch effort the trustees offered the city or the county to take ownership of the cemetery, but both declined. Finally, at the end of 2004, Whetzel brought the issue to the county commissioners, and it was resolved.\nDuring the property tax issue in April 2004, there were problems with the leases to Boston Market and Johnny's Car Wash. The trustees leased the land adjacent to the cemetery to both Johnny's Car Wash and Boston Market, invalidating Johnny's Car Wash's lease. When McDonalds took ownership of Boston Market, they threatened legal action against the trustees.\n",

    "Debate in the House of Representatives in the Netherlands\nKVP leader Norbert Schmelzer speaking on 11 October 1966.\nThe Night of Schmelzer was a debate in the House of the Representatives of the Netherlands that took place from 13 October to the early hours of 14 October 1966. The night was the last day of the general debate on the 1967 budget, which had started on 11 October. During the conclusion of the debate, Norbert Schmelzer, the parliamentary group leader of the Catholic People's Party (KVP), introduced a motion against the Cals cabinet. This cabinet included members from the KVP, alongside Labour Party (PvdA) en de Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP). The motion was perceived by the cabinet as a vote of no confidence, but it was passed regardless. As a result, the cabinet resigned on 15 October.\nThe Night of Schmelzer catalyzed ongoing developments in Dutch politics. Within the Labour Party, distrust of the KVP grew, leading to a polarization strategy and the rise of the New Left faction. This Night accelerated the KVP's electoral decline, which had begun with depillarisation. Christian radicals, who preferred cooperation with the PvdA, split off from the KVP in 1968 to form the Political Party of Radicals. On the other side, the Night contributed to KVP, CHU and ARP forming the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). Anti-establishment parties like the Farmers' Party and the newly founded Democrats 66, established on 14 October 1966, saw increased popularity in the 1967 general election.\nBackground\nGovernment table during the debate on 13 October 1966.\nAfter the 1963 general election, the Marijnen cabinet, comprising the KVP, VVD, CHU, and ARP, took office. This cabinet fell in early 1965 after a cabinet crisis over the broadcasting system, in which the KVP and ARP opposed the VVD. KVP faction leader and informateur Norbert Schmelzer's attempts to resolve the issues during the formation that year were unsuccessful. MP and formateur Jo Cals, representing the KVP's left wing, successfully formed the Cals cabinet, including the KVP, PvdA, and ARP.\nThe cabinet garnered little enthusiasm. Within the KVP, most preferred a coalition with the VVD, while a small faction, including Cals, favored Roman/Red cooperation. Personal rivalry between Cals and Schmelzer added to tensions within the party. The ARP also faced internal division between traditionalists and radical evangelicals, marked by rivalry between party leader Bauke Roolvink and Deputy Prime Minister Barend Biesheuvel. PvdA supporters were skeptical of the 1965 partner swap, fearing the KVP aimed to resolve the broadcasting issue before resuming a coalition with the VVD.\nThe cabinet took office during an unfavorable economic period marked by a wage-price spiral and government overspending since 1964. During the formation, the PvdA insisted on deviating from the Romme norm, which restricted government expenditure growth to the rate of national income, much to the dismay of right-wing KVP members. This deviation was immediately applied to the 1966 national budget. The KVP and ARP were frustrated with the inflexibility of Finance Minister Anne Vondeling (PvdA) and Cals. Schmelzer had to threaten resignation to prevent his parliamentary group from opposing the budget.\nIn the March 1966 provincial elections and the June 1966 municipal council elections, the government parties, particularly the PvdA, suffered losses. Despite this, the three parties remained committed to participating in the government but adopted a more critical stance in anticipation of the February 1967 Dutch general election. None of the parties ruled out the possibility of a cabinet crisis.\nNational budget 1967\nThe immediate issue was the 1967 national budget. The cabinet proposed addressing budget gaps by accelerating income tax collection. During deliberations, Finance Minister Vondeling claimed that after implementing all measures, the budget deficit was only 26 million guilders, within the margin of error, so further action was unnecessary. However, the KVP parliamentary group believed the deficit was significantly larger.\nDebate\n11 and 12 October\nVVD parliamentary group leader Edzo Toxopeus speaking during the general debate on 11 October 1966.\nOn 11 and 12 October 1966, the general political debate began. Edzo Toxopeus and Henk Beernink, leaders of the VVD and CHU respectively, criticized the cabinet's financial policy and argued that the cabinet should resign. PvdA party leader Gerard Nederhorst\u00a0 predicted an improvement in economic circumstances based on the budget, but the party still had a number of questions. Roolvink was critical of the financial policy on behalf of the ARP, but did not want to express an opinion yet.\nSchmelzer started his term with a positive yet critical reflection but concluded with sharp criticism of the national budget. He argued that the cabinet's forecast was overly optimistic and lacked sufficient coverage. He offered several austerity suggestions and expre",
    "Israeli naval base\nAshdod Naval Base also known as Southern Arena of the Israeli Navy is a naval base located in the port city of Ashdod near the Port of Ashdod and plays an important role in the surveillance and blockade of Gaza strip as well as protecting the Port of Ashdod.\nHistory\nEstablishment\nThe construction of the permanent camp in the south of the port began in 1965. A temporary base was established in the port within a day. Lt. Col. Yekutiel Netz was appointed as the commander of the base.\nSix Day War\nAmphibious warfare ships in preparation for the landing operation at El Arish beach were stationed there. During the Six Day War and after it, ships from the 914th Torpedo Squadron were attached to floats and received fuel and supplies from the base.\nWar of Attrition\nDuring the War of Attrition, the Israeli warships engaged with an Egyptian destroyer, sinking the destroyer in about 25 minutes. This incident came to be known as Battle of Romani. The Israeli warships were directed from this base.\nInauguration\nThe inauguration of the permanent camp of the Navy base in Ashdod was held on 12 August 1968. The commander of the navy stated \"the new base of the navy in Ashdod is a key to maintaining the ongoing security and sovereignty of Israel along the southern coasts from North Sinai to the entrances of Port Said\".\nYom Kippur War\nThe Battle of Baltim was fought between the Israeli Navy and the Egyptian Navy on 8\u20139 October 1973, during the Yom Kippur War between Baltim and Damietta. The Israeli warships that participated in the battle were stationed and co-ordinated from this base.\nRelocation attempts\nIn the early 1980s, Defense Minister Ariel Sharon wanted to bring the Navy closer to Gaza to save sailing time by moving the base to the city of Ashkelon. The mayor of Ashdod, Zvi Zilkar, strongly opposed this, partly and the plan was ultimately cancelled.\nAftermath of the First Intifada\nAfter the First Intifada and the creation of a Palestinian Authority in Gaza strip, five patrols boats were organised for regular patrols which number grew to be seven patrol boats.\nDisengagement from Gaza\nDuring the Israeli disengagement from Gaza, the base served as a major evacuation and transport hub for the evacuation of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) personnel from Gaza strip.\n2006 Gaza\u2013Israel conflict\nDuring the Operation Summer Rains on 26 June, the Israeli Navy imposed a naval closure of the Gaza Strip, to prevent the hostage Gilad Shalit being smuggled out by sea by the Palestinian militants. The navy increased patrols of naval vessels along the Gaza coastline, and prepared for an attempt to smuggle Shalit out by boat, sending instructions to captains. Palestinian fast boats were banned from operating in the area, and only small Palestinian fishing boats were allowed on the sea. These patrols were organised from this base.\nBlockade of the Gaza Strip\nThe Blockade of the Gaza Strip starting in 2007 was organised from this base.\nOperation Cast Lead\nDuring the Gaza War (2008\u20132009) the Israeli Navy attacked Hamas' rocket launchers and outposts, command and control centers, a Hamas patrol boat, and the office of Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, using the Typhoon Weapon System and surface to surface missiles. The navy coordinated with other Israeli forces and used powerful shipboard sensors to acquire and shell targets on land.  Records of the attacks published by the navy indicate that for the first time vessels were equipped with Spike ER electro-optically guided anti-armor missiles. Videos of an attack showed precision hits from a Typhoon stabilizing gun despite a rolling sea. Versions of the Spike were also used by ground units and possibly by helicopters or unmanned aerial vehicles. Shayetet 13 naval commandos were also deployed to attack targets on land, and reportedly attacked an Iranian ship loaded with arms for Hamas, which was docking in Sudan. On 28 December, Naval vessels shelled the Port of Gaza.\nOn 29 December, the Free Gaza Movement relief boat Dignity carrying volunteer doctors with 3.5 tons of medical supplies, human rights activists (Among them Caoimhe Butterly and former US Representative Cynthia McKinney), and a CNN reporter was involved in an altercation with Israeli patrol boats. The captain of the Free Gaza vessel said that their vessel had been rammed intentionally and that there had been no warning before it had been rammed. An Israeli spokesman disputed this, and said the collision was caused by the Dignity attempting to outmaneuver the patrol boats after disobeying Israeli orders to turn back.\nOn 4 January the Israeli Navy extended its blockade of the Gaza Strip to 20 nautical miles (37\u00a0km; 23\u00a0mi).\nNaval squadrons during the Operation Warm Winter were also coordinated from here.\nThroughout the war, the Israeli Navy employed Sa'ar 4.5-class missile boats of the flotilla in addition to Super Dvora Mk III-class patrol boats which were coordinated from this base.\nMay 2010 Gaza flotilla raid\nOn 31 Ma",

    "From the Second Temple Period\nStone vessels on display in the Burnt House in Jerusalem\nThe use of stone vessels made from soft limestone among Jews during the Second Temple period and beyond was widespread across Judea, the Galilee and the Golan Heights. Initially appearing in the early 1st century BCE, these vessels continued to be utilized until different times in various regions. \nIn Judea, their use was traditionally thought to have ceased after the destruction of the Second Temple, but discoveries in places like Jericho and Shuafat indicate their continued use until the Bar Kokhba revolt. Conversely, in the Galilee, their use persisted until the 4th century CE. These stone vessels were found in all regions densely populated by Jews, often in settlements featuring ritual baths, serving as a significant indicator of Jewish presence from the early Roman period through the Byzantine era.\nStone vessels held particular religious significance in Jewish ritual law due to their imperviousness to impurity, contrasting with pottery vessels that could become impure and would need to be discarded or broken. This property likely contributed to their popularity during a period when adherence to purity laws was paramount in Jewish culture.\nThe remains of at least five workshops dedicated to producing stone vessels from the Second Temple Period have been identified as of 2021. These workshops were located near Jerusalem (Mount Scopus and Hizma), in the Galilee (Einot Amitai and Reineh), and in the Golan Heights (Wadi es-Sufera). Evidence suggests the presence of more workshops within Jerusalem itself, including Jabal Mukaber, Tel el-Ful, and Bethlehem of Galilee. These workshops operated within caves where craftsmen quarried chalk (soft limestone) and crafted stone vessels using manual techniques or lathes.\nRole and importance\nStone vessels made of soft limestone, were used by Jews throughout Judaea during the Second Temple period and beyond. They first appeared during the early 1st century BCE and were gradually phased out during the following centuries. Their use in Judea was originally thought to have ceased after the destruction of the Second Temple, though through their discovery in such Jewish sites as those in Jericho and Shuafat, it became clear that their use continued until the Bar Kokhba revolt. By contrast, in the Galilee they continued to be used until the 4th century CE at least. \u00a0Stone vessels were found in all the regions that were densely populated by Jews according to historical sources, and in all settlements which also contained ritual baths. As a result, Stone vessels, along with the presence of Mikvehs and a lack of imported vessels, serve as a clear indicator for Jewish sites in Judaea from the early Roman period through the Byzantine period.\nHistorical context\nIt is widely accepted that during the Second Temple period, and especially after the founding of the Hasmonean state in Judaea, there began a dramatic increase in the awareness and practice of the laws of purity among Jews. A testimony to this is the sudden appearance and spread of such elements of material culture as Mikvehs and stone vessels. This is most probably due to the centrality of the Temple around which the laws of purity revolved, though some have suggested that there was a political aspect to this as well.\nIn Judea, the use of stone vessels continued even after the destruction of the temple, and finally ceased altogether with the crushing of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 136 CE, though in the galilee there is evidence for their continuous use through the 4th-century CE.\nReligious context\nAccording to early interpretations of biblical law, the susceptibility of vessels to impurity is, among other things, based on the material that composed them. The biblical book of Leviticus lists the substances which become impure when they come in contact with a dead animal:When one of them dies and falls on something, that article, whatever its use, will be unclean, whether it is made of wood, cloth, hide or sackcloth. Put it in water; it will be unclean till evening, and then it will be clean.The book of Numbers further lists other materials, including metals, which become impure when they come in contact with human remains:Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood. Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, \u201cThis is what is required by the law that the Lord gave Moses: Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead, and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water.It is based on these lists that it was deduced during the Second Temple period that vessels made of these materials, namely wood, cloth, leather, sackcloth, pottery, bone and metal, are all susceptible to impurity, while vessels made of material not mentioned",
    "Dragon boat accident in Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Cambodia\nOn 23 November 2007, a 22-member Singapore national dragon boat team capsized after colliding with a pontoon in Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Cambodia, leading to the deaths of five Singaporean dragon boat paddlers after they were sucked under the pontoon by strong water currents.\nThey were participating in Bon Om Touk, an annual Cambodian festival. The five Singaporeans were found on 25 November floating downstream towards Phnom Penh. They were later identified by relatives and brought to Calmette Hospital.\nBackground\nThe Singapore national dragon boat team had arrived in Cambodia on the morning of 23 November, the first time that Singapore had participated in the Bon Om Touk, where the Tonl\u00e9 Sap River reverses in its water flow towards the lake. Before beginning, the Singapore team noticed that the currents were stronger that day and that the water was dirty. The Singapore team also decided to not wear lifejackets as it would have allowed them to \"paddle faster\".\nIncident\nTonl\u00e9 Sap River where the incident occurred, pictured in 2003\nOn 23 November, after the race, the Singapore team was being brought back to shore by a safety vessel. However, after seeing other teams paddle back to shore, opted to paddle back themselves to practice and get a better feel of the water conditions.\nUpon reaching the pontoon, they slowly navigated the 50m gap between the two pontoons and began angling the boat halfway to turn into the docking point, however, a sudden shift in direction caused the dragon boat to capsize sideways and all 22 dragon boat paddlers and the boat were sucked underneath the pontoon by strong currents. Out of the 22, only 17 paddlers could be recovered.\nSearch efforts\nSoon after, the first responders were eight divers and five boats from a speedboat workshop near Chroy Changvar Bridge. Nhim Vanda, Head of Cambodia's Disaster Management Agency, was called on by then-Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen to aid in the search efforts.\nOn 24 November, the search party had grown to 400 people\u2014Cambodian police, navy, and fishermen. 3 million riel was offered to find the paddlers and the search was widened to the whole venue of the festival. By midday, they tried attaching fishing nets to the bottom of search boats in an attempt to pick up the paddlers. At about 3 p.m., Singapore sent a 8-man Naval Diving Unit team to aid in the search.\nOn 25 November, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines offered to help in the search efforts. After replacing the fishing nets with metal hooks, they found the first body at Koh Pich at 8 a.m. and two more bodies soon after, 40 hours after the incident. The final two bodies resurfaced on their own.\nVictims\nThe victims are as follows.\nChee Wei Cheng, 20\nJeremy Goh, 24\nStephen Loh, 31\nPoh Boon San, 27\nReuben Kee, 23\nAftermath\nThe bodies were later brought to Calmette Hospital where they were cleaned and treated by traditions from the Embassy of Singapore in Cambodia. On 28 November, the Singapore Dragon Boat Association made wearing lifejackets mandatory for all dragon boat paddlers. On 29 November, a memorial service was held for the 5 paddlers at Mandai Crematorium and a speech was given by the captain of the dragon boat Yeo Chin Hwei. Then-Minister for Community Development and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan attended the memorial service.\nThen-Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen paid respects to his Singaporean counterpart, then-Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. In December, an inquiry panel was launched to investigate the dragon boat incident. In 2008, the inquiry panel stated that a combination of factors such as the paddler's unfamiliarity of the race venue, the low safety awareness, and the lack of preparation may have led to the accident.\nIn 2008, two survivors of the accident, Alex Loh Kar Meng and Xie Jiaqi, launched a bursary at Nanyang Technological University called the Poh Boon San and Stephen Loh Soon Ann NTU Dragon Boat Endowed Bursary Fund. In 2023, the Singapore dragon boat team made its return to Cambodia, 16 years after the accident, to participate in the 2023 SEA Games.\nSee also\n2010 Penang dragon boat tragedy\n2011 Pr\u00e6st\u00f8 Fjord dragon boat accident\n",
    "The Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program is an ongoing program under the United States Department of Energy, office of fusion energy sciences to support the development of a fusion pilot plant (FPP) and eventually commercialize fusion power. As of 2024, eight private companies have received a total of $46 million for the first 18-month period of performance. The program is planned to run for five years and culminate in one or more fusion pilot plants. \nHistory\nThe need for a fusion pilot plant has been recognized throughout the program to develop fusion power. Most recently before the announcement of the Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program, in 2021 the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) released a report which highlighted the need for such a program and advised its creation. In 2022 the Biden administration and DOE announced a Bold Decadal Vision for Commercial Fusion Energy which included plans to fund support for pilot plant development program.\nThe funding opportunity announcement (FOA) was announced by the US Department of Energy in September of 2022, and $50\u00a0million was earmarked for the program.\nApplications were received in December 2022. Eight companies were selected for negotiation in May of 2023. However, agreements were not signed with the awardees until more than a year later in June of 2024, reportedly due to concerns over how intellectual property would be handled.\nIn June 2024, at a White House summit the Department of Energy announced that all eight companies had successfully concluded detailed milestones negotiations with the federal government and that agreements had been signed to commence the Milestone Program.\nAwardees\nThe eight awardees are:\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems (Cambridge, MA)\nFocused Energy Inc. (Austin, TX)\nThea Energy, Inc (formerly Princeton Stellarators Inc., Branchburg, NJ)\nRealta Fusion Inc. (Madison, WI)\nTokamak Energy Inc. (US subsidiary of UK-based company, Bruceton Mills, WV)\nType One Energy Group (Madison, WI)\nXcimer Energy Inc. (Redwood City, CA)\nZap Energy Inc. (Everett, WA)\nThe awardees include 2 companies pursuing the tokamak approach, 2 companies pursuing the stellarator approach, 2 companies pursuing inertial confinement fusion, one company pursuing the magnetic mirror approach, and one company pursuing the Z-pinch approach.\nStructure\nThe program is structured as a public\u2013private partnership between the DOE and the awardees. The companies unlock matching funds upon completion of quantitative milestones, up to the full award amount.\nThe program is structured in three periods of performance: One spanning the first 18 months, one spanning the second 18 months, and one spanning the remaining 24 months of the five-year term. The first period of performance will presumably end around the end of 2025, assuming a start date based on the June 2024 announcement. \nOnly the first period of performance has been announced and awarded. The $46 million number is for the first period of performance. Subsequent periods of performance have not as of 2024 been announced, appropriated, or awarded.\nThe applicants were encouraged to propose collaborations with US national laboratories, with which the DOE would contract separately and pay directly. Oak Ridge National Laboratory will work with six of the eight companies.\nDispute over intellectual property\nThe year-long gap between the announcement of awardees and their signing agreements with the DOE was apparently due to a dispute over how companies' intellectual property would be treated under the award. Reporting stated that the companies' rights to existing and subject intellectual property was not sufficiently safeguarded under the DOE's initial proposed terms. At the time of the announcement, the total private investment in Commonwealth Fusion Systems was larger than $2 billion.\nAwardee table\n",
    "A 1988 book of Islamic supplications\nFortress of the Muslim (also Fortification of the Muslim; Arabic: \u062d\u0635\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0630\u0643\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0629, \u1e25i\u1e63n al-Muslim min ad\u035fhk\u0101r wa l-sunna) is a book of supplications and invocations (dua) compiled by the Saudi Islamic scholar Sa'id bin Ali bin Wahf Al-Qahtani in October 1988.\nAl-Qahtani received his doctorate from the College of the Fundamentals of Religion of the Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, which is considered to be a Wahhabi educational institution. Fortress is Al-Qahtani's most famous and popular book; it has been translated into many languages and used by believers irrespective of their proficiency in Arabic language. Every dua in translated editions is provided in Arabic and accompanied by a translation and a pronunciation guide to facilitate the following of the example of Muhammad in his constant usage of dua.\nThe supplications are grouped by occasion such as \"dua to say before a meal\"; there are 132 of them. The source for all of the dua that Al-Qahtani included in his book are various hadith collections and the Quran itself. Al-Qahtani put a lot of effort into presenting the dua in his book as the true and pure record of the Quran and the most sound of ahadith, which is typical for Salafi authors.\nFortress is very popular both among mainstream and Salafi Muslims, both recent converts and people born into ummah; they carry it with them and often try to memorise pages from it. The only Islamic book that outsells the Fortress in 2014 in Kazakhstan is the Quran. Several mobile applications with dua from the Fortress exist.\nOne of the reasons of this popularity is that Fortress is seen as an acceptable source by the so-called modern Islamic piety movement whose adherents donate money for the promotion of Islam such as book printing. By sponsoring the distribution of Fortress, they make sure that the believers recite the \"correct\" dua and not the customary ones, which may include asking the spirits of the ancestors for help\u00a0\u2013 a practice seen as sinful by modernists. Fortress is also read by the members of the Kazakhstani neopagan movement Ata Zholy\u00a0.\nIt is one of the many common Islamic books that are banned in Russia as \"extremist literature\", which, coupled with its ubiquity, is used to persecute Crimean Tatars and other Muslims living in Russia. For example, in 2016, a foreign citizen was fined and deported from Russia after the police found Fortress among her possessions during a search.\nThe book was translated into English by Ismael Ibraheem as Fortification of the Muslim through remembrance and supplication from the Quran and Sunnah in 1998.\nNotes\n^ a b Schwab 2014, p.\u00a029.\n^ a b c d Sinani 2024, p.\u00a07.\n^ a b Schwab 2014, p.\u00a028.\n^ Schwab 2014, p.\u00a022.\n^ Wagemakers 2021.\n^ Sounaye 2015, p.\u00a0123.\n^ Schwab 2014, p.\u00a031.\n^ Sorgenfrei 2021, p.\u00a02.\n^ Schwab 2014, p.\u00a026.\n^ Schwab 2014, p.\u00a027.\n^ Schwab 2014, p.\u00a034.\n^ Akhmetova 2018.\n^ \u0411\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 2015, p.\u00a0110.\n^ \u041c\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e & \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d 2015, p.\u00a022.\n^ \u0417\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 & \u0424\u0435\u043e\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 2018, p.\u00a089.\n",
    "Overview of non-compete agreements in the United States\nThe majority of U.S. states recognize and enforce various forms of non-compete agreements. A few states, such as California, North Dakota, and Oklahoma, totally ban noncompete agreements for employees, or prohibit all noncompete agreements except in limited circumstances.\nPrevalence and status\nData from 2018 indicates that non-compete clauses cover 18 percent of American labor force participants. A 2023 petition to the FTC to ban non-compete agreements estimated that about 30 million workers (about 20% of all U.S. workers) were subject to a noncompete clause. While higher-wage workers are comparatively more likely to be covered by non-compete clauses, non-competes covered 14 percent of workers without college degrees in 2018. By some estimates, nearly half of all technical workers are covered by non-compete agreements.\nFederal law\nIn March 2019, Democratic officials, labor unions, and workers' advocacy groups urged the U.S. FTC to ban non-compete clauses. A petition to the FTC, seeking a ban on noncompete clauses, was submitted by the AFL-CIO, SEIU, and Public Citizen. In July 2021, President Joe Biden signed Executive Order 14036, directing the FTC (whose chair, Lina Khan, he had recently appointed), as well as other federal agencies, to \"curtail the unfair use of non-compete clauses and other clauses or agreements that may unfairly limit worker mobility\". On January 5, 2023, the FTC proposed a rule banning non-compete agreements.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has lobbied against bans on non-compete agreements; in 2023, it threatened to sue the FTC if it bans non-compete agreements. The Chamber argued that \"noncompete agreements are an important tool in fostering innovation and preserving competition\".\nFederal Trade Commission\nOn April 23, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a ban on nearly all non-compete agreements. The rule was published on the Federal Register on May 7 and the ban will go into effect on September 4, 2024.\nThe FTC found as shown the use of non-compete clauses by employers has negatively affected competition in labor markets, resulting in reduced wages for workers across the labor force\u2014including workers not bound by non-compete clauses and that by suppressing labor mobility, non-compete clauses have negatively affected competition in product and service markets in several ways. The commission noted that the existing legal frameworks governing non-compete clauses\u2014formed decades ago, without the benefit of this evidence\u2014allow serious anticompetitive harm to labor, product, and service markets to go unchecked. The Commission noted \"that instead of using noncompetes to lock in workers, employers that wish to retain employees can compete on the merits for the worker's labor services by improving wages and working conditions.\" In 2024, approximately one in five American workers, or about 30 million people, are subject to noncompetes.\nLaws by state\nCalifornia\nNon-compete agreements are automatically void as a matter of law in California, except for a small set of specific situations expressly authorized by statute. They were outlawed by the original California Civil Code in 1872 (Civ. Code, former \u00a7 1673).\nEnforcement of out-of-state agreements\nA leading court decision discussing the conflict between California law and the laws of other states is the 1998 California 4th District Court of Appeal decision Application Group, Inc. v. Hunter Group, Inc. In Hunter, a Maryland company required that its Maryland-based employee agree to a one-year non-compete agreement. The contract stated that it was governed by and to be construed according to Maryland law. A Maryland employee then left to work for a competitor in California. When the new California employer sued in California state court to invalidate the covenant not to compete, the California court agreed and ruled that the non-compete provision was invalid and not enforceable in California. Business and Professions Code Section 16600 reflects a \"strong public policy of the State of California\" and the state has a strong interest in applying its law and protecting its businesses so that they can hire the employees of their choosing. California law is thus applicable to non-California employees seeking employment in California.\nWhether California courts are required by the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution to enforce equitable judgments from courts of other states, having personal jurisdiction over the defendant, that enjoin competition or are contrary to important public interests in California is an issue that has not yet been decided.\nExceptions\nThere are limited situations where a reasonable non-compete agreement may be valid in California.\nWhere the owner of a business is selling the entire business, or is selling the goodwill in the business, the seller may be bound by a non-compete clause.\nWhen there is a dissolution or disassociation of a partner",

    "2024 video game\nAnthology of the Killer is a series of comedy-horror video games developed by Irish independent developer Stephen Gillmurphy under the pseudonym \"garmentdistrict\". The games were released for free on Game Jolt between 4 December 2020 and 5 March 2024; a paid compilation, including all nine games and bonus content, was released on Game Jolt and itch.io on 28 May 2024.\nGameplay\nScreenshot of gameplay in Drool of the Killer. Dialogue, either from BB or other characters, is a near-continuous presence throughout the games\nThe games are primarily walking simulators; the player moves main character BB around environments and reads her thoughts on the current events. Interspersed are chase sequences where the player must escape from pursuing killers, though there is no penalty for failure.\nPlot\nThe games follow BB, a college student living in an apartment in XX City with her older sister ZZ, as she investigates various strange events for her zine. XX City has an extremely high murder rate, and foremost among its many serial murderers is a supernatural bird-headed figure known only as \"the Killer\".\nVoice Of The Killer\nBB gets a job as a cold caller at the insurance company Life Contracts, where she notices several strange occurrences, such as all the employees being covered in sheets, a heavy police presence, and a welcoming party for the Killer. That night, BB has a surreal dream and wakes up to a message on her phone telling her the Life Contracts office has burnt down.\nHands Of The Killer\nZZ sends BB to explore the depths of their apartment building to find things to sell online. While doing so, BB stumbles into a night college devoted to creating a new world via murder, led by the elderly Professor Zoo. Though the faculty and students consider real murder kitsch, they mistake BB for a \"My First Strangle Victim\" doll. While escaping, BB accidentally disables the college's security system, allowing the Killer to enter and murder everyone as BB escapes.\nDrool Of The Killer\nBB investigates a mysterious bus service that takes her to a swimming centre known as Tammy. BB discovers that Tammy is actually the ghost of a schoolgirl who was drowned by the Killer, who since her death has been transforming buildings into water parks to fulfil her vision of the new economy. Outraged that Tammy's water is unchlorinated, BB apparently kills Tammy by knocking over a bottle of chlorine onto her.\nEyes Of The Killer\nBB is conscripted into the city's immersive theater production of \"Melmo the Wanderer\", where she plays \"Potsy the Mop Girl\", a character who has one line before being killed. Annoyed by her inability to discover more about the plot, as the stage manager believes the actors should know no more than their characters, BB abandons her role and explores backstage to try and find out the identity of her character's murderer. Following a man in a bear costume, BB falls through a trapdoor and discovers the police, dressed in bear costumes, dismembering the corpses of audience members. Escaping, BB tries to inform the theater's director, Bosso, about this, but discovers she is a member of the same cult that the night college belonged to. Bosso explains that BB did the cult a favour by allowing the college to be wiped out, as the college had diluted the cult's message and the CCTV footage of the massacre made money for the cult when they released it as direct-to-video horror film Bloody Night IV. Bosso reveals that the wealthy owners of the city fund the immersive theater and the murder of its audience to satisfy their desire for bloodshed. After a climatic scene in the play, where a character resembling the Killer murders characters representing the Sun and Moon, BB is dismissed from the theater with a twenty-dollar paycheck.\nFlesh Of The Killer\nBB and three fellow college students (Max, Claude, and Ray) investigate the Museum of Moral Art, a secret museum built in a freeport. The museum prominently features the works of M.T. Lott, who revitalised the genre of moral art before being arrested for cannibalism. Venturing deeper into the museum, they discover that M.T. Lott, believing morality too important to leave to humans, created a robot called the Morality Animal. However, incapable of understanding morality outside of its depiction in art, the robot went berserk and now attempts to trap all life within paintings. After the robot traps them in a painting together, the group distracts the robot with a morality-themed play before attacking and destroying it.\nBlood Of The Killer\nBB is sent to investigate why a zine distro established in the nearby River Town stopped sending messages. River Town brands itself \"the home of the drinky bird\", as there used to be a major drinky bird factory in the town before it burnt down. BB travels to the home of her contact, Clarice, only to find it burnt to the ground. BB then encounters XX city serial killer Murderer X, who mistaking BB for a fellow murderer tells her to check o",
    "South African politician\nNonceba Bianca Mhlauli (born 3 June 1990) is a South African politician and communications strategist. She is currently serving as Deputy Minister in the Presidency since June 2024. A member of the African National Congress (ANC), she was elected to her first term in the National Assembly in the May 2024 general election. She rose to political prominence as the interim leader of the ANC Youth League between April 2021 and March 2023.\nBorn in Upington, Northern Cape, Mhlauli was a student activist at Rhodes University, where she joined the national leadership of the South African Students Congress. Before entering frontline politics, she served as spokesperson to Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu and as spokesperson of the ANC's parliamentary caucus. She was elected to a five-year term on the ANC National Executive Committee in December 2022.\nEarly life and education\nBorn on 3 June 1990, Mhlauli is from the small town of Upington in the Cape Province (now the Northern Cape). Her home language is Xhosa. Her family were supporters of the African National Congress (ANC), and her grandfather and uncle had been members of Umkhonto we Sizwe during apartheid. Influenced by family members, Mhlauli joined the Congress of South African Students and ANC Youth League as a 15-year-old high school student.\nAfter matriculating in 2007, she moved to Grahamstown to study journalism and political studies at Rhodes University. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 2011 and Honours in 2012. Though she entered the workforce thereafter, she continued her postgraduate studies at Rhodes and in 2016 completed a Master of Arts in social policy and African language studies. Her thesis was about the effect of language on access to public healthcare in South Africa, with particular focus on primary healthcare in Grahamstown and Cofimvaba.\nWhile a student at Rhodes, Mhlauli became increasingly involved in youth politics through the South African Students Congress (SASCO). She joined SASCO during her first year at the university, and as a postgraduate student she was a member of its national executive committee between 2011 and 2015. She also served as national communications coordinator for SASCO from 2013 to 2015. At the same time, she was among a group of students who launched the ANC Youth League's branch at Rhodes.\nCareer as ANC staffer\nIn 2013, after graduating with her Honours degree, Mhlauli moved to Cape Town to work as a junior policy researcher for the Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union (SACTWU), an affiliate of the Congress of South African Trade Unions. She worked at SACTWU until 2014, when she took up a position in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament as a researcher for the ANC caucus. In 2016, she was transferred to the ANC's parliamentary caucus in the National Assembly, the lower house of the South African Parliament. Working closely with the office of the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, she entered as a media liaison officer and was promoted to spokesperson and head of communications for the caucus in 2017.\nAfter the May 2019 general election, the outgoing Chief Whip, Jackson Mthembu, was appointed to the cabinet as Minister in the Presidency. Mhlauli followed him to the Union Buildings, becoming his spokesperson. In that role she pioneered the virtual press conferences held by the Presidency and national executive during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nANC Youth League convenor: 2021\u20132023\nOn 8 April 2021, Mhlauli was appointed as national convenor of the National Youth Task Team (NYTT), a 35-member interim leadership corps which was mandated to lead the ANC Youth League until the league could hold new leadership elections. She worked alongside Joy Maimela, who was appointed as coordinator of the NYTT. Mhlauli and Maimela's NYTT replaced a former task team, led by Tandi Mahambehlala as convenor and Sibongile Besani as coordinator, which had been appointed after Collen Maine's leadership corps was disbanded in 2019; Mahambehlala and Besani had been trying unsuccessfully since then to hold an elective conference. In subsequent weeks Mhlauli argued that the ANC Youth League was in disarray because of \"extreme factionalism and that sort of cultish leadership where if you disagree, you get disbanded\", a phenomenon that she said had been intensified by ANC leaders' habit of using the league \"as a pocket knife in the factional battles of the mother body\".\n55th National Conference\nMhlauli was ANC Youth League coordinator during the run-up to the ANC's 55th National Conference in December 2022, which involved a leadership contest between President Cyril Ramaphosa, the incumbent, and his rival Zweli Mkhize. Mhlauli was viewed as among Ramaphosa's staunchest supporters, described variously as the leader of \"the Ramaphosa faction\" in the NYTT and as \"among the key campaigners\" for Ramaphosa's re-election.\nHowever, in November 2022, Mhaluli's NYTT overruled her, deciding to endorse M",
    "2023 comedic tabletop role-playing games\nIf I Were a Lich, Man is a boxed set of three comedic, Jewish tabletop role-playing games about creative resistance against authoritarianism. The games were written by Lucian Kahn and illustrated by Ezra Rose. The box contains three games: \"If I Were a Lich, Man,\" \"Same Bat Time, Same Bat Mitzvah,\" and \"Grandma's Drinking Song.\" It was published by Hit Point Press in 2023 after the publisher's kickstarter campaign raised $84,590 in two weeks.\nGames\n\"If I Were a Lich, Man\" is an anti-fascist four-player game about a family meeting of Jewish liches arguing about how to defend themselves against killer paladins. It uses dreidels instead of dice. \"Same Bat Time, Same Bat Mitzvah\" is a LARP for 7 to 13 players. It is about a Bat Mitzvah party where the attendees are turning into vampires. \"Grandma's Drinking Song\" is another four-player game. The players write a drinking song together while performing short scenes based on Kahn's ancestors' true stories about working as bootleggers during Prohibition in New York City.\nThemes\nThe games reappropriate antisemitic tropes to rethink fantasy monsters and criminals as \"figures of resistance.\" Kahn explained the thinking behind this in an interview with Lindsay Eanet for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency:\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long tradition of looking at the monster and seeing that the reason why these are monsters is because the people who have oppressive power have decided that these are going to be the enemies of the \u2018good\u2019 oppressive powers...But if you don\u2019t agree with their ideology, if you\u2019re seeing yourself as being a member of a marginalized community and being in opposition to these oppressive powers, then you can look at the qualities assigned to these monsters and some of them are qualities that are good.\u201d\nReception\nIf I Were a Lich, Man was nominated for the 2024 ENNIE Awards for Best Family Game / Product. The dreidels were nominated for the 2023 Origins Awards for Best Dice-Related Product. The prototype for the title game \"If I Were a Lich, Man\" won the Indie Game Developer Network award for \"Most Innovative\" in 2020.\n",

In 1884 she gained admission to Grant Medical College, Mumbai, from where she graduated. After gaining her Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (LRCP) she was appointed to head the Victoria Jubilee Hospital for women in Ahmedabad. In 1891, she qualified FRCS.\nIn 1911 Kapadia received the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in the 1911 Delhi Durbar Honours following the Coronation of George V and Mary.\nEarly life and education\nOld Grant Medical College building, 1860.\nMotibai Kapadia was born in 1867 in Mumbai, then Bombay, into a wealthy Parsi family. In 1884, with permission from her father and despite opposition from others she knew, Kapadia gained admission to Mumbai's Grant Medical College through the Dufferin Fund. She travelled to England and received the LRCP in 1888, along with Rattonbai Malabari. She has been credited with being the first Indian female physician in Western medicine to have trained alongside men in India, and Grant's first Indian female graduate.\nCareer\nDr Motibai Rustomji Kapadia Public Hall for Women (21 February 1928)\nIn 1889, after returning from Britain, the indiastrialist Ranchhodlal Chhotalal appointed Kapadia in charge of his newly established Victoria Jubilee Hospital and its dispensary in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, then in Bombay Presidency. There, she was a well known lady doctor, who accomplished good work, and remained in that post for 36 years. In 1891, she qualified FRCS. In Ahmedabad, she lived in a street somewhere bewtween Kalupur and Khadia. In 1897, she was chosen to represent the Ladies Club at Ahmedabad to deliver the draft English address in preparation for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.\nLater life\nKapadia later travelled back to Britain, after which she returned to India on the SS Devanha in 1921. According to Canadian educator Geraldine Forbes, Western medicine expanded in Bengal as a result of hospital assistants who trained in that field by physicians from Bombay that included Kapadia.\nAwards\nOn 12 December 1911 Kapadia received the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in the 1911 Delhi Durbar Honours following the Coronation of George V and Mary.\nDeath and legacy\nKapdia died in 1930. Historian Makrand Mehta credits Kapadia as a significant influencer of Gujarat. Author Kavitha Rao considered Kapadia notable enough to include her in her book Lady Doctors, though omitted her due to being unable to find enough archival material on her.\nNotes\n^ 62 women were admitted to Grant in the six years preceding 1892.\n",
    "Japanese weather forecasting company\nWeathernews Inc. is a Japanese weather forecasting company, whose headquarters and global center are located in Mihama Ward, Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture.\nHistory\nHiroyoshi Ishibashi, who served as the representative director and president of the Japanese subsidiary of Ocean Roots (ORCJ), a marine meteorological research company headquartered in the United States, expanded the company's land and aviation divisions to 180 million yen with the cooperation of financial institutions. Established in 1986 using a management buy-out method, which was extremely rare at the time, to purchase the company for 10,000 yen (the number of employees at the time of establishment was approximately 40).\nThe background for its establishment was a maritime accident in January 1970 when a cargo ship sank due to a bomb cyclone that hit Onahama Port, killing 15 people. Because it was difficult to predict weather conditions and there was no weather information available for sailors, Ishibashi took this accident as an opportunity to improve weather information, saying, \"If there was really useful weather information, this accident could have been prevented\".\nIn addition to being a pioneer in the private comprehensive weather forecasting service in Japan, in 1993 it merged with its parent company, Ocean Roots, and became the world's largest private weather information company and multinational company.\nWeathernews was founded in 1986, but including its predecessor ORCJ and its predecessor Pacific Weather Analysis Corporation (PWAC, founded in 1953), the total It has a history of 70 years (as of 2023). PWAC is a company that provides weather route information to ships sailing in the Pacific Ocean, and is the world's first private weather information company.\nIn April 1983 it started providing weather information to Asahi Broadcasting (currently Asahi Broadcasting Group Holdings) becoming the first weather service provider other than the Japan Weather Association to provide weather forecasts to a broadcasting station. This included providing cloud images for television from Japan's first meteorological satellite Himawari. In October 1991 it provided the world's first weather forecast using entirely 3D CGI graphics to \"News Station\" (TV Asahi). In 1993 it produced a program for TV Tokyo, Weather Paradise. A dedicated weather channel produced by Weathernews started on PerfecTV! in October 1996.\n",

About 500 objects were renamed, including 100 settlements. The renaming occurred as a result of the armed conflict with China over Damansky Island in 1969. Many (but not all) place names that were replaced were of Chinese origin.\nHistory\nUntil 1972, in the Primorsky Krai, the names of many geographical objects were of Chinese (due to the neighborhood with China) or Tungus-Manchu (native) origin. To a lesser extent, such toponyms were found in the Khabarovsk Krai and the Amur Oblast.\nThe current territory of the region, before the Beijing Treaty of 1860 (before joining the Russian Empire), was considered a vassal territory of the Manchu people, who in the middle of the 17th century conquered China (along with Mongolia) and placed the Manchu-led Qing dynasty on the imperial throne.\nThe Russian settlers who founded Russian military posts and the first estates lived for several decades on the territory of modern Primorsky Krai (South Ussuri) region together with the peoples of the Manchu-Tungus group: Orochs, Udege, Nanai, a small number of Manchus and descendants of other peoples who were previously part of Jurchen and Manchu statehood by the indigenous population.\nIn the territory annexed to Russia by Count Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky in 1860, a number of Chinese lived (see Manzy), mostly otkhodniks, since the permanent residence of the Chinese in the Manchu lands was limited, and at times outright prohibited, by the Manchu authorities of the Qing dynasty. On the territory of what is now Primorsky Krai, ethnic Chinese were engaged in agriculture, hunting, fishing, robbery, mining (primarily gold), collecting wild plants (Ginseng), and trading.\nBy the time the first Russian sea posts of Posyet, Vladivostok, and Slavyanka appeared in the southern part of the South Ussuri region, native names of the Tungus-Manchu language series (Adimi, Sidimi, Hadimi, Talmi, Tuluchekoritsig) and Chinese (Suifun-he, Yanchi-he) coexisted.\nRussian names appeared mainly around islands, capes and bays (Russky Island, Slavic Bay), since Russian colonization was initially clearly naval.\nNative names were subsequently used by Russian settlers and remained until 1972.\nRenaming campaign\nIn 1972\u20131974, as a result of the armed conflict with China over Damansky Island (1969), in the Primorsky Krai and, to a lesser extent, in neighboring regions, a massive renaming of geographical objects and settlements was carried out in order to get rid of toponyms of Chinese origin.\nAt the same time, not only Chinese names were replaced (Suifun-he was renamed to the Razdolnaya River, Yanchi-he - to the Tsukanovka River), but also Tunguska names (Adimi - renamed to the Poima River, Sidimi - to the Narva River, Tulamu Bay - to Slavyanka Bay).\nNon-indigenous place names also suffered: for example, America Bay and Manchzhur Bay were renamed Nakhodka Bay and Cormorant Bay, respectively. These objects were originally named after the Russian sea vessels that carried out exploration of the coast of the Far East in the 19th century: the corvette America and the transport Manjur. Obviously, any toponym whose sound showed unfavorable political connotations for that period was considered unreliable, regardless of the origin of this toponym.\nAs a result of the renaming, the Primorsky Krai has largely lost its toponymic identity. Most of the new names are not associated with the region historically, ethnographically or geographically - for example, the Ilistaya River (formerly Lefou), the Tikhaya River (formerly Telyanza), Mount Obzornaya (formerly Khalaza), Lazurnaya Bay (formerly Feldhausen or Shamora), - or they duplicate the Russian-language names of nearby objects - for example, the Arsenyevka River (formerly Daubikhe), the Razdolnaya River (formerly Suifun), Mount Livadiyskaya (formerly Pidan).\nAmong the small number of indigenous place names that have been preserved are the names of the Ussuri, Sungacha and Bikin rivers and Lake Khanka.\n",
    "2016 Canadian drama film\nMissing Victor Pellerin (French: Rechercher Victor Pellerin) is a Canadian mockumentary film directed by Sophie Deraspe and released in 2016. The film centres on the mystery of Victor Pellerin, a visual artist from Montreal who burned all of his art and disappeared in 1990, on the occasion of a 2005 gallery show exhibiting artwork by other figures who had been influenced by him.\nThe cast consists principally of real figures in Montreal's arts scene playing fictionalized versions of themselves, including Eudore Belzile, \u00c9lisabeth Legrand, Anne Lebeau, \u00c9ric Devlin, Olga Korper, Julien Poulin, Alain Lacoursi\u00e8re, Mathieu Beaus\u00e9jour, Sheila Ribeiro, Sylvain Bouthillette, Maria-Luisa Fernandes, Plastik Patrick and Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Messier.\nThe film premiered at the 2006 Festival du nouveau cin\u00e9ma, where it received a special mention from the Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des critiques de cin\u00e9ma.\nCritical response\nGeoff Pevere of the Toronto Star wrote that \"Slowly, slyly, Missing Victor Pellerin metamorphoses from a verite-style mystery about a missing artist to a satirical meditation on the nature of fraudulence itself. Ultimately, nothing is offered as what it seems, a suitably foggy philosophical state for a missing person mystery set in the over-inflated, scam-ridden art market of the 1980s. You may find yourself on to Missing Victor Pellerin's own game long before it's over, but that shouldn't prevent you from enjoying the either the skill with which its played or appreciate the legitimacy of the con itself.\"\nFor The Globe and Mail, Rick Groen wrote that \"they're acting quite well, so convincingly that the line between the real and the fake is hard to draw, and growing even harder with our dawning realization that, when it comes to discussing Victor Pellerin -- his charisma, his manipulative nature, his checkered past, his larcenous tendencies -- even the real folks are acting. Brilliantly, then, Deraspe plugs into three traits in the viewing audience: (1) our gullibility, born of our uncertainty about who's who in this incestuous but reputedly important enclave; (2) our unwillingness to admit to that naivet\u00e9, to what we don't know; and (3) our instinctive responsiveness to cozy stereotypes (the tortured artist) and to easy conventions (the standard-issue doc about the tortured artist).\"\n",
    "Italian automotive and industrial designer\nPio Manz\u00f9 (officially Pio Manzoni), born 2 March 1939 in Bergamo, Italy, deceased 26 May 1969 in Brandizzo, Italy, was an Italian designer of cars and home furnishings. One of his best known designs is that of the Fiat 127.\nEducation\nA son of sculptor Giacomo Manz\u00f9 and his first wife Antonia Oreni, Pio Manz\u00f9 studied at the  School of Design in Ulm, Germany, with the objective to specialise in industrial design, under the guidance of  Argentine designer and philosopher Tom\u00e1s Maldonado. After his graduation in 1964 as the first Italian at this institution, he continued as a teaching assistant at the Ulm school. In 1962 he entered an international competition of the Swiss magazine Ann\u00e9e Automobile, which he won with a design for an Austin Healey 3000. The prize was that the design would be executed by Carrozzeria Pininfarina, who displayed it at motorshows in Turin and London.\nWork\nAutonova\nAutonova Fam, designed by Busch, Conrad and Manz\u00f9\nManz\u00f9 realised a number of projects for interior decoration and started collaborating with several international publications, writing articles and making designs in the automotive field. \nIn 1965, together with automotive writer Fritz Bob Busch and fellow-Ulm-graduate Michael Conrad, Manz\u00f9 set up the project group Autonova, that came with prototypes Autonova GT and Van Autonova Fam. The latter immediately caught the attention of engineer Dante Giacosa, head of the Fiat development department and styling center. But also the management of companies like NSU, Glas, Pirelli, Recaro, VDO and BASF had an eye on these concept cars.\nFurniture and more\nOther designs that carry the signature of the designer from Lombardy were in the field of home accessories. An example is the table clock Cronotime, that resembles the exhaust pipes or cooling water hoses of a car engine, and which was originally made as a giveaway for Fiat customer relations. It then became a Ritz-Italora product that was available in La Rinascente department store and has been included in the MoMA collection. Later it was added to the Alessi catalog, in which it currently still is. Other product designs were writing and desktop materials for Kartell. \nFlos Parentesi lamp by Pio Manz\u00f9 and Achille Castiglioni\nAlso, Manz\u00f9 designed an automobile inspired lounge chair and a one-legged table for Alias. The lamp Parentesi (brand FLOS, over 800,000 sold) was developed by Achille Castiglioni in 1971, based on a sketch made earlier by Manz\u00f9; the lamp is in the MoMA collection as well and was awarded the Compasso d'Oro in 1979.\nManz\u00f9 also worked as a consultant for Piaggio and Olivetti.\nThe collaboration with these companies, together with the support of the Turin coachbuilders Sibona & Basano, lead to the realisation of prototypes Glas 1004 Autonova Fam, on the basis of the Glas 1004, and NSU Prinz Autonova GT, based on the NSU Prinz and NSU Ro 80.\nIn 1969, Manz\u00f9 was the only non-French jury member for the selection of the Bolide Design exhibition organised by the  Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris.\nFiat projects\nFiat City Taxi concept car\nAt Fiat Styling Center,  Dante Giacosa at first was hesitant about the newly hired consultant Manz\u00f9's ability to fit in with the strict procedures of industrialisation of a product design. In 1968, the first experience, however, lead to the execution of a concept car for the use as taxi, on the mechanical basis of the Fiat 850 and with cutting-edge technical and styling solutions that Manz\u00f9 had already developed at Autonova. The result, the Fiat City Taxi, was sort of a monospace avant-la-lettre and, however it did not go into production, stylistically formed the basis of what a few years later would become the successor to the Fiat 500, the 126.\nAnother project in 1968 was the Autobianchi sports coup\u00e9 G.31, which had already been started by OSI a few years before. Manz\u00f9 had to bring it back to life, and did so very much to the satisfaction of Giacosa as well as the public, because the response during its display at the Turin Auto Show was very positive. Nevertheless, it was decided that the car would not see production.\n Fiat 127 of 1971\nManz\u00f9's work convinced Giacosa to entrust him, in the same year, with the styling of the Fiat 127, a new car that was to become a revolutionary concept for the people's car and a reference for the global car production in the 1970s. Almost 8 million would be built in two decades.\nDeath\nPio Manz\u00f9 never saw the result of his French museum judging job or his important project at the Fiat Styling Center. In fact, he was on his way to the presentation of the final Fiat 127 mock-up to the top management, in May 1969, when he had a one-sided car accident on the A4 autostrada Milan-Turin, near the toll booths of the Brandizzo exit, just 10 km before reaching Turin. Having come home late the night before, and having left early to get to the 8.00 a.m. presentation in time, Manz\u00f9 had chosen to drive his wife's Fiat 500 ins",

    "Novel by Laline Paull\nThe Bees was the debut novel of Laline Paull, nominated for the 2015 Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction.\nSummary\nForm and setting\nThe novel opens and closes with a brief frame narrative describing the human owners of an orchard on the edge of a town, in which lies the beehive of an elderly beekeeper. Otherwise, The Bees is set within the world of this hive of honeybees. It is a third-person narrative, told from the point of view of one worker bee, Flora 717.\nThe world of the hive is portrayed in ways which blend human ways of apprehending the world with bees'. For example, the world of the hive, most of whose inhabitants are biological sisters, is conceptualised in ways that evoke a medieval Christian nunnery, with the queen bee thought of as a divine mother-figure evoking the Virgin Mary in Roman Catholicism; the small number of male drones are conceptualised as rumbunctious, ruff-wearing knights; rooms include nurseries and the Chapel of Wax; the hum of the bees in the hive is conceptualised as the Holy Chord. The bees frequently apprehend the world through scent, which the novel often describes in concrete terms (for example, \"Sister Sage curled a filament of her own scent around Flora's antennae\", pp.\u00a030\u201331).\nHive society is divided into different kin groups with specific roles, named after flowers. For example, the Sage are priestesses, the Thistle are guardians, and the Teasel are nurses. Those bees who have individual personal names are also named after flowers. The kin at the bottom of the hive's social hierarchy, too despised to be named after a specific flower, are the Flora, who are viewed as ugly, smelly, unable to talk, and serve as sanitation workers, clearing the hive of debris and corpses. Bees from diverse kin may become foragers, flying away from the hive to gather food. A further social role is being a member of the \"fertility police\", who kill infirm or deviant bees.\nA regular feature of the bees' day is \"Devotion\", when the Queen's scent permeates the hive, the bees hum the Holy Chord, and the sisters of the hive experience a sense of union with one another and with their Holy Mother the Queen.\nPlot\nThe story begins with the emergence from pupation of the protagonist, Flora 717, who faces prejudice and abuse throughout the story on account of her despised status. She is, moreover, larger and darker than most Flora, and born able to speak. For these reasons, the fertility police plan to kill her, but a cold and rainy summer has left the hive short-handed, and the priestess Sister Sage intervenes to save the talented heroine. Sister Sage setting Flora 717 to work in the nursery, feeding royal jelly (referred to by the bees as \"flow\") to the larvae. There Flora witnesses the fertility police destroying eggs laid by any bee other than the Queen, and any bee suspected of laying those eggs. Refusing to co-operate with the fertility police, Flora is threatened with execution but again saved by Sister Sage, who sends her to work in Sanitation. In this role, Flora encounters various areas of the hive (such as the Fanning Hall, where nectar is reduced into honey) and sections of hive society (such as the drones, who are entitled, demanding, adored by the sisters, and given to sexual harassment; Flora narrowly avoids being raped). Flora's work as a corpse-bearer takes her out of the hive for the first time.\nFlora takes a central role in killing an attacking wasp and is rewarded with an audience with the Queen. The Queen's ladies in waiting take Flora to the Holy Library, a hexagonal chamber the scents of whose walls contain six key chapters in the collective memory of the hive. Flora gets to read its scent panels, learning of predators outside the hive, \"the Kindness\" (the practice of killing infirm, deviant, or elderly bees), what the reader recognises as the robbery of honey by humans, and other phenomena which she struggles to comprehend. Flora learns that the Queen is not in good health, before being chased away by the ladies in waiting.\nHurt by her separation from the Queen and finding herself unable to participate in Devotion, Flora aspires to become a forager. Before she does, disaster strikes the foragers when they collect pollen from a field of rape that has been doused with pesticide, bringing illness and polluted food into the hive. The venerable forager Lily 500, who had signalled this food source to other foragers before the pesticide was sprayed, is unfairly killed by the fertility police, but before her death she is able to transmit her store of foraging data to Flora.\nAt this point, the story begins to alternate between two aspects of Flora's life. To her own surprise, Flora lays an egg, experiencing maternal affection despite knowing that it is forbidden; this is followed later in the book by a second and then a third egg. One thread of the narrative therefore concerns Flora's efforts to bring an offspring to pupation. Flora tries to enable the birth of her fi",
    "Short-lived Cuban professional baseball league\nNot to be confused with Baseball Federation of Cuba.\nThe Cuban Federation League (Spanish: Liga de la Federaci\u00f3n) was a winter league circuit in the mid-1940s that briefly challenged the Cuban League's status as the top professional baseball league in Cuba. Founded in 1946, its fleeting existence was notable as a flashpoint in the conflict between \"organized\" Major League Baseball and the \"outlaw\" Mexican League; this conflict directly led to the demise of the original Federation League after only one season, after which it was reformed into the Liga Nacional (\"National League\"). Both incarnations of the league played most of their games at the Estadio La Tropical in Havana. \nHistory\nEstablishment\nThough the Cuban League had been in operation since 1878, the Federation League was established in 1946 by the Cuban Sports Federation (the Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Deportes y Educaci\u00f3n Fisica) under Luis Orlando Rodriguez. The new league was bankrolled by Julio Blanco Herrera, the owner of the Estadio La Tropical; his stadium had hosted Cuban League games for over a decade, until the more-established circuit left for the more modern Estadio El Cerro (or Gran Stadium) across town.\nThe league was unique in that it played its games across the country, unlike the Cuban League, which at the time played exclusively in Havana. The Matanzas club (not to be confused with the the earlier Cuban League side of the same name) played at the historic Palmar de Junco stadium.\nDon Newcombe played with the Federation League's Havana Reds in 1946\nStarting in 1946, Major League Baseball commissioner Happy Chandler banned players from the upstart Mexican League from participating in \"organized baseball\" (i.e. MLB or its affiliated minor leagues), accusing them of breaking contracts with major league clubs. In its first season, the Federation League was largely composed of players under contract to MLB organizations, who did not want to risk suspension by playing alongside ballplayers in the Cuban League who had already been suspended for playing in Mexico. Federation League players in 1946 included Fermin Guerra and Gilberto Torres, both of the Washington Senators, among others. The league also included prominent players from Cuba's amateur circuits, including Conrado Marrero of Oriente.\nThe Federation League struggled to challenge the supremacy of the Cuban League, which, aside from the high-profile defections of Ray Dandridge and Booker McDaniel, managed to retain most of the island's top talent. It also became clear that the Cuban Sports Federation lacked funding, as well as the power to enforce its own contracts. The federation was dealt another blow when the Cuban League announced a pact with MLB, ending the threat of suspension for its players.\nLiga Nacional\nDespite the agreement, players from the Cuban League that had been in Mexico were still ineligible to play in organized baseball. As of December 1946, at least 20 Cuban players were banned. This included major figures of Cuban baseball, including Agapito Mayor, Tomas de la Cruz, and Almendares manager Adolfo Luque.\nThese players organized a players' association, the Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Peloteros Profesionales de Cuba, and a new circuit to rival the Cuban League for the 1947\u201348 season. The successor to the original, government-sponsored Federation League, the new circuit was officially known as the \"Liga Nacional,\" though it has also been referred to as the \"Players' Federation League.\" The Liga Nacional, filled with players that were blacklisted from organized baseball, was the opposite of the Federation League, which had been made up of players that feared the blacklist.\nIt was an ironic reversal. The year before, the Liga de la Federacion was the refuge for Cuban major leaguers  who did not want to risk their jobs playing in the Cuban League. But now its successor was conceived to give refuge to the \"outlaws\" from Organized Baseball, who were the stars of the game in Cuba.\u2014\u200aRoberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda\nAside from the blacklisted Cubans, the Liga Nacional included many foreign \"jumpers\" who had been banned by MLB, including Danny Gardella, Napoleon Reyes, and Luis Olmo. Despite a surge in popularity, the league was unable to compete financially with the older Cuban League, even with support from the Cuban Sports Federation, and the Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional was beset by accusations of mismanagement.\nThe Liga Nacional was resurrected once more in 1950 as a short-lived minor league feeder circuit for the Cuban League (which, at this point, was itself a minor league for MLB) made up exclusively of Cuban players.\nTeams\nBoth the Federation League of 1946 and the Liga Nacional of 1947 appropriated, with only slight differences, the emblems and colors of teams in the Cuban League, including Habana (the \"Reds\"/\"Leones\") and Almendares (\"Oriente\"/\"Alacranes\").\n1946\u201347\n1947\u201348\nSee also\nCuba portal\nList of Cuban baseball champions\nNotes\n^ Also",
    "2019 concert residency by Ledisi\nLedisi: The Legend of Little Girl Blue was the first concert residency by American singer Ledisi. It was held for three consecutive nights in December 2019. The residency was held at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, California. Ledisi performed a set list consisting of her songs as well as songs written or performed by Nina Simone, backed by her own band to an audience of 500. The concept of the shows revolves around impact Ledisi's mother Nyra Young and American singer Nina Simone had on Ledisi's life and career. The show also featured a tribute to other influential figures, including Philandro Castile, Marilyn Monroe, Julia Roberts, and Michael Jackson.\nLedisi: The Legend of Little Girl Blue received mixed responses from music critics who praised Ledisi's vocals but also criticized the show for its \"lack of narrative\". A concert special, Ledisi Live: A Tribute to Nina Simone, aired on PBS on November 28, 2020, featuring the performance recorded in 2019. The show sold out nineteen performances. The success of Ledisi: The Legend of Little Girl Blue has led Wallis Annenberg Center to ask Ledisi to return for another future production and in March 2024, the venue became the opening date of her The Good Life Tour.\nBackground\nThe concerts were held in Beverly Hills' Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts to a sold-out audience.\nOn August 15, 2019, Ledisi's announced that she would be performing a residency show at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, California from December 13 to December 22, 2019. Tickets for the shows were available on August 15 on The Wallis. When the tickets went on sale to the general public on August 15, 2019, for the residency's first week, the dates sold out. As a result, eight additional performances were added to the residency due to the original dates being sold out months in advance. The residency eventually extended to December 29 and played to nineteen sold-out shows.\nIn an online interview with BroadwayWorld, Ledisi spoke in depth about the upcoming shows and impact of Nina Simone stating \"Nina Simone's legacy lifted me and reminded me to be proud of my skin and embrace the walk I was given. Her music lets me know I am not alone in my journey.\" In a separate interview, she further stated \"The way she expressed the words like a conversation is a master class in storytelling. Her phrasing cuts through even when it's soft and the notes were an afterthought. The feeling always won me.\" The Wallis' Artistic Director Paul Crewes stated he \"appreciated the opportunity to work with Ledisi, who brings her exceptional artistry to our stage.\"\nDevelopment\nI met Billy Porter while I was an understudy on Broadway for Caroline, or Change and workshopping The Color Purple. Billy and I became friends while singing with the Broadway Inspirational Voices. I have always been a fan of how he blended different genres of music in his shows. So, together we bonded over music. He was directing Once on This Island in Los Angeles and asked me to play Asaka. That is where I met producer Suzi Dietz. When I decided to do this show in a semi-theatrical way, my first call was asking Billy to be involved, and Suzi showed up right behind him. I am so grateful they are here guiding my team and I through this.\n\u2014Ledisi BroadwayWorld interview\nLedisi: The Legend of Little Girl Blue was written by Ledisi and Daniel Beaty. It was directed by Gregg Field and produced by Billy Porter and Suzi Dietz. Kim Burse served as the music supervisor and Brandon Waddles as the musical director. The concept of the shows revolves around Ledisi's life and the connections she has with her mother Nyra Dynese Young as well as Nina Simone. Ledisi orchestrated a tribute concert tour to Simone titled Nina and Me Tour in mid-2019 and included some of the same songs that Simone wrote or recorded into the residency show. Ledisi also included her own original songs in the show.\nConcert synopsis\nThe show begins with Ledisi coming onstage dressed as Nina Simone in a high headdress and African robe. Her band plays the lead-in to the blues song \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\". In character as Simone, Ledisi comments that the band is playing too loudly and that they might as well continue on playing. She eventually performs the song. After performing several of Simone's songs, Ledisi performs Simone's cover version of \"Trouble in Mind\" while detailing how Simone's version of the song helped Ledisi overcome suicidal depression.\nFollowing a costume change, Ledisi portrays her mother Nyra, exclaiming to the audience \"Nina Simone was one of my greatest sheros, making it possible for singers like me to believe our dreams could come true. But my first shero was my mother\". She then launches into a story about witnessing her mother's beating.\nLedisi eventually portrays herself in the remainder of the show. She performs her song \"Alright\" while recalling",
    "The Master Adaptive Learner (MAL) concept in American medical education refers to a framework designed to prepare U.S. medical students, residents, and medical practitioners to continually adapt and respond to the rapidly evolving landscape of medical knowledge and practice. This metacognitive approach to learning or \u201clearning to learn\u201d is based on self-regulation that fosters the development and use of adaptive expertise in practice. This concept emphasizes the importance of lifelong learning, self-regulation, and adaptability, enabling health professionals to provide high-quality care in an ever-changing environment.\nThe MAL concept aligns with competency-based medical education, which is becoming more common and focuses on defining specific competencies or skills required for effective practice, assessing learners based on these competencies, and allowing progression based on demonstrated proficiency rather than time-based criteria. MAL also aligns to the newer concept of precision education which is being proposed as a model for lifelong learning for medical students, residents, fellows, and physicians. Precision education is an educational approach that tailors learning experiences and interventions based on individual student needs, strengths, and learning styles. Precision education utilizes data-driven insights and personalized strategies to optimize educational outcomes, fostering greater student engagement, understanding, and achievement.\nHistory\nThe MAL framework was first outlined in the scientific literature in 2017. The concept emerged from the recognition that medical knowledge is expanding at an unprecedented rate. Traditional frameworks for medical education, which often focus on the acquisition of static knowledge, are insufficient to prepare health professionals for the dynamic nature of medical practice. The MAL framework aims to cultivate skills that help learners not only acquire new knowledge but also adapt and apply this knowledge effectively in diverse and unpredictable clinical settings.\nCore principles\nThe Master Adaptive Learner framework is built on four key principles:\n1. Self-regulated learning\nSelf-regulated learning involves the ability to set goals, monitor progress, and adjust learning strategies as needed. This includes self-assessment, reflection, and the ability to seek feedback. The MAL framework encourages learners to take an active role in their education, fostering independence and self-efficacy.\n2. Adaptive expertise\nAdaptive expertise is the ability to apply knowledge and skills flexibly and innovatively in different situations. Unlike routine experts, who rely on well-practiced routines, adaptive experts can think critically and creatively, making them more effective in novel or complex scenarios.\n3. Lifelong learning\nLifelong learning is the continuous pursuit of knowledge and skills throughout a professional's career. The MAL framework promotes a culture of ongoing education and professional development, recognizing that medical knowledge and best practices are constantly evolving.\n4. Reflection and Feedback\nReflection and feedback are crucial components of the MAL framework. Reflective practice involves regularly analyzing one's own experiences and performance to identify strengths and areas for improvement. Constructive feedback from peers, mentors, and patients helps learners refine their skills and knowledge.\nImplementation in medical education\nImplementing the MAL framework in medical education requires a multifaceted approach.\nCurriculum design\nWhen designing medical curricula, opportunities for self-directed learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving should be incorporated. This includes case-based learning, simulations, and other active learning strategies that encourage students to apply knowledge in practical settings.\nAssessment methods\nAssessments should evaluate not only factual knowledge but also the ability to apply knowledge adaptively. This may involve formative assessments, reflective exercises, and performance-based evaluations that provide meaningful feedback and guide further learning.\nFaculty development\nFaculty members play a crucial role in fostering the skills associated with the MAL framework. Training programs for educators should focus on mentoring, providing effective feedback, and creating an environment that supports adaptive learning.\nLearning environment\nCreating a supportive learning environment is essential. This includes access to resources, opportunities for collaboration, and a culture that values continuous improvement and innovation.\nCoaching\nCoaching is frequently a part of medical school curricula that incorporates the MAL framework. This coaching helps learners take appropriate action in response to feedback and assessment.\nInformatics\nA learning environment focused on the MAL framework requires a robust informatics infrastructure to identify learning needs and assist in guiding learners on individualized paths.\n",
    "11th-century military clashes\nThe Zirid-Byzantine Conflicts were a series of military clashes between the Zirid dynasty of North Africa and the Byzantine Empire in the 11th century\n. These conflicts, primarily naval raids, occurred in the context of the broader Islamic-Byzantine conflicts that had characterized the region for centuries.\nBackground\nThe Zirids emerged as a powerful dynasty in the Maghreb (North Africa) in the 10th century. They established their capital in Ashgar (present-day Algeria) and ruled over a vast territory encompassing Tunisia and eastern Algeria. Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire, a dominant power in the eastern Mediterranean for centuries, sought to maintain control over its territories in southern Italy, Sicily, and the Adriatic Sea.\nThe Zirid Campaign in Illyria (1026-1035)\nThe most significant episode of the Zirid-Byzantine conflicts was the Zirid campaign in Illyria, which lasted from 1026 to 1035. The Zirids, in alliance with the Kalbid Emirate of Sicily, launched a series of naval raids against Byzantine holdings in the eastern Adriatic Sea, Greece, and Thrace. These raids aimed to disrupt Byzantine trade routes and assert Zirid power in the Mediterranean.\nImpact\nWhile the Zirid campaign did not achieve any lasting territorial gains, it had a significant impact on the region. The raids exposed the vulnerability of Byzantine defenses in the face of resurgent Muslim naval power in the central Mediterranean. It also marked a turning point in the power dynamics of the region, with the growing involvement of Italian maritime republics like Pisa and Genoa in these conflicts.\nAftermath\nFollowing the Zirid campaign, there were sporadic clashes between the Zirids and Byzantines throughout the 11th century. However, neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage. The rise of the Almoravids in the latter half of the 11th century ultimately eclipsed Zirid power in North Africa, and the Byzantines faced increasing pressure from the Seljuk Turks in the East.\nSee Also\nByzantine Empire\nZirid dynasty\nZirid campaign in Illyria\nAlmoravid dynasty\n",
    "\n2023 studio album by Modern Nature\nNo Fixed Point in Space is the third studio album by English musician Jack Cooper's music project Modern Nature. It was released on 29 September 2023 by Bella Union.\nThe album features collaborations by Anton Lukoszevieze, Mira Benjamin, Chris Abrahams and Julie Driscoll.\nBackground\nOn 27 June 2023, Modern Nature announced the release of a new third studio album, along with a music video for the single 'Murmuration'.\nThe second single, Cascade was released on 17 August 2023, with Cooper saying of the single:\n\"Cascade is a link between the abstract colors of this record and the rhythms of the last one Island of Noise. The imagery is an attempt to convey how overwhelming the world can be when you make the time to really observe it. Beautiful, intricate and infinite. I was honored to be able to sing this round a microphone with the great Julie Tippetts... something I'll never forget.\"\nCritical reception\nNo Fixed Point in Space was met with \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 77, based on 6 reviews.\nMark Moody of Under the Radar wrote: \"As with all of Cooper's post Ultimate Painting work, he has assembled a group of highly skilled musicians, created a framework for them to explore, and has let them roam and ramble in a fluid environment of their own making. No Fixed Point in Space takes this even further as the confines of traditional popular music are disassembled, much as the animals dispersing on the album's cover convey a pushing away from the center. At Pitchfork, Louis Pattison described the release as \"a subtler and more muted record than its predecessor, and somewhat stranger in the bargain.\" Writer John Bergstrom of PopMatters gave the release a 4 out of 10 stars, remarking \"Despite its open orchestration and more experimental bent, it is Modern Nature's least interesting release.\"\nAccolades\nTrack listing\n",
    "\nThe Saint Mary Monastery church of Radna (Romanian: M\u0103n\u0103stirea Maria Radna, Hungarian: M\u00e1riaradnai kolostor) is an 18th century baroque-style church in Radna, Arad County, Romania, located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Timi\u0219oara. The monumental ensemble consists of the actual church and three other buildings, all historical and architectural monuments of the 18th and 19th centuries.\nHistory\nThe monastery, cca 1820.\nThe first documentary mentions of monastic activity in this place date from around 1327. These mentions are related to the king of Hungary, Charles Robert of Anjou, who erected here a monastery and a church dedicated to Saint Louis of Toulouse, his uncle, both of which were entrusted to a group of Franciscan monks who came from Bosnia.\nIn the year 1520, a small chapel was built by a pious widow on the nearby hill, where the Franciscan monks refugees served on these banks of the Mure\u0219 River, when the Banat area was under Ottoman occupation. After the Banat region was conquered by the Ottomans in 1551, the chapel served the faithful and the Franciscan monks, refugees from the raiders on the northern shore of the Mure\u015f river.\nIn 1626 the Franciscan monastery was re-established at Radna. In 1642, P. Andrija Stipan\u010di\u0107, a priest in Radna, after a long and arduous journey on foot to Constantinople and back, succeeds in obtaining, in exchange for a substantial tip, an \"Embre\" (firman) from the Sultan Ibrahim I for the renovation of his chapel. In the year 1668, a certain Gheorghe Vriconosa from Bosnia donated an \"icon of the Mother of God\" to the chapel of the Franciscan monks in Radna. The icon was printed on paper in the workshop of a master typographer in Italy. In September 1695, the chapel was set on fire by the Ottoman soldiers, being devastated to the very ground. Despite the fire, the \"icon of the Mother of God\" did not suffer any damage, being considered a miracle-working artifact honored by believers to this day. Only in the year 1750, thanks to canon Johannes Szlezak, the monastic settlement Maria Radna was officially recognized as a church and place of pilgrimage. In the same year, the place of pilgrimage to Maria-Radna was also officially recognized.\nIn 1723, a new, larger church was built. In 1727, the construction of today's monastery with the west wing began. Between 1743 and 1747, the number of monks increasing significantly, the south wing was added. In 1756, on the 7th of July, on the feast of Pentecost, the foundation stone of a new church for Maria Radna was laid, the old church already being too small.\nBetween the years 1769-1771, the magnificent silver frame was made for the miraculous icon which is still visible as of today.\nIn the year 1992, the church was brought up to the rank of Minor Basilica with the patronage of 'Mother of Graces', by Pope John Paul II. In the year 2003, the Franciscan monks left the monastery, the parish and the place of pilgrimage being looked after by the diocesan clergy ever since.\nIn 2013, as part of a project co-financed by the European Union, the Maria Radna complex, classified as a class-A historic monument, underwent a complete renovation, the aim being the revitalization of local tourism.\nThe \"icon of the Mother of God\"\nThe Miracle worker icon of the Mother of God from inside the church.\nAccording to a sum of reports dating from before 1750, it appears that the Miraculous Icon, a representation of the Blessed Virgin Mary on Mount Carmel, had been resting in the nearby locality of Radna since 1668. An old Bosnian resident had bought it from an itinerant Italian merchant. Years later, the old man donated the icon to the church. It was printed after 1660 in northern Italy, more precisely in the Remondi printing house in Bassano del Grappa (province of Vicenza). Hundreds or even thousands of copies of the icon left the printing house at that time. The sacred image, measuring 477x705 mm, represents the Holy Virgin Mary with the Baby Jesus in her arms, and a scapular can also be seen in the Virgin's hands. On the edges of the image, there are group of imprimed small scenes with corresponding texts in Italian, which describe events with people in need who were miraculously helped by the Mother of God. Under the image with the Holy Virgin and the Baby Jesus, there is a small text written in Italian which says: \"La Beatissima Vergine del Carmine\", and which means \"Holy Virgin of Carmel\". Beneath this text, there is a representation of people on fire, which signify the souls of deceased people who have arrived in the Purgatory.\nThe monastery's museum\nThe Maria Radna Museum has a rich history which dates back to the year 1325. This museum displays a large number of artifacts of the Franciscan order, as well as a collection of more than 2,500 paintings donated by various people to the church, who claimed they symbolize the miracles they experienced during their lives. The current collection of paintings is actually the second one in the building and w",

    "Grade II* listed country house in Berkshire, England\nChilton Lodge is an English country house. It is a historic Grade II* listed building. The house is located northwest of Leverton, Berkshire, in the parish of Hungerford, in the West Berkshire district, in the ceremonial county of Berkshire. Its park extends into Wiltshire where one gate is just outside Chilton Foliat.\nHistory\n16th and 17th Century\nIn 1574 the property that was then referred to as \"Chilton Park\" was split from older estates Calcot Manor and Chilton Foliat Manor by Edward Manners, 3rd Earl of Rutland who had inherited the property through his other title, the 14th Baron de Ros. At this point, there was already a lodge in the Wiltshire portion of this property, near where the current Park Farm stands. The newly split Chilton Park was purchased by Sir Anthony Hinton (1532\u20131598) of Earlscourt (Earlscote) Manor outside of Wanborough, Wiltshire. Chilton Park became the Hinton family home. Sir Anthony's son, Sir Thomas Hinton (1574\u20131635) was the High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1612\u201313 and was a Member of Parliament twice between 1621 and 1625. Hinton was also one of the major investors in the Virginia Company, and the Hinton family subsequently developed close ties with Virginia.\nIn 1639 Sir Thomas's son Sir Anthony Hinton (1596\u20131647) sold the property to Thomas Hussey (1597\u20131657).\nThe Hussey family ended up in significant financial distress, and so in 1663, Thomas's son, Willam Hussey, sold the Chilton property to Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke, Keeper of the Great Seal during the Commonwealth.\nWhitelocke died at Chilton in 1675 and left the estate to Samuel, the oldest son of his third wife.\n18th Century\nThe Whitelocke family held the property until 1767. They sold it to John Zephaniah Holwell (1711\u20131798), a nabob, survivor of the Black Hole of Calcutta (1756), and the author of its most famous account. He had also been governor of Bengal in 1760. In 1771 Holwell sold the estate to another returnee from India, General Richard Smith (1734\u20131803). Smith, the former commander-in-chief of the East India Company in Bengal, had retired in 1770, and reportedly returned to England with \u00a3300,000 (equivalent to \u00a352,524,324 in 2023). While residing at Chilton, Smith spent much of his time standing for, or serving in Parliament.\nSmith reportedly gambled much of his massive fortune away, and in 1785 was obliged to sell the estate to John Macnamara (1756\u20131818). Macnamara was also a notorious gambler and playboy. In 1788, Macnamara sold Chilton back to the mortgagees William Morland (1739\u20131815) and Thomas Hammersley, bankers of Pall Mall. In 1789 Hammersley released his interest to Morland.\nIn 1789, Morland commissioned the architect Sir John Soane to demolish and rebuild the 16th-century house. This new house was completed around 1793. Soane's plans show a villa with a two-storied center and short single-storied wings. The new house was most likely built on the foundations of the old house and reused some materials from it. Other materials from the old house were auctioned in 1791.\nIn 1796 the estate was purchased by John Pearse (1759\u20131836) whose family had been extremely successful in the fabric and clothing business, particularly in supplying the military. In addition to the family business, Pearse was on the board of the Bank of England, eventually becoming its governor in 1812, and was a Member of Parliament from 1818 to 1832.\n19th Century\nIn 1800, Pearse had the roughly 7-year-old Soane-designed house pulled down and hired architect William Pilkington to design the current Chilton Lodge. There doesn't appear to be any clear indication why Soane's house was demolished so soon after it was built. Pearse also assembled the park that currently surrounds the Lodge. The new house was built to the east of the old one\u2014in Berkshire, and roughly in the center of the park. By 1813 he owned a total of 1,488 acres in the parish.\nIn 1834 Pearse sold the estate to the Rev. Sir William Henry Cooper (1766\u20131835), son of the Secretary to the Treasury (1765\u20131782) Grey Cooper. Rev. Cooper had been a Prebendary of Rochester Cathedral from 1793 to 1797, and, in 1803, chaplain to George III. Cooper died in 1835, leaving the house to his wife Isabella. From her very wealthy family, Isabella had inherited Isleworth House, a mansion on the banks of the River Thames in Isleworth, Middlesex, and it seems that she spent her time there, so Chilton Lodge was rented during this period. When Isabella died in 1855, she left the property to her and Sir William's grandson, William Honywood. Honywood does not seem to have lived in Chilton Lodge either. For example, The Times notes that Major-General Randal Rumley died in an accident while visiting a Mr. William Butler at Chilton Lodge in 1884.\nHonywood sold the property in 1890 to Sir William Pearce (1861\u20131907). Pearce was the son of famed shipbuilder Sir William Pearce, 1st Baronet, who had founded and was chairman of Fairfield Shipbuilding and Eng",

Following the successful launch of its first season in 2016, JTBC aired the second season in 2017. The Phantom Singer series features a diverse group of participants, including classical vocalists, musical actors, K-pop idols, traditional Korean musicians (\uad6d\uc545\uc778), and amateurs from various fields. Members of Miraclass emerged from these auditions, showcasing their talents and thus forming the group as part of the show's process.\nKang-hyun Park, a musical actor who had been on the scene for a year, was the first of the members to appear on the show. In his first TV audition, he performed \"She Was There\" from The Scarlet Pimpernel, achieving the highest viewership rating per minute. Julian Jootaek Kim, an established opera singer in Europe, performed F. Chopin\u2019s \"Tristezza.\" His performance was praised by Producer Hye-Soo Sonn, who remarked, \"When an opera singer reaches that high a level, the detail lies in complete control of the breathing.\" Phillip Jeong, a part-time member of the Busan Metropolitan Chorus, sang R. Leoncavallo's \"Mattinata\", which means 'morning' in Italian, with producers noting his voice suited a bright morning. Tain Han, a student in the Department of Vocal Music at Seoul National University, performed the jazz standard \"I've Got The World On A String,\" though this performance was not aired. Despite his classical training, Han had experience performing in a rock band in Hongdae before joining Phantom Singer 2.\nEach member advanced through various stages, including one-on-one duet competitions, duet showdowns, trio competitions, and quartet competitions, to reach the final 12. Notable performances include Han's rendition of Billy Joel\u2019s \"Piano Man,\" which was noted for his rhythm, soft phrasing, and stage manner. Kim's duet performance of \"A Blooming Day (\uaf43 \ud53c\ub294 \ub0a0)\" ranked fourth among the 14 teams, but narrowly missed advancing by 2 points. Park's duet with Lee Choong Joo, \"As Flowers Bloom and Fall (\uaf43\uc774 \ud53c\uace0 \uc9c0\ub4ef\uc774),\" was well-received and ranked first in the duet showdown. Tain Han's trio mission performance of \"I See Fire\" and Julian Jootaek Kim's trio performance of \"Il Guerriero Buono\" received mixed reviews from the producers. Jeong's trio performance of \"Look Inside\" by Mark Vincent was well-received and secured second place among the eight teams. In the semifinal round, the quartet he belonged to achieved the highest score with their performance of \"La Vita.\"\nFormation of Miraclass\nThe four members faced various challenges and moments of praise throughout the competition, but ultimately reached the final 12. Among the finalists, Forestella and Edel Reinklang had been singing together since the trio mission. Alongside Miraclass, these two teams emerged as strong contenders due to their vocal harmonies and cohesive performances. Forestella, known for their unique blend of classical and pop music, and Edel Reinklang, with their rich vocal textures and dynamic stage presence, both formed a tight-knit bond during the trio or quartet missions. They already had a team name or a name close to their final form, showcasing their readiness and unity.\nWhen the members of Miraclass first met, only Julian Jootaek Kim and Kang-hyun Park, had sung together once, while the other two had never sung with the other members. They needed a team name quickly, and Jeong came up with \"Miraclass\" by coining \u201cmiracle\u201d and \u201cclass,\u201d",
    "Human dislike towards monkeys\nMonkey hate is a form of zoosadism where humans have a hatred for monkeys and take pleasure in their suffering. The phenomenon drew public attention after a global monkey torture ring was uncovered by the BBC in 2023.\nBaby macaque monkeys are primarily targeted. Monkeys are often referred to by monkey haters as \"tree rats\".\nOccurrence and arrests\nVideos of monkeys being tortured or abused have been commonly uploaded to social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. According to a September 2021\u2013May 2023 study by Asia for Animals\u2019 Social Media Animal Cruelty Coalition (SMACC), videos by pet macaque owners had a total of 12 billion views online, with 12 percent of these videos involving physical torture, and 13 percent involving psychological abuse. Video titles have often contained broken English phrases such as \"million pity\" and \"million sadness\".\nIn 2021, a United States-based Telegram monkey torture group, Million Tears, was closed down after being brought to public attention. The group had about thirty members, who would pay owners of monkeys to carry out abuse on them. In 2023, a continuation of the group, Ape's Cage, which involved around four hundred members, was uncovered by the BBC. Video operators who carried out the monkey torture were primarily based in Indonesia, while the members of the group were largely American and from other Western countries. Torture methods ranged from submerging monkeys in ice water to killing them in blenders, sawing them in half, or cutting off their tails and limbs.\nSeveral notable members of Ape's Cage have been arrested, including American Michael McCartney (known as \"Torture King\") and two British women, Holly LeGresley and Adriana Orme. Two Indonesian men also received prison sentences for their involvement. \"Mr. Ape\", the pseudonymous leader of the group, has not been publicly identified.\nAnimal welfare organizations such as Action for Primates and Lady Freethinker have been involved in investigating monkey hate groups.\nCauses\nIn countries where macaques are native, negative interactions between humans and wild macaques have increased as humans take over monkey habitats, resulting in macaques being considered pests and targeted for abuse.\nDave Gooptar, who helped investigate Ape's Cage, has stated his belief that since baby monkeys mimic certain childlike behaviors and characteristics, many monkey haters are sexual sadists who use baby monkeys as a proxy for children.\nSome monkey haters have claimed that their hatred comes from monkeys falling into the uncanny valley, a phenomenon where something that looks almost human but is different in subtle ways triggers revulsion.\n",
    "British politician\nNot to be confused with Jean Kraft.\nJennifer Craft is a British Labour Party politician and former civil servant who has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Thurrock since 2024.\nEarly life and career\nCraft was born at Orsett Hospital in Orsett, Thurrock, England. She grew up in Grays, Thurrock and was educated at Grays Convent High School and Palmer's College. She studied politics and history at university. Before entering politics, she worked as a civil servant. She left the civil service to look after one of her children who has Down syndrome.\nIn an interview from 2023, Craft said her interest in politics was inspired by her mother, a GMB shop steward, and her children. A member of the Labour Party, she was Labour MP Margaret Hodge's campaign manager in the 2010 general election, managing her campaign to defeat the British National Party in the constituency of Barking. In the 2019 Thurrock Council election, she stood as the Labour candidate for the ward of Stifford Clays. She came in second place behind Jennifer Smith of the Thurrock Independents by 188 votes.\nMember of Parliament\nIn 2022, Craft was selected as the Labour Party's prospective parliamentary candidate for the constituency of Thurrock. She was chosen in a ballot of local party members, beating Thurrock Council Labour leader John Kent, former Basildon Council Labour leader Jack Ferguson and Ealing Council member Miriam Rice. She was convinced to run by her husband Alastair and applied for financial support from the organisation MotheRed to support her bid to become Labour's candidate in the seat. Her bid was supported by former Thurrock Council Labour leader Jane Pothecary, former Thurrock mayor Carl Morris and John Biggs, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets. She was also endorsed by several trade unions, including GMB, Community and USDAW.\nAfter Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called the 2024 general election in May 2024, Craft said it was an opportunity for Labour to \"unleash a decade of national renewal\". She criticised the Conservative Party for presiding over the bankruptcy of Thurrock Council, which she said reflected the national situation under Sunak's Conservative government. Although optimistic, Craft warned that the election was \"not a foregone conclusion\" and pledged to \"work hard for every single vote until the polls close\" on election day. In the same month, she launched the party's six pledges for the election with Labour leader Keir Starmer. In June, she was endorsed by Ross Kemp. In that month, she campaigned in the constituency with Starmer and Labour frontbenchers Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper.\nAt the general election on 4 July 2024, she defeated the incumbent Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price with 16,050 votes and was elected the new MP for Thurrock with a majority of 6,474 votes, or 17.2%, over Reform UK candidate Sophie Preston-Hall. Her election made her one of at least three disabled MPs who were first elected in 2024, alongside Labour MP Marie Tidball and Liberal Democrat MP Steve Darling. She was sworn in to Parliament on 11 July 2024.\nPersonal life\nCraft lives in Grays with her family. Her husband Alastair Craft is a member of the local Labour Party and stood for the party in the 2024 Thurrock Council election. She is disabled, describing herself as having \"long term mental health issues\" in an interview from 2023, and is also a full-time caregiver for one of her children who has Down syndrome.\n",

    "Former municipality of Iceland\nSeyluhreppur\nSeyluhreppur is an old Icelandic hreppur, or rural municipality, that is today part of the municipality of Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. It is located to the west of the H\u00e9ra\u00f0sv\u00f6tn river in Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur county and is named after the town of St\u00f3ra-Seyla in Langholt, which was where county assemblies were held.\nSeyluhreppur consisted of four districts: Langholt, Vallh\u00f3lmur, V\u00ed\u00f0im\u00fdrarhverfi, and Sk\u00f6r\u00f0, aside from Fjall, Geldingaholt, and H\u00fasabakkab\u00e6irnir, which were not considered to belong to any of the four districts. Seyluhreppur is wide, but only six towns in the hreppur had land bordering the mountain. The municipality was located completely in the parish of Glaumb\u00e6r where there were two churches, one in the town of Glaumb\u00e6r and one in V\u00ed\u00f0im\u00fdri. In centuries past, there was also a church in Geldingaholt.\nAgriculture was, for a long time, the inhabitants\u2019 primary occupation, but shortly before 1950, a small urban area developed in Varmahl\u00ed\u00f0, most of whose residents work in various types of businesses or in service jobs. Varmahl\u00ed\u00f0 has a school, community center, hotel, and swimming pool, as well as shops and other services. After incorporating into the municipality of Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, 303 residents lived in the hreppur, with 125 in Varmahl\u00ed\u00f0.\nOn June 6, 1988, the hreppur joined ten other local municipalities to form the eponymous municipality of Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur: Skefilssta\u00f0ahreppur, Sau\u00f0\u00e1rkr\u00f3kskaupsta\u00f0ur, Skar\u00f0shreppur, Sta\u00f0arhreppur, L\u00fdtingssta\u00f0ahreppur, R\u00edpurhreppur, Vi\u00f0v\u00edkurhreppur, H\u00f3lahreppur, Hofshreppur, and Flj\u00f3tahreppur.\nHreppur Council\nThe last government council in Seyluhreppur was elected in the May 28, 1994 municipal elections, consisting of Anna Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur Hr\u00f3\u00f0marsd\u00f3ttir, Arn\u00f3r Gunnarsson, Kristj\u00e1n Sigurp\u00e1lsson, Sigur\u00f0ur Haraldsson, and Sveinn Allan Morthens.\nCouncil chairs:\n1874\u20131877 Stef\u00e1n Einarsson in Krossanes\n1877\u20131880 Magn\u00fas J\u00f3nsson in Fjall\n1880\u20131884 Halld\u00f3r Stef\u00e1nsson in V\u00ed\u00f0im\u00fdri\n1884\u20131888 Eyj\u00f3lfur Hansson in Valadalur\n1888\u20131892 \u00c1rni J\u00f3nsson in Marb\u00e6li\n1892\u20131899 Sigur\u00f0ur J\u00f3nsson in Brautarholt\n1899\u20131901 J\u00f3n \u00c1sgr\u00edmsson in H\u00fasey\n1901\u20131919 Sigur\u00f0ur J\u00f3nsson in Brautarholt\n1919\u20131935 Bj\u00f6rn L.

    "Frederick Robert Irvine FLS (30 April 1898, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, UK \u2013 19 August 1962, Accra, Ghana) was a British botanist.\nIrvine graduated with agricultural training at Armstrong College, University of Durham. There he received a D.Sc. For 16 years from 1924 to 1940 he taught botany and agriculture at Achimota College in Accra, Ghana. In 1927 he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London. His 1930 book Plants of the Gold Coast focused on the uses of such plants. His 1931 book Botany of West Africa was the first text-book on the subject. He became in 1940 an administrative officer at the University of Edinburgh and in 1961 returned to Ghana.\nFrom 1924 to 1939 Irvine collected plants in West Africa. His main co-collector was A. O. Ohene (of Ghana's Akan tribe). Irvine collected plants in Ghana, Mali, Senegal, Sierre Leone, and the French protectorate in Morocco, as well as in the UK. Many of his botanical specimens are stored at the Natural History Museum, London.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s he frequently visited the Kew Herbarium. There he sought obscure publications on food plants, asked questions about plant taxonomy, and took copious notes. His interest in food plants led him to accumulate information about the traditional food plants of the Australian Aborigines and the North American Indians.\nIrvine was concerned about the well-being and success of overseas students in the UK. After WW II, his work with the Society of Friends, as warden of the society's International Centre at Tavistock Square, brought him into contact with a large number of such students. Irvine's interest in food supply motivated him to collect zoological information. He collaborated with 3 colleagues in writing the 1947 book The Fishes and Fisheries of the Gold Coast.\nIn 1959, while working under Quaker auspices for a year in the United States, he became seriously ill \u2014 after returning to the UK, he recovered but for the rest of his life his health was not good. At the time of his death, he was revising his 1934 book West African Agriculture, working on a book about herbs as a companion volume to Woody Plants of Ghana, and attempting to complete his book Vocabularies of Plant Names in the Nigerian Languages. Upon his death in 1962 he was survived by his widow, their son, and their two daughters. In 1963 his widow donated his papers to the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh.\nSelected publications\nArticles\nIrvine, F. R. (1932). \"The Teaching of Agriculture in West Africa\".

    "Gennady Rakitin (Russian: \u0413\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d) is a hoax and the name of a fictional Russian poet created by an anonymous group of anti-Putin Russian exiles led by Andrey Zakharov. In mid-2023, they began to translate Nazi propagandistic poems, written in the 1930s and 1940s in Nazi Germany to celebrate Nazism, fascism, and to honor Adolf Hitler, into Russian with minimal changes and published those poems as patriotic verses celebrating Russia's war in Ukraine and the Russian leader and President Vladimir Putin on a Russian social media platform. The barely disguised Nazi poems drew significant attention in Russia, duping people from all walks of society that include Kremlin officials and nearly a hundred State Duma deputies and even winning some influential poetry competition awards. In June 2024, tired of moral exhaustion, the Russian exiles finally revealed the non-existence of Gennady Rakitin and the Nazi provenance of those patriotic poems. According to the participants, this hoax was created to debunk Putin's claim of anti-Nazism in Russian invasion of Ukraine and prove that modern mainstream Russian culture has so much in common with Nazism.\nHoax\nThe Russian anti-Putin exiles created a 49-year-old poet named Gennady Rakitin with his black-and-white image created with AI. Gennady Rakitin was set as a graduate of the Philology Department at Moscow State University. In mid-2023, they published 18 poems on VKontakte to \"pay tribute\" to the \"heroic sacrifices\" of Russian soldiers in the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the \"great leader\" Vladimir Putin. In fact, these verses were translations of Nazi Germany's propaganda written in the 1930s and 1940s with minimal changes such as replacing \"Germany\", \"Hitler\" and \"nameless Storm Troopers\" with \"Russia\", \"Putin\" and \"nameless Wagner Group mercenaries\". One poem \"Leader\", which was posted with Putin's masculine picture, is actually \"Fuhrer\", an anti-Semitic Nazi propagandistic work written by Eberhard Wolfgang M\u00f6ller in 1938. M\u00f6ller had joined the Nazi Party even before Hitler came to power. Other Nazi authors include Herybert Menzel, a Sturmabteilung member who joined Nazi Party in 1933, and Heinrich Anacker, a Nazi songwriter.\nImpact\nThe verses were reposted on VKontakte by many. About 100 State Duma deputies, 30 Senators, and not a few Kremlin officials were taken in and added Gennady Rakitin as \"friends\". These people include State Duma deputies Dmitry Kuznetsov and Nina Ostanina, Russian senators Dmitry Rogozin and Andrey Klishas, Putin\u2019s cultural advisor Elena Yampolskaya, and pro-Kremlin \u201cwar correspondent\u201d Yuri Kotenok.\nMeanwhile, in June 2024, one of Rakitin's poems won a prize at an All-Russian Patriotic Poetry Competition held by the Union of Writers of Russia Kaluga branch, reaching the semifinals in the \u201cPoems about war and defenders of the Motherland\u201d category. One of the poems also won the Tvardovsky Patriotic Poetry Competition.\nSee Also\nRuscism\n",

RANS Entertainment was founded on December 27, 2015.\nHistory\nSee also: RANS Nusantara F.C.RANS Entertainment is a YouTube channel and production house owned by Raffi Ahmad and Nagita Slavina. The name RANS comes from a combination of the names Raffi Ahmad (RA) and Nagita Slavina (NS). Both of them chose YouTube as the initial medium for broadcasting RANS Entertainment because Nagita Slavina felt freer to express herself through YouTube than television.\nRaffi Ahmad's initial goal in creating the RANS Entertainment YouTube channel was to capture moments with his family. RANS Entertainment's first content contains videos discussing facial makeup. As time went by, Raffi saw a good income opportunity through YouTube AdSense.\nOn October 26, 2021, RANS announced their partnership with Emtek Group. RANS also announced that Kaesang Pangarep had been appointed as commissioner of their company.\nIn an interview with CNBC Indonesia in early 2022, Raffi Ahmad said that the RANS Entertainment company had achieved profit and was planning to conduct an initial public offering. Raffi claims that RANS Entertainment no longer only relies on YouTube channels, but has other business lines such as managing sports fields at Pantai Indah Kapuk. Economic observer from the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance, Nailul Huda, said that RANS was not ready to carry out an initial public offering in 2022, because it still relied on the big name of its owner.\nIn February 2022, RANS announced via press release that it was investing in audio content application Noice. RANS injected capital amounting to IDR 35.75 billion to the owner of Noice, Mahaka Radio Integra, for the development of the application\nProduct Content\nMusic Channel\nOn August 16, 2018, RANS Entertainment created a special channel for the music genre, namely RANS Music which has 972 thousand subscribers as of August 2023.\nWeb Series and Animation Production\nOn September 30, 2019, RANS Entertainment released the web series My Dreams Become Real, starring the top 5 alumni of Indonesian Idol Junior (third season).

The series premiered on May 23, 2020. This series was also broadcast on ANTV to celebrate Rafathar's 5th birthday.\nMURI Records\nOn June 18, 2020, at 20.00 WIB, RANS Entertainment started a live broadcast that lasted 30 hours. The broadcast featured 22 pieces of content, watched by more than 4 million people, and featured several public figures, such as Ari Lasso, Gading Marten, Nikita Mirzani, Olla Ramlan, and Rizky Febian. This broadcast earned the RANS Entertainment YouTube channel a MURI record for the category of Live Broadcast of Family Events with the Most Viewers and the category of Live Broadcast of Family Events via YouTube and Facebook for the longest time.\nOther Business Divisions\nIn July 2020, RANS Entertainment created a PUBG division in RANS Esport with the team name RANS Glory.\nAt the Indonesia Brand Forum 2021, RANS Entertainment announced that they would launch a playground project in the Pantai Indah Kapuk area.\nOn March 16, 2022, it was announced that RANS Entertainment was collaborating with VCGamers to create a metaverse called RANSVerse.\nAdSense Earnings\nAccording to Social Blade data in 2019, Raffi and Nagita as owners of the YouTube channel RANS Entertainment are the second richest YouTube celebrities in Indonesia (after Atta Halilintar) with estimated income from YouTube of between IDR 448 million to IDR 7.1 billion per month. Data from the same source the following year placed RANS Entertainment as the YouTuber with the 4th most subscribers, with monthly income that could reach IDR 7.9 billion.\nResearch by Ega Maulana and others states that the loyalty of subscribers to the RANS Entertainment YouTube channel is closely related to their satisfaction with RANS videos and has little to do with the company's image. The book Entrepreneurship Changing Times says that netizens like content about children of artists, such as the daily life of Rafathar, who is Raffi and Nagita's son.\nApart from that, RANS Entertainment is also creating a start-up business project with a metaverse concept with VCGamers called RANSVerse. VCGamers officially received funding from RANS Ventures owned by celebrity couple Raffi Ahmad and Nagita Slavina and Beenext.

    "English minister and activist (1830\u20131905)\nFor other people named James Clark, see James Clark (disambiguation).\nJames Clark (18 October 1830 \u2013 7 June 1905) was an English Bible Christian Church minister and activist for temperance and vegetarianism. Clark was deeply involved in social causes, including relief efforts during the Cotton Famine and service on the Salford Board of Guardians. As Honorary Secretary of the Vegetarian Society, he represented the organisation at international congresses and helped found the International Vegetarian Union.\nLife and career\n1891 meeting of the Vegetarian Society. Clark stands in the top left.\nJames Clark was born on 18 October 1830 in Bolton, Lancashire. He was Christened in Bolton le Moors, in 1831. Clark's family had a history of tuberculosis.\nClark moved to Manchester as a youth and began his career in a shipping house, where he later became a buyer. Despite the demands of his work, he attended evening classes associated with the Bible Christian Church in King-street, Salford.\nIn 1848, Clark became a teetotaller and worked with the temperance society of the Oldham-street Tabernacle. He adopted vegetarianism in 1851 and was ordained as a minister of the Bible Christian Church, eventually becoming the pastor at Whitstuntide in 1858. This denomination, established in 1809, mandated abstinence from intoxicants and meat. One of Clark's ministerial predecessors was Joseph Brotherton, who represented Salford in the House of Commons. Clark remained as a pastor for nearly 50 years, continuing his church duties in his later years, despite failing health.\nClark was actively involved in relief efforts during the Cotton Famine and served on the Relief Committees in Salford. Following the Broughton floods of 1866, he dedicated much time to aiding those affected. He was a long-time member of the Salford Board of Guardians, advocating for significant reforms. Upon his resignation as chair in 1889, he received an address signed by every member, regardless of party affiliation.\nA committed Liberal and proponent of education, Clark taught at the Salford Lyceum and served two terms on the Salford School Board. He oversaw large Sunday and day schools within the Bible Christian Church, regarded among the best in the borough.

He was also buried in Weaste Cemetery.\nClark's death deeply impacted the Bible Christian Church, his local community, and the campaigners he supported. Days before his passing, he had expressed a desire to die while serving his congregation. His memorial service included representatives from various organisations, highlighting his broad influence, especially with the Vegetarian Society. Tributes praised his exceptional character and dedication to helping the poor. Two memorials were unveiled in his honour, and his successor noted his humane nature and commitment to alleviating suffering.

    "1973 studio album by Jean Shepard\nSlippin' Away is a studio album by American country singer Jean Shepard. It was released by United Artists Records in September 1973 and was her twentieth studio album. The album was named for Shepard's top five US and Canadian country single of the same name. The album itself was Shepard's first for United Artists after many years with Capitol Records. It received a positive response from both Billboard and Record World magazines.\nBackground\nOne of country music's first successful solo female artists, Jean Shepard rose to fame in the 1950s and had top ten and 20 singles over the next 20 years. Shepard had been with Capitol Records until the early 1970s, but was getting frustrated with the lack of attention the label gave to her recent releases. In February 1973, it was announced that Shepard had moved to United Artists Records. In 1973, her United Artists single \"Slippin' Away\" made the country top ten. Her first United Artists of the same name would be named for the single.\nRecording and content\nAt first, Larry Butler was working alongside Johnny Cash at Columbia Records until it was announced he would be working as an independent producer at United Artists. With this decision, it was then decided that Butler would serve as Shepard's producer for her next recording sessions. Recording sessions for Slippin' Away were held between March and April 1973 at the House of Cash studios in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Butler was the sole producer on the album. The album contained a total of ten tracks. A majority of the recordings were cover tunes. Covers included \"Teddy Bear Song\", \"'Til I Get It Right\", \"Funny Face\" and \"It's Not Love (But It's Not Bad)\". The title track was one of the album's few new tracks and was penned by Bill Anderson.\nRelease and critical reception\nCash Box magazine originally stated that Slippin' Away would be released in mid-August 1973. However, the album was instead released in September 1973 by United Artists Records. The label distributed it as a vinyl LP, with five songs on each side of the disc. Slippin' Away was the twentieth studio album released in Shepard's career. It was given positive reviews from critics following its release. Billboard named it among its \"Country Picks\" in September 1973, finding that Shepard was \"singing better than any time in her life\". Critics also predicted high sales, stating, \"The titles in this album are very familiar, which should help with the product.\" Record World magazine also praised the album in September 1973 calling the cover tunes \"a solid collection of hits\" with \"fine readings\".\nChart performance and singles\nSlippin' Away was Shepard's first album in three years to make the US Billboard Top Country Albums chart, rising to the number 15 position in 1973. It was her third highest-peaking album on the country survey behind two records from 1966. It was one of seven albums by Shepard to make the top 20 of the same survey. Slippin' Away included two singles. Its lead single was the title track, which was initially released by United Artists in May 1973. It rose to the number four position on the US country songs chart and number three on Canada's RPM country chart in 1973. \"Come on Phone\" was spawned as the second single in October 1973, reaching number 36 on the US country chart and number 28 on the Canadian country chart.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAll credits are adapted from the liner notes of Slippin' Away.\nChart performance\nRelease history\n",
    "Australian arts administrator\nGilbert (Gil) Charles Docking OAM (16 February 1919 \u2013 17 November 2015) was an Australian arts administrator, founding director of the Newcastle Art Gallery, director of the Auckland City Art Gallery (1965\u20131972) and senior education officer and acting director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales (1972\u20131982).\nEarly life\nDocking was born in 1919 in Bendigo, Victoria to George Docking and Gertrude Docking (n\u00e9e Ebbott). He went to school at Melbourne Boys High and won a scholarship for \u00a0Industrial Design at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. His first job on graduating was as an industrial designer for a glass factory, but his upbringing in the Methodist faith led him to attend a training college for Methodist Home Missionaries. He was then posted to serve in the circuit of Omeo, an historic Gippsland gold mining town in Eastern Victoria. In 1942, aged 23, Docking enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force and was based in the UK where he was involved in coastal defence as the navigator on a Bristol Beaufighter. Flying off the Dutch coast in 1944, the plane was hit and Docking and the pilot ended up in a rubber dingy in the North Sea. The two men were picked up by a German torpedo boat and spent the rest of their war in a German prisoner of war camp. They were liberated by Russian forces in 1945. You can read the illustrated diary Docking kept during his imprisonment here. After the war Docking attended Melbourne University to study Fine Arts and Philosophy, graduating in 1951 with a BA. Three years later he married artist Sheila (Shay) Lawson. At this time the couple\u00a0 turned to Anglo-Catholicism sharing a love of its liturgy, music and images.\nArt museum career\nNational Gallery of Victoria\nIn 1952 Docking was appointed education officer at the National Gallery of Victoria with responsibility for touring exhibitions throughout the state. On occasion he was accompanied by Shay Docking who used the opportunity to paint the landscape. Docking left the Gallery in 1956 and spent the next two years teaching at Mt Scopus Memorial College.\nNewcastle Art Gallery\nIn 1958 Docking was invited to be the inaugural director of the Newcastle Art Gallery. Based on his experience gained traveling throughout New South Wales,\u00a0 Docking brought to his new role an overview of how regional art galleries could best evolve. Working with contacts made at the National Gallery of Victoria he began to amass a significant collection. Many of the works were received as gifts including important paintings like Portrait of a strapper 1941 by William Dobell. Docking also championed the young artist Brett Whiteley and in 1959 the Newcastle Art Gallery became the first public institution to purchase his work.\nAuckland City Art Gallery\nIn 1965 Docking took up the position of director at the Auckland City Art Gallery becoming its third director after Eric Westbrook and Peter Tomory. One of his early actions was to initiate a small but select collection of Gothic art. This was the beginning of a number of important purchases which included a number of significant works by New Zealand artists: Rita Angus's Portrait of Betty Curnow 1942, Gordon Walters Painting No 1 1965, Colin McCahon The Marys at the Tomb 1947, Michael Smither Rocks with Mountain 1968, and Doris Lusk's The Pumping Station 1958. He was also responsible for the acquisition of\u00a0 37 works by Henry Fuseli.\nEarly in his directorship \u00a0Docking became involved in a project that almost doubled the size of the Auckland City Art Gallery's exhibition spaces and significantly updated its\u00a0 exhibition style. In 1967 the Gallery had received a large bequest from the Philip Augustus Edmiston Trust. This supported a major extension to the building, initially through the addition of the Edmiston Wing and a new sculpture garden. The extension was opened in 1975, the Gallery's centennial year.\nDocking was closely involved with the exhibition programme over his directorship. A \u00a0selection from the programme at this time included:\n1967 Marcel Duchamp: 78 Works The Mary Sisler Collection. Docking himself described securing \u00a0this comprehensive exhibition of Duchamp's work as a result of a \u2018shot-in-the-dark. A letter to a New York dealer culminated in one of the world's most important collection of the French artists work to tour New Zealand.\n1969 Frances Hodgkins 1869-1947: A Centenary Exhibition. New Zealand's Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council commissioned Docking and Hodgkins expert E.H. McCormick to develop a \u2018comprehensive exhibition\u2019 to mark the centenary of the artist's birth.\n1970 New Zealand Art of the Sixties: A Royal Visit Exhibition.\n1971 Ten Big Paintings.

    "Monument in Harbin, China\nThe Soviet Red Army Monument, Harbin (Chinese: \u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8\u82cf\u8054\u7ea2\u519b\u82f1\u96c4\u7eaa\u5ff5\u7891; pinyin: H\u0101\u011brb\u012bn s\u016bli\u00e1n h\u00f3ngj\u016bn y\u012bngxi\u00f3ng j\u00ec ni\u00e0nb\u0113i) is a national monument of China to the fallen Soviet Red Army soldiers who took part in the 1945 Soviet invasion of Manchuria during World War II which liberated Northeast China (Manchuria) from Japanese occupation. It is located in the Nangang District of Harbin. \nHistory\nPresident of Russia Vladimir Putin lays flowers at the monument during his state visit to China (17 May 2024)\nAs agreed with the United Kingdom and the United States (Western Allies) at the Tehran Conference in November 1943 and the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Soviet Union entered World War II's Pacific Theater within three months of the end of the war in Europe. The Soviet invasion of Manchuria began on 9 August 1945, and led to defeat of the Japanese Kwantung Army and toppled the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in Manchuria.\nAfter the Soviet troops entered Harbin in the second half of August 1945, the Monument to the fighters against the Comintern, which honored the White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who died in the fight against the Soviet Union, was demolished by Soviet troops. In its place, it was decided by the Soviet Red Army Command to erect a monument to honor fallen Soviet soldiers who died during the liberation of Manchuria from Japanese control. Construction began in August 1945 and was completed on November 7 of the same year, which was the 28th anniversary of the October Revolution. On the same day, the dedication ceremony of the monument was held.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Sino-Soviet relations deteriorated significantly due to the Sino-Soviet split and the 1969 Sino-Soviet border conflict. As a result, many monuments honoring Soviet soldiers were affected including the Red Army Martyrs Monument in Harbin were covered by scaffolding. However, on Qingming Festival and  Victory in Europe Day, the Soviet embassy, Soviet consulate, China-Soviet Union Friendship Association and other organizations would lay wreaths in front of the monument. Following the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations in the 1980s, the scaffolding was removed and the monument underwent repairs.\nThe monument became one of Harbin's cultural relics protection sites in 1995 and on 11 November 1997, then President of Russia Boris Yeltsin, during his state visit to China, visited Harbin and laid a wreath in front of the monument. On 10 January 1999, the monument was listed as the fourth batch of Heilongjiang Province's cultural relics protection sites. In 2010, the monument was declared as Harbin's fourth batch of first-class historical buildings and in 2011, it was repaired as a whole with some of its parts and the commemorative words on the monument repainted with the damaged parts of the monument completely replaced.\nOn 17 May 2024, during his visit to Harbin as part of his state visit to China, President of Russia Vladimir Putin laid flowers at the monument.\nStructure\nThe Soviet Red Army Monument consists of a monument top, two parts of the monument body and a monument base. It is 18\u00a0m (59\u00a0ft) high and faces east. There are two life-size sculptures of a Soviet Red Army soldier and a Soviet Navy sailor. They hold a rifle that has fallen to the ground in one hand and raise a five-pointed star with the other hand together, symbolizing victory in the war.\nOn both sides of the upper part of the monument body, there are reliefs composed of wheat ears, flags and hammer and sickle patterns. Below the relief are the numerals \"1945-IX-3\" (3 September 1945), the official Soviet and present-day Russian commemoration date of VJ Day.

The couple briefly lived in Detroit and Chicago before moving back to Minnesota and buying a 250-acre farm in 1957. She taught English in Belgrade, Minnesota for over ten years.\nAnti-power line movement\nIn the early 1970s, the proposed CU Powerline would have cut across 8,000 acres of farmland in North Dakota and Minnesota, which caused much controversy in rural areas. In an April 1978 poll, the Minneapolis Tribune asked Minnesotans whether they sided with the farmers or the utilities. Sixty-three percent said they sided with the farmers. Among rural Minnesotans, support for the farmers ran at 70 percent.\nTripp led opposition to the power line and campaigned against it, supported by Karen Clark.

    "American clergyman, planter, patriot and politician\nCharles Clay (December 24, 1745 \u2013 February 8, 1820) was an American planter, clergyman and politician in Virginia who represented Bedford County, Virginia in the Virginia Ratifying Convention. Today he is best known either for his friendship with Thomas Jefferson, or as a member of a political family which included his brothers Congressman Matthew Clay and Kentucky Senate president and General Green Clay, as well as his four sons, especially Odin Green Clay who continued the political tradition of this branch of the family as well as became president of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company.\nEarly life and education\nHe was born to Martha Green and her planter husband Charles Clay in then-vast Goochland County in the Colony of Virginia, probably in the part that became Cumberland County in 1749 and again split in 1777 and became Powhatan County.  He received a private education appropriate to his class. Younger brothers included future Congressman Matthew Clay (1754\u20131815) and General Green Clay (1757\u20131828), who were also well educated. Other siblings included Rev. Eleazer Clay and Thomas, Henry and Martha Clay. His father had also patented (claimed) much land in what became eastern Pittsylvania County, which Matthew Clay would ultimately inherit from a sibling (but which at the time of Matthew's birth was in Halifax County).\nCareer\nAfter traveling to England for ordination by the Bishop of London, Clay served as rector of St. Anne's Parish in Albemarle County, Virginia during the American Revolutionary War (1772\u20131785). His most famous parishioner (and friend) was lawyer and planter Thomas Jefferson who became governor of Virginia during the conflict, as well as President of the United States decades later. However, Clay  left that parish after disestablishment of the Episcopal Church led to failure to pay his salary, as well as arrears in repairs to his glebe home. He made unsuccessful attempts to secure those payments including through the county court and by petitioning the Virginia House of Delegates. Rev. Clay then took a position with Manchester Parish in Chesterfield County, Virginia (now within the Richmond city limits but then across the James River from Virginia's new capital). Rev. Clay participated in the 1785 convention that organized the Protestant Episcopal Church in Virginia, as well as the diocesan convention the next year, before abandoning his ministry by 1787.\nClay also had a plantation called \"Petty Grove\" in Bedford County, Virginia, near Thomas Jefferson's Poplar Grove. Like Jefferson and other nearby planters, Clay used enslaved labor to operate those plantations. By his death, he also owned land in Amherst, Buckingham and Campbell Counties as well as town lots in Lynchburg.\nClay served as justice of the peace in Bedford county from 1782 until 1785. Bedford County voters elected Clay and John Trigg as their representatives to the Virginia Ratifying Convention in Richmond, during which his brother Green Clay served as one of the representatives for Madison County (which would later become Kentucky). Like his brother and Trigg, Clay voted to require amendments to the proposed new federal constitution and then voted (unsuccessfully) against ratification. On the last day he voted for a proposed amendment to reduce Congress' taxation powers. Clay also unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1790 and 1792 before ending his political career.\nPersonal life\nClay married Editha Landon Daviews on July 4, 1796, who bore four sons who survived to adulthood.\nDeath and legacy\nClay died at home on February 8, 1820, and was buried on the estate. A very large cairn of stones reportedly marks his gravesite, either to deter road building in the area, or because Clay required each of his sons to throw a rock on the pile for every wrongful act they committed. His last will provided for his widow as well as distributed his land and slaves and shares of the Farmers Bank of Virginia among his sons, and also mentioned a small silver cane given him by Thomas Jefferson.\n",
    "Mountain in Washington, United States\nGamma Peak is a 7,005-foot (2,135-metre) summit in Snohomish County, Washington, United States.\nDescription\nGamma Peak is located 25 miles (40\u00a0km) east-southeast of Darrington in the heart of the Glacier Peak Wilderness on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. It is set three miles (4.8\u00a0km) northeast of Glacier Peak in the North Cascades. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Gamma and Dusty creeks which are tributaries of the Suiattle River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 3,950 feet (1,204 meters) above the Suiattle River in three miles (4.8\u00a0km). The approach to the remote peak is via the Gamma Ridge Trail which starts in the upper Suiattle Valley near the Pacific Crest Trail. The summit provides one of the finest views in this part of the Glacier Peak Wilderness. The mountain's toponym was officially adopted in 1963 by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\nNorthwest aspect of Gamma Peak seen from Vista Ridge\nGeology\nSubduction and tectonic activity in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about 90\u00a0million years ago. The area was previously an oceanic environment, consisting mainly of sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about 35\u00a0million years ago. However, mountain building in the area did not begin until the Miocene, approximately 10\u00a0million years ago. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is southwest of Gamma Peak, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene. Gamma Peak is composed of Quaternary andesite of the volcanic lava flows from Glacier Peak.\nThroughout the ice age, the North Cascades were mostly covered in thick glaciers, extending to near Puget Sound. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately 18,000 years ago, and most valleys were ice-free by 12,000 years ago. As a result, valleys in the area are deep and U-shaped, and mountains tend to be rocky, with steep slopes and narrow summits.\nClimate\nGamma Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originating in the Pacific Ocean travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) or above 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C).\nSee also\nGeography of the North Cascades\nGeology of the Pacific Northwest\n",

A US-made GBU-39 small-diameter bomb, manufactured by Boeing, was used in the attack. Several dozen were outside at the time of the attack, spectating a soccer game being played in a courtyard. According to a witness, a warplane flew overhead and fired a missile at young men sitting at an internet cafe, after which \"it was screams and body parts everywhere\". At least 19 deceased Palestinians from the airstrike were brought to nearby Nasser Hospital, in addition to 53 injured Palestinians. Weapons experts identified fragments from the strike as the 250-pound U.S.-made GBU-39 bombs. Workers at the hospital expected the number of dead to increase. The death toll had risen to 31 by the next day.\nReactions\nHamas condemned the massacre and said in a statement: \u201cThe bombing of the school is an Israeli insistence on the war of extermination, and confirmation of the occupation\u2019s continuation of the crimes of murder, without regard to the consequences of its crimes or the laws and treaties that were established to protect civilians in wars.\u201d It further called upon \u201cthe Arab peoples and those it called the peoples of the free world to move in support of the Palestinian people, and it also called on the people of the West Bank to activate all tools of support to engage with Israel.\u201d Hamas also called for \u201crage marches in all cities of the world to condemn the massacres and to demand an end to the ongoing war in the besieged Gaza strip\".\nThe Israeli Ministry of Defense claimed that the attack used \"precision weapons\" to target an area near the school where a Hamas fighter who took part in the October 7 attacks on Israel. The ministry stated that it was investigating reports that Palestinian civilians were harmed in the attack.\nEuropean Union Chief of Foreign Policy Josep Borrell strongly condemned the attack, lamenting the cost of the war to innocent civilians while calling for an immediate ceasefire agreement to free the reminding hostages and provide sufficient humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Borrell stated, \"We condemn any violation of international law: those responsible must be held accountable.\"\nSee also\nAl-Sardi school attack\nShadia Abu Ghazala School massacre\nAl-Fakhoora school airstrikes\nAttacks on schools during the Israeli invasion of Gaza\n",

    "American actor\nScott Jarvis (9 April 1941 \u2013 26 February 1990) was an American actor of stage and screen. He was mainly active as a musical theatre actor from the mid 1960s into the late 1980s. He is best remembered for creating the role of the Courier in the original Broadway production of Sherman Edwards and Peter Stone's musical 1776 in which he was critically acclaimed for his performance of the song \"Momma Look Sharp\".\nEarly life and education\nScott Jarvis was born with the name Ralph Jerome Jarvis in Ohio on 9 April 1941. He grew up in Parma, Ohio. He was the son of Walter C Jarvis and Alma A Arent. He graduated from Parma Senior High School in 1959.

He is describing himself as a soldier who is shot by the British up in New England and how he hears his mother coming towards him as he lays dying in the grass. Jarvis was more than moving.\"\nIn celebration of Presidents' Day in February 1969, 1776 was performed at the White House for Richard Nixon. Due to anti-war material in the play, White House officials requested that a portions of Jarvis's role be cut for its White House presentation; specifically the part where the Courier delivers an anti-American Revolutionary war petition. In an interview in the Anderson Herald Bulletin Jarvis stated he was angered by the request because he was a \"member of the Vietnam Moratorium\".\n1776 debuted on Broadway on March 16, 1969, at the 46th Street Theatre (now the Richard Rodgers Theatre). Originally the musical was presented with no intermission, but later Jarvis's song \"Momma Look Sharp\" became the emotional climax ending to Act 1. Theatre historian Gerald Bordman  described it as the \"most poignant moment\" in the production. Jarvis sang the song at the 23rd Tony Awards. which was broadcast  nationally on NBC on April 20, 1969. He later performed the song on The Great American Dream Machine in 1972 while in the national tour of 1776.\nLater career\nIn 1971 Jarvis starred in the original Off-Broadway musical revue Leaves of Grass at Theater Four on W. 55th St. Based on poems by Walt Whitman. His songs in the production included \"There Is That in Me\", \"Do You Suppose\", \"Twenty-Eight Men\", and \"Dirge For Two Veterans\". He later performed the role of Jerry/Daphne in the original 1972-1973 Broadway production of Jule Styne and  Bob Merrill's Sugar; taking over the part from Robert Morse for part of its run while working as a Standby. He later performed the role of Jerry/Daphne at the Casa Ma\u00f1ana Theatre in Dallas in 1974 with tenor Joseph Evans as Joe/\"Josephine\". He also performed the role of Jesus in Godspell at that theatre in 1974, and that same year starred in a production of the musical revue Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris at the Sombrero Playhouse in Phoenix, Arizona.\nIn 1975 Jarvis starred as Mordred in Lerner and Loewe's Camelot at the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. That same year he returned to Casa Ma\u00f1ana to perform the role of \nWarren Smith in On a Clear Day You Can See Forever. In 1976 he starred in a production of Leonard Bernstein's Wonderful Town at the Music Circus in New Jersey. With the actors Jennifer Darling and Sam Weisman, he starred in the cabaret show Chapin in Los Angeles in 1977; a show which was centered around the music of Harry Chapin.\nIn 1986 he starred as Jacquot in the Goodspeed Musicals production of Carnival!. In 1988 he portrayed Manfred in Sweet Charity at the Birmingham Theatre in Michigan. In 1989 he portrayed Ludlow Lowell in Pal Joey at the theatre of The Claridge Hotel in Atlantic City with Clint Holmes in the title role. He had previously starred at this latter theatre as Chip Salisbury in the Kander and Ebb musical Woman of the Year in 1987.\nOn television, Jarvis appeared as a guest actor in episodes of Starsky and Hutch, The Young and the Restless, and The Edge of Night.\nDeath\nScott Jarvis died of AIDS at his home in New York City on 26 February 1990 at the age of 48.\nFurther Reading\nThere is a biographical profile of Jarvis in the March 1972 issue of After Dark.\n",
    "Ukrainian politician\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is  Petrovych and the family name is  Kaida.\nOleksii Petrovych Kaida (Ukrainian: \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0301\u0456\u0439 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u0301; born 27 February 1971) is a Ukrainian politician from Svoboda who served as a People's Deputy of Ukraine from Ukraine's 163rd electoral district from 2012 to 2014. Prior to his election, he was Chairman of the Ternopil Oblast Council from 2009 to 2012.\nEarly life and career\nOleksii Petrovych Kaida was born on 27 February 1971 in the city of Berdiansk in southeastern Ukraine. Following his graduation from school in 1988 he began working at a shoe factory. He helped to organise the People's Movement of Ukraine and the Taras Shevchenko Society for the Ukrainian Language\u00a0 in Berdiansk, as well as the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. From 1989 to 1994 he studied at Lviv Polytechnic, graduating with a specialisation in system engineering. He joined the Social-National Party of Ukraine in 1994.\nPolitical career\nKaida first attempted to join the Verkhovna Rada (parliament of Ukraine) during the 1998 election, as part of the Less Words\u00a0 bloc's proportional representation list. He was not elected. He was a parliamentary aide to Oleh Tyahnybok, who was elected from Less Words and later from the Our Ukraine Bloc, from 1999 to 2006.\nKaida was elected to the Lviv Oblast Council during the 2006 Ukrainian local elections. He partook in the 2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election on the proportional representation list of the Svoboda party, although he was not elected, and he continued to serve in the Lviv Oblast Council until 2009, when he was elected to the Ternopil Oblast Council. He was selected as the council's chairman, and continued to hold the office until 2012.\nPeople's Deputy of Ukraine\nKaida again ran to become a People's Deputy of Ukraine during the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election, running in Ukraine's 163rd electoral district in the city of Ternopil. He was successfully elected with 56.65% of the vote, defeating lieutenant general of the Militsiya and Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform candidate Vitalii Maksymov\u00a0, who gathered 15.18%. He was deputy leader of Svoboda in the 7th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada.\nAlong with mayor of Ternopil Serhiy Nadal, Kaida visited Pope Benedict XVI in May 2011. The two were permitted a private audience with the Pope, during which they asked him to give blessings to Svoboda in their efforts to increase spirituality in Ternopil Oblast.\nKaida ran for re-election in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, again running in the 163rd electoral district. He was defeated after gathering only 23% of the vote, as part of a broader societal reaction against Svoboda due to a decrease in political polarisation.\nLater political career\nKaida has attempted on multiple occasions to make a comeback following his electoral defeat. In 2015, he was appointed deputy mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk for land and architectural issues, and he unsuccessfully sought election to the Kyiv City Council. He again ran in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election as the 17th candidate on the proportional representation list of Svoboda.\nKaida was briefly detained on 12 December 2019 after getting into a fight with incumbent People's Deputy Andriy Bohdanets in the Verkhovna Rada building. Kaida, along with fellow former People's Deputies from Svoboda Eduard Leonov\u00a0 and Ihor Miroshnychenko, punched Bohdanets until he was hospitalised with a concussion. The fight occurred in response to Bohdanets's support for legalising the private sale of land.\nMilitary career\nFollowing his defeat, Kaida was mobilised into the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2015, alongside other former People's Deputies from Svoboda. He fought in the war in Donbas, at various points serving in the Sich Battalion or the Svoboda Legion\u00a0. He was one of seven former People's Deputies from Svoboda to fight in the Sich Battalion. He served for 14 months as an artilleryman before being demobilised.\nAfter the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine Kaida rejoined the Armed Forces and took part in the battle of Kyiv. He later joined the 45th Artillery Brigade\u00a0, and fought in the battles of Kupiansk, Bakhmut, and Lyman. On 25 December 2023, he was awarded the Silver Cross of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine\u00a0 by Valerii Zaluzhnyi.\n",

It was incorporated in 1879 to construct a line from the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad north of Petoskey, Michigan, to Harbor Springs, Michigan, on Little Traverse Bay. The line opened in 1882. The company was sold to the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad and eventually became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad system. The line was abandoned in 1962. The former station in Harbor Springs has been preserved.\nHistory\nThe Bay View, Little Traverse and Mackinaw Railroad was incorporated on April 22, 1879. The company's purpose was to build from the main line of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad around Little Traverse Bay to Harbor Springs, Michigan, a distance of approximately 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km). Although the officers and board of directors included a number of local men from Harbor Springs, the company owned no rolling stock of its own and the Grand Rapids and Indiana exercised control from the outset.\nConstruction of the line began on June 24, 1881. The junction point on the Grand Rapids and Indiana line was at \"Kegomic,\" near Bay View. The line, 5.8 miles (9.3\u00a0km), opened on February 1, 1882. The Bay View, Little Traverse and Mackinaw Railroad was sold to the Grand Rapids and Indiana on January 17, 1888. The Grand Rapids and Indiana extended the line, now called the Harbor Springs branch, a further 0.5 miles (0.80\u00a0km) north in 1901; this extension was abandoned between 1904 and 1913. The Pennsylvania Railroad, successor to the GR&I, abandoned the branch in 1962. former station in Harbor Springs, completed in 1889 after the formal acquisition by the GR&I, has been preserved.\nNotes\n^ Other sources give May 2, 1879, which is the date the articles of incorporation were filed with the Secretary of State.\nFootnotes\n^ a b Meints (1992), p.\u00a041.\n^ a b ICC (1929), p.\u00a0724.\n^ Coverdale & Colpitts (1946), p.\u00a0342.\n^ Michigan Railroad Commission (1883), p.\u00a014.\n^ a b Coverdale & Colpitts (1946), p.\u00a0343.\n^ Meints (2005), p.\u00a0186.\n^ Diane Bell; Carmen Ludy (July 12, 2000), NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES REGISTRATION FORM: Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad Harbor Springs Depot\n",
    "Sikh cartoon series\nSikh Park is a Sikh cartoon series that is a spoof of South Park. The cartoon has been described as mixing the \"cute\" and \"simple\" appearance of South Park with a unique version of Sikh humour.\nHistory\nDalbir Singh was a graduate of Calcutta University and worked as the creative director of Ogilvy & Mather whilst he resided in Budapest, Hungary. As a child, Dalbir often drew cartoons, some of his political cartoons made their way into local Indian newspapers. Dalbir recalls that growing-up as a child in India, there was little else to do other than cricket, so him and his friends passed time by reading cartoons, books, and creating artwork.\nDalbir Singh invented \"Sikh Park\", based on the popular cartoon South Park, to transgress prevailing stereotypes on Sikhs. Dalbir Singh had never actually watched an episode of South Park before creating Sikh Park as he had been living in non-English speaking countries for around a decade, where the show was not popular, around the time he created Sikh Park. There had already been a Sikh comic at that time called Sikh Toons but it was geared toward political content and Dalbir wanted to make a cartoon that covered everyday humour that was plain, simple, and relatable.\nThe cartoon originated from the website sikhchic.com, after it opened up a section dedicated to humour. The early running of the cartoon series was also published on MySpace. Whilst residing in Canada, Dalbir was friends with sikhchic.com's creator, Tapishar Sher Singh. Sikhchic.com is a website dedicated to Sikh art and culture, Dalbir was helping with the design of the website. Dalbir came up with the idea of adding a humour section to the website, similar to traditional newspapers. Originally planning on naming the cartoon Karol Bagh, it was ultimately decided against because Westerners may not understand the meaning of that name. Then they thought of naming the cartoon Karol Park, ultimately deciding upon Sikh Park.\nDalbir was inspired to create the comic after Sikhs began facing attacks and discrimination in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, to show that Sikhs are normal, progressive, fun, and witty. Dalbir wanted to combat the prevailing sardar ji type jokes that are commonly circulated to show that more positive jokes involving Sikhs are possible. Dalbir had been dismayed by the popular perception of Sikhs, whom were joked about in magazines, websites, and even Bollywood films. The initial feedback from the community to the comic was positive. Initially, the cartoon heavily imitated South Park but it began to form its own unique style overtime as its popularity increased, due to conscious efforts by its creator. Dalbir claims he comes-up with the ideas for its content on his own but admits as of late it is difficult to think of new ideas. Dalbir works in the advertising business full-time, so there have been periods where Sikh Park has not been updated with new content for periods as long as 6\u20137 months. Dalbir states that it is difficult to return to making new comics for Sikh Park after long intervals. Dalbir admits that the comic series has been slow to grow, which he attributes to the difficulty he has with remaining active online constantly. Sikh Park has collaborated with musicians and artistes.\nWhilst the cartoon was created with the intentions that is was to be enjoyed by diasporic Sikhs and NRI Sikhs, many Desis from different backgrounds enjoy it. After Dalbir moved to India, he Indianized Sikh Park so it could be more relatable to actual Indians living in India.\nIn 2015, Dalbir expressed hopes that he wishes Sikh Park can become an animated show someday but that it would require funds. He has expressed openness to bringing in other editors, such as writers and animators, for the cartoon. Presently, the comic series is only present on social media channels. The Facebook page of Sikh Park has over 30,000 followers whilst its Instagram page has over 16,000 followers.\nIn 2022, Dalbir was approached by a political party based in Punjab, India to run a series on covering the party's 2022 assembly election campaign in Punjab, but Dalbir refused to intertwine his artistic creation with politics. He also does not Sikh Park to become commercialized and prefers that it remain powered by passion instead. When Dalbir went to a Comic Con convention, many people queried him on why he never released any Sikh Park-themed merchandise but it was not something Dalbir had in-mind. Recently, Dalbir delved into NFTs.\nIn July 2022, Dalbir stated that he has dreams of producing Sikh Park as a web series with real people, perhaps through Netflix. However, his career occupies much of his time and nothing of the like has transpired yet.\nStyle and themes\nThe cartoon is described as \"colourful, quirky, and lighthearted\". It does not halt itself from taking \"gleeful digs\" at perceived idiosyncrasies within the Sikh community. Many of the jokes in Sikh Park are about turbans. A common theme in",

    "\nSchool\nNir Kiryat Arba Yeshiva is a religious Zionist hesder yeshiva located in Kiryat Arba.\nHistory of the Yeshiva\nThe yeshiva was established after the Six-Day War, in 1968, by Rabbi Eliezer Waldman and Rabbi Moshe Levinger. Its original location was in the military government building in Hebron, making it the first religious institution established in the Hebron Hills in this generation. Later, with the beginning of settlement in Kiryat Arba in the early 1970s, the yeshiva was reestablished in its current form. In December 1979, the yeshiva building was inaugurated in the presence of Prime Minister Menachem Begin. The yeshiva building was designed by architect David Cassuto.\nIn its first year, Rabbi Yehoshua Rosen headed the yeshiva, and he was later succeeded by Rabbi Waldman. In 1976, Rabbi Dov Lior was appointed the rabbi of Kiryat Arba and began delivering lectures at the yeshiva. From then until 2012, Rabbis Dov Lior and Eliezer Waldman jointly served as the heads of the yeshiva; Rabbi Lior focused on teaching Talmud and Halacha, while Rabbi Waldman concentrated on faith studies according to the teachings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook.\nIn 2012, Rabbi Eliezer Waldman decided to retire from his position as head of the yeshiva and appointed his son, Rabbi Noam Waldman, as his successor. However, he continued teaching and served as the yeshiva's president until his passing in 2022. Following Rabbi Dov Lior's departure from Kiryat Arba in 2015, he also ceased his active role as head of the yeshiva.\nOver the years, the yeshiva lost 22 of its students, including those killed in the 1980 terror attack near \"Beit Hadassah\" (in their memory, the settlement of Beit Hagai was established, and a memorial book named \"Sefer Hagai\" was published), as well as students who died in the Lebanon War.\nDuring the evacuation of Yamit, the yeshiva relocated to a yeshiva operating in Yamit as a protest against the evacuation. In 2005, most of the yeshiva students, along with Rabbi Eliezer Waldman, moved to the settlement of Sa-Nur in northern Samaria to strengthen the settlement and attempt to prevent the Disengagement Plan. The yeshiva rabbis ruled that soldiers should refuse orders to evacuate the settlements.\nIn the third decade of the 21st century, Rabbi Noam Waldman heads the yeshiva, which has about 100 students and avrechim.\nAcademic programs at the Yeshiva\nThe yeshiva is closely affiliated with the \"Merkaz Harav\" stream. The yeshiva heads and many of its rabbis are graduates of Merkaz Harav Yeshiva and students of its heads, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook and Rabbi Avraham Shapira, who are referred to on the yeshiva's website as \"Morenu VeRabenu\" (Our teacher and our rabbi). The yeshiva especially emphasizes the study of Rabbi Kook's teachings according to his son Rabbi Zvi Yehuda's approach and includes a certain Hasidic element led by Rabbi David Potash.\nMost yeshiva students serve in the IDF within the framework of the \"hesder\" program. The yeshiva also offers a high-level yeshiva program and a Halacha kollel, preparing its students for the rabbinical ordination exams of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, led by Rabbi Shalom Iluz, author of \"Halacha Shlema.\"\nThe yeshiva operates a branch of Herzog College for teacher training.\nYeshiva Rabbis\nThe names of the ramim (teachers of Talmud) and faith instructors at the yeshiva are:\nRabbi Noam Waldman - Head of the Yeshiva\nRabbi Chaim Yerucham Smotrich (father of Bezalel Smotrich) - Ram of advanced classes\nRabbi Shalom Iluz - Head of the Halacha kollel\nRabbi David Pots - Faith instructor\nRabbi Abraham Isaac Schwartz - Rabbi of Kiryat Arba (son of Rabbi Chaim Avihu Schwartz) - Ram of second-year class\nRabbi Itamar Leshem (son-in-law of Rabbi Chaim Steiner) - Ram of military graduates\nRabbi Michael Hanuna (graduate of the yeshiva) - Ram of first-year class\nRabbi Yosef Tzairi - Ram of proficiency studies\nRabbis Dov Lior and Eliezer Waldman served as heads of the yeshiva.\nFormer teachers include: Rabbi Nissan Zakash, Rabbi Michael Hershkovitz, Rabbi Yoezer Ariel, Rabbi Moshe Boimel, Rabbi Yaakov Sharabi (son of Rabbi Saadia Sharabi), Rabbi Shalom Litov, Rabbi Mordechai Sternberg, Rabbi Hillel Horowitz, Rabbi David Samson, Rabbi Chananel Etrog, and Rabbi Yosef Carmel.\nSettlement groups\nThe yeshiva is characterized by a significant emphasis on practical action for the Land of Israel. It has become one of the most prominent institutions advocating practical activities for this cause among all the yeshivot that emerged from the Merkaz Harav school. Many settlement groups originated from the yeshiva, with a significant number of settlements in southern Hebron Hills being established by its students, including Carmel, Maon, Susya, Beit Hagai, and other settlements in the Judean Hills, forming the basis for the settlement of Samaria, which is also filled with alumni founders.\nNotable alumni\nRabbi Eitam Henkin - Rabbi, Torah scholar, and historian\nZe'ev Hever (Zambish) - Secretary General of Aman",
    "Hospital in Rabat, Malta\nThe Santo Spirito Hospital (Maltese: L-Isptar ta' Santu Spirtu, English: Holy Spirit Hospital), originally known as the St. Francis Hospital, is a former hospital in Rabat, Malta which functioned from at least the 14th century to 1967. Since 1994, the hospital building has housed the head office of the National Archives of Malta.\nHistory\nThe Santo Spirito Hospital was established during the late medieval period as the St. Francis Hospital (Latin: hospitalis Sanctj Franciscj, Italian: Ospedale San Francesco) in the suburb of Rabat, located outside the walls of Mdina, then the principal settlement on Malta. It is the earliest known hospital in Malta, and it has been claimed to be one of the oldest hospitals in Europe or the world.\nThe St. Francis Hospital might have been established as early as 1299, and a register held at the Vatican Apostolic Archive suggests that it already functioned during the reign of King Frederick the Simple of Sicily in the second half of the 14th century. The earliest known undisputed record of the hospital's administration is a document dated 4 December 1372 held at the Archivio di Stato di Palermo\u00a0.\nThe hospital was named after Saint Francis of Assisi and it was run by the Franciscans who had an adjacent monastery. Some later sources claim that it functioned as a leprosarium, but there is no contemporary proof of this. In the beginning of the 15th century, the Franciscans' administration of the hospital was being criticised, and in 1403 King Martin instructed the Universit\u00e0 \u2013 the local authority based in Mdina \u2013 to inquire into the financial management of the hospital.\nIn 1433, King Alfonso ordered the Universit\u00e0 to run and maintain the hospital, while recognising the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Malta over it. On 6 May 1467, the Universit\u00e0 sought to affiliate the hospital with the Santo Spirito hospital in Rome, and by 1474 the St. Francis Hospital had been renamed as the hospitalis Sancti Spiritus Rabbati. A major rebuilding project was carried out between 30 July 1494 and May 1496. During the early 16th century, the building was possibly damaged during corsair raids. In May 1544, the hospital's chapel was repurposed as a dormitory, and it was still being used as such during a visit by Pietro Dusina in 1575.\nLa ruota degli esposti, a baby hatch for unwanted babies along the fa\u00e7ade of the Santo Spirito Hospital\nSick patients treated at the hospital included both local residents and foreign visitors or captives. From the mid-15th to the mid-16th centuries, the hospital also housed poor or old people who were not capable of caring for themselves. It also functioned as a foundling hospital where abandoned children were cared for, with wet nurses being employed at the hospital from 1518. A baby hatch known as the ruota degli esposti where unwanted babies could be left to be cared for by the hospital is still in existence along the hospital's fa\u00e7ade. 15th and 16th century records from the hospital are preserved at the Mdina Cathedral Museum, and they are a primary source about late medieval and early modern Malta.\nDuring the period of Hospitaller rule between the 16th and 18th centuries, the hospital was run by the Grand Masters of the Order of St. John. The building was restored during the 17th century, and in 1688 its church (also dedicated to the Holy Spirit) was reconstructed under the auspices of Grand Master Gregorio Carafa. The hospital was enlarged during the magistracy of Ant\u00f3nio Manoel de Vilhena during the 18th century. Several 17th and 18th-century Latin inscriptions are or were present in the building, including some referring to Hospitaller Grand Masters Alof de Wignacourt, Antoine de Paule, Martin de Redin, Carafa and Vilhena.\nThe building was being used as a convalescence hospital by 1883, and it continued to function as a hospital until 1967. The building was subsequently left in a derelict state for a number of years, until efforts to repurpose it were made in the 1980s with various possible uses being considered, including a conversion to a medical museum or an old people's home.\nRestoration works commenced in 1986, and the following year the government allocated the building to the National Archives of Malta. Part of the archive was transferred from the Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta to the former hospital by 28 July 1989, and the building was officially opened by President Ugo Mifsud Bonnici on 28 May 1994. A pharmacy within the building was restored in 2009.\nCalls to move the archives from Santo Spirito to a purpose-built building were made in the mid-2000s and 2010s. In 2019, the government made plans to construct a new archive building in Ta' Qali and repurpose the former hospital into a medical museum, but the plans fell through. As of 2024, the head office of the National Archives is still housed at Santo Spirito.\n",

There, Fesl's parents ran an inn, Zum Bayerischen. In his childhood, Fesl was, according to the story, once expelled from a school for replying to a box on the ear from a teacher by boxing the teacher's ear back. Further academic endeavours, though, were somewhat more successful. After finishing at the Volksschule, he passed the intake examination for the Oberrealschule in Ingolstadt (now called the Christoph-Scheiner-Gymnasium), where he lived at boarding school. In 1959, the family moved to Munich, where Fesl learnt from his father how to play the trumpet\u00a0\u2014 this after his earlier failed attempts in Greding to teach his son to play the clarinet and the accordion. Fesl was, in both 1966 and 1967 the Upper Bavarian Junior Champion Weightlifter for the club ESV M\u00fcnchen Ost, to which he had belonged since 1962. Fesl did an apprenticeship as an artist blacksmith. He learnt to play guitar while he was in the Bundeswehr, where he also became the joker in the background in his outfit, the Gebirgsj\u00e4gertruppe (\"Mountain Infantry\"), which somewhat irked his superiors.\nCareer\nAfter Fesl had tried his hand at various occupations (by his own word, he worked as a furrier, a film set builder, an extra, a locksmith, a fashion jewellery seller, a bulky-waste collector, an antique dealer and a beer lorry driver), he wanted to establish himself as an artist blacksmith, setting himself up a workshop in Freising. According to Fesl himself, his career as a musician began when he found that he could get into cabaret theatres (\"Kleinkunstb\u00fchnen\") in Munich free if he showed up with a guitar and told the staff that he was one of the musicians who were to appear. One evening, when the actual artistes failed to show up, Fesl was asked to get up on the stage himself and perform. With his funny, chatty manner, he quickly won the audience's favour. In 1976, at the Theater im Fraunhofer in Munich, he made his first record, entitled simply Fredl Fesl. After its release, he got his own television programme, Fredl und seine G\u00e4ste (\"Fredl and his Guests\").\nOne of Fesl's trademarks in his live appearances was the detailed speeches that he gave before each number, which by his own admission were sometimes longer than the songs themselves. He ended his concerts by doing a handstand on the chair on which he had been sitting and playing his songs. Fesl was often associated with the song \"Der K\u00f6nigsjodler\" (\"The King's Yodeller\"), which he had earlier regularly performed. Other well known songs in Fesl's repertoire were \"Der edle Rittersepp\", \"Anlass-Jodler\", the \"Taxilied\" and the \"Fu\u00dfball-Lied\". In the media, he was sometimes called \"Bajubarde\" (\"Bayou Bard\") or \"Bayerns bester Barde\" (\"Bavaria's Best Bard\").\nFor a few years, Fesl could regularly be heard in radio advertisements for the beer brand Veldensteiner. In 2008, there was a civil court case arising from the mention of J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann in one advertisement, which the brewer, Kaiser Br\u00e4u, lost. Klinsmann's actual complaint was that the Denglisch word \"clean\" was being used in the advertisement to refer to the first syllable in his last name. The presiding judge in the case stressed that it was \"certainly not the worst case of violating personal rights, but name rights have been fundamentally violated.\" The offending beer commercial was banned, as well. Fesl had this to say about the proceedings: \"There are worse things, mushy Semmelkn\u00f6del for instance.\"\nLater years\nBeginning in 1997, Fesl found that he was suffering from Parkinson's disease and thus in late 2006, he had to cut his well attended farewell tour short. In 2009, to alleviate his Parkinson's symptoms, he had a \"brain pacemaker\" surgically implanted. His life with this illness was documented within the framework of the ZDF series 37\u00b0. In 2015, his autobiography \"Ohne Gaudi is ois nix\" came out. The book contained memories from Fesl himself, along with some from companions such as Zither-Man\u00e4, Mike Kr\u00fcger, Konstantin Wecker, Hans Well, Willy Astor and Martina Schwarzmann.\nFesl was also an inventor of sorts. Later in life, he came up with something called the Schunkelhilfe (roughly, \"sway helper\"), a modified, concave chair seat that was designed to make it easier for the sitter to sway back and forth in time to music. Fellow Kabarett artist Claudia Pichler called it Fesl's \"possibly most pointless invention\". Fesl explained his thinking thus:\nEs gibt Heerscharen von Ingenieuren, die sich \u00fcberlegen, was die Leute noch alles brauchen k\u00f6nnten. Da ist es schwierig, einen Fu\u00df in die T\u00fcr zu kriegen. Auf dem Sektor \u201eWas der Mensch ganz dringend \u00fcberhaupt nicht braucht\u201c",
    "Norwegian priest\nFor the cleric born in 1656, see Hans Povelsson Paus.\nSir Hans Povelsson Paus the Elder (1587 \u2013 1648) was a Norwegian priest.\nBiography\nHe grew up in Oslo together with his brother, fellow priest Peder Povelsson Paus (b. 1590); the brothers have long been known as the earliest certain ancestors of the Paus family. The fact that both brothers received the best and most costly education available in Denmark-Norway and their apparent social connections to powerful men in Oslo/Eastern Norway show that they clearly belonged to the elite of 16th century Oslo. According to S. H. Finne-Gr\u00f8nn, the brothers were almost certainly the sons of burgher of Oslo Povel Hansson (born ca. 1545\u201350), a son of canon at St Mary's Church Hans Olufsson (died 1570), who held personal noble rank.\nHe became a student at the University of Copenhagen around 1607\u201308 under the name Johannes Paulli Asloensis. Returning as a tutor at the Oslo Cathedral School, he was chosen as the first singer by Bishop Niels Clauss\u00f8n Senning on 11 May 1609. Like his younger brother, he sang alto. In 1616, he earned his bachelor's degree in Copenhagen and became the head tutor at the Oslo Cathedral School. Shortly after, he was appointed chaplain at Oslo Cathedral. In late 1622, he was elected parish priest in Fredrikstad, succeeding Anders Flor, and took his office oath before the bishop on 22 January 1623. Hans Paus was married twice; S. H. Finne-Gr\u00f8nn suggested in two articles in Norsk Personalhistorisk Tidsskrift in 1910 that his first wife was \"most likely\" the daughter of Oslo mayor Anders Nilss\u00f8n (brother of Bishop Jens Nilss\u00f8n), but later modified this in his book Slekten Paus . Hans Paus's second marriage was to Ingeborg Lemmich (died 1696), daughter of Hans Henningsen Lemmich. Ingeborg had been previously married to the wealthy Fredrikstad merchant Oluf Holck, bringing a substantial fortune with her.\nHans was the father of, among others, Povel Hansson Paus (1620\u20131658), who, after studying at the University of Franeker, earned his magister's degree at the University of Copenhagen in 1649 and, in 1655, parish priest in Lier, Bragernes, and Str\u00f8ms\u00f8; and Anders Hansson Paus (1622\u20131689), who, like his brother, studied at the University of Franeker and from 1663 was the parish priest in Jevnaker. Povel Hansson Paus participated in the homage to Prince Christian in 1656 and the estates meeting in 1657 as a representative of the clergy in the Oslo diocese. From Anders Hansson Paus, there is an academic oration printed in Greek at the University of Franeker in 1644, where he lists chancellor Jens Bjelke, Bjelke's son-in-law Daniel Ottesen Bildt of Hafslund, Admiral Sten Willumsen Rosenvinge of Tose, and Bishop Oluf Boesen as patrons of his father who funded his education. It is dedicated to these four as well as to his father. \"The text ends with a Latin verse praising the speaker by the contemporary Hungarian student Nicolaus Szoboszlai, who proudly states that Paus's honor will resound as long as the world stands,\" writes Finne-Gr\u00f8nn. Anders Hansson Paus was, among other things, the grandfather of timber merchant and sawmill owner in Ringerike, Anders Hansen Paus (1691\u20131745), who was first married to Annichen Larsdatter Thue (1695\u20131740), daughter of Christiania merchant Lars Thue, and later to Barbara Sophie Akeleye. His daughter from his first marriage, Karen Paus (born 1721), was married to Andreas Jensen Stoltenberg (1724\u20131751).\nNotes\n^ Although the family name Paus is attested in his lifetime, he usually omitted it in everyday use in accordance with the custom of the time, and was often known by his given name and patronymic; the exact spelling of both names could vary, both in Latinized and Norwegian versions. In formal documents his name would typically be rendered in Latin, e.g. as Johannes Paulli Asloensis  in the records of the University of Copenhagen. As a member of the clergy, one of the two privileged estates, he was styled as herr in Norwegian or Dominus in Latin, conventionally rendered as Sir as an ecclesiastical title in English; the Norwegian style herr was (until the 19th century) reserved for members of the clergy and the nobility; its predecessor sira (sir) had been introduced as the style for clergymen in Norway in the 13th century and gradually been replaced by the Norwegianized version herr from the 15th century.\n",
    "Sole naval training base of the Israeli Navy\nBHD 600 or Haifa naval training base is the sole naval training base of the Israeli Navy. It is located in the port city of Haifa and is responsible for the training of most of Israeli Navy personnel.\nRoles\nThe base is responsible for the training of all Israeli Navy personnel except Shayetet 13 and YILTAM fighters. All Shayetet 3, Shayetet 7 and regular personnel are trained here in addition to supplementary training for commanders. UAV and UUV operators are also trained here. In addition to training, regular military exercises are also held here.\nOrganisation\nTraining group - trains the instructors, the course commanders in building courses and improving them.\nSimulator Fleet - unites under it the simulator training course and the regular training in the various simulators in the fields of Shayetet 7 and Shayetet 3 and Naval intelligence\nTash Kashrut squadron - training for recruiters, command and controls.\nStil Kashrut squadron - For specialisation in secondary services.\nCoastal Technical Training Squadron - Training in small arms and electronic equipments.\nSchool for officers - a school for conscripts and military officer training.\nSubmarine training squadron - Training for Shayetet 7 personnel.\nThe Naval Command School - training for ship commanders.\nTzur-Yam - a high school specializing in technological expertise.\nHistory\nEstablishment\nThe base was established in 1965 and training missions were initiated in 1967 after the arrival of new ships from Cherbourg after the Cherbourg Project. These vessels were initially used for training purpose.\nYom Kippur War\nIn the 1960s, limited facilities at the training base prompted Israeli Navy to hold drills in Malta as Naval Combat exercises couldn't be held at the training base. With the passage of time, the facilities were gradually improved and helped to strengthen up the Israeli Navy before the Yom Kippur War.\nEvacuation attempts\nAt the end of the 1990s, the Haifa Administration wanted to promote a plan for the construction of a marina in Bat Galim . Environmental activists opposed the plan, which included drying up an extensive sea area, for the purpose of construction that would finance the construction of the marina. The Society for the Protection of Nature proposed an alternative plan that included the evacuation of the base and the construction of a marina in the area opposite to it, which was not accessible to the public. In January 2003, the Israel Land Administration also presented a plan for the development of Bat Galim that included the evacuation of the base. In May 2008, local authorities approved the construction of a neighborhood of 1,000 housing units in the base area. However, the plan did not go into effect, as the Ministry of Defense refused to sign an agreement to evacuate the base. In 2015, the plan was transferred to the National Committee for the Planning and Construction of Preferred Housing Complexes, with the hope that its rapid advancement would serve as leverage to renew negotiations with the Ministry of Defense, but it did not advance the plan.\nHulda Gurvitz Strip\nAt the end of 2017, it was agreed that the base would vacate only a strip of beach along the seashore, so that for the first time so that a sequence of promenades would be created, in front of the sea from the Mediterranean coast, through the beach of the base, Bat Galim beach to the southern beaches of the Haifa. The construction of the boardwalk began in 2018, most of it was completed, and in August 2020 it was decided to name it after Hulda Gurvitz. however the Navy withdrew from the agreement and refused to allow the construction to be completed.\nCommanders\nSources & References\n^ \"\u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4 \u05de\u05ea\u05e2\u05e7\u05e9\u05ea: \u05e0\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\".

    "Native American painter from Montana, U.S. (1947\u20131998)\nEarl Biss (September 29, 1947 \u2013 October 18, 1998), also called Spotted Horse and The Spirit Who Walks Among His People, was a Native American painter born in Renton, Washington. He was Aps\u00e1alooke and a citizen of the Crow Tribe of Montana.\nA significant Native American fine artist, Biss is known for his colorful oil paintings of Plains Indians and western landscapes. Biss exhibited his artwork widely and has works in the public collections of institutions including the New Mexico Museum of Art, the Missoula Art Museum, and the Gilcrease Museum.\nEarly life\nBiss was born to Earl Biss Sr. and Dorothy Shane and was a child of the Greasy Mouth Burnt Lip Clan. He was a descendent of Crow scout White Man Runs Him. As a young child, Biss split his time between living with his grandmother in Montana on the Crow Indian Reservation and with his father on the Yakama Indian Reservation in Washington.\nAt age eight, Biss fell ill with rheumatic fever. During his convalescence, he began painting and soon showed significant talent in the arts. Elders gave the young artist the Crow name Spotted Horse (Iich\u00edile X\u00e1xxish).\nBiss spent time at both Mount Si High School and Wapato High School. At age sixteen, he began at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA)  along contemporaries T. C. Cannon (Kiowa/Caddo) and Kevin Red Star (Crow_. While there from 1963 to 1965, Biss studied under faculty including Fritz Scholder (La Jolla Luise\u00f1o), Allan Houser (Ft. Sill Apache), Charles Loloma (Hopi), and Paolo Soleri. He was inspired by Abstract expressionism and other Modern art movements to incorporate wider influences into Native art, in turn helping found the Contemporary Southwestern Art movement. Said Red Star, \"Earl was the catalyst, like the agitator in a washing machine.\"\nAfter studying oil painting on scholarship at the San Francisco Art Institute, Biss traveled to Europe to explore art museums and to study printmaking with Stanley William Hayter. Biss also spent six months painting on Corfu in Greece. Biss said, \"I believe my work was most influenced by the works of the European masters: the violent translucent skies of  Turner, the impressionistic brush work of Monet, illusive suggestiveness of Whistlerlandscapes.\" Other influences included Edvard Munch, Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning.\nCareer\nBiss had his first solo exhibition in 1972, which sold out and earned him enough money to travel and learn.  He quickly became well known as a master oil painter in his own right, and his work was exhibited across the globe.\nBiss moved often, setting up studios in places like Santa Fe, San Francisco, Red Lodge, and Colorado. He was a prolific artist who created thousands of works in his lifetime. Biss often worked in days-long painting sessions in which he would create under the influence of alcohol and other substances. He prided himself on his technique, once saying, \"Ninety-nine percent of the artists in the United States don't really know oil painting and if an artist doesn't paint in oils then he isn't a real artist.\"\nAfter years of artwork honoring his Aps\u00e1alooke heritage, Biss earned the name The Spirit Who Walks Among His People (Il\u00e1axe Baah\u00e9eleen D\u00edilish).\nPersonal life\nOf Biss, his colleague Presley LaFountain said, \"His passion was Indian people, horses, women and art.\" Biss had numerous relationships and marriages throughout his life.\nIn 1998, Biss died of a stroke while painting in his studio in Sante Fe, New Mexico. He is interred at the Crow Agency Cemetery in Crow Agency, Montana.\nLegacy\nIn 2021, Biss was the subject of a documentary film Earl Biss: The Spirit Who Walks Among His People.\n",

    "Werner Schnelle  Image by Bea Schnelle\nWerner Schnelle (born 1942 in Vienna) is an Austrian photographer.\nBiography\nWerner Schnelle was born in Vienna in 1942, and has lived and worked in Salzburg since 1965. A freelance photographer since 1987, his artistic work is primarily concerned with various special photographic techniques such as the instant camera, the photo-, chemi- and lumigram, camera- and negative-less photography and in-camera negatives. He has also worked with large Polaroid images. Schnelle's works are mainly created in the studio and deal with the process of photography itself in a media-reflexive manner and often \"unique photographic pieces\" are the result of his artistic work.\nThe central elements in the work of Schnelle, whose \"abstract works occupy a singular  position within Austria\", are always the medium of photography itself, the properties of light and space and of movement and time, and the traces that objects leave in the image under the influence of the processes inherent in photography.\nSchnelle's approach to photography is deliberately analog, thereby tying it to the origins of the medium, and refers to an appropriation of the world that only exists in analog photography in this way. Analog photography provides an \"authenticity\" - for example through not being able change the in-camera negatives after the shooting process - but also a \"persistent tension\" through coincidences and experiments that the chemical processes make possible.\nKurt Kaindl locates the interests of Schnelle's photography in the \"explorations of the instrumental, chemical and optical foundations of photography  the basic interest in pictures and their esthetic and poetic qualities, which find their validation only in the viewer\".\nMargit Zuckriegl, who has curated several exhibitions of Schnelle's work and written texts accompanying his publications, says of Schnelle's photography: \"Werner Schnelle's photographs always reflect the conceptual approach of his work.

    "Catholic charity organization based in Estonia\nCaritas Estonia (in Estonian: Caritas Eesti) is a non-profit association in Estonia. \nIt is affiliated with the Catholic Church in Estonia and part of the Caritas Internationalis confederation and the regional Caritas Europa.\nHistory\nAfter the restoration of independence of Estonia in 1991, a large number of vulnreable people were in support of assistance. Staring in 1992, Caritas Germany sent packages for humanitarian aid. A local Tartu Caritas was founded to distribute this aid. In 1996 activist and politician Lagle Parek set up the national Caritas Estonia, which was not formally registered as an NGO until 26 March 1997 The initial name was Eesti Caritas, this was changed to Caritas Eesti in 2003.\nAmong the first activities was the distribution of clothes and food to children from families in difficulty and without family support. Soon afterwards, the first day centres were established, named \"Caritas Kinderstubed\". They provided food, education and other care to vulnerable children. The Caritas Kinderstubed started operating in Narva, Ahtme and Tartu in 1997.\nAfter this, integration projects for children and young people were set up, bringing together children and young people who speak Estonian and other languages (mainly Russian) as their mother tongue, in different ways, for common discussions and common goals.\n1997 also saw the birth of Caritas' long-running project, the \"Estonian Farm Teaches Estonian\" (Eesti talu \u00f5petab eesti keelt), which has seen more than 1,000 children learning the Estonian language, culture and traditions in Estonian farms during school holidays. Between 2000 and 2003, Caritas offered farm holidays and farm education primarily to children from children's homes in Ida-Viru County and to children from families with coping difficulties in Tallinn.\nIn 1998, director Merle Karusoo and young people from Viljandi Culture Academy carried out a project titles \"Who I am\" (Kes ma olen) for 87 Russian-speaking young people, during which the young people searched for their roots and identity under the guidance of the director and with the help of creative techniques. The project resulted in a series of productions that explored the connections between different people and their roots, social and cultural affiliations.\nIn 1999, the project \"Theatre and Dance for Social Change\" (Teater ja tants sotsiaalsete muutuste teenistuses), funded by the Estonian Centre for Contemporary Art and the European Cultural Foundation, was launched to address the problems of children and young people and to find solutions through artistic activities involving actors and dancers in solving the problems of children and young people. In Tallinn, a Caritas youth arts and theatre project was launched, and in Tartu, creative dance classes were held for the children of the Kinderstube project.\nIn 1999, a project called \"Democracy School\" (Demokraatiakool) took place, where young people of different nationalities debated all the issues that concern them, from the social system to agricultural policy. In 2000, the joint project \"From Border to Border\" (Piirist piirini) in Narva and H\u00e4\u00e4demeeste and the project \"New Life in Narva-J\u00f5esuu\" (Uus elu Narva-J\u00f5esuus) tried to enhance the value of Narva-J\u00f5esuu, the home town. \nIn 1999, Caritas Estonia became a member of Caritas Europa.\nBy the autumn of 2001, the Caritas School of Creativity had grown out of the theatre and art classes for young people in Tallinn, and began to operate in the newly completed premises of the new Pirita Monastery. The aim of the Creativity School was to increase tolerance through creativity between different social groups and to discover oneself and the world through artistic activities. Through creativity, children can express their feelings and opinions, learn to communicate with their peers, respect others and feel that they belong. This method has been widely appreciated worldwide, especially when working with children at risk, and has received a lot of positive feedback. To promote integration, in 2001 Estonian and Russian young people jointly renovated the Caritas eco-house in Sillam\u00e4e, also learning the ecological technologies used. The international dimension was added in 2001 by a joint camp for French and Estonian children in Soomaa.\nIn 2002, camps continued in Ida-Viru County and children's school holidays on farms.\nIn 2003, Caritas started to work with girls who had been orphaned as teenagers - the first support group started. It started to look for ways to support girls who had become mothers at a very young age to cope, to parent, to learn skills and responsibilities. The work with young mothers has received extremely positive feedback and continues to evolve and develop to this day.\nIn July 2003, during its 17th General Assembly, Caritas Estonia was admitted as member of Caritas Internationalis.\nIn 2005, the Caritas Family Centre (Caritase perekeskus) was opened in the Kopli district of",

Kyiv, Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Kropyvnytskyi, and Pokrovsk came under fire from more than forty missiles of the Russian military. In total, at least 47 people were killed and about 170 were injured. In Kyiv, strikes damaged residential buildings and infrastructure, notably including the Okhmatdyt children's hospital, the country's largest. The city's Artem military plant\u00a0 was also hit. The international community condemned the attacks. The Security Service of Ukraine defined Russia's attack on the Okhmatdyt children's hospital as a war crime and initiated criminal proceedings into the matter. Human Rights Watch also wrote that the strike against the children\u2019s hospital should be investigated as a war crime.\nAttack\nEvacuation of a child near Okhmatdyt children's hospital\nAround 10 a.m. Russian forces launched more than forty missiles towards Ukraine.\nThe community of analysts Molfar claimed that the attack on Okhmatdyt was carried out by pilots and maintenance personnel of the Engels-2 airbase in Saratov Oblast.\nKyiv\nOkhmatdyt children's hospital\nA missile hit the toxicology department of the Okhmatdyt children's hospital. The roof of the building collapsed, resulting in the death of two adults. Ukrainian authorities stated that 16 people were injured, including seven children. Cancer patients were evacuated from the hospital with their parents.\nRussia claimed that the strikes were retaliation and hit defence industry targets and the destruction was caused by Ukrainian air defenses. The Security Service of Ukraine said it had found fragments of a Kh-101 missile. According to OSINT analysis, the Kh-101 missile was fully functional, powered by jet engine in flight and undamaged until impact. UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission representatives confirmed these findings with \"high likelihood\" after visiting the impact site.\nOther strikes\nDestroyed residential building in Kyiv (Shevchenkivskyi District)\nIn Kyiv, Solomianskyi, Dniprovskyi, Darnytskyi, Sviatoshynskyi, Desnianskyi, Shevchenkivskyi and Holosiivskyi districts of the city were affected.\nSix Russian missiles struck the Artem military plant\u00a0. Russia claims that the plant produced munitions, while Ukrainian side denies this. Associated Press stated that the plant produced \"components for various military-grade missiles\". The plant had already been hit during Russian missile attacks in December 2023.\nIn the Solomianskyi District, missiles hit a building with offices, as well as several floors of a multi-storey building. The total area of \u200b\u200bdestruction was 1,500 square meters, and seven people were killed. In the Holosiivskyi District, residential buildings, garages, and cars were damaged. In the Dniprovskyi District there was a missile attack in the area. In the Darnytskyi district, a private house was damaged by the impact.

The residents had to be evacuated.\nDamaged building in Kyiv (Dniprovskyi District), which houses medical centers \"Adonis\" and \"Isida\"\nOverall in Kyiv, 33 people were killed, including five children, and 121 were injured, 10 of them children, according to officials.\nKryvyi Rih\nIn Kryvyi Rih, 10 people were killed and 53 more were injured after a Russian missile strike hit an administrative building at a coal processing plant.\nDnipro\nIn Dnipro, a strike hit a high-rise building, killing one person and injuring 12 others.\nPokrovsk\nIn Pokrovsk, three people were killed, while three others were injured.\nReactions\nDevastation around the Okhmatdyt children's hospital after the Russian attack\nUkraine\nA day of mourning was declared on 9 July in Kryvyi Rih. Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko accused Russia of \"genocide of the Ukrainian population\".\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on NATO members states to show a \"greater resilience and stronger response\" to Russia's attacks on Ukrainian land and children, calling for concrete action towards providing air defense. Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak stated that calls for an \"immediate ceasefire\" by Hungary and China only pushes further Russian aggression by spreading a \"false feeling\" that \"the aggressor has the right to kill because he speaks of \u2018peace\u2019, and the victim should not defend himself\". The attacks happened just before a NATO summit in Washington was planned to be held, with Ukraine participating.\nProsecutor General Andriy Kostin reported sending all information about the attacks to the International Criminal Court.\nOn her Wimbledon Championships match against Wang Xinyu on 8 July, tennis player Elina Svitolina wore a black ribbon on her sporting gear in memory of the victims of the strikes.\nRussia\nOn 8 July the Russian defence ministry stated that \"in response to attempts by the Kyiv regime to damage Russ",
    "Church in Kerala, India\nSt. Mary's Forane Church, Pulinkunnoo is a Catholic church located in Alappuzha district of Kerala, India. Located in a small village named Pulinkunnoo in Kuttanad, the church is also known as Pulinkunnoo church or Pulinkunnu church. It is one of the oldest church and Christian pilgrim centre in Alappuzha district.\nOverview\nSt. Mary's Forane Church, Pulinkunnoo is a Catholic church located in a small village named Pulinkunnoo in Kuttanad, Alappuzha district. This church is more than five hundred years old and has been renovated four times. Many centuries old objects and documents are kept in this church. Decades old iron staircase, wooden confession booths and special carvings on the altar are all features of this church.\nThe church is declining due to age and geographical features. The parish authorities are trying to find a solution to this problem and save the church.\nPulinkunnoo Church, which is also the parish where the blessed Kuriakose Elias Chavara served.\nHistory\nThe early Christians of Kuttanad used to do spiritual things in the Niranam Church, which was established by the disciple of Christ, Thomas the Apostle. Later, with the establishment of the Kallurkkad Church, the center of worship of Christians in Kuttanad became the Kallurkkad church (Basilica of St. Mary, Champakulam). When the number of Christians increased in Pulinkunnoo and surrounding areas, efforts were started under the leadership of Chakala Eepan Tarakan, who was the leader of the Christians at that time, to establish a church at Pulinkunnoo as well. Chakala Eepan Tharakan met Vadakumkur Koical Thampuran who was the local ruler of these regions at that time to build a church there, and the request was allowed by the Thampuran. The Araya (A community whose main livelihood has traditionally been fishing) people who used to live there were shifted to another place. The 'Vallapura' (traditional canoe shed) was demolished to build the church structure.\nThis first Christian church in Pulinkunnoo was established in AD 1450. After 1500 AD, King of Chembakassery (present-day Ambalapuzha) conquered the Pulinkunnoo area and annexed it to his kingdom. During the reign of the Chembakassery kings, many Christians migrated from other areas to Kuttanad including Pulinkunnoo. In 1557, the Christians of Pulinkunnoo and its surrounding areas decided to demolish and rebuild the old church. The last Chaldaean Bishop of Kerala, who was in disguise fearing the Portuguese, was invited to Pulinkunnoo by the Christian families and the foundation of the church was laid by him. On 4 February 1557, Pope Paul IV established the Diocese of Cochin and placed the entire area under this diocese. When the construction was completed, the new church was consecrated and the church was given the name of Virgin Mary, according to the special interest of the then Bishop of Cochin and the believers of Pulinkunnoo.\nIn 1750, Maharaja Marthandavarma conquered the kingdom of Chembakassery and annexed it to Travancore. With this many families from different parts of Travancore again migrated to Kuttanad. Most of the present Christian families in Pulinkunnoo have migrated during this time. As the number of believers increased, the church was renovated again in 1885. Srampikal Geevargis Katanar, who was a parishioner of the church, led the construction of the present church. The foundation stone of the church and the laying of the first stone was carried out by Fr. Geevargis Veliyanad, who was a parishioner of this church. The new church was built on the foundation of the old church.\nlocation\nSt. Mary's Forane Church is located on the banks of Pampa river at Pulinkunnoo in Kuttanad in Alappuzha district. It is located about 17 km away from Alappuzha Bus Stand and about 16.5 km away from Alappuzha railway station.\nCharitable activities\nIn 2020, the church authorities had given away 2.06 acres of land free of cost for Pulinkunnoo Taluk Hospital. 8 cents of land was also handed over to the government in 1956, for the building the first hospital which was now elevated as a taluk hospital.\nThis church was one of the refuge centers for the locals during the 2019 Kerala floods. At the beginning of the flood, the church authorities, who had delivered food to the houses, opened the parish hall of the church itself when the water entered the houses, temporary accommodation facilities have also been arranged in the church. The church's kitchen was also opened to cook for those who sought refuge in the church.\nIn popular culture\nThe church gained more attention when it was appeared in Gautham Vasudev Menon's film 'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa'.\nReference\n^ \"Pulinkunnu Church in Kerala\".

    "\nRepublican Union (UR), is a far-right, neo-fascist internal current of the Argentine political party Republican Proposal. It was described as the most right-wing faction of the PRO and Juntos por el Cambio. It is also known for its youth, called Young Republicans. Although they are part of the PRO, they support the government of La Libertad Avanza.\nPolitical party in Argentina\nHistory\nIn 2020 several members of the far-right wing of Propuesta Republicana launched an internal faction and group within the party called Uni\u00f3n Republicana through a Zoom virtual meeting. Patricia Bullrich, its main figure, aimed to create a space with a liberal imprint that strongly opposes statism, socialism, and the Kirchnerist government. They also introduced the youth wing, J\u00f3venes Republicanos.\nDuring the pandemic months, JR and UR mobilized, expanding their follower base to over 100,000 across all social media platforms. They established training courses that presented revisionist views of Argentine history and economics, critical of state intervention and aligned with ideas similar to those of the Chicago school of economics, rooted in liberalism. The organization opposes President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez's government, who has criticized the group on Twitter alongside then Chief of Cabinet Santiago Cafiero. This occurred when the group placed mock body bags at Plaza de Mayo, bearing names of political figures opposed to the Macri administration, including those of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo. The movement mirrors the American Trumpian current, even using the slogan \"Make Argentina great again\" on their website, led by Ulises Chaparro, a self-proclaimed Trump supporter. Weeks later, they staged protests at various government officials' residences, including Sergio Massa, Agust\u00edn Rossi, and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, alleging these actions were carried out with police complicity in Buenos Aires.\nIn 2021 Francisco S\u00e1nchez, a deputy from the PRO party and leader of the group, called for the death penalty against Vice President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, arguing that a house arrest sentence for 12 years of consecutive theft would be a minimal punishment. This controversy escalated further when on 1 September 2022, Sabag Montiel, an ultraright militant with neo-Nazi tattoos, who had participated in protests organized by UR and JR, attempted to assassinate the Vice President of the nation.\nCurrently the group is considering becoming a political party, as they clarify on their Twitter page.\nIdeology\nThe group is described by political scientists and historians as far-right, neo-fascist, and crypto-fascist. This is due to several factors, such as their endorsement of the ideas of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera and Isabel Per\u00f3n, as well as sympathies towards neo-Nazis personalities, fascist parties, and various Latin American dictatorships. Additionally, they exhibit extreme conservatism, even expressing willingness to physically eliminate members of the homosexual community. The group also displays racist characteristics akin to identitarian and white supremacist movements. Some have drawn parallels between Uni\u00f3n Republicana and other fascist groups like Proud Boys or CasaPound, and also with Argentinian neo-nazi groups like Revoluci\u00f3n Federal.\nIn turn she is described as right-wing populist, right-wing libertarian, reactionary nationalist, ultra-conservative and ultra-neoliberal.\n",

    "2008 murder-dismemberment of a teenage girl in Hong Kong\nIn this Chinese name, the family name is  Wong.\nOn 27 April 2008, at Shek Kip Mei, Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong, 16-year-old sex worker Wong Ka-mui (\u738b\u5609\u6885 W\u00e1ng J\u012bam\u00e9i), alias Kiki Wong, was murdered by strangulation after having sex with her 28-year-old male client Ting Kai-tai (\u4e01\u542f\u6cf0 D\u012bng Q\u01d0t\u00e0i), who butchered her body into bits and pieces before flushing most of the body parts down the toilet and throwing her severed head and organs into the sea. Ting was arrested days after the murder and for the charges of preventing the lawful burial of a body and first-degree murder, Ting was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.\nBackground\nWong Ka-mui\nWong Ka-mui, alias Kiki Wong, was born in 1991 at Hunan, People's Republic of China (or mainland China), and had an older sister. After her divorce, Wong's mother remarried in 1994 to a Hongkonger. Wong immigrated to Hong Kong in 2005, and settled in Tai Po, where she attended school at Tai Po Sam Yuk Secondary School. Wong was academically inclined but reportedly had difficulty socializing with people in school due to her not being a local resident of Hong Kong and unrefined Hong Kong accent.\nDue to her family's poverty and need to pay off her debt of HK$50,000, Wong chose to drop out during her third year of secondary school in January 2008, and made a living by finding odd jobs. Wong reportedly joined a compensated dating network, which was a sex worker social network where young prostitutes would provide their services to older clients. Wong also harboured hopes and dreams of becoming a famous model in midst of making a living by prostitution.\nTing Kai-tai\nTing Kai-tai, nicknamed \"Fatty Ting\", was born in British Hong Kong in 1984. At the age of five, Ting lost his mother to a car accident, and during the same car crash, Ting sustained a severe head injury. Since then, he has had emotional problems. When he was eight years old, Ting was sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and he dropped out of school when he was in the first grade of secondary school. Ting's father later remarried, and Ting's stepmother reportedly treated Ting well. Many friends of Ting noted he had a weird temper, as he would sometimes fly into a rage and out of control at certain moments or when things did not go his way.\nTing had several run-ins with the law since his youth. He was sentenced to a boy's home for one year for hurting someone when he was 15. Ting also began consuming drugs at this point of time and had since notched up some drug antecedents, and also engaged the prostitutes' sexual services at age 16. Ting would later work as an apprentice in air-conditioning engineering, and later became a transportation worker by 2008.\nWong's disappearance and murder\nDuring mid-April 2008, Wong Ka-mui first met up with Ting Kai-tai online, after he contacted her through her sex worker networking and engaged her services. Over the next two weeks, Wong and Ting would constantly met up for dating and sex.\nOn 27 April 2008, Ting returned from a night outing at a shopping mall's nightclub, where he consumed ketamine and ecstasy pills. Ting decided to seek Wong again for sex, and after they met up and had lunch, Wong and Ting had sex inside the latter's Shek Kip Mei apartment in Sham Shui Po, which Ting rented with another person, who was not present at that time. Inside the flat itself, after the two of them listened to music and consumed drugs together, Ting, who heard from Wong that she wanted to die, had strangled 16-year-old Wong Ka-mui to death and due to the effects of drugs, he lost consciousness for a while before he awoke but could not clearly remember what happened. Ting, who recalled what he did, decided to dispose of the corpse by dismembering it.\nFor the next six hours, Ting chopped up the body of Wong inside the bathroom, separating the head and limb by limb. Ting proceeded to cut up the severed limbs and torso into small bits and pieces of flesh and bone. Ting gathered up most of the flesh pieces from Wong's corpse and flushed them down from the toilet, and also kept the severed head and organs into a plastic bag, which he threw into the sea after reaching the Kowloon City Ferry Pier by bus. As for the bone pieces and some last bits of Wong's flesh, Ting sneaked into Shek Kip Mei Wet Market, where he threw the bone pieces and flesh into baskets of pork bones at a pork-seller's stall. He disposed of Wong's handbag and mobile phone but stole HK$3,400 in cash from Wong's wallet and used up the money for sex, drinks and drugs over the next nine days.

    "German politician (1928\u20132015)\nHeinz Ziegner (13 July 1928 \u2013 23 December 2015) was a German politician and party functionary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as the longtime First Secretary of the SED in Bezirk Schwerin and was a member of the Central Committee of the SED.\nLife and career\nEarly career\nHe was born into a working-class family and attended middle school. After the end of World War II, the farm laborer joined the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany) in 1945, which was forcibly merged with the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) to form the SED in 1946.\nIn 1945, he became an employee of the district council in Hettstedt and served there as head of the Statistical District Office until 1949. Additionally, he became a member of the FDGB (Free German Trade Union Federation) and the FDJ (Free German Youth) in 1946. During this time, he also led the local basic organization of the SED and was a member of the FDJ leadership in Annarode until 1948.\nFrom 1949 to 1950, he worked as a department head in the SED District Leadership in Hettstedt. In 1950, he was transferred to the district of Salzwedel, where he worked as a department head for State Administration, Economy and Agriculture. In Autumn 1951, he was made Secretary, Second Secretary in June 1952 and First Secretary in July 1953. On 1 January 1954, he assumed the same position in the district of Sch\u00f6nebeck.\nThat same year, on 17 March, he was appointed First Secretary of the Bezirk Magdeburg FDJ. As such, he also served as statutory member of the Bezirk Magdeburg SED Secretariat. Additionally, he became a member of the FDJ Central Council in 1955 and its Bureau in 1957.\nFrom 1956 to 1957, Ziegner attended the Komsomol Higher School in Moscow. He later also pursued distance learning at the Agricultural Engineering School in Haldensleben, which he completed a with a degree in agricultural sciences (Dipl.-Agrar Ing.) in 1968. He was subsequently made Secretary for Agriculture of the Bezirk Magdeburg SED until 1969.\nDuring his Bezirk Magdeburg tenure, he was elected to the Central Committee of the SED as a candidate member in April 1967 (VII. Party Congress).\nBezirk Schwerin SED\nIn 1969, Ziegner was transferred to the Bezirk Schwerin SED as Second Secretary, also being elected as a full member of the Central Committee of the SED in June 1971 (VIII. Party Congress). Additionally, later in 1971, he was given a mandate by his party as a representative of the Volkskammer, nominally representing a constituency in the southwest of his Bezirk.\nIn January 1974, on the instigation of party leadership, he replaced Bernhard Quandt as First Secretary of the Bezirk Schwerin SED leadership, a position he held for over 15 years until 1989.\nZiegner was regarded as an uncharismatic apparatchik.\nZiegenhahn was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in 1960, 1969 and in Gold in 1984, the Banner of Labor in 1974, the Order of Karl Marx in 1978 and the Hero of Labour title in 1988.\nPeaceful Revolution\nNew Forum protestors at the Alten Garten in Schwerin on 23 October 1989\nDuring the Wende, on 23 October 1989, the oppositional movement New Forum called for a demonstration after a peace prayer in the cathedral at the Alten Garten in Schwerin.\nZiegner decided to hold a counter-demonstration on the same square at the same time, which had been agreed with newly elected SED General Secretary Egon Krenz in Berlin. The SED wanted to prove that there were regions in the GDR that did not take part in the uprising. Reliable comrades were brought in as claqueurs for the staged demonstration of approval, and an National People's Army loudspeaker truck played additional applause. But since, according to the old SED method, nothing was to be left to chance, weapons were issued to officials, delivery and internment points were provided and combat groups were mobilized. The SED put up posters advertising the demonstration as a dialogue event, but denied the Schwerin initiators of the NF the right to speak and openly threatened them during a preliminary meeting.\nOnly a few hours before the demonstration, the NF group decided to leave the rally if the SED speakers spoke alone, which was quickly spread by telephone and word of mouth.\" An unprecedented crowd of 40,000 demonstrators had gathered at the Alter Garten. When Ziegner explained to them, among other things, that the SED had \"no ear and no time\" for \"advice aimed at eliminating socialism,\" the NF group marched off the square, followed by most of the assembled demonstrators. Ziegner stood there \"like a wet poodle\" and disappeared through a back door.\nOn 3 November 1989, the Bezirk Schwerin SED removed him from the position of First Secretary and installed reformer Hans-J\u00fcrgen Audehm as his successor. The SED Politburo wanted to prevent Ziegner from resigning, as many others would then have to be replaced as well. However, the majority in the Bezirk Schwerin SED Secretariat prevailed agains",

    "American slave-trading company\nBill of sale for Peter sold by H. G. Richardson on behalf of Rowan & Harris for $750 to Samuel Davis, May 1835 (Mississippi State University Lantern Project)\nRowan & Harris, sometimes Harris Rowan & Co., was a slave trading company of the United States, known for selling at the Forks of the Road slave market in Natchez, Mississippi in the 1830s. The principals were John L. Harris and Thomas Rowan.\nIn 1834, Harris was advertising \"180 negroes for sale\" in Natchez. Rowan died sometime before 1851 when their lawsuit against Hiram G. Runnels went before the U.S. Supreme Court. The nature of the case was \"In Rowan et al. v. Runnels, the plaintiffs, John A. Rowan  and John L. Harris, brought action to recover on a promissory note given them by the defendant, Hiram G. Runnels. The note was dated March 27, 1839, and was payable March 1, 1840. The only consideration in back of the note was certain slaves brought into Mississippi in 1836 and sold by the plaintiffs as merchandise. This was the evidence presented in the lower court, and the jury was instructed to declare the note void if the slaves had been introduced into the State and sold after May 1, 1833. When the verdict and judgment were rendered against them, the plaintiffs appealed to the lower federal court where the contract was held illegal under the Mississippi Constitution of 1832, and appeal was taken to the Supreme Court...\" The court overruled the Mississippi Supreme Court and declared Mississippi's 1832 rule prohibiting slave sales irrelevant to the contract, with Roger Taney writing for majority. Peter V. Daniel dissented, writing \"that a state court interpretation of its own constitution should be binding on all. To ignore this rule as the Court was doing was, in his opinion, to reflect upon the competency of state courts and to impair the very nature of the federal system\".\nIn 1841, Rice C. Ballard was the trustee listing for sale the 2,300-acre Bruinsburg plantation in Claiborne County and over 100 slaves (including 23 children under age eight) \"to pay three promissory notes owed Rowan & Harris.\nSee also\nList of slave traders of the United States\n",
    "Escalation of violence in northern Syria\nIn early July 2024, violent anti-Turkish riots occurred in Northern Aleppo Governorate, Syria, within areas controlled by Turkey and Turkish-backed Syrian opposition forces. Local protesters and armed militants attacked and set fire to Turkish government buildings, military bases, and Turkish civilians in the region. The clashes coincided with anti-Syrian riots Turkey. \nBackground\nPrior to the clashes, tensions between Syrian refugees and Turks had been intensifying in Turkey. The country, which hosts over 3 million Syrian refugees, has faced accusations of discrimination against this population. Furthermore, nearly 30,000 Syrian refugees were forcibly deported from Turkey in 2023 and subjected to inhumane treatment, according to the Syrians for Truth and Justice Institute.\nIn a speech on 28 June 2024, Turkish President Erdo\u011fan expressed his willingness to restore relations with the Syrian government under Bashar al-Assad, inciting anger among the Syrian opposition and refugees. On the same day, Turkey reopened the Abu al-Zandin crossing near al-Bab, facilitating commercial connections between Turkish-controlled areas and Syrian government-held territories in the eastern Aleppo countryside. Subsequently, on 30 June 2024, an anti-Syrian pogrom erupted in the Turkish city of Kayseri after a Syrian national was accused of sexually abusing a child. Dozens of Syrian-owned shops and offices were set ablaze, and 14 police officers were injured.\nClashes\nOn 1 July 2024, violent riots erupted in Turkish-occupied Northern Syria and the rebel-held Idlib Governorate, where several Turkish military bases are located. In the town of Al-Rai, protesters removed Turkish flags from government institutions and military bases, obstructing the passage of commercial convoys and trucks from Turkey. In the town of Azaz, employees of the Turkish postal service, PTT, were expelled from their offices. Subsequently, armed clashes erupted in Afrin, where gunmen attacked the Turkish military headquarters. At the Syria-Turkey border, militants opened fire on trucks coming from the Turkish border, resulting in the burning of 11 trucks in total. At least three protesters and five militants were killed during the clashes.\nOn 2 July 2024, Turkey shut down all its border crossings with Syria, including the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing, which serves as a trade and transit route for over 3 million people. Additionally, reports emerged of internet and power outages in Syrian opposition-controlled areas.\nOn 3 July 2024, traffic resumed through the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing after a two day hiatus. In the town of Ras al-Ayn, fighters from the Hamza Division and Ahrar al-Sharqiya, along with local residents, demonstrated against the ongoing attacks on Syrians in Turkey.

Abdi also welcomed all Syrians who rioted to SDF controlled areas in north and eastern Syria, extending a hand to save the country together.\nSee also\nInter-rebel conflict during the Syrian civil war\n",
    "A public elementary school in Western Sydney\nFairfield Public School is a government-funded, co-educational, primary day school, located in Fairfield, a western suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Established in 1889 and opened by Sir Henry Parkes, the school caters for approximately 435 students from kindergarten to Year 6. The school is operated by the New South Wales Department of Education and it is opposite of Fairfield High School.\nWith 97% of the school's students being of a non-English speaking background, Fairfield Primary School is one of the most multicultural schools in Sydney. The motto, \"Learning Together\", represents the school's united partnerships and values.\nHistory\n19th\u201320th century\nTeachers race at a picnic in the school, circa 1905\nThe school was opened on 25 February 1889 by ex-New South Wales Premier Sir Henry Parkes on a Saturday afternoon with a large assemblage of parents and children (although the school was opened for the reception of children a month prior to the grand opening). On the opening day, classroom visitations where made with garlands of flowers, in addition to children making speeches to the guests. In one of the speeches, the school's chairman expressed agitation for the establishment of the school, but then he stated they were all pleased with Sir Henry Parkes, who came to open the new school.\nParkes compared the lack of educational facilities of a quarter of a century prior with the system of government-funded education being finally constituted through Australia throughout the late 19th century, making it an extraordinary advantage over the children of former time periods or of those in other nations. Parkes also remarked to the students that they had a special privilege in attending this school, as they had their entire lives to gain from the teaching they received at that period.\nMr Willis, the school's first headmaster, had his house within the school grounds (facing The Horsley Drive) in the late 1890's. In the late 1890's and early 1900's, the students were called to school each day to ring the solid iron school bell three times at 9am and again at 9:30 am. The school has organised sport picnics from as far back as the 1920s, with some events being notable enough to be reported in local newspapers like The Biz. By 1958, Fairfield Public School was one of the largest primary school in New South Wales, though enrolments in that year decreased from 1400 to 1350 students (despite an increase of enrolments in schools of the surrounding areas). In the 1950s, approximately 15% of the students were recent immigrants to Australia. Since the 1960s, classrooms have oftentimes been renovated through government-funded painting, with blue being the school's emblematic colour.\n21st century\nOn 15 March 2002, a A$2 million pedestrian bridge over The Horsley Drive was opened to link the school with Fairfield High School on the opposite side. The bridge was named the Eva Wesley Stone Pedestrian Bridge, after Eva Wesley Stone (1894\u20132001), who was Fairfield's oldest resident and lived in Fairfield all her life, in addition to attending the school in the late 1890s/early 1900s. In June 2014, Fairfield Public School celebrated 125 years of education where former New South Wales governor Marie Bashir, and as well as former principals, visited the school and participated in a special assembly; the school choir performed I Am Australian in Bashir's honour, and the school's drumming group played for her.\nIn November 2016, Fairfield Public School had recorded the biggest increase of students in its Intensive English Centre. In January 2017, over 200 families enrolled their children in the school, many of whom were recent refugees from overseas, including Syria \u2013 The new students received a pencil case, teddy bear and drink bottle. In December 2017, students from the school took part in the annual Christmas trolley run for the disadvantaged in Fairfield CBD, where students rode trolleys filled with food and were led by the school's drumming band to the Fairfield Uniting Church. In January 2018, the school began to improve its indigenous education due to national population boom in school-aged Aboriginal children. In June 2018, the school's library picked up A$7,000 of new books from Dymocks, after Dymocks Children's Charities assisted the students to raise A$3,500 to help refill the school's library with 500 new books.\nDemographics and statistics\nStudent population is transient; enrolment has decreased since 2020, with an enrolment of 503 students at the beginning of 2021, down from 565 at the end of 2020 and 617 students in 2015. In 2023, 437 students were enrolled, down from 462 students in 2022.\nIn 2023, the number of students attending 90% or more of the time increased by 9.7%, from 47.3% in 2022 to 57% in 2023, which was above both the Department of Education and similar school percentages. Though 29% of students attended school less than 85% of the time. As of 2023, the s",

    "2003 book by Steven LeBlanc\nConstant Battles: Why we fight (St. Martin's Griffin, 2003) is a book by Steven LeBlanc, a professor of archaeology at Harvard University who specializes in the American Southwest. The book explores the myth of the \"noble savage\", and demonstrates a long pattern of violence through human history from nearly all parts of the globe.\nContents\nMuch of the book explores debunking the myth of the \"noble savage\", which the evidence of archaeological exploration from around the globe does not support (a peaceful ancient human existence). LeBlanc's data supports that as many as 25% (conservatively estimated) of adult males perished as a direct result of warfare and murder in pre-agricultural times. Chapter 2 titled, \"Was There Ever an Eden?\" explores this notion further.\n\"Prior to the horse, hunting buffalo was not easy. One of the best methods was the buffalo jump, depicted here by Alfred Jacob Miller in 1867. Used for thousands of years by the Plains Indians, a jump could result in hundreds of buffalo being killed, often far more than could be consumed. The Plains Indians, like everyone else on earth, had no mechanisms to avoid affecting their environment or preventing depletion of their resources.\" p. 32, 'Constant Battles: Why We Fight' by Steven A.  Le Blanc\nAs one review from The Wall Street Journal highlighted: About 1,000 people die in local wars around the world each day. That's two people every three minutes or so, in places like the Balkans, Central Africa and Timor. It may sound like a lot of killing, but in fact the planet has never been more peaceful. The past is much bloodier. LeBlanc explains that resource scarcity leads to war and conflict. Scarcity involving access to reproductive capacity including women, food and water, and the required elements involved in creating and holding shelter. When these resources become scarce, warfare and bloodshed tend towards becoming increasingly likely.\nIn the \"Was There Ever an Eden?\" chapter, LeBlanc demonstrates evidence, such as the \"Buffalo jump\", where hundreds to thousands of buffalo would be driven off a cliff, with only some of the killed being able to be used or harvested for their meat and hides, to show that Native and Indigenous persons in the America's were often very wasteful in their hunting practices, and that it is a myth that such groups and cultures were \"conservationists\" with regard to all of their interactions with nature, wildlife, and their ecology.\nReception\nThe book received mostly positive reviews including from St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Scientific American, The Washington Times, The Harvard Crimson, and National Review.\nSee also\nWar Before Civilization by Lawrence H.

In 2014 he obtained a master's degree in Art History from the University of Copenhagen and then a master's degree in Fine Art from Central Saint Martins University of Arts in London.\nSteensen is considered a pioneer in dealing with new artistic and technological practices. He uses current developments in photography and computer games to create multidimensional worlds that relate to the natural environment and make ecosystems tangible through the senses. By collaborating with biologists, composers and writers, among others, he creates poetic interpretations of hidden natural phenomena. After intensive research (including with linguists and musicians) he mostly uses macro photogrammetry, which he implements in 3D animations, so that the work of art can later make several layers of a newly generated, very complex landscape structure visible.\nHis extensive exhibition projects are created in collaboration, which is important to the artist to point out by mentioning the collaborators in the publications and next to the installations.\nAfter a six-year stay in New York, he has been living in Berlin since 2019, where he has had success with his project Berl.Berl.

    "Canadian outlaw biker and gangster\nHarold Paul Barnes (12 May 1935 \u2013 5 November 2016), better known as \"Johnny Sombrero\", was a Canadian outlaw biker and gangster who was the founder and leader of the Black Diamond Riders Motorcycle Club of Toronto.\nEarly life\nBarnes was born in the Junction district in Toronto, the son of a British father and an Italian mother. His father, a working class Englishman from Carlisle in the north of England, was a quiet, reserved man while his dominating mother, a Calabrian woman from Siderno, ruled the household. Barnes's mother was a Commisso related to the Commisso 'ndrina of the 'Ndrangheta, and throughout his criminal career, Barnes benefitted from his 'Ndrangheta ties. In an interview, Barnes stated: \"My mother was very violent. She used to beat the shit out of me. She told every day of my life she was going to kill me...She hit me with her hand and hurt her hand. Kicked me and hurt her foot. Then she went for the rolling pin\". When being sentenced for one of his crimes in 1963, Barnes told the judge that \"I fear no man and only one woman\".\nBlack Diamond Riders\nAs a teenager, Barnes joined a biker gang called the Humber Valley Riders, but broke away in 1951 to found his own biker gang, the Black Diamond Riders. In his founding speech, Barnes proclaimed himself the \"Supreme Commander\", a title he ripped off from the title used by General Dwight D. Eisenhower when he served as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in north-west Europe during World War II. Barnes told his followers: \"I don't care what you say. It's only my way or it's not done\". As an young man, Barnes stood 5'10 tall and weighted 245 pounds while having a barrel-shaped chest. Barnes described himself as an young man as \"bulging with muscles\". He rode around in a Harley-Davidson motorcycle with sheet-metal mufflers he added himself or drove a Cadillac. Barnes regularly took part in brawls on Queen Street that led to the police putting up blockades on the area while outrunning the police in his motorcycle. In 1956, Barnes declared a biker war on the first version of Satan's Choice. Barnes said of his action: \"The first time I invaded their clubhouse I had to. They were invading our property\". Barnes offered up \"beer bounties\" when he provided a case of beer to any Black Diamond Rider who take away the \"colors\" from a Satan's Choice member.\nIn 1961, Barnes first met Bernie \"The Frog\" Guindon of the Golden Hawk Riders, a meeting that ended badly when Guindon refused to address Barnes as \"Supreme Commander\". In 1962, there occurred the \"Battle of Pebblestone\" at the Pebblestone Golf Course in the village of Courtice, when during a biker \"field day\", Barnes and the Black Diamond Riders violated the biker code by attacking the other bikers present at the \"field day\" when they were showing off their bikes to the public. During the brawl, Barnes along with another Black Diamond Rider, Tom Bird, personally fought Guindon, who knocked out Bird with his fist and forced Barnes to retreat. The victory at the \"Battle of Pebblestone\" as the media called the brawl made Barnes famous in Toronto. In 1962, Barnes set up an ambush that forced Satan's Choice to disband at gunpoint. Barnes told the media at the time: \"We took all their crests and told them they couldn't exist any longer. I wiped them out twice, the Choice\".\nA colorful character, Barnes spoke often to the media and portrayed himself as engaged in a crusade to defend Canada's British heritage, which he somehow connected to his criminal activities. In 1963, Barnes wrote a long letter to Queen Elizabeth II asking for a royal charter to rid Canada all of the other outlaw biker gangs except for the Black Diamond Riders. Barnes's letter was not answered. By this point, Barnes was regarded as a \"semi-mythical\" figure in Toronto, the leader of the largest outlaw biker gang whose colorful antics kept him constantly in the news. Media reports in 1963 described Barnes as a \"beefy, tough-talking\" young man who led a biker gang of about 200 that \"terrorized high school dance halls, staged brawls and administered serious beatings to whoever was considered an opponent.\" In 1963, a series of \"lightning police raids\" led to Barnes being jailed for three months for selling alcohol illegally.\nIt was to end the attacks of the Black Diamond Riders that led to a merger in 1965 of four biker gangs, namely the Phantom Riders of Oshawa, the Canadian Lancers of Scarborough, the Wild Ones of Port Credit and the Throttle Twisters of Preston into a super-biker gang, Satan's Choice led by Guindon. Guindon used the name Satan's Choice because he knew it would enrage Barnes. The new Satan's Club promptly defeated the Black Diamond Riders owing to their superior numbers. Guindon followed up his victory by dictating the territory of the Black Diamond Riders, who fell into decline. By 1968, the Black Diamond Riders had only 15 members compared to the 200 they had in 1963.\nDecline",
    "1948 novel by Australian writer Arthur Upfield\nAn Author Bites the Dust (1948) is a novel by Australian writer Arthur Upfield. It is the eleventh of the author's novels to feature his recurring character Detective Inspector Napoleon 'Bony' Bonaparte. It was originally published in Australia by Angus and Robertson in 1948.\nAbstract\nThe author and critic Mervyn Blake is found dead in his writing room on his property about 30 miles from Melbourne. The cause of death is unknown. Two months after the death Boney is brought down to Melbourne to help solve the case.  \nLocation\nThe novel is set in the fictional town of Yarrabo, in the valley of the real Yarra River.\nPublishing history\nFollowing the book's initial publication by Angus and Robertson in 1948 it was subsequently published as follows:\nDoubleday Books, USA, 1948\nUnicorn Mystery Book Club, USA, 1948\nAngus and Robertson, Australia, 1967\nand subsequent paperback, ebook and audio book editions.\nThe novel was also translated into Spanish in 1956, German in 1957, and French in 2000.\nCritical reception\nThe reviewer in The Bulletin noted that with the victim and associates being members of Australian literary circles, this allowed Upfield to \"write about Australian scenes and Australian literature. The former he does well, quietly, and warmly; although now and again there is an indication that he is not so much building up a familiar scene as explaining something to an overseas reader. But in writing about Australian literature Mr. Upfield is, at times, very unkind...Napoleon Bonaparte, Upfield's familiar half-caste inspector, is a synthetic figure: the usual efficient sleuth with endearing habits who baffles his orthodox colleagues, with a bit of 'blacktracking' thrown in for good measure.\"\nIn The Sydney Morning Herald the reviewer wrote: \"Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte, B.A., is the only Australian detective in steady fictional employment. He has individual theories of crime, prides himself on his feminine intuition and his knowledge of psychology, but is modest regarding the singular powers of tracking inherited with his aboriginal\nblood\". And concluded \"In the details of detection, Bony shows his usual competence\".\nSee also\n1948 in Australian literature\n",
    "British politician\nAaron Cameron Thomas, MP is a British politician who has been a Member of Parliament for Tewkesbury since July 2024. He is a member of the Liberal Democrats. He won against incumbent Conservative MP, Laurence Robertson.\nThomas joined the RAF at the age of 17, initially within the ranks and later served as a Commissioned Officer. He has served several operational tours which include Iraq, United Arab Emirates and the Falkland Islands. Motivated primarily by helping others, Cameron also served heavily in the training environment, including a tour as a Drill Instructor, training 1000 recruits over 3 years, before resigning his commission to enter politics.\nIn August 2021, Thomas's team was integral to planning the successful British withdrawal from Afghanistan. Later that year, Thomas deployed to East Midlands NHS, to plan and deliver the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines across Leicestershire and Rutland.\nMilitary career\nOn 3 May 2000, at the age of 17, Cameron Thomas enlisted in the Royal Air Force (RAF). He graduated from Recruit Training Squadron (RTS), in July 2000 with 11 Flight and commenced Trade Training at RAF Cosford in September. During this time, Thomas bonded closely with his course mates through activities such as football and playing Goldeneye on the N64. He graduated from RAF Cosford as a Telecommunications Operator (TCO) in March 2001.\nThomas\u2019s first assignment as a TCO was with the Tactical Communications Wing (TCW) at RAF Brize Norton. He deployed multiple times, including to Oman (on exercise in Thumrait on 11 September 2001), Iraq (Umm Qasr, Shai'bah, and Balad), South Carolina (USA), and Fujairah (UAE). During this tour, he was awarded the Iraq Medal. His Flight Sergeant suggested commissioning as an officer, a path Thomas initially dismissed but later reconsidered.\nIn August 2005, Thomas was posted to Cyprus Communications Unit (CCU) Episkopi, responsible for maintaining various communications systems across the island. He spent three months at RAF Cosford realigning his trade to Information and Communications Technology (ICT), acquiring skills in building and maintaining computers, networks, and cabling systems.

He was awarded the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal during this tour.\nAs a Drill Instructor at RTS, Thomas trained, mentored, and developed future RAF aviators, finding this role highly rewarding. He trained recruits in Foot and Arms Drill, General Service Knowledge, Core Values, and equipment maintenance. His effective mentorship led him to recognize his leadership potential and aspire to a commission, enhancing his credibility as a future parliamentary candidate. He completed 13 consecutive intakes of RAF recruits, approximately 1,000 trainees, and received the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal.\nBetween RTS and Initial Officer Training, Thomas was stationed at RAF Cranwell, Imjin Barracks, and RAF Brize Norton. At Brize Norton, he supervised a diving expedition in Malta and assisted with training new divers in Cyprus. He also called the salute at the National Cenotaph in Westminster during London Pride 2018.\nThomas began Initial Officer Training at RAF College Cranwell in June 2018 with B Squadron. He bonded with his course mates and assisted Direct Entrants with Weapon Handling, equipment preparation, and Foot Drill.

In June 2023, he joined the RAF Inclusivity team at Air Command, RAF High Wycombe.\n2024 United Kingdom General Election\n",
    "State of the German Empire\nThe Free State of Saxe-Gotha (German: Freistaat Sachsen-Gotha), initially also known as the Republic of Gotha (German: Republik Gotha), emerged after the World War I from the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. It existed from November 1918 to May 1, 1920: It united with six other states to form the State of Thuringia.\nHistory\nRevolution 1918\nOn November 9, 1918, the Gotha Reichstag representative Wilhelm Bock (USPD) proclaimed the Gotha Republic on the main market in Gotha and declared Duke Carl Eduard deposed. Five days later, on November 14, the joint state parliament of Saxony-Coburg and Saxony-Gotha held its last meeting in Gotha. At this meeting, the Duke announced his resignation. Finally, the state parliament dissolved itself. The two former duchies went their separate ways in the political developments that followed.\nThe executive committee of the Workers' and Soldiers' Council of Gotha took over the Duke's responsibilities in Gotha under the leadership of Otto Geithner. After a delegate conference of the workers' and soldiers' councils on November 30, the executive was taken over by three \"People's Representatives for the State of Gotha\", who signed \"State Ministry, The People's Representatives\". These were Wilhelm Bock, Emil Grabow and Adolf Schauder, with Bock resigning at the beginning of February and being replaced by Albin Tenner. The state administration was headed by State Minister von Bassewitz until May 1919. \nElection of the State Assembly\nOn January 23, 1919, they set February 23 as the election day for the State Assembly of Gotha. The USPD won the absolute majority.  The election campaign was overshadowed by the occupation of Gotha by Reichswehr units of General Maercker on February 18, 1919. This was triggered by military preparations against the meeting of the National Assembly in Weimar. The workers' movement responded to the occupation with a general strike, which in turn triggered a civil strike. On March 26, 1919, the people's representatives Schauder, Grabow and Tenner were confirmed as members of the government by the newly elected state assembly with 10 votes to 8.\nOn April 12, 1919, the separation of Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Coburg was completed with the \"State Treaty on the Administration of the Common Affairs of the Free States of Coburg and Gotha\".  After Carl Eduard had rejected a compensation offer of 15 million marks for the loss of his property, the \"Law on the Confiscation of the Gotha House Fideikommi\u00df, the Lichtenberg Fideikommi\u00df, the Ernst-Albert Fideikommi\u00df, the Schmalkalden Forests and the House Allod\" was passed by the state assembly on July 31, 1919. It was the only expropriation of princes in Germany and was later annulled by a ruling of the Reich Court on June 18, 1925. The \"Community Treaty on the Merger of the Thuringian States\" was approved by all parties on May 28, 1919.  The decision on a constitution based on a draft by Hermann Brill was made on December 23, 1919, as the last Thuringian state to do so, with the \"Law for the Provisional Government Power in the Republic of Gotha,\" after a first draft incorporating the council system failed to come into force in the summer.\nConflicts with the Reich\nOn the occasion of the Kapp Putsch in March 1920 in Berlin, the state government led by the USPD called for a general strike in the Free State of Gotha. The workers armed themselves and stormed, among other things, the Gotha prison. In response, a Reichswehr unit was sent from Erfurt to Gotha on March 13, 1920. As a result, there were civil war-like clashes in Gotha with more than 100 deaths, after which the decimated Reichswehr Association withdrew to Erfurt on March 18.  On March 20, a Marburg unit was transferred to Gotha, which drove 15 workers to the village of Mechterst\u00e4dt near Gotha and shot them there during the Mechterst\u00e4dt murders.\nAnother general strike followed from March 26 to 31. The eight members of the bourgeois parties in the state assembly demanded the resignation of the state government due to the events and finally resigned their seats in order to force new elections by failing to pass a quorum. Since the state assembly continued to meet with the USPD members, the opposition filed a complaint to the Reich Minister of the Interior on March 31 because of the unconstitutional conditions. This, as well as the executive committee to which the people's representatives had submitted themselves, were the triggers for the Reich Execution against Saxony-Gotha on April 10, 1920, which meant the declaration of a state of emergency, the appointment of the Reich Government Commissioner Wilhelm Holle and later the dissolution of the state assembly and new elections.\nSince the People's Representatives were not prepared to cooperate with the Reich Commissioner, he appointed a Civil Service Government on May 10, 1920, with State Councilors Wilharm and Muther. In the new elections on May 30, the USPD lost its majority in the state parliament. On June 1",

    "\nThe siege of Kotor Varo\u0161 took place during the Bosnian War in 1992. Kotor Varo\u0161 is a town located in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The conflict involved HVO, HOS and ARBiH against VRS. Kotor Varo\u0161 was surrounded by the VRS. At the beginning of the main battles for Kotor Varo\u0161 HVO and ARBiH from Kotor Varo\u0161 got big help from Jajce soldiers. After the fall of Kotor Varo\u0161, the VRS in south almost 2 months later ended its operation Vrbas '92, capturing Jajce.\nTimeline\nIn May the VRS launched a major offensive to seize control of areas with significant Croat and Bosniak populations. The town of Kotor Varo\u0161 became a strategic target. In June 11\u201312, Initial VRS attacks on HVO and HOS aimed at gaining control of Kotor Varo\u0161 and surrounding villages. The HVO and local Bosniak forces attempted to defend the area but faced overwhelming VRS strength. On June 24, 1992, Heavy fighting occurred around Kotor Varo\u0161 as VRS forces intensified their offensive. Reports indicate significant casualties and destruction of property. In June VRS also started operation Vrbas '92, attacking the nearby town of Jajce. In July, clashes continued with the VRS gradually gaining control over Kotor Varo\u0161. The HVO and ARBiH were pushed back, and many civilians fled or were displaced. By mid-August, the VRS had established control over Kotor Varo\u0161 and surrounding areas. There were also smaller rebel fights around Kotor Varo\u0161 in September, but they were resolved by an agreement that the remaining Croatian and Muslim forces would leave the area.\nAftermath\nThe battle resulted in significant destruction and displacement of the civilian population. Reports of atrocities and ethnic cleansing emerged, with many non-Serb residents being expelled or killed. But even when Kotor Varo\u0161 was under Croatian control, there were crimes against Serbs. One example was Serdari massacre. The capture of Kotor Varo\u0161 by the VRS solidified their control over a strategically important area in northern Bosnia and Herzegovina. The aftermath of the battle left deep scars on the Muslim and Croat community.\n",

    "This article is about the FromSoftware character. For the clown, see J. P. Patches.Fictional character\nPatches is a recurring character designed by Hidetaka Miyazaki and video game development studio FromSoftware. He is voiced by British actor William Vanderpuye, and, in Japanese, Naomi Kusumi. Appearing in most of their games starting from the 2008 Armored Core: For Answer, he has predominantly featured in games in the Soulsborne series, up to and including the 2022 open-world fantasy game Elden Ring. Bald and wearing trademark leather armor, he is usually a merchant who obtains his wares from looting corpses, including those of unsuspecting people he has fooled. His outlandishly cowardly personality and transparent ploys to kill the protagonist function as comic relief in the otherwise dark games. At times, Patches also becomes the player's ally, making him akin to a trickster. Patches has been described as a self-insert character for Miyazaki himself, who shares the tendency to spring traps on unsuspecting players, and only appears in games Miyazaki designed or directed. His similarity in design across games has led to theories that he can cross between dimensions. He has become widely popular amongst fans despite his constant attempts to misle the player.\nCharacter design\nPatches is typically depicted as a middle-aged man wearing fullbody light leather armor created for thievery and sneaking, save for his head. He has little to no facial hair, small, beady eyes, and a long nose. Patches uses a spear and greatshield to fight, allowing him to attack from behind the shield in a highly defensive manner, and has a powerful kick that can break the player's guard, attributed to his preferred tactic of kicking people off cliffs. In Dark Souls III, he both uses and drops the Horsehoof Ring, a magic ring that increases the power of kicks.\nPatches is commonly seen performing the \"Patches Squat\" or \"Patches Crouch\", a resting pose that resembles the Slav squat and which is learnable by the player.\nAppearances\nThe very first incarnation of Patches may have appeared in the 2003 video game Shadow Tower: Abyss, in which a nameless trickster character drops players into monster-infested waters by collapsing a bridge while they are crossing it. However, a character bearing a similar name first appeared in For Answer as \"Patch the Good Luck\", a mecha pilot. Patch prefers to fight from afar using a sniper rifle, and will plead for mercy when defeated, retreating if the player spares his life. Patches reappears in Demon's Souls and its 2020 remake under the name \"Patches the Hyena\", a scavenger of corpses. He attempts to lure the player into two different deadly traps, but, if spared, will return to the game's hub area, the Nexus, to serve as a merchant. His next appearance, in Dark Souls, is as \"Trusty Patches\", with a nigh-identical appearance and role, springing two traps on the player in the game's Catacombs area, then returning to the game's hub, Firelink Shrine, as a merchant. In this game, he largely sells the stolen weapons, armor, and items of clerics.\nPatches does not appear in Dark Souls II due to Miyazaki's lack of involvement in the game, being replaced by Mild-Mannered Pate, a similar corpse robber, but one who is less blatant in his schemes. However, he returns in Bloodborne as Patches the Spider, a human-headed spider creature who sells items in the game's Chalice Dungeons. During the game's main story, he gives the player the mysterious Tonsil Stone item in an attempt to trap them in an alternate dimension known as the Nightmare. In Dark Souls III, \"Unbreakable Patches\" steals the armor of one of the game's other characters, Siegward of Catarina. Even if killed by the player, he returns as Lapp in the game's DLC, a kindly armored knight who has lost his memory. When Lapp regains his memories, he \"tricks\" the player into finding the correct path.\nThe most recent appearance of Patches is in Elden Ring, where he ambushes the player in a cave, attempting to steal from them before cowering and begging for mercy upon his near-defeat. If Patches is befriended, he becomes a merchant and can be summoned to fight Starscourge Radahn, though he quickly flees from battle. Patches betrays the character again after joining the Recusants, a group of assassins led by the demigod Praetor Rykard. Patches falls in love with Rykard's consort, Lady Tanith, but is forced to leave the Recusant hideout upon Rykard's defeat. He is found heavily injured in the Shaded Castle, where he provides the player with a gift to console Tanith, albeit to no avail. While the quest ended here in older versions of the game, with Patches appearing to perish, it was later extended. Patches survives and permanently returns to his former thievery, inhabiting the same cave he is first discovered in.\nIn the FromSoftware game Sekiro, the character Anayama the Peddler was compared to Patches in personality and role, as a shifty former thief turned merchan",

    "6th race of the 2024 ARCA Menards Series West\nMotor car race\nThe 2024 West Coast Stock Car Motorsports Hall of Fame 150 presented by NAPA Auto Parts was the 6th stock car race of the 2024 ARCA Menards Series West season, and the 23rd iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, July 6, 2024, at Irwindale Speedway in Irwindale, California, a 0.50 mile (0.80\u00a0km) permanent asphalt oval shaped short track. The race was originally scheduled to be contested over 150 laps, but was extended to 152 laps due to an overtime finish. In an action-packed race with post-race controversy, Sean Hingorani, driving for Venturini Motorsports, would take advantage of late teammate troubles from Isabella Robusto, and take the lead with 29 laps to go. After surviving numerous restarts, Hingorani held off Jack Wood in a one-lap shootout to earn his sixth career ARCA Menards Series West win, his second of the season, and his second consecutive win, sweeping both doubleheader races. Robusto and Trevor Huddleston were the most dominant drivers of the race, Robusto led 58 laps while Huddleston led a race-high 62 laps. After hitting the wall with 29 laps to go, Robusto lost the lead and retired from the race with a flat tire, credited with a 17th place finish. To fill out the podium, Tyler Reif, driving for Central Coast Racing, would finish in 3rd, respectively. \nThe race was originally scheduled to be held on March 30, but was postponed until July 6 due to the impeding bad weather for the area. The race served as a doubleheader with the 2024 NAPA Auto Parts 150, which was held two days prior on July 4.\nReport\nBackground\nIrwindale Speedway, the circuit where the race was held.\nThe Irwindale Speedway & Event Center (a.k.a. Irwindale Speedway, Irwindale Dragstrip, or \"The House of Drift\") is a motorsports facility located in Irwindale, California, United States. It opened on March 27, 1999, under the official name Irwindale Speedway. Toyota purchased the naming rights to the facility in 2008, and from that time until 2011 it was also known as the Toyota Speedway at Irwindale.\nThe speedway features banked, paved 1\u20442- and 1\u20443-mile oval tracks and a 1\u20448-mile drag strip. The property is primarily used for NASCAR races such as ARCA Menards Series West and Whelen All-American Series events. In late 2011, NASCAR announced it was dropping Toyota Speedway from its schedule. The company that managed the track, Irwindale Speedway LLC, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on February 13, 2012.\nEntry list\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\nPractice\nThe first and only practice session was held on Saturday, July 6, at 3:30 PM PST, and would last for 1 hour. Nick Joanides, driving for Jan's Towing Racing, would set the fastest time in the session, with a lap of 18.510, and a speed of 97.245\u00a0mph (156.501\u00a0km/h).\nPractice results\nQualifying\nQualifying was held on Saturday, July 6, at 5:00 PM PST. The qualifying system used is a multi-car, multi-lap based system. All drivers will be on track for a 20-minute timed session, and whoever sets the fastest time in the session will win the pole.\nNick Joanides, driving for Jan's Towing Racing, would score the pole for the race, with a lap of 18.380, and a speed of 97.933\u00a0mph (157.608\u00a0km/h).\nOne driver withdrew from the race: Robbie Kennealy.\nQualifying results\nPost race conflict\nFollowing the end of the race, conflict broke out between the PA announcer and the Irwindale Speedway track owner, Tim Huddleston (also the father of driver Trevor Huddleston), and crew members of Venturini Motorsports. As Hingorani did a burnout to celebrate, Huddleston stated that \"This race is under review. They might take it away from him. Cause he jumped the start, so NASCAR is trying to figure out what happened here.\" Shortly after, ARCA officials confirmed that Hingorani was the winner of the race. As Hingorani began celebrating by climbing the catchfence, tensions began to rise. \"They made the decision. Picking it up tonight. Climbing the fence. Hey, fuck you buddy\" Huddleston had shouted into the hot mic. Shortly after, the mic ended up getting cut off before Huddleston went over to interview second-place finisher Jack Wood. \"P2 tonight. What a gentleman. Class act. Ladies and Gentleman, they're so disrespectful, I'm not interviewing them. They don't need it.\" Afterwards, Huddleston jokingly said that Wood was the winner of the race. After interviewing third-place driver Tyler Reif, the broadcast went back to Hingorani, but wrapped up shortly after and Hingorani did not receive a victory interview on the broadcast.\nRace results\nStandings after the race\n"
