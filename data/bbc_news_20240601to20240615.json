    "A 14-year-old girl who struggled with her school attendance after the Covid-19 pandemic took her own life, an inquest concluded.\nErin Tillsley \"was very bubbly, loved TikTok, doing her hair and dancing\", her father Daniel said in a statement read out at Suffolk Coroner's Court on Friday. \nBut Mr Tillsley said \"things became really difficult after Covid-19 lockdowns - she didn't want to go back to school\".\nErin was found unresponsive at their home in Great Cornard, Suffolk, on the morning of 14 July 2023.\nShe had moved schools in May that year, but only attended it for four days between the start of the May half-term and her death, Suffolk's area coroner Darren Stewart said.\nHer father said on the day she died, he had left their home to go to work at 05:30 BST and called Erin at 07:00 to see if she was awake and ready for school.\nHe said that she sent him a text message saying she \"can't do this\" and in a later call at 08:50, she said she was not going in to school. \nMr Tillsley said he got a \"really bad feeling\" and returned home, finding Erin in her bedroom at 10:25.\nHe called emergency services and paramedics arrived 11 minutes later, but she was pronounced dead at 11:33.\nMr Stweart said Erin's family had noted the \"significant\" impact the pandemic had on her and that she \"experienced difficulties being able to re-engage with school\".\nOn New Year's Eve in 2022, Erin took a number of her mother's prescription pills and was taken to the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds.\nMr Stewart added the hospital treated it as an accidental overdose combined with alcohol and it did not trigger a referral to a psychiatric liaison team.\nErin was referred to the mental health trust, Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, by her GP on 4 January 2023.\nMr Stewart said he was concerned about \"delays\" by the trust and that he was awaiting further information from them.\nHe said the reason why Erin \"struggled with her attendance\" had not been established.\n\"I find Erin took her own life,\" the coroner ruled, recording her medical cause of death as by a ligature around her neck.\nMr Stewart said he would make a decision on whether a report to prevent future deaths was required after hearing more from the mental health trust and from West Suffolk Hospital.\nDr Ewen Cameron, chief executive of the hospital trust, said it was \"deeply saddened\" by Erin's death.\n\u201cEvery patient deserves the highest quality and safest care and we have rightly carried out a patient safety review regarding Erin\u2019s care with us,\" he added.\nA spokesperson for the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust declined to comment at \"the request of the family\".\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "An abandoned dog has been given a new lease of life after being saved just seconds away from death.\nDr Sharon Williams, a vet from Celandine Wood Animal Rescue (CWAR) in Wirral, had been sent a message asking if she could help Pumpkin the pocket bully.\nBut, when she called back, she was told it was \"too late\" and he had been taken to be put down.\nDr Williams then got a second call when, by a twist of fate, the vet could not find a vein to administer Pumpkin's final sedation.\nShe then drove five hours to pick him up.\nDr Williams said Pumpkin, despite everything, still \"wagged his tail\" when he saw her.\n\"You could just tell he just wanted to be loved,\" she said.\nPumpkin - a cross between an American bully and a Patterdale terrier - was dumped by his owner and tied to the gates of a council-run dog pound.\nUnder the care of the kennels, he was unexplainably losing weight \u2013 going from 30 kilos to 15 within a few months. \nDr Williams said the kennels expected he had cancer and he was booked in for euthanasia as \"council-run pounds often can\u2019t afford veterinary care\".\nAfter receiving a message asking if she could save Pumpkin, Dr Williams phoned the kennels back but was told she was \"too late\". \n\u201cI phoned the woman and said \u2018Yes, we can take Pumpkin\u2019. But she said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re too late, they\u2019ve just sedated him and they\u2019re now putting him to sleep\u2019,\u201d said Dr Williams.\nShe said she felt sick knowing she had not been able to save him. \n\u201cI\u2019d been out cleaning my yard when I was texted about saving Pumpkin.\n\u201cMy heart sank, knowing that if I\u2019d have just seen the text a few minutes before, he would still be alive.\u201d\nBut then her phone rang again. \n\"She said \u2018The vet can\u2019t find a vein. Can you still take him?\u2019.\"\nDr Williams and a volunteer, Paul, then drove five hours to pick Pumpkin up. \nShe said: \u201cHe was in a cold office, lying on a stone floor and he had a little pumpkin-coloured jumper on, which is where we got the name from, because he was actually called George.\n\u201cAlthough he was totally emaciated and looked tired, sad and ill, he wagged his tail when he saw us.\"\nAfter undergoing blood tests and a specialist ultrasound scan under CWAR's care, Pumpkin was found not to have cancer, but food allergies. \nHe was given a specialist hypoallergenic diet and soon began putting on weight. \nDr Williams said: \u201cWithin weeks he was like a different dog. He was thriving and full of life.\u201d\nPumpkin has now found his forever home with one of the rescue's dog walkers. \n\u201cHe just loves people and is always happy when snuggled next to someone on the sofa,\u201d said Dr Williams. \nCWAR is facing closure unless it raises \u00a3500,000 to set up new premises.\nIt must vacate its shelter by 14 June because the landowner is selling up. It is fundraising for its longer-term plans to build a \u00a31m permanent facility that will quadruple rescue spaces.\nThe Merseyside-based rescue currently has 50 dogs in its care and also takes in cats and wildlife.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Actor Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt has submitted a petition to a Los Angeles court to drop Pitt from her name. \nThe daughter of Hollywood stars Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt took legal action to become Shiloh Jolie on May 27, the date of her 18th birthday.\nAngelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt in September 2016, but details of their separation have not been finalised and a settlement agreement is yet to be reached.\nThe couple are also currently involved in a legal battle over Chateau Miraval, a French winery they bought together. \nShiloh is the third-eldest of the former couple\u2019s six children, but not the first of her siblings to seek a move away from the name Pitt.\nEarlier this year, her 15-year-old sister Vivienne dropped their father's last name in  her listing in a Playbill programme for a production of The Outsiders on Broadway.\nAnd in a 2023 video, eldest daughter Zahara can be seen and heard introducing herself as Zahara Marley Jolie, on joining Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority at Spelman College.\nHowever, Shiloh, who performed as a voice actor in the animated film Kung Fu Panda 3, is the first of the siblings to file a formal petition for a legal name change.\nThis legal request comes amid developments in the divorce battle between Jolie and Pitt, who were married in August 2014. \nJolie filed for divorce after an incident in 2016, in which she says Pitt grabbed her by the head and attacked two of their children on an aeroplane.\nPitt also verbally abused and poured alcohol on his family during the flight from France to Los Angeles, she says.\nHe denies the allegations.\nThe pair were engaged in a custody battle that resulted in Pitt being awarded joint custody in 2021.\nBoth actors have also filed lawsuits against each other.\nDisagreements between the two include disputes over property and shared business ventures, including Ch\u00e2teau Miraval.\nIn February 2022, Pitt sued Jolie and her company, Nouvel, for allegedly selling her share of the winery without his supposedly agreed-upon consent.\nLegal documents claimed that Jolie \"sought to inflict harm\" on her former husband when she sold her stake in their co-owned vineyard to a Russian oligarch.\nOn 4 April 2024, Angelina Jolie\u2019s legal team filed a motion requesting communication be released, saying it would \"prove\" Pitt would not allow her to sell her shares in Ch\u00e2teau Miraval to him unless she agreed to an \u201cexpansive\u201d non-disclosure agreement.\nPitt is being countersued over claims that millions of dollars of Ch\u00e2teau Miraval funding were used for personal projects.",
    "You want to step out of the world of wage slavery, and set up a business of your own? Preferably a business that will be more than a mere lifestyle for you - one that you can sell and from which you can retire on the proceeds?\nWell, in thinking about your chances of success, it helps to look at those who have trodden that path and ended up with a flourishing enterprise to their name.\nIn the interview series The Decisions That Made Me a Leader, we spoke to half a dozen successful entrepreneurs - too small a sample from which to draw statistically useful generalisations, but large enough to spot some interesting patterns.\nI was struck by three intriguing attributes that may not guarantee business success, but which do seem to help.\nFirst, I noticed the degree of rebelliousness exuded by several of them. They never quite fitted in - perhaps not into school, or university, or into the first jobs they tried.\nDuncan Bannatyne, famous as one of the original big stars of the Dragons Den TV series, certainly never fitted into the navy, from which he was court-martialed and dishonourably discharged after getting into a fight with an officer. \u201cI just thought it was right thing to do - he was poking me and shouting at me,\u201d recalls Mr Bannatyne.\nHis attitude, he tells me, is that \u201cauthority should not be accepted\u201d.\nSimon Beckerman, founder of online marketplace Depop, draws a similar conclusion about himself. \u201cI'm quite a disobedient person in my own right,\" he says. \"I think I am unemployable.\"\nAnd it\u2019s true that when you don\u2019t find it easy to work for anyone else, going it alone is the obvious alternative career route.\nBefore she created the tea mixology brand Bird & Blend Tea Co, Krisi Smith had stumbled through many jobs - including cleaning out cat pens in a cattery (even though she is allergic to cats) and working as a \"shot girl\" selling spirits to club-goers.\n\"I was always asking questions and wanting to know why we were doing something and making suggestions,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd I think that that tended to put people's back up.\" After seeing her employers treat staff and customers badly, she decided she wanted to run her own business ethically.\nThe second attribute that I noticed was a kind of impatience hard-wired into their personalities. It seems there is always an itch. They never stand still.\n\nBut if you thought their success in business came out of some kind of life-plan upon about which they had reflected and consciously embarked, you would be missing the point.\nThese entrepreneurs grabbed at opportunities, and indeed grabbed opportunities to make opportunities for themselves.\nTimo Armoo, who set up the social media marketing company FanBytes, says he started his first venture at school, charging other pupils to help them with their maths assignments. Then, at the age of 17, he managed to secure interviews with Sir Richard Branson, Lord Sugar and James Caan after emailing the organisers of a business summit and offering to set out chairs in exchange for a press pass.\n\u201cI sent it and within 20 minutes I get back an email saying, \u2018You're crazy and yes, let's do it',\" recalls Mr Armoo.\nThe impatience that one can observe even extends to the entrepreneurs leaving the very businesses they created. Self-aware founders understand the skills they have and do not have, and know that when a business matures, it often needs a management that can do the painstaking work of delivering sustainable growth, rather than one with the flair of creation and discovery.\nAt that point, impatience is exactly the wrong attribute. And anyway, the entrepreneurs we spoke to, being impatient, are ready to move on once the business is solid, so their minds wander to selling.\nTake Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of Lastminute.com at the height of the dot-com boom during the late 1990s. She was the poster child of a new youthful entrepreneurial culture that sprung up at that time, as kids showed the grown-ups exactly what the internet was capable of.\nBut at the age of 31, she made the decision to step down as managing director of the company. \u201cIt was like being in a pop band where you had this one mega hit, and I didn't want that to be the only thing that defined my life,\" she says.\nSo to a third and final entrepreneurial attribute, which follows from the others: it\u2019s a willingness to actually do things, rather than merely think about them. Or overthink them.\nI feel this is what marks out those people - in business or perhaps even in charities or public service - that are of a genuine entrepreneurial spirit. They are the people who seem to get things done.\nSome of it comes down to a kind of optimism. They believe that their own actions have a good chance of achieving something, so they are less likely than most of us to descend into a fatalistic stupor. It gets them out of bed in the morning.\nRichard Walker comes from a family with a track record in business - his father was the founder of the supermarket chain Iceland, where Richard is now ",
    "US supermodel sisters Bella and Gigi Hadid are donating $1m (\u00a3785,000) to support Palestinian relief efforts.\nA representative for Bella said the money has been earmarked for equal distribution among four humanitarian organisations that have a focus on children and families affected by the conflict in Gaza.\nThe sisters, whose father is Palestinian property tycoon Mohamed Anwar Hadid, have been vocal in their support for the people affected.\nIn an Instagram post in May, Bella said she was \"devastated at the loss of the Palestinian people and the lack of empathy coming from the government systems worldwide\".\nThe donations come after a series of photographs of the model at the Cannes Film Festival last month featured her in a red and white dress made of traditional Arabic cloth associated with Palestinian culture.\nShe wrote that it was \"a beautiful way to represent the history, labour of love, resilience and, most importantly, the art of historic Palestinian embroidery\".\nAfter Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel, Gigi wrote on Instagram: \"My thoughts are with all those affected by this unjustifiable tragedy, and every day that innocent lives are taken by this conflict - too many of which are children.\n\"I have deep empathy and heartbreak for the Palestinian struggle and life under occupation, it's a responsibility I hold daily.\"\nShe added: \"While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person.\"\nThe four relief agencies receiving donations from the sisters are Heal Palestine, Palestine Children's Relief Fund, World Central Kitchen, and United Nations Relief and Works Agency. \nThe organisations support humanitarian aid including food and medical programmes, assist displaced families, and provide psychological services amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.\nUS President Joe Biden on Friday urged Hamas to accept a new Israeli proposal to end the conflict in Gaza, saying that \"it's time for this war to end\".\nThe conflict began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to Gaza as hostages.\nMore than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the start, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "Police made 56 arrests around the Champions League final, mainly for attempts to get into the ground without a ticket.\nThe Met Police said five people were arrested for invading the pitch.\nPolicing the final was part of a major police operation across London on Saturday, with more than 2,000 officers on duty. \nEarlier in the day, thousands of people attended a protest organised by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as a counter-demo. Police said two people were arrested near Parliament Square where the protest ended.\nAt a separate London protest, nine pro-Palestinian demonstrators were arrested.\nAfter the Wembley final, which Real Madrid won 2-0 against the German side Borussia Dortmund, a spokesperson for the Met said they were \"confident the overwhelming majority\" of attempts to enter the stadium were unsuccessful. \n\"Videos shared online showing groups running into entrances do not necessarily represent successful attempts to enter the stadium,\" the spokesperson said. \n\"There are typically multiple further levels of security beyond an initial entrance.\"\nSaturday's game had only just kicked off when play was disrupted, with pitch invaders approaching some of the players.\nThe Met spokesperson added: \"Major sporting events often attract attempts by those without tickets to bypass perimeter fencing or otherwise gain entry. There is a robust policing operation in place to support the Wembley security plan and officers have worked closely with stewards and stadium staff to maintain security throughout.\"\nEarlier on Saturday, thousands of people attended the march and rally organised by Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon. According to police they included groups from across the UK linked to football disorder.\nThe rally led by set off from Victoria at around 13:00 BST and ended in Parliament Square just after 18:00 where Robinson, Reclaim leader Laurence Fox and others gave speeches and a film was shown.\nOn X, formerly Twitter, the Met said it was aware \"a number of groups\" had gathered in \"pubs nearby and elsewhere in central London\", including people known to them for football violence.\nThe force later posted to say two people were arrested \"in the vicinity of Parliament Square\", including one person who was arrested \"for drunk and disorderly and assaulting an emergency worker\".\nAround 300 people attended a static counter-protest in Whitehall organised by Stand Up To Racism. There, crowds gathered to hear from speakers such as Zak Cochrane.\nThe Met said officers were deployed \"in significant numbers\" to ensure those in Parliament Square and Whitehall did not come together.\nA third smaller demo unrelated to the other two also took place in central London.\nYouth Demand said it wanted to take direct action to protest against the ongoing conflict in Gaza, and said in public statements its members were intending to occupy roads and bridges.\nThe Met posted on X that protesters \"went onto York Road, attempting to cause serious disruption by blocking traffic\" despite being \"subject to conditions not to leave the pavement\".\nThe force later posted that nine people had been detained for \"breaching Public Order Act conditions not to leave the pavement\", adding \"the remainder of the group has largely dispersed\".\nMeanwhile officers tried to curb a planned demo against the conflict in Gaza in the Finchley area by imposing restrictions under the Public Order Act.\nThe Met said if protesters gathered they would be restricted to a static demonstration to take place at a location away from sites that may cause fear and concern to Jewish residents, but that is still of importance to the protest organisers.\n\"There is a significant difference between a protest that takes place in central London on a Saturday away from residential areas, and a protest that seeks to walk right through an area with a significant Jewish community. It is right that our policing response takes this into account,\" Cdr Louise Puddefoot said.\nA four-day family football festival is also continuing in parts of the capital throughout the weekend.\nIt has been taking place at several sites in central London, including Trafalgar Square, Regent Street, Somerset House, the South Bank and Potters Field Park, with road closures in place as well as changes to some bus routes and Cycleways.\nIt is due to finish on Sunday evening.\nEarlier, there was some disruption on public transport due to the Champions League final, with part-closures and severe delays adding to congestion.\nAmid the multiple events taking place in London were rehearsals for Trooping the Colour on 15 June, for the King's official birthday.\nMeanwhile, engineering work over the weekend means there are no direct train services between central London and Luton Airport, as well as no Elizabeth Line services between Paddington and Abbey Wood, and between Whitechapel and Stratford on Saturday.\nTfL said people should check their journey on its website for updates before they travel.\nAd",
    "An author from Somerset has published a book about a family secret revealed at a funeral.\nJustin Adam, from Curry Mallet, was attending a funeral for his 87-year-old Aunt Flo when a man arrived claiming to be her son.\nDecades later Mr Adams was able to find out more information about his new family member and why he had been kept a secret.\nThe tale is told in the book, The Unexpected Mourner.\nMr Adams told BBC Radio Somerset that on the day of Flo's funeral, the family was lining up outside the church on the outskirts of Watchet, when a car drew up.\n\"This middle-aged man got out of the car and his wife propelled him to push in front of my father to stand right behind the coffin.\n\"The wife said 'this is her son, this is her son',\" Mr Adams said.\n\"We just took one look at this chap and we thought, 'he is her son'. \n\"The likeness was instant,\" he said.\nThe family was in \"absolute and total shock\".\n\"It was one of those occasions in life when you actually feel that it's happening to somebody else, it's surreal,\" added Mr Adams.\nHer son, Len, chose not to stay in touch with the family, but after he died, they received \"an enormous volume of paperwork\", because he had not been legally adopted.\nMr Adams said when he began delving into the family history he discovered Aunt Flo had met an Australian serviceman at the end of WW1 and become pregnant in 1924.\n\"This chap basically did a runner and abandoned her,\" said Mr Adams. Her son Len  was then fostered.\nMr Adams said it must have been difficult for his aunt, due to the stigma at the time of having a child out of wedlock.\n\"She managed to keep the secret, but it impacted both of their lives terribly.\"\nHe said the experience helped to explain her demeanour.\n\"I think it meant that she was a very conflicted person. She had her moral views, which were the normal views for someone of her time, and she was carrying this burden, this secret.\n\"She was quite hard on us and in her own way I think she was trying to tell us that life could be tough.\"\nMr Adam's aunt remained in contact with her son and some of the letters between them are printed in the book.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Parents have described the decision to close a children's nursery with immediate effect as \"devastating, chaotic and stressful\".\nCedar Park Nursery in Enfield, north London, closed its doors on Tuesday, claiming it was due to enter administration.\nOne member of staff, who did not want to be named, told the BBC she was \"frazzled and not sleeping\".\nThe BBC has not had a response from the nursery but, in a letter to parents, one of the directors apologised for \"what will undoubtedly be a terrible inconvenience for everyone\".\nThe decision affects 117 children at the nursery which employed 37 staff, the BBC understands.\nZehra Nevzat-Unver, 37, whose 19-month-old daughter attended the nursery, said: \"It was very abrupt and confusing.

    "Saliva tests carried out at home are better at identifying men who are at higher risk of prostate cancer than the standard blood test, new research suggests.\nThe at-home test could identify genetic factors which make men more likely to develop the disease which claims around 12,000 lives a year in the UK.\nThe study was carried out by the Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.\nThey hoped the findings could \"turn the tide on prostate cancer\".\nThe research has not yet been published in a specialist journal.\nThe UK does not have a national screening programme for prostate cancer because blood tests are not considered accurate enough and can pick up non-life threatening forms of the disease over aggressive types.\nResearchers believe the cheap and simple testing method could help catch the disease earlier and save lives.\n\"It is simple from the patient's point of view... get sent a tube, put your saliva sample into it and post it off,\" consultant urologist Prof Caroline Moore said.\nSpecialising in the detection and minimally invasive treatment of prostate cancer, she told Today on BBC Radio 4 what happens to the samples.\n\"DNA is extracted from that [saliva] and analysed to look for a combination of genetic variations that are linked to prostate cancer.\"\nThe latest study involved more than 6,000 European men aged 55-69, an age bracket where the risk of developing prostate cancer is increased.\nThe researchers then used blood and saliva tests on a smaller group of those men who were found to have genetic variations in their DNA indicating a higher likelihood of developing the disease.\nPreliminary results from the research show the saliva test produced fewer false positives and picked up a higher proportion of aggressive cancers.\nCurrently, men who wish to be tested for prostate cancer need to speak to their GP and have a blood test, which measures the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in their blood.\n\"[But] we know the PSA test doesn't find all of the cancers,\" Prof Moore said, adding the men in the study had done the test, but showed normal PSA levels.\nFollowing an MRI scan and biopsy, 40% of men with high scores from the saliva test were diagnosed with prostate cancer.\nFor standard blood tests, only 25% of men with a high PSA level will actually have prostate cancer, the researchers said.\nInstitute of Cancer Research chief executive Prof Kristian Helin said the standard blood test \u201ccan cause men to go through unnecessary treatments and, more worryingly, it's missing men who do have cancer\u201d.\nNaser Turabi, director of evidence and implementation at Cancer Research UK, called the study \u201cencouraging\u201d and said \u201cmore research is now needed to confirm if this tool can save lives\u201d.\nProf Moore said the next step would be a big screening study to find the best test or the best combination of tests, looking at saliva tests, PSA tests and MRI scans, which are a modern alternative to the rectal examination.\nThe preliminary findings were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago.",
    "Hidden in a dark cellar in the bowels of a centuries-old castle is one of Northern Ireland\u2019s best kept World War Two secrets.\nFor 80 years, its basement walls have been the canvas for hundreds of hand-written messages from American soldiers preparing for D-Day.\nFrom December 1943 to February 1944, Killymoon Castle just outside Cookstown played a key role in the war effort.\nIt was the base for the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the US Army.\nUntil 1942, the British had been facing off against Nazi Germany without their greatest ally.\nThe bombing of Pearl Harbour changed all that and the first arrival of American troops to the British Isles began to gather pace between 1943 and 1944.\nIt is estimated that about 300,000 American military personnel were deployed to Northern Ireland by the end of the war.\nMore than 600 American army personnel were stationed at Killymoon Castle.\nMany of them were part of an elite parachute unit that would play a key role in the war.\nThey spent three months at Killymoon Castle before being dispatched to England for the final preparations of the operation to land in France, that would forever be known as D-Day.\nBy the end of World War Two, 153 paratroopers who stayed at Killymoon had died.\nBut the American soldiers that stayed in the rural County Tyrone castle left their mark in more ways than one.\nClarke Hill is a local historian who has helped bring the story of the American GIs and Killymoon Castle to life.\n \"When people come to the castle and I tell them the history, they can\u2019t believe it,\" he said.\n\"There are still lots of artefacts from their time here that can be found in the castle, including handbooks that the American soldiers had as a guide to Northern Ireland.\n\"There are, of course, many wonderful pictures from that time too, including the troops playing baseball on the front lawn of the castle.\"\nOfficers and senior US Army personnel stayed in the warmth of the castle and many of the rooms have now been restored to how they would have looked during this era.\nThe rest of the American troops stayed in makeshift huts that were erected on the castle grounds, the remnants of which can still be found today.\nThe cellars of the castle played host to a prison cell, a mess room and an armoury.\nKillymoon's owners have left these rooms virtually untouched, allowing handwritten messages left by US troops to survive for eight decades.\nMr Hill added: \"These walls are a hidden gem and the messages left really are an incredible part of history.\"\nThe cellar walls consist of hundreds of messages scrawled in pencil from the soldiers who called Killymoon their home during this era.\nThe handwritten messages include, names, dates of birth and regiment details as well as caricatures.\nThe wall even features a pencil drawing of Adolf Hitler.\nOne of the names on the wall reads: \"P.T \u2013 Tony J. Vickery 505 Prcht. Inf, U.S. Army, Atlanta, GA\".\nThe incredible story behind this name was unearthed by local World War Two enthusiast, Andy Glenfield.\n\"I have been to many World War Two connected sites in Northern Ireland, but I\u2019ve never come across anywhere like Killymoon,\u201d he said.\n\"When I went into that cellar basement and saw all those names, I was absolutely flabbergasted, I couldn\u2019t believe they were all still there.\n\"The reason Tony Vickery\u2019s name stood out for me is because he had given so much detail about himself, so that gave me a lot to go on in terms of researching his story.\"\nAndy was able to find out that Tony Vickery had been part of the parachute regiment in the 82nd Airborne Division and was only 18 when he stayed at Killymoon.\nHe also uncovered documents showing that the men in his company had called him \u201cthe milk bar commando\u201d because of his love of milkshakes.\nThe Georgia native had qualified as a fourth-grade technician and parachuted into Normandy on 6 June 1944.\nFive days later he was providing cover while other soldiers in his group were sleeping and a group of Germans advanced to their position.\nA firefight ensued and Tony Vickery was killed in action.\nHe was awarded the purple heart and is buried in the American Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer in Normandy.\nAfter pulling together the details of Tony Vickey\u2019s story, Andy Glenfield decided to visit his grave in France.\nHe said: \"When we were there, our guide had a little silver bucket with sand from Omaha Beach and he took the sand and wiped it into the white marble cross onto Tony\u2019s name, and it made it stand out gold.

You can't risk ordering later.\"\nMr Glynn explained that the spot rate - the current price for immediate delivery of goods - has dramatically increased in recent weeks from $4,500 to $7,500 (\u00a33,500 to \u00a35,900).\n\"This makes a massive impact on big bulky items, especially those that have low margins such as furniture, barbecues, and kitchen appliances,\" he said.\nThere was \"no way\" most online retailers could absorb those price increases on big-ticket items, he said.\n\"So unfortunately for consumers, the next few months will see significant rises on these big-ticket items,\" he added.\nDisruptions caused by Yemen's Houthi movement have limited the global supply of shipping space and containers.\nThe Houthi rebels have already launched attacks on more than 50 ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\nShipping costs have soared as a result. The average cost of shipping a 40ft container now exceeds $4,000, a 140% increase from 2023, according to freight market tracker Xeneta.\nPeter Sand, Xeneta's chief analyst, said that importers have learned many lessons from the pandemic including that \"the most straightforward way to protect supply chains is to ship as many of your goods as you can as quickly as possible\".\n\"That is what we are seeing with some businesses telling us they are already shipping cargo for the Christmas period - in May,\" he said.\nTypically, retailers start importing goods for the November Black Friday sales and Christmas shopping season between late summer and autumn.\nSue Terpilowski, from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, agreed, saying companies are realising that disruption to the Red Sea route caused by Houthi attacks could last until the autumn.\n\"To avoid headlines 'Christmas is cancelled, there's nothing in the shops', people are now actually bringing forward their shipments,\" she said. \"So they'll be here in good time allowing any eventualities that might happen while they are at sea.\"\nThe attacks on ships have forced owners of vessels travelling between Asia and Europe to take a longer route around Africa, and so ships are starting their journeys earlier to allow for the extra time needed for the diversion.\n\"The effects of the diversions from the Red Sea that started last December are only now becoming apparent, with vessels on the Asia-Europe trade needing more than 100 days on a rotation by circumventing Africa,\" said Dominique Nadelhofer, from Kuehne + Nagel, a major sea logistics firm.\nHe added that the rotation of container equipment has also been disrupted, and said only around 50% of global container shipping is currently completed on time.\nAs well as concerns about potential future Houthi attacks, there are also growing fears that as naval forces focus on countering the Houthi rebels, the resulting reduction in maritime patrols elsewhere may provide Somali pirates with opportunities to increase their activities.",

    "Cameras installed to catch drivers jumping red lights at a road junction in Hull have generated a debate online.\nHull city council had the cameras placed at the junction at Mount Pleasant and Holderness Road to try to reduce accidents. \nPeople sharing their views online said the junction was a \u201cnightmare\u201d but others thought that the cameras would be a \u201cnice income\u201d for the council.\nThe cameras have been installed at the junction but do not come into force until 1 July.\nThe Local Democracy service said eight of the 23 collisions recorded at the junction in the last five years were due to drivers ignoring traffic signals.\nThe Council awarded a contract worth \u00a3240,448  to install the cameras because they said the junction had become an \"accident hotspot\".\nLocal people took to social media to air their views.

    "Labour is promising to give businesses more flexibility over how they spend government money currently earmarked for apprenticeships if they win the July election.\nShadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson says the party will allow businesses to use up to 50% of the cash provided by the government to fund apprenticeships or training for existing staff.\nLabour previously outlined the plan to \"tackle skills shortages\" but the announcement gives more detail on how it hopes it would work in practice.\nIt comes after the Conservatives said they would scrap some university courses to fund more apprenticeships.\nThe Conservative Party said Labour\u2019s proposal was \"ill thought through\".\nApprenticeships are partly funded by money raised through taxes, as well as through an \"apprenticeship levy\" paid by bigger businesses with an annual wage bill of more than \u00a33m.\nThose firms, as well as smaller businesses, can then use that money to train apprentices.\nLabour's plans for what it has termed a \"growth and skills levy\" involve giving businesses the choice to spend up to half of the money they receive to train existing staff in \"high-level technical skills\" such as retrofitting or engineering.\nUnder the plans, employers could also offer \"pre-apprenticeship training\" courses to prepare people for full apprenticeships or jobs.\nA minimum of 50% of the money from the levy would still be reserved for apprenticeships.\nThey say that any courses will need to be from an approved list of essential skills, which could include areas like digital and green skills, social care or childcare and that businesses would not be able to use it on internal training such as HR or health and safety.\nLabour said that if businesses used just 3% of the additional flexibility, it could generate 150,000 traineeships for young people.\nBridget Phillipson said the plans would create a \"golden age of lifelong learning\".\nShe added: \"Labour will put businesses in the driving seat of creating the opportunities people need to get on in work.\"\nA spokesperson for the party said they had no plans to increase the levy.\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan said Labour's plans would halve the number of apprenticeships and disadvantage small and medium-sized businesses.\n\u201cSince 2010, we have built a world-class apprenticeship system from the ground up... creating pathways to 70% of occupations through apprenticeships.\" \nThe Liberal Democrats said its own plans involved giving every adult a \"pot of money\" over their working life to spend on education and retraining.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that in order for apprenticeship plans laid out by any party to be a success, more businesses need to be convinced to take up the funding available.\nImran Tahir, a Research Economist at the IFS, said: \u201cBoth main parties have now set out aspirations to increase the number of employees - and especially young employees - in training or apprenticeships.\n\"Ultimately, employers will decide how to use the funding, and presently many are choosing not to take up the funding that is available. \n\"If these new programmes are to benefit the youngest employees, either party would have to convince employers shift their current patterns, which see nearly half of apprenticeships funded by the levy being taken by employees aged 25 and up.\"\nDavid Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said the plans were a \"good first step\" in transforming the current apprenticeships levy which, he says, \"has not delivered for young people\".\nHe added: \"I would like to see more commitment to grow training and skills funding in colleges for those adults who need to learn in a rapidly changing world. \n\"Without an urgent and significant growth in opportunities in colleges, millions of adults risk being left behind as technology changes.\"\nAccording to the IFS, average employer spending on training has fallen by 27% in real terms since 2011, and public spending on adult education and skills is down 31% over the same period.\nThe number of adults on further education courses has declined by around 50% since 2010, from roughly 3.5 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2023.\nThe number of people completing apprenticeships has also fallen in recent years.\nIn England, 54.6% of apprentices completed and passed a final assessment in 2022-23, which is far below the government's 67% target by the end of 2024-25.\nA report by the Department for Education in March 2022 suggested that four in 10 people who did not complete their apprenticeships cited personal reasons such as mental health issues, caring responsibilities or career changes. \nHowever, about four in 10 also said that the apprenticeship was badly run, they were not given enough time for training or that it did not meet their expectations.\nThere are no UK-wide figures for the number of apprentices, but there were 752,200 in England in 2023, which is higher than during disruption from the Covid pandemic, but lower than in the mid-2010s.\nAdd",

    "The UK ambassador to Mexico reportedly left his post earlier this year after he pointed a gun at a local member of embassy staff.\nA video posted on social media, originally reported by the Financial Times, purports to show Jon Benjamin aiming a rifle at another man while looking down the weapon's sights.\nIt was captioned: \"In [the] context of daily killings in Mexico by drug dealers, he dares to joke.\"\nMr Benjamin hasn't commented so far on what appears to have been a badly misplaced joke. \nNo official announcement about Mr Benjamin's position has been made by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). But he is no longer listed as ambassador to Mexico on the government's official website, which says he was in post \"between 2021 and 2024\".\nIn the video, a man resembling Mr Benjamin can be seen moving a weapon around the car, aiming it at different people. Laughter can be heard in the background. One man is seen gesturing uncomfortably as the weapon is aimed at him.\nMr Benjamin arrived in Mexico from previous postings including Ghana and Chile with a reputation as quite unconventional by the standards of most UK diplomats. \nHe was very active on social media with a large following on X. He could be quite outspoken, sometimes directly answering followers on issues he was passionate about - particularly African politics, football and rock music. It was part of a more approachable, less stuffy persona than that conveyed by other ambassadors.\nIn Mexico, as in most of his previous postings, Mr Benjamin was a firm believer in the role of the soft power of British rock and indie music. An avid music fan himself, he encouraged major UK bands and artists to visit Mexico, sometimes hosting them in his residence ahead of their concerts. \nFor decades, for example, he was the Rolling Stones' chief point of contact within the FCDO, helping the supergroup to negotiate the tangled paperwork of performing live events around the world.\nHe always appeared fascinated and well-engaged in Mexico from the start of his posting in 2021, travelling to many of its 32 states. It was on one of those trips, to the drug-cartel controlled states of Sinaloa and Durango, that the incident with his staff took place.\nOver 30,000 people were murdered in Mexico last year. The country has extremely restrictive gun laws, and is home to only one gun shop, housed in a Mexico City military complex.\nThat the ambassador was seen to brandish a gun at his team amid so many annual murders from drug-related violence in Mexico has struck even more of a nerve among the embassy staff affected - and many Mexicans.\nEven if intended as a joke, that it took place with an apparently loaded machine gun in one of the most dangerous regions of Mexico was a serious miscalculation.\nWhat was supposed to be a routine trip to northern Mexico has seemingly brought an ignominious end to a very long and otherwise distinguished career in the FCDO.\nAn FCDO spokesperson said: \"We are aware of this incident and have taken appropriate action.\n\"Where internal issues do arise the FCDO has robust HR processes to address them.\"\nThe BBC has contacted Mr Benjamin for comment.\n",

Her life was school, school, school.

    "Thousands of people are attending a two-day air show to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. \nWorld War Two aircraft have taken to the skies at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) at Duxford, Cambridgeshire, joined by historical re-enactors on the ground.\nAir show event manager Phil Hood said: \"So many people gave their lives on D-Day and we want to make sure we do that justice.\"\nHe is expecting about 40,000 people to attend the Duxford Summer Air Show: D-Day 80 weekend.\n\nThe D-Day landings, also known as Operation Overlord, was one of the most decisive military campaigns of World War Two.\nIt saw 156,000 Allied troops arrive in Normandy on 6 June 1944 for a combined naval, air and land assault on Nazi-occupied France.\nAt this point, Duxford airfield was the headquarters of the 78th Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces' 8th Air Force, flying fighter aircraft such as P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs.\n\"Only a very few of the objectives for D-Day were reached at the end of 6 June, but it was enough for the Allies to get a foothold into Europe to then go further,\" said historical re-enactor Mark Bailey.\nHe runs an educational project called Discover D-Day, based in Attleborough, Norfolk, which is \"mainly about the American Airborne and Army in the last year of the Second World War\". \n\"We cover a very wide range of things,\" he said. \"We cover a lot of things to do with engineers, we talk about explosives, the way weapons were developed during the war.\n\"We also talk about poeple who were forgotten, so the people who would do all the clerical work, paying of the troops making sure they had the right equipment in the right place at the right time.\"\nBrian Johnson, who travelled from Michigan in the United States to attend, said: \"My grandfather was a B-24 captain in the 15th Air Force, stationed out of Italy and Libya, so to be able to see something like this come back to life is really unique and a special treat.\"\n\"The preservation of history is very important to make sure it doesn't repeat itself and these aircraft are probably not going to be airworthy forever.\n\"It's really quite a special thing to get the chance to see them operate while they still are.\"\nHe was accompanying his father Donald Johnson, who admitted he found the event \"emotional\" as it reminded him of his World War Two pilot dad. \nMr Johnson, a captain in the Civil Air Patrol from Chicago, Illinois, wanted \"to catch this incredible event that you have going on here\".\nHe added it was important to remember what was achieved by the people who took part in D-Day - \"what they did was beyond belief\". \nJack McCombie, a World War Two re-enactor who dresses as a US pilot, wanted to \"commemorate D-Day and honour the sacrifice they went through 80 years\" ago. \nHe said: \"I came here from Wolverhampton today with my family, who are also re-enacting. \n\"Remembering D-Day is very important and a lot of the future generation don't see that, especially the scale and what they were went through.\"\nA fleet of Dakotas will take part in the flypasts at the event, as will Spitfires - which flew out of Duxford during the Battle of Britain. \nMr Hood said the air show had taken months of planning and the museum had been in discussions with the United States-based D-Day Squadron of Dakotas about its attendance for two years. \n\"A lot of the activities on the ground here have a D-Day theme, with lots of living history groups recreating how Duxford would have felt during D-Day, and from a flying perspective it focuses on the commemorating of D-Day but sticks true to the Duxford Summer Air Show being a little bit of something for everyone,\" Mr Hood added.\n\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A man armed with two knives who was shot dead by a City of London Police officer in Westminster was lawfully killed, a jury at an inquest has concluded.\nHassan Yahya, 30, was Tasered and fatally shot by police on 8 March 2020.\nDuring the incident, a Metropolitan Police officer tried to Taser Mr Yahya in Northumberland Avenue before he moved towards Great Scotland Yard in central London.\nA jury at Inner West London Coroner's Court returned a finding on Friday that he was lawfully killed.\nAfter the inquest concluded on Friday the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) released the findings of its investigation that were carried out in 2021.\nThe watchdog said the actions of the City of London Police firearms officer who shot Mr Yahya were reasonable in the circumstances, when considering the risk the officer perceived to his life.\nIt found no indication any officers should face disciplinary action or had committed a criminal offence.\nAlthough no officers were found to have breached the police standards of professional behaviour following the IOPC investigation, three City of London Police officers underwent the reflective practice review process over failures to activate their body-worn video during the incident.\nOn the night Mr Yahya died, two Ministry of Defence Police officers were conducting mobile patrols in a marked police vehicle, the IOPC said.\nAt about 23:20 GMT the previous evening they were driving along Upper Ground, on the South Bank, and came across Mr Yahya before leaving their vehicle to speak to him, thinking he may be lost.\nHowever, Mr Yahya produced two knives and both officers discharged their Tasers.\nOne of the officers activated his emergency button and officers from the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police responded to the call for assistance.\nThe IOPC said Mr Yahya ran away from officers over Hungerford Bridge and on to Northumberland Avenue where a Met Police officer discharged his Taser, but all the Taser discharges at this stage were ineffective.\nMr Yahya then ran on to Great Scotland Yard, where a City of London Police officer discharged his Taser and another City of London Police officer fired a single shot at 23:34 GMT which hit Mr Yahya, the IOPC continued.\nThe watchdog said he was placed in handcuffs and given emergency first aid by the officers but was pronounced dead at the scene at 00:16 GMT. Two knives were recovered from the scene.\nIOPC regional director Charmaine Arbouin said: \"During the course of the officers' interactions with Mr Yahya, they made numerous attempts to apprehend him using non-lethal force - including multiple discharges of Taser over a five-minute period, which proved ineffective.\"\n\"The officer who shot Mr Yahya said he feared for his life as Mr Yahya moved toward him while holding two knives,\" she continued.\n\"Our investigation reviewed all available CCTV footage which showed Mr Yahya stepping towards officers, holding a knife, when he was then fatally shot.\n\"Based on the available evidence, we found that the decision to shoot Mr Yahya was reasonable in the circumstances, due to the threat the officer perceived to his life.\"\nIOPC investigators attended the scene and examined more than 50 witness statements from police officers and members of the public, along with medical records for Mr Yahya which showed he had been receiving treatment for mental health issues for several years.\nHowever, the police officers who interacted with him on the night did not know about his mental health background, the IOPC added.\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

    "The key to hit TV show Bridgerton\u2019s success is that people from \"every country can watch the show and see themselves in it,\" an actress on the show has said. \nBanita Sandhu, who plays Miss Malhotra in the Netflix period drama, said characters with different ethnicities had significant storylines and were not just \"ornamental\".\nBridgerton, now on its third series, is set in early 19th Century high society in London and has been described as a \"Regency-era Gossip Girl\". \nBanita, 26, grew up in Caerleon, Newport, after her grandparents moved to Britain from Punjab, northern India, shortly after World War Two, with both her parents born in the UK. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales, she said the so-called \"colour blind\" casting in Bridgerton made it a very \"warm and inviting\" set to be on. \nShe said it was common on British productions for her to be the only actress of south Asian heritage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s already a struggle being an actor, but being an actor of colour is another struggle,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping this has paved the way for those stories finally to be told, so that we have a better understanding of our history and our place in the United Kingdom,\u201d she said.\nShe added that the reason the show is so popular worldwide is \u201cbecause every person from every country can watch the show and see themselves in it, and see themselves with a significant storyline, and not just as something ornamental\u201d.\n\u201cAnd I think that's the most wonderful part about the show, and especially for me as an Indian actress to be on that set with so many different people of colour, and to have very shared experiences,\u201d she said.\nBut she was keen to point out that Bridgerton\u2019s diverse casting is not just a creative liberty, and that there were Indian families in British high society at the time, including a royal family from Punjab, as well as the Indian godchild of Queen Victoria. \nThe first four episodes of series three of Bridgerton were released earlier this month, with the final episodes out on Netflix on 13 June.\nThe series has already notched up more than 25 million views in the UK, according to the streamer. \nThe latest series focuses on a blossoming romance between Lady Penelope Featherington (played by Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton).\nIt continues to be narrated by the mysterious Lady Whistledown, who writes newsletters full of tittle-tattle about the dating exploits of high society. At the end of season one, her identity was revealed to be Lady Penelope.\nAs Miss Malhotra, on the hunt for a husband, Banita attended the balls that appeared in the series, dressed in the costume department\u2019s lavish finery.\n\u201cEvery week the costume team would surprise me and bring even bigger stuff,\u201d she said, adding that she loved the detail put into them, as well that many of the costumes were recycled.\n\u201cIt was just such craftsmanship \u2013 it was amazing. I think my favourite was the pink one that I wear when Lady [Whistledown] was speaking about me,\u201d she said.\nHowever, she acknowledged that some of the costumes were difficult to wear, including a headdress that included an enormous white feather.\n\"I felt like I was 7ft tall. It was amazing,\" she said.\n\"You have to bow and you\u2019re trying to balance the feather and not fall and look graceful at the time same time.\n\"But I can say I\u2019ve worn a feather on my head that\u2019s that big now.\"",
    "A dentist based in Stoke-on-Trent has said she believes it would be impossible to return to universal NHS dental coverage.\nDr Zoey Wray, who has left the health service, claims many colleagues believe the answer is a core NHS service covering the basics.\nThe British Dental Association has said that NHS dentistry is in crisis across the West Midlands.\nAll the main political parties are setting out plans to revive it, but none have explained how they would be funded.\nDr Wray said she could never return to NHS dentistry because the 2006 contract, introduced by a Labour government, pays the same for treating a patient for one filling as it would for providing them with 10 fillings.\n\"Many of my colleagues believe that providing a core service for people that can't afford private dentistry and for children is the way forward, but not providing them with everything that is available to dentistry,\" she said.\n\"That\u2019s quite a difficult thing for governments to contemplate, because it's not very popular with everyone.\"\nEddie Crouch, chair of the British Dental Association, said there were problems accessing NHS dentistry services in the West Midlands, particularly in some inner city areas like Stoke-on-Trent and rural areas like Herefordshire and Shropshire.\nThe picture is complex though. Official data shows the number of dentists providing an NHS service has remained the same across the West Midlands between 2018 and 2022.\nHowever, there are 73 fewer in the Black Country and 60 more in Birmingham and Solihull.\nThe real issue is that they are providing far less NHS dental activity - about 18% less nationally.\nHealthwatch Stoke-on-Trent, which represents the public, said 73% of patients surveyed in 2022 found it hard to see an NHS dentist - 62.5% had not seen an NHS dentist for two years.\nMr Crouch said: \"We have seen a significant reduction in the number of dentists wanting to commit to NHS dentistry and I think that the general election is a tipping point for NHS dentistry. \n\"There is an opportunity to save it depending on the political agenda of the new government.\"\nThe Conservatives say that they introduced a dental plan in February. \nThey are offering dentists \u00a320,000 to deliver care in areas where finding a dentist is difficult. They also plan to increase undergraduate training places by 40% by 2031, tying in new dentists to work in NHS dentistry for three years .\nThey are also offering incentives to take on new patients.\nLabour is matching the \u00a320,000 incentive scheme to attract dentists to hard-to-recruit areas and will provide 700,000 extra emergency appointments. \nIt wants a toothbrushing scheme in schools for three to five-year-olds in the most deprived areas and believes a new dental contract is key.\nIt has committed from \"day one\" of a new government to sit down and negotiate a new dental contract.\nThe Liberal Democrats are campaigning to reduce tooth decay - the most common reason for six to 10-year-olds to be admitted to hospital. \nThey would guarantee access to NHS dentistry for children, mothers and those on low incomes.\nThe Green Party is also calling for a new NHS contract to end the dental deserts in rural areas. \nReform UK says it would put patients in charge by giving them a voucher for private treatment if they cannot see an NHS dentist.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "There is an \"undemocratic culture\" within Labour, a former member of the party's National Executive Committee has said. \nDarren Williams claimed some Welsh general election candidates have been \"imposed\" on local members with \"no previous connections\" to their area.\nTwo new Labour candidates were announced on Friday \u2013 Torsten Bell for Swansea West and Alex Barros Curtis for Cardiff West.\nWelsh Labour said its Welsh Executive Committee and local members were part of the panel for choosing candidates.\nBut Mr Williams, a Labour member for 35 years and a member of the Cardiff West Constituency Labour Party Executive, said members in that constituency had \"no meaningful input into this decision\".\nHe added that the selection process and announcement, which came as a shock many members in Cardiff West and Swansea West, was \"a reflection of the undemocratic culture of the Labour Party under the current leadership\".\nMr Williams also disputed Welsh Labour\u2019s statement that the decision was made by local members.\n\"Although two constituency Labour Party officers were part of the selection panel, they were outnumbered by members of Welsh Executive Committee \u2013 with the latter having effectively imposed a candidate who is a party functionary, effectively chosen by the UK leadership,\" he said. \n\"The outcome of the selections in Cardiff West and in Swansea West suggest the Welsh Executive Committee members involved acted in the interest of the UK Labour leadership rather than in the interest of the party membership in Wales.\"\nAnother Labour member and councillor in Swansea West, Ceri Evans, also criticised the process, saying it \"flies in face of assurances by Keir Starmer that all MPs will be decided by constituency Labour parties.\"\n\"That clearly hasn\u2019t happened here. It can\u2019t be a coincidence that the candidate here is from London,\" Mr Evans added.\n\"The wishes of Swansea West members are not being considered at all in this process.\u201d\nAnother member told BBC Wales that the \u201crole of the constituency Labour parties are being eroded and there are questions for the Welsh leadership on their impact on this decision making process.\"\nAlex Barros-Curtis, who has been chosen to stand in Cardiff West, grew up in north Wales and has served as the UK Labour Party\u2019s executive director of legal affairs.\nTorsten Bell, the candidate chosen for Swansea West, is chief executive of the economic think tank the Resolution Foundation and a former Labour treasury adviser.\nIn May, Mr Bell wrote an article in the Guardian arguing in favour of lifting the UK government\u2019s two-child benefit cap, saying scrapping it would \u201cimmediately lift about half a million children out of poverty.\u201d \nThis is despite the current UK Labour policy to keep the cap.\nPlaid Cymru MS Sioned Williams said: \u201cWhen Labour candidates are parachuted into Welsh seats, the least voters should expect is transparency on where they stand on important issues.\n\u201cKeir Starmer is notorious for wanting every Labour candidate to sing from the same hymn sheet and Mr Bell should come clean on whether his loyalty to the Labour whip is more important than his independence of thought.\u201d\nAnnouncing the selection of both candidates, Welsh Labour said: \"We\u2019re pleased that despite the expedited process, the panels were formed by representatives from the Welsh executive committee and local members.\n\"Torsten brings a wealth of experience in economic policy and tackling child poverty.

    "North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un plans to meet President Putin this month about potentially providing Moscow with weapons for its war in Ukraine, according to a US official.\nThere are concerns that in return, North Korea may seek advanced weapons technology from Russia.\nNorth Korea has continued regular tests of its missiles this year, after a significant increase in tests carried out in 2022. \nNorth Korea has tested a variety of ballistic and cruise missiles in recent years. \nIt's also tested hypersonic missiles, which can fly at several times the speed of sound and at low altitude to escape radar detection, as well as others launched from submarines.\nIn April, North Korea tested what it called \"its most powerful\" missile to date - the Hwasong-18. It's a solid-fuel missile, which are generally quicker to launch than liquid-fuel ones.\nIt reportedly flew about 1,000km on its maiden flight, but its true range is estimated to be in excess of 15,000km, according to the US-based CSIS Missile Defense Project. \nA second test launch in July 2023 saw a Hwasong-18 reach a claimed altitude of over 6,600km, with a flight time of 74 minutes.\nIn November last year, an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested at a high angle, short-range trajectory. Launched at a lower trajectory, this same missile could have reached the US mainland, according to the Japanese government.\nImages from North Korean state media of Kim Jong-un with his daughter at the launch appear to show it was the Hwasong-17 - or possibly a modified version of it.\nThe missile is believed to have a range of 15,000km or more, and could potentially carry three or four warheads, rather than only one. Several earlier attempts to launch the Hwasong-17 are thought to have failed, although it may have been used in a test carried out in March 2022.\nIn October last year, North Korea fired another type of missile which flew over Japan - thought to have been the intermediate-range Hwasong-12. This can travel up to 4,500km - putting the US island of Guam in the Pacific within range.\nNorth Korea has also been testing the Hwasong-14 ballistic missile with a range of 8,000km - although some studies suggest it could travel as far as 10,000km, making it capable of reaching New York. \nAnd there is the Hwasong-15 missile, which is believed to have a range of 13,000km, putting all of the continental US in its sights.\nNorth Korea tested a record number of missiles in 2022, including ones capable of reaching US territory.\nThe last time North Korea tested a nuclear bomb was in 2017. The explosion at its Punggye-ri test site had a force, or \"yield\", of between 100-370 kilotons. \nA 100 kiloton bomb is six times more powerful than the one the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.\nNorth Korea claimed this was its first thermonuclear device - the most powerful of all types of atomic weapon.\nHowever, North Korea may be aiming to test a smaller type of nuclear warhead with similar explosive force, according to Joseph Byrne, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.\n\"It seems they are now testing a new capability - a miniaturised warhead that can be fitted onto a range of missiles, including short-range missiles\" he says. \nSix underground tests have previously been carried out at Punggye-ri. However, in 2018 North Korea said it would shut the site down, because it had \"verified\" its nuclear capabilities.\nSome of the tunnels into the site were subsequently blown up in the presence of foreign journalists. However, North Korea did not invite international experts to verify if it had been put beyond use.\nIn 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a promise to then-US president Donald Trump that North Korea would destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities.\nHowever, the UN's atomic energy agency, the IAEA, says satellite images suggest that North Korea has restarted the reactor which makes its weapons-grade plutonium.\nIn September 2022, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said there were signs that a test site at Punggye-ri was open again.  And in March this year, Mr Grossi said that activity there as well as at Yongbyon was \"deeply regrettable.\"\nThe IAEA has not had physical access to North Korea's nuclear facilities since April 2009.",
    "No serving leader in the European Union has led their country for as long as Viktor Orban. \nSince 2010, he has transformed Hungary into what the European Parliament has denounced as a \"hybrid regime of electoral autocracy\". He appears uncertain how to describe his own invention, trying both \"illiberal democracy\" and \"Christian liberty\".\nEither way, he has learned to maintain and constantly strengthen his grip on power, but has found himself at the centre of the most difficult moment of his 14 years at the top.\nTwo close allies, the president and former justice minister, resigned over a pardon given to a man in a paedophile case.\nHe has repeatedly clashed with European Union colleagues on migration and the war in Ukraine.\nHungary also finds itself the only Nato member country not to have approved Swedish membership, even though its prime minister claims to be in favour. \nAndras Kosa entitled his biography of Viktor Orban, Man of Chaos, suggesting he has a way of presenting himself as the only solution to a mess created by others. \nWhen toxic red sludge from a bauxite mine engulfed a Hungarian valley and threatened the Danube shore in 2010, he rolled up his sleeves and stacked sandbags alongside firemen and volunteers.\nAfter 14 years of uninterrupted rule, Viktor Orban's personal charisma is an unquestionable ingredient of his success, alongside an ability to \"think on the ball\", as his ex-football trainer once remarked. \nFormer political adviser George Birnbaum remembers \"a very intellectually smart individual\" with a \"well educated, intellectually deep knowledge of things, which is very rare,\" he told the BBC.\nViktor Orban first made his mark on Hungary in the late 1980s, as the Soviet Union began to fall apart, setting up a political movement called Fidesz, or Alliance of Young Democrats.\nHe was still a law student at Bibo College in the capital, Budapest, when in 1989 he delivered an audacious, seven-minute speech calling on the Soviet Red Army to go home.\n\"If we believe in our own power, we are able to finish the communist dictatorship,\" he declared to an estimated quarter of a million Hungarians gathered in the city's Heroes' Square for the reburial of the man behind Hungary's failed uprising in 1956, Imre Nagy.\nReflecting on his words 10 years later, he said he had \"exposed everyone's silent desire for free elections, and an independent and democratic Hungary\".\nBut the democracy that replaced authoritarian rule has changed dramatically in recent years, with widespread complaints of backsliding. \nVeteran Hungarian-born journalist Paul Lendvai sees a staggering reversal in Viktor Orban - \"from one of the most promising defenders of Hungarian democracy into the chief author of its demise\".\nProf Andras Bozoki, a former culture minister, describes Hungary since 2010 as being \"the only one former consolidated liberal democracy in the EU that has reached the level of a non-democratic system as a hybrid regime\".\nFor a Central European leader whose political infancy was rooted in the fall of Russia's hegemony, it seems odd he has become the closest ally in the EU of a Russian president who views the Soviet collapse as the \"greatest geopolitical catastrophe\" of the 20th Century, and one who began the biggest war on European soil since World War Two.\nViktor Orban was born in 1963 an hour to the west of Budapest, the eldest of three sons whose father was an agricultural engineer and Communist Party member and whose mother was a special needs teacher. \nThey had no running water at the family home in Felcsut, a village of fewer than 2,000 people where he still owns a house.\nIn an 1989 interview, he recalls being beaten twice a year by his father, Gyozo, whom he describes as a violent man: \"When he beat me, he also shouted. I remember all this as a bad experience.\"\nNothing about his childhood suggested that he would go on to challenge the communist regime. He attended a grammar school and was involved in the Young Communist League.\nHis main interest was football, playing for his local club, FC Felcsut, and he remains highly enthusiastic about his childhood sport. Ten years ago, he inaugurated a controversial new stadium there called the Pancho Arena, where top-flight team Puskas Akademia play to audiences of a few hundred.\nIn the months before he went to university, he carried out his military service, where he says he turned down an approach from the communist secret services to become an informer. \nHe was 23 when he married fellow student Aniko Levai, whom he met at university. They have five children, four daughters and a son, Gaspar, who was trained by the British Army at Sandhurst and serves as an officer in the Hungarian army in Chad.\nAfter his 1989 speech to a large crowd in Heroes' Square, he went on to study liberal political philosophy briefly at Oxford. His scholarship was funded by Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a benefactor he would turn against years later.\nWithin months he had ",

    "A university professor is swapping the lecture theatre for the red carpet as his books are being turned into a Hollywood movie.\nFilming is underway on Giant, which will tell the story of former world featherweight champion boxer Prince Naseem Hamed.\nStarring Pierce Brosnan and Amir El-Masry, it has been inspired by two books written by Edge Hill University psychology professor Geoff Beattie, who trained at the same gym as Naseem and charted his rise.\n\"I was approached for the rights years ago and I thought nothing will ever happen and suddenly here it is,\" he said.\nHe said: \"I'd written the books quite a few years ago and I wasn't expecting anything like this, I was shocked.\"\nThe books - written in the 1990s - focus on Brendan Ingle\u2019s famous gym in Wincobank in Sheffield and explore boxing in precarious economic times after the pit closures and the decline of the steel industry. \n\u201cWe got on brilliantly and became close,\" Professor Beattie said of Ingle, played by former James Bond star Pierce Brosnan.\n\"He would tell me what was on his mind, and we would have some very personal chats.\"\nAmong those training at the gym was boxer Prince Naseem Hamed who went on to become Britain\u2019s most successful featherweight boxer.\n\"I immersed myself in that culture, writing about what I saw,\" Prof Beattie said. \n\"Following this Naseem Hamed all the way up, and looking at the development of this father-son relationship between him and Brendan, which eventually all turned sour.\u201d\nHamed is played by Amir El-Masry and the film's executive producer is Sylvester Stallone.\n\"The books are the background to the whole thing,\" Prof Beattie said.\n\"The writer and director is Rowan Athale who came to see me early on and he sent me the script which I though was really good. \n\"He's taken all of the details from the books, and some of the dialogue, some of the conversations and so on and put them into the script.\"\nHe said: \"Boxers are interesting characters from a psychology point of view, how you turn a young guy from Wincobank into a world title holder.\"\nWhile researching his books, Prof Beattie also trained at Ingle\u2019s gym which launched the careers of a string of famed boxers including Hamed and fellow world champions Johnny Nelson, Junior Witter and Kell Brook.\n\"I took up training to get a feel for the whole thing, to get a taste for boxing,\" he said. \n\"I got into the ring and wasn't really expecting what happened next.

    "People living on quiet streets in Bradford will be able to apply to have their roads temporarily closed to traffic in a bid to get children more active.\nThe new Play Streets initiative aims to tackle the problem of inactivity in many of the district\u2019s children, with a recent study having found nearly two thirds of youngsters in some areas were not getting enough exercise.\nThe scheme, run by Bradford Council, will allow residents living on residential streets or cul-de-sacs to apply to close their streets for between one and three hours so that children can safely spend more time outside.\nThe council says the sessions could also provide a chance to bring neighbours together and bring a sense of community spirit.\nA study by the Born in Bradford research programme found 64% of nine and 10-year-olds were not getting their recommended amount of daily exercise and spent up to 70% of their day sitting down, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nCouncillor Sue Duffy, Portfolio Holder for Children and Families and Living Well, said: \u201cThere is a real need in Bradford to create more opportunities for our children to play outside as this has huge, long-term benefits to their physical health and mental wellbeing.\u201d\nThe launch initiative follows a successful pilot scheme at two separate streets. \nResidents and communities who wished to hold a Play Street session should begin by speaking to their neighbours to gather support and find the most convenient dates and times for the sessions to take place, the council said.\nThey can then apply on the Bradford Council website.\nThe local authority said it would typically take around four weeks to process an application and once approved,  \"road closed\" signs and cones would be provided.\nTo minimise disruption, residents would still be allowed vehicle access to and from their homes during the Play Street session.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "A visually impaired commuter from Sheffield has said she feels at constant risk during her daily walk to work because of the danger posed by e-bikes.\nChloe Firth, 24, is registered blind and said that despite many streets in the city centre being pedestrianised, some cyclists ignore the restrictions.\nShe said she is particularly vulnerable around e-bikes because, despite their potential speed, they are virtually silent.\nA council spokesperson said while the city had the \"potential to be the e-bike capital of the UK\", it was working with police to crack down on illegal use.\nAnyone over the age of 14 can ride an e-bike without needing a licence, but by law the motor must have a maximum power output of 250W.\nThis restriction limits the e-bike's speed to 15.5mph (25km/h) and it must also have pedals to be classed as a bicycle rather than a motorcycle.\nMs Firth was diagnosed as partially sighted at the age of five but her vision has deteriorated in recent years.\nShe has corneal decompensation, which she describes as \"extreme double vision\", and nystagmus, an involuntary shaking of the eye.\nOn her commute to work, Ms Firth said she walks down the Moor in the city centre, and often feels \"scared\" when passed by fast e-bike users.\nShe told the BBC: \"They whip in and out between crowds which is fine when you can see people coming, but I can\u2019t see anything at all on my right side and only when they are very close on my left. I can\u2019t move out of the way of the danger fast enough.\"\nMs Firth said another hazard faced by the visually impaired was \"pavement clutter\", when delivery drivers leave their bikes in the centre of the pavement while dropping off food.\nShe said: \"I have managed to get my cane stuck in between the wheels of the bike. Other friends of mine have even fallen over parked bikes.\"\nChloe's concerns are shared by the Sheffield Royal Society for the Blind.\nChief executive Joanne Ardern said: \"We have noticed e-bikes weaving in and out of pedestrians on pavements and in pedestrian areas, sometimes without lights on in the dark too.\n\"We realise that people and organisations do not deliberately set out to cause problems for our clients, but many of us who are lucky enough to have good sight or mobility may take it for granted and just don\u2019t think about consequences for others.\"\nCycling UK's senior policy officer Monica Scigliano, who lives in Sheffield, said a distinction needed to be made between the different types of e-bike, with many of the concerns being around illegal bikes that are \"too powerful\".\nShe said: \"We do not condone this sort of behaviour; cyclists have to take responsibility to watch out for pedestrians.\n\"We have to remember that some of these vehicles which pedestrians are worried about are being ridden without pedals faster than 15.5mph. These are motorbikes and we should start calling them that.\"\nCouncillor Ben Miskell, chair of transport, regeneration and climate at Sheffield City Council, said: \"We want streets to feel safe and welcoming for everyone and we\u2019re transforming the city centre to make it a place that everyone can feel proud of.\n\"Sheffield is a city built on seven hills and has the potential to be the e-bike capital of the UK.\n\"However, e-bikes that have been modified to assist a cyclist above 15.5mph are illegal and are causing problems in towns and cities across the UK.\n\"We are determined to work with South Yorkshire Police and food delivery companies to tackle the problem.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "An \"ultra-sensitive\" new blood test can predict if breast cancer will return years before the disease shows up on scans, researchers say.\nIt picks up traces of a tumour's DNA before a full relapse and was found to be 100% accurate at predicting which patients would see their cancer return.\nIt is hoped that the test can allow treatment to start earlier and improve survival rates.\nThe UK research has been branded \"incredibly exciting\" by experts but is still in its early stages.\nBreast cancer is the most common form of the disease worldwide, with 2.26 million women diagnosed in 2020 and 685,000 deaths in the same year, according to Breast Cancer UK. \nA team of researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) London conducted the trial on 78 patients with different types of early breast cancer.\nThe \"liquid biopsy\" looked for 1,800 mutations in the patients' blood which are released by cancer cells. \nThese circulating tumour DNA were found in 11 women, who all saw their cancer relapse. No other women saw their cancer return. \nOn average, the blood test detected cancer 15 months before symptoms appeared or the illness showed up on scans,  according to results presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago on Sunday.\nThe earliest detection was 41 months before a scan confirmed the diagnosis. \nLead researcher Dr Isaac Garcia-Murillas, from the ICR, said: \"Breast cancer cells can remain in the body after surgery and other treatments but there can be so few of these cells that they are undetectable on follow-up scans.\"\nHe added that the cells can cause patients to relapse many years after their initial treatment.\nDr Garcia-Murillas said the study lays the groundwork for better post-treatment monitoring and potentially life-extending treatment.\nResearchers tested blood samples at the point of diagnosis, then again following surgery and chemotherapy.\nThese tests were then repeated every three months for the next year and every six months for the next five years.\nDr Simon Vincent, director of research, support and influencing at Breast Cancer Now - which part-funded the study - said: \"Early detection is one of our greatest weapons against breast cancer and these initial findings, which suggests new tests could be able to detect signs of breast cancer recurrence over a year before symptoms emerge, are incredibly exciting.\"\nThough acknowledging that the research was still in its early stages, he said catching breast cancer recurrence earlier means treatment is much more likely to destroy the cancer and stop it spreading to other parts of the body and becoming incurable. \nDr Vincent continued: \"With around 11,000 people dying every year in the UK from secondary breast cancer, breakthroughs like these are urgently needed so that we can stop people losing their lives to this devastating disease.\"\nIt is unclear when the test could become widely available. \nThe news follows a number of developments in cancer research in the past week.\nIt comes after saliva tests carried out at home were found to be better at identifying men at higher risk of prostate cancer than standard blood tests.\nAnd on Friday it was announced that thousands of NHS cancer patients in England are expected to get access to trials of a new type of treatment using personalised vaccines to fight their disease.\nBut on Monday a cancer charity said the number of melanoma skin-cancer cases in the UK was expected to hit record levels.",
    "Two far-right Israeli ministers have threatened to quit and collapse the governing coalition if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agrees to a Gaza ceasefire proposal unveiled by US President Joe Biden on Friday.\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said they were opposed to striking any deal before Hamas was destroyed.\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid has pledged to back the government if Mr Netanyahu supported the plan.\nThe prime minister himself insisted there would be no permanent truce until Hamas's military and governing capabilities were destroyed and all hostages released.\nHowever, the White House said on Sunday it expected Israel would agree to the plan.  \n\"This was an Israeli proposal. We have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal - as was transmitted to them, an Israeli proposal - then Israel would say yes,\" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told ABC News.\nBefore the threats of resignation were issued, one of Mr Netanyahu's advisers told the Sunday Times that many of the plan's details needed to be worked out, and there would be no permanent ceasefire \"until all our objectives are met\".\nBut senior foreign policy adviser Ophir Falk also said Mr Biden's plan was a \"deal we agreed to - it\u2019s not a good deal, but we dearly want the hostages released, all of them\".\nThe three-part proposal would begin with a six-week ceasefire in which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza. The deal would eventually lead to the release of all hostages, a permanent \"cessation of hostilities\" and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza.\nBut in a post on social media on Saturday, Mr Smotrich said he told Mr Netanyahu he would \"not be part of a government that agrees to the proposed outline and ends the war without destroying Hamas and bringing back all the hostages\".\nEchoing his words, Mr Ben-Gvir said \"the deal.. means the end of the war and the abandonment of the goal to destroy Hamas. This is a reckless deal, which constitutes a victory for terrorism and a security threat to the State of Israel\". \nHe vowed to \"dissolve the government\" rather than agree to the proposal. \nMr Netanyahu's right-wing coalition holds a slim majority in parliament, relying on a host of factions, including Mr Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party - who hold six seats - and Mr Smotrich's Religious Zionism party - who hold seven seats - to maintain power. \nBut Yair Lapid, one of Israel's most influential opposition politicians, was quick to offer his backing to the embattled prime minister. His Yesh Atid (There is a future) party holds 24 seats. \nHe said the prime minister \"has our safety net for a hostage deal if Ben-Gvir and Smotrich leave the government\".\nThe row came as tens of thousands of people rallied in Tel Aviv, calling on the Israeli government to accept Mr Biden's proposed plan. \nMany demonstrators also demanded Mr Netanyahu's resignation and some told reporters they feared the prime minister could torpedo the proposal.\nA group campaigning to bring home Israeli hostages captured by Hamas has warned that such a move would endanger the lives of those held in Gaza.\nScuffles broke out between protesters and police, who used mounted officers and water cannon to disperse the crowds. Some demonstrators were reportedly detained.\nProtests have become a fixture in Tel Aviv in recent months, as families of hostages and other anti-government campaigners have held rallies calling for a hostage deal - as well as for Mr Netanyahu to step down or call an election.\nIn a joint statement on Saturday, mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US urged both Israel and Hamas to \"finalise\" Mr Biden's proposed deal.\nOfficials said that \"as mediators in the ongoing discussions to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages and detainees\", they \"call on both Hamas and Israel to finalise the agreement embodying the principles outlined by President Joe Biden\".\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also offered his backing to the plan, telling reporters that his government could \"flood Gaza with far more aid\" if Hamas accepts the ceasefire plan. \nEarlier, a senior Hamas politician told the BBC it \"will go for this deal\" if Israel does.\nIn a statement after Mr Biden unveiled the plan, Mr Netanyahu's office insisted Israel's \"conditions for ending the war have not changed\".\nIt listed these as \"the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel\".\nThe statement added Israel would \"continue to insist these conditions are met\" before agreeing to a permanent ceasefire.\nHowever, the comments seemed to be vague enough for Mr Netanyahu to be able to claim that his objectives had been achieved. \nMr Netanyahu's office did not mention \u201ctotal victory\u201d - which he has repeatedly highlighted as a key aim for the war in Gaza.\nThis omission may allow the prime minister to ",

About 24,849 heatstroke cases were reported during the period.\nHowever, state-wise figures suggest the actual number could be much higher. \nIn Odisha, district authorities reported 99 suspected heat stroke deaths in the past 72 hours - of these, 20 cases have been confirmed, the state's Special Relief Commissioner said in a statement. \nIn Uttar Pradesh, Navdeep Rinwa, chief electoral officer of the state, told reporters that the families of deceased election personnel would be given a monetary compensation of 1.5m rupees ($18,000; \u00a314,000).\nMr Rinwa said that a man who was standing in the queue to vote fainted because of the heat.\n\u201cThe voter was transported to a health facility, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival,\u201d he said.\nSuspected heat-related deaths have also been reported from the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. \nIndia's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a \"life-threatening\" condition with a mortality rate of 40-64%.\nThe heat in northern and central India and parts of the west has been unrelenting for the past two weeks, with maximum temperatures hovering around 45-46C for days at a stretch and even climbing up to 50C in some areas.\nHowever, India's weather department says that temperatures are likely to fall in the coming days due to the onset on the monsoon.\nSeveral regions are experiencing severe water and electricity shortages due to a rise in power consumption.\nVideos from capital Delhi show people jostling for water from water tankers.

    "A new type of home called a fourplex is being hailed as the answer to Canada's acute housing shortage. But why is there so much opposition?\nAngela Jiang says she is much happier since she moved out of a high-rise apartment building.\nShe used to live on the 68th floor of a condo tower in downtown Toronto, but five years ago she relocated to a four-unit residential building called a fourplex, in the city\u2019s more low-rise midtown area.\nEither a new-build, or the conversion of an existing single home, fourplexes are one building, typically detached, split into four separate apartments.\n\u201cI loved how the neighbourhood was more residential, how I didn\u2019t need an elevator at all, and how the large balcony I had caught so much light,\u201d says Ms Jiang, who works in investment banking.\nProponents of fourplexes, which include the Canadian government, hope they will spread out across the country. They want them to provide the \u201cmissing-middle\u201d between large apartment buildings and single residency houses.\nIt comes as fourplexes made headlines this year in Canada after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the federal government would be making $CAN 6bn ($4.4bn; \u00a33.4bn) in new money available to help provinces tackle the national housing crisis \u2013 a lack of affordable properties.\nFederal Housing Minister Sean Fraser has required allowing fourplexes as a condition for municipalities to collect their share of this federal housing money.\nThis has been welcomed by some provinces, such as British Columbia (BC). The BC government has passed legislation to require fourplexes, and even five and sixplexes, to be permitted in any city with a population of more than 5,000.\nYet both the governments of Ontario and Alberta say they are opposed to municipalities in their provinces being forced to allow fourplexes. \u201cWe know that local municipalities know their communities best, and don't believe in forcing them to build where it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Ontario Premier Doug Ford told the BBC.\nThis opposition centres on a fear that long-existing Canadian suburbs of single-family homes will have their character irretrievably changed if fourplexes are forced upon them.\nWhile Toronto is now moving forward with fourplexes, its housing history is a useful guide to the issue. Put simply, new-build fourplexes were banned in the city from 1929 to 2023.\nInstead, under previous zoning laws, large swaths of residential areas in Toronto were put aside for single-family occupancy detached and semi-detached houses.\nIt was a similar picture in other Anglophone Canadian cities. By contrast, in Montreal fourplexes and other small apartment buildings have always been more common.\n\u201cToronto had specific regulations to defend single-family neighbourhoods,\u201d explains Alex Bozikovic, author of House Divided: How the Missing Middle Will Solve Toronto's Affordability Crisis.\n\u201cThere was classism at play here, as the 1910s saw policy that separated where homes and apartments could be built, as there was the perception that apartments bring the \u2018wrong\u2019 sorts of people into the neighbourhood, like immigrants.\u201d\nMr Bozikovic adds that the situation is now changing thanks to the pressure from the federal government. \u201cMinister Fraser is using funding and a bully pulpit to push municipalities to make necessary changes, because the government sees fourplexes as a palatable immediate solution to the affordable housing crisis,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThe questions for Canada become, \u2018is this the answer?\u2019, or \u2018is this the only the first step to much larger reforms?\u2019\u201d\nBut just because the Canadian government is pushing for more fourplexes doesn\u2019t mean developers and architects will be seeking to build them.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an experienced well-capitalized developer, there are strong incentives to do larger projects on the parcel of land you have,\u201d says Brandon Donnelly, managing director of development at Toronto-based housing market investment firm Slate Asset Management. \u201cWhy spend time and resources to focus on a four-unit project when you can do a 150-unit project?\u201d\nMeanwhile, Canadian newspaper columnist Frances Bula wrote recently how financing fourplexes will also be challenging because banks are not used to them.\n\u201cBanks will need to develop a new kind of financing product to service this new missing-middle form of development, which is not the single-detached houses or concrete towers that banks have loaned money on for decades,\u201d she says.\n\u201cAnd, in reality, ramping up large-scale production of fourplexes will likely require the growth of a new, niche type of developer.\u201d\n\nTom Knezic, a Toronto architect and co-founder of Solares Architecture, designed one fourplex currently being rented in the city, and also designed four now under construction.\nHe says that there is a misconception that fourplexes have to be architecturally boring, and that instead architects can be creative with the layout and design. He adds, for example, that the four units can be vastly different in size, so one could b",

The paper has spoken to dozens of people working for 11 providers, who say they paid thousands of pounds to agents to secure jobs in the UK, but in many cases ended up with no work, or far less pay than they were promised. The Home Office responded by saying that it prevents overseas care workers from entering the UK without genuine roles or fair pay.\nSeveral papers report on figures that suggest there has been a surge in people under the age of fifty being diagnosed with cancer. The Daily Mail says scientists believe the rise could be linked to ultra-processed food. The Daily Mirror says \"unhealthy lifestyles, an obesity epidemic and poor gut health are feared to be fuelling an explosion of early onset cancer\".\nTributes to the rugby league legend Rob Burrow feature across many of the papers. \"He inspired the nation\" says the Daily Express, alongside a picture of him smiling in his wheelchair after being made an MBE. The Telegraph says he \"transcended\" his sport in his \"battle to raise awareness\" of Motor Neurone Disease. For the Times, that campaigning made him a \"national figure of extraordinary significance\". The Daily Star's front page shows him before his diagnosis, charging on the pitch with a rugby ball under his arm. The headline calls him \"the bravest man in Britain.\"\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "On 6 June 1944, Allied forces landed on the beaches of northern France, marking the beginning of the liberation of Europe from the Nazis. Ahead of the 80th anniversary, BBC News went along to visit Cliff Dalton - one of the last survivors of the Normandy landings.\nWith a trembling hand, Cliff Dalton picks up a framed photograph showing a fresh-faced man in Army uniform.\n\"I look smart,\" he says, lost in the image; a 98-year-old face reflecting back off the glass frame.\n\"I wouldn't have missed it. I am proud.\"\nOn his jacket lapels, around his gleaming medals, are badges commemorating other key D-Day anniversaries. He is about to add another.\nMr Dalton was 18 when he landed on Gold Beach, at Arromanches in Normandy on 10 August 1944 - two months after D-Day.\nA few months earlier he had joined the Royal Army Service Corps.\nHe tells me he could have delayed his call-up on account of him being an apprentice vehicle electrician, but he was \"bored\" and hankered after adventure.\nMr Dalton was training in Southend, Essex, when the first waves - including men from his home city of Hull who served with the 2nd Battalion East Yorkshire Regiment - stormed the beaches.\n\"We were all talking about it,\" recalls Mr Dalton, who is believed to be East Yorkshire's last remaining Normandy veteran.\nHe knew his turn was coming.\nMr Dalton has vivid recollections of boarding a troop ship at Southampton bound for Normandy.\n\"It was a very hot day,\" he says. \"We were full of stuff on our backs - a rifle, steel helmet, respirator, mess tins, a back pack...and to top it all, at Southampton, just as you left, they threw 50 rounds of ammunition around your neck.\"\nHe claims he \"didn't have time to be scared\", adding, with a grin: \"You have too much on your plate.\"\nArriving in Normandy, he recalls the Mulberry harbours - floating artificial harbours designed and constructed by British military engineers.\n\"There was an officer shouting orders,\" says Mr Dalton. \"He was shouting, 'come on, hurry up! Get down on to the landing stage'.\n\"As soon as we stepped foot on shore, we didn't stop. We kept on going - getting a move on, you would say.\"\nMr Dalton, along with others, deployed as reinforcements following D-Day. Immediately after landing, they marched four miles inland to a camp, where he found his unit, 318 Company.\n\"I was in the mobile workshops,\" he says. \"We maintained about 200 of the company's vehicles, which were supplying the frontline.\"\nHis unit were often on the move, he remembers.\n\"We would set up the workshops and then we would get the order, 'pack up - we're moving'.\"\nIn the days and weeks after D-Day, huge volumes of men and equipment were brought ashore, assisting the main fighting force.\nMr Dalton remembers: \"Tanks would come by, churning up the roads. I remember that.\"\nHis company pushed through France, Belgium, Holland and eventually Germany, where an image he treasures was taken.\nIt shows Mr Dalton and his friends perched on a V2 rocket - one of Hitler's most feared and technologically-advanced weapons.\n\"I'd never seen anything like it before,\" he says. \"The front end was damaged.\n\"Our sergeant took this photograph of us all sitting on the rocket and gave us all a two-inch copy to keep. It's pretty unique.\"\nAfter the war, Mr Dalton met and married wife Jean. They were married 53 years, before Mrs Dalton died in 2005. They had two sons together, Philip, 62, and Keith, 64.\nIn 1985, Mr Dalton joined the Hull branch of the Normandy Veterans' Association after seeing an advert in a local newspaper.\nOver the years he joined other veterans on visits back to the beaches.\n\"Some of them [other veterans] were a lot older than me,\" he says. \"They were involved earlier [D-Day] than me so I kept quiet. They would tell you what went on.\"\nNow, with those veterans mostly lost to time, Mr Dalton has picked up the baton; determined to ensure the Normandy story continues to be told.\n\"Our association always said we'd carry on - the last person will turn off the lights.\"\nReturning to the photo, now back in his hand, Mr Dalton tells me how he feels about being one of the few left standing.\n\"I'm very grateful. I can't understand how I've done it,\" he says.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "If the billboards in Ivanovo are to be believed, Russia\u2019s really going places.\n\u201cRecord harvest!\u201d\n\u201cMore than 2000km of roads repaired in Ivanovo Region!\u201d\n\u201cChange for the Better!\u201d\nIn this town, a four-hour drive from Moscow, a giant banner glorifying Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine covers the entire wall of an old cinema. With pictures of soldiers and a slogan: \n\u201cTo Victory!\u201d\nThese posters depict a country marching towards economic and military success.\nBut there is one place in Ivanovo that paints a very different picture of today\u2019s Russia.\nI\u2019m standing outside it. There\u2019s a poster here, too. Not of a Russian soldier, but a British novelist. George Orwell\u2019s face stares down at passers-by.\nThe sign above it reads The George Orwell Library.\nInside, the tiny library offers a selection of books on dystopian worlds and the dangers of totalitarianism. \nThere are multiple copies of Orwell\u2019s classic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four; the story in which Big Brother is always watching and the state has established near-total control over body and mind.\n\u201cThe situation now in Russia is similar to Nineteen Eighty-Four,\u201d librarian Alexandra Karaseva tells me. \u201cTotal control by the government, the state and the security structures.\u201d\nIn Nineteen Eighty-Four, the Party manipulates people\u2019s perception of reality, so that citizens of Oceania believe that \"war is peace\" and \"ignorance is strength\".\nRussia today has a similar feel about it. From morning until night, the state media here claims that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is not an invasion, but a defensive operation; that Russian soldiers are not occupiers, but liberators; that the West is waging war on Russia, when, in reality, it was the Kremlin that ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\u201cI\u2019ve met people who are hooked on TV and believe that Russia isn\u2019t at war with Ukraine, and that the West was always out to destroy Russia,\u201d Alexandra says. \n\u201cThat\u2019s like Nineteen Eighty-Four. But it\u2019s also like Ray Bradbury\u2019s novel Fahrenheit 451. In that story the hero\u2019s wife is surrounded by walls that are essentially TV screens, talking heads telling her what to do and how to interpret the world.\u201d\nIt was a local businessman, Dmitry Silin, who opened the library two years ago. \nA vocal critic of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he wanted to create a space where Russians could \u201cthink for themselves, instead of watching TV\u201d.  \nDmitry was later prosecuted for \u201cdiscrediting the Russian armed forces\u201d.  He\u2019d been accused of scrawling \u201cNo to war!\u201d on a building. He denied the charge. He has since fled Russia and is wanted by police.\nAlexandra Karaseva gives me a tour of the library. It\u2019s a treasure trove of literary titans from Franz Kafka to Fyodor Dostoevsky. There is non-fiction, too; histories of the Russian Revolution, of Stalin\u2019s repressions, the fall of communism and of modern Russia\u2019s failed attempts to build democracy. \nThe books you can borrow here are not banned in Russia. But the subject matter is very sensitive. Any honest discussion of Russia\u2019s past or present can bring problems.\nAlexandra believes in the power of the written word to bring change. That\u2019s why she is determined the library stays open.\n\u201cThese books show our readers that the power of autocratic regimes is not forever,\u201d Alexander explains. \u201cThat every system has its weak points and that everyone who understands the situation around them can preserve their freedom. Freedom of the brain can give freedom of life and of country.\u201d\n\u201cMost of my generation had no experience of grassroots democracy,\u201d recalls Alexandra, who is 68. \u201cWe helped destroy the Soviet Union but failed to build democracy. We didn\u2019t have the experience to know when to stand firm and say \u2018You mustn\u2019t do this.\u2019 Perhaps if my generation had read Ninety Eighty-Four, it would have acted differently.\u201d\nEighteen-year-old Dmitry Shestopalov has read Ninety Eighty-Four. Now he volunteers at the library.\n\u201cThis place is sacrosanct,\u201d Dmitry tells me. \u201cFor creative young people it\u2019s a place they can come to find like-minded citizens and to get away from what\u2019s happening in our country. It\u2019s a little island of freedom in an unfree environment.\u201d\nAs islands go, it is, indeed, little. Alexandra Karaseva is the first to admit that the library has few visitors.\nBy contrast, I find a large crowd in the centre of Ivanovo. It\u2019s not Big Brother people have stopped to listen to. It\u2019s a Big Band. \nIn bright sunshine an orchestra is playing classic Soviet melodies and people start dancing to the music. Chatting to the crowd I realise that some Russians are more than willing to believe what the billboards are telling them, that Russia\u2019s on the up.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with the direction Russia\u2019s heading in,\u201d pensioner Vladimir tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re becoming more independent. Less reliant on the West.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re making progress,\u201d says a young woman called Natalya. \u201cAs Vladimir Putin has said, a new stage for Russia has begun.\u201d\nBut what about Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine?\n\u201cI try not to watch anything about that ",
    "Voters in a Derbyshire village have questioned why they are being moved into a new parliamentary constituency with other communities more than 40 miles away. \nPeople in Hilton and Hatton, which are served by South Derbyshire District Council, will now be voting for an MP for Derbyshire Dales.\nIt is due to changes made by the Boundary Commission in 2023, which reviews constituencies and their voter numbers. \nA council spokesman said they are working to keep disruption to a minimum. \nLeanne Broomhead is a small business owner in Hilton. \nShe said: \"I just feel like it's too far away - [Derbyshire Dales] has got nothing to do with this area - I had heard nothing about this. \n\"I do care [about the change] because it would be more beneficial if [representation]    was all in this area.\n\"I feel like we'll get a lot less support with it being so far away, and if there is any issues, it might be a massive problem for us and our business - it's too big of an area, and we may not get specialised support.\" \nOne man from the village said it felt like MPs \"only turned up when it was election time\" but added putting Hilton into the new constituency was \"odd\". \nAlan Dennis said he's voted in every election since the early 1970s. But he said it didn't matter what constituency  Hilton was in. \n\"I vote on who I think I want to run the country - I don't get into the rest of the politics. \n\"I suppose if you don't vote, then you can't moan.\"\nDave Gibson and Paula Laird were against the boundary changes to the villages.\n\"I don't understand why Hilton should move, this area is governed by the district council in Swadlincote, which is in South Derbyshire,\" Mr Gibson said. \n\"To call it Derbyshire Dales is ludicrous - the demographics and the geography are quite different.\"\nMs Laird added: \"It's pretty disgraceful because [the MP] won't have the local knowledge and issues in mind - it's too remote, and you need to keep it local.\"\nThe Boundary Commission, which published the final changes in 2023, said all recommended constituencies had to have no less than 69,724 parliamentary electors and no more than 77,062.\nThey said the new constituencies are available on their website, but it is \"now the responsibility of local authorities\" to inform their residents.\nA spokesperson for South Derbyshire District Council, said it published information about the changes in December 2023 after the Boundary Commission's final proposals were confirmed. \n\"The boundary changes only affect the parliamentary constituency and no other elections, and therefore the council did not extensively promote the news before the police and crime commissioner and mayoral elections as the boundaries remained unchanged.\n\"The council is working closely with Derbyshire Dales District Council to minimise any disruption to voters in Hatton and Hilton. The venues of the polling stations will remain the same.\" \nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Donald Trump has said his historic trial and criminal conviction have been \"very hard\" for his wife, former First Lady Melania Trump. \nLast week, jurors found Mr Trump guilty of falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments made to former porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election campaign.\nWith the verdict, he became the first US president to be convicted of a crime. He has repeatedly called the trial rigged and politically motivated. \nIn an interview with Fox News over the weekend, Mr Trump vowed that success at the upcoming November US election would be his \"revenge\". \nHe is slated to be sentenced on 11 July, and plans to appeal against the convictions. \nSpeaking to Fox on Sunday, Mr Trump said his New York legal battle has been particularly difficult on his wife. \nThe trial included lurid details of the alleged meeting between Mr Trump and Ms Daniels. \nThe details included Mr Trump greeting her in silk pyjamas at his hotel suite, and Ms Daniels' claims that he did not wear protection when they allegedly had sex. \nIn her testimony, Ms Daniels also claimed that Mr Trump and his wife sleep in different beds. \n\"She's fine, but I think it's very hard for her,\" Mr Trump said of his wife, adding that \"in many ways, it's tougher on them [his family] than it is me\". \nUnder New York law, each of the 34 felony counts Mr Trump was convicted of could result in up to four years in prison - though this is not considered a likely outcome. \nIn his interview on Fox, Mr Trump acknowledged the possibility of being imprisoned, saying that he is \"okay with it\" but that he is \"not sure the public would stand for it\". \n\"I think it would be tough for the public to take,\" he said. \"You know, at a certain point there's a breaking point.\" \nIn another interview published over the weekend, the woman at the heart of the New York case - former adult film actress Stormy Daniels - said she was \"shocked\" at how quickly the jury reached a verdict. \nIn her first public remarks since the convictions, Ms Daniels told UK newspaper The Mirror that she believes Mr Trump \"should be sentenced to jail and some community service working for the less fortunate\".\n\"Or being the volunteer punching bag at a woman's shelter,\" she added. \nEven after the conviction, Ms Daniels said that the case is \"not over\" for her. \n\"It's never going to be over for me,\" she said. \"Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy.\" \nMr Trump is still facing dozens of other charges in three other criminal cases, including a Georgia case in which he is accused of conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat by President Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 election. That case is currently tied up in appeals. \nIn Florida - where he faces a federal case over his alleged mishandling of classified documents - a judge has indefinitely postponed the trial, saying setting a date before resolving questions about evidence would be \u201cimprudent\u201d.",
    "A student has created a magnetic walking stick after seeing his partner, who has multiple sclerosis, struggle while using a standard one. \nSean Guyett, a design student at Nottingham Trent University (NTU), had noticed how standard walking sticks often fell to the floor while their owner did other tasks.\nRemovable magnetic pads, which attach to clothing, mean the stick can be secured without being held.\nThe 22-year-old was inspired by his partner Ora Hambleton after seeing the difficulties she and other disabled people faced trying to integrate walking sticks into their everyday lives. \nMr Guyett, from Uxbridge in West London, said his aim was to support people who found themselves \"designed out\" of the wider world. \nHe said he was particularly interested in those who are of working age due to \"low employment figures\" of people who have disabilities.\nAlmost half of people who have a disability are unemployed, compared to 18% of able-bodied people, according to government figures. \n\nAs part of his research, Mr Guyett met with people with a range of disabilities to gain a greater understanding of their personal experiences. \nHe found walking sticks did not \"integrate very well\" into people's lives and could become a \"hinderance\" at times, saying the sticks often fell over when being leant against a counter or were difficult to use on buses. \nHe said: \"I wanted to create something to show how we can design away many of the common problems that are faced by people who have to rely on a walking stick.\u201d\nThe student created a clip that hooks onto the top of a pair of trousers and another magnet that attaches to a small steel plate and can go under clothing such as dresses. \nNamed Ida - after the mountain on which magnets were discovered in Greek mythology - the walking stick can attach to both clothing magnets or be secured against any other metal surface and easily pulled away.\nThe walking stick has a lightweight aluminium pole as well as three different designs of handles and bases that are interchangeable for different uses.\nMr Guyett's partner, Miss Hambleton - a postgraduate psychology student at NTU - said: \u201cSean\u2019s design means that I don\u2019t have to be worried about taking my stick out with me anymore because I know it will accommodate my needs in the moment.\u201d\nThe student's design is on show for the NTU student showcase at the City Campus until 7 June. \nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The daughter of a woman with dementia who died after she was pushed to the ground in a bank said she was \"stunned\" staff did not intervene prior to the fatal shove.\nCourtney Richman, 26, floored Myra Coutinho-Lopez, 82, after growing impatient with her in the queue at Lloyds Bank in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire.\nThe victim's daughter, Michelle Lopez, said she would campaign to ensure staff received dementia training after her mother's death in December 2021.\nRichman was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment for manslaughter, suspended for 21 months, at Luton Crown Court on Friday.\nShe had denied the offence but was found guilty following a trial in February.\nMrs Coutinho-Lopez, who had Alzheimer's disease, died in hospital on 16 December 2021 - 10 days after she was pushed to the floor.\nThe trial heard the victim had forgotten she had withdrawn money three days earlier and caused a long queue to develop as she had an argument with a cashier.\nRichman, who was in the queue, was heard to say: \"Hurry up - people don't have all day.\"\nThe jury watched CCTV which showed Mrs Coutinho-Lopez swing her handbag at Richman, who then shoved her.\n\"It really shocked me when I saw that CCTV footage for the first time \u2013 I gasped with surprise,\" Ms Lopez said.\n\"I was stunned that could happen and the bank let it get to that.

    "A junior doctor has ended up with a new pet after a goldfish mysteriously appeared in his garden. \nDr Ben Beska, 33, from Newcastle, said he saw a group of magpies squawking in his garden on Saturday and went out to investigate when he spotted the fish lying in the grass.\nThe NHS cardiology doctor retrieved the fish and placed it in a freezer drawer filled with water, and intends to keep it as a pet. \n\"It's pretty mad really, finding a fish on the lawn.

    "Eighty years ago soldiers from across Ireland were bracing themselves for D-Day.\nBy air and by sea they joined the 150,000-strong Allied advance on France in June 1944.\nAfter years of aerial bombing raids, rations and hard factory work at home, the mission of Operation Overlord was to seize a foothold in France and turn the tide of the war against Nazi Germany.\nIn Northern Ireland, conscription was not imposed due to its political divisions, however, citizens from both unionist and nationalist backgrounds signed up for the war effort.\nIn the Irish Free State, which adopted a policy of neutrality, some 70,000 soldiers would join the British Army as it added Normandy to its other frontlines in Italy and north Africa.\nFor months, the Allies planned how they would re-enter Nazi-occupied France, four years after the evacuation from Dunkirk.\nUnder tight secrecy and to surprise Germany, Normandy was chosen rather than the shorter crossing point at Calais.\nShortly after midnight on 6 June 1944, a small number of troops landed on gliders with the mission of seizing key locations such as bridges over the Caen Canal and River Orne.\nThey were to be relieved by the world\u2019s largest amphibious invasion force which reached Normandy's beaches from 06:30.\nThe US 1st Army was tasked with attacking the Utah and Omaha assault zones to the west.\nTo the east, British and Canadian forces focused on Gold, Juno and Sword.\nAbout 12,000 Allied aircraft and several thousand sea vessels formed part of Operation Overlord.\nMet by mortar shells, machine gun fire and snipers, the Allied objective was to breach the enemy\u2019s coastal defences and push towards key cities such as Bayeux and Caen.\nThe eventual aim would be the liberation of France.\nMore than 4,000 allied troops were killed on D-Day and thousands of others were wounded.\nThe Royal Ulster Rifles (RUR) was the only British regiment to have its full strength of two battalions deployed on D-Day.\nMany soldiers from the Irish Free State and Great Britain would also form part of its ranks.\nAt midday, a few hours after the initial wave of the invasion on 6 June 1944, 2nd Battalion RUR landed at Queen Red beach, part of the Sword assault zone. \nTheir aim was to advance inland towards a battle for the city of Caen.\nThe battalion's war diary states some of the soldiers were small in size and had difficulty getting ashore from the landing craft, carrying equipment, weapons and a fold-up bicycle - although many of those were thrown overboard to be recovered later.\nThere were some initial casualties due to mortar and shell fire.\nHowever, there were no beach fatalities for the RUR and the war diary states they were met by the sight of surrendering German soldiers.\nThe 2nd Battalion's initial objective was to assemble at nearby Lion-sur-mer and they dug in for the night at P\u00e9riers-sur-le-dan. \nThe 1st (Airborne) Battalion of the RUR meanwhile was preparing to land by Horsa glider a few miles to the south near Ranville.\nThey established a base at Le Bas de Ranville by the evening of 6 June, preparing for assaults on the villages of Longueval and Sainte-Honorine.\nIn the days and weeks that followed, the RUR would suffer heavy losses during an intense battle in the wood at Cambes-en-Plaine and around the city of Caen.\nIn July 1944, they were given the Battle Honour Caen, meaning the RUR would lead the 3rd Infantry Division's advance on the heavily-bombed city, which was one of the first to be liberated.\nAlmost 200 RUR soldiers died between D-Day and the end of August 1944.\nAbout 70,000 soldiers from the Irish Free State served across a number of areas in the British 2nd Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.\nAmong them were servicemen in the Guards Armoured Brigade and the Royal Dragoon Guards.\nThe only Irish man to receive the Military Cross for his actions on 6 June 1944 was Maj Redmond Cunningham, of 79 Assault Squadron, from Waterford. \nHis efforts to clear German defences and mines at Queen Red Beach helped the RUR's advance. \nMaj John Aldworth, born in County Cork, was killed in action on 7 July leading the RUR\u2019s initial attack on Cambes Wood.\nThousands of Irish diaspora soldiers also fought on D-Day in the US and Canadian militaries.\nThere are 195 Royal Ulster Rifles soldiers recorded as having graves or their names remembered on memorials in Normandy who died between 6 June and 25 August 1944.\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission cares for such sites from both world wars in northern France, including soldiers who had fought around Dunkirk.\nMany graves of Northern Ireland and Irish soldiers from Operation Overlord can be found in cemeteries in Caen, Ranville and Bayeux.\nOn D-Day, two RUR soldiers were killed, both English-born servicemen.\nThe regiment's efforts in the liberation of Caen and the surrounding area is remembered by monuments near Ranville and Cambes-en-Plaine.\nThere is also a road named in its honour, Chemin des Royal Ulster Rifles.\nThe main British Normandy Memorial at Ver-sur-me",
    "The US has \"every expectation\" Israel will accept a ceasefire proposal that would begin with a six-week cessation of hostilities in Gaza if Hamas takes the deal, a senior White House official has said. \nThe three-part plan unveiled by President Joe Biden last week would also see a \"surge\" of humanitarian aid, as well as an exchange of some hostages for Palestinian prisoners before a permanent end to the war. \nThe proposal, however, has encountered vocal opposition from some members of Israel's government. \nThe negotiations come as fighting continues in Rafah, which came under intense Israeli airstrikes over the weekend. \nAccording to the UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, all 36 of its shelters in the Rafah area are empty after residents were forced to flee. \nAnother 1.7 million people are estimated to be displaced in Khan Younis and parts of central Gaza. \nSpeaking to ABC News on Sunday morning, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the US had \"every expectation\" that Israel would \"say yes\" to the proposed ceasefire deal if Hamas accepts. \n\"We're waiting for an official response from Hamas,\" he said, adding that the US hopes that both sides agree to start the first phase of the plan \"as soon as possible\". \nDuring that initial six-week pause in the fighting, Mr Kirby said the \"two sides would sit down and try to negotiate what phase two could look like, and when that could begin\".\nLate on Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made separate calls to  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and war cabinet member Benny Gantz to lobby for the deal. \nMr Blinken \"commended Israel for the proposal\", stressing that Hamas should take the deal \"without delay\", said state department spokesman Matthew Miller.\nHe also added that America's top diplomat said \"the proposal would advance Israel\u2019s long-term security interests\".\nOn Saturday, however, two far-right Israeli ministers threatened to quit and collapse the country's governing coalition if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to the deal. \nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said they were opposed to striking any deal before Hamas was destroyed.\nSimilarly, Mr Netanyahu has insisted that there will be no ceasefire until Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities are destroyed and all hostages are released.\nHanoch Milwidsky, a senior member of the Knesset for Mr Netanyahu's Likud Party, told the BBC on Sunday that Israel's governing coalition is unified in opposition to the deal, which he called \"completely unacceptable\". \n\"The math of the Israeli government has not changed - that means Hamas can no longer rule Gaza, can no longer have any capability, not military not any civilian capability to be in power, and all the hostages need to come back,\" Mr Milwidsky  said. \"The war will not stop until these demands are met.\" \nMr Kirby, for his part, said that US intelligence now believes that Hamas has been militarily degraded to the extent that it can no longer repeat an attack such as that which its fighters conducted on 7 October. \n\"We've not said that they don't still represent a viable threat to the Israeli people. Of course they do,\" he said. \"But they don't have the military capabilities to do what they did.\" \nIn another development on Sunday, the government of the Maldives announced it would ban Israeli citizens from the Indian Ocean island archipelago, in turn prompting a warning from Israel's foreign ministry that its citizens should avoid the country. \nAbout 11,000 Israelis visited the Maldives last year - less than 1% of all tourist arrivals. \nMore than 36,000 people have been killed across Gaza since the start of the conflict, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe war began in October when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to Gaza as hostages.\nIn the US, President Biden has faced growing domestic criticism over the level of US support for Israel, as well as calls to do more to encourage the warring sides to negotiate.",
    "A man who holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of fossilised poo, has opened a museum showcasing his treasures.\nThe museum in Williams, Arizona - aptly called Poozeum - boasts it houses thousands of fossilised faeces including one of the largest ever found.\nFounder George Frandsen says he was motivated by the \"glaring absence of coprolite [fossilised poop] representation\" in museums.\nPoozeum was originally founded in 2014 as a virtual resource centre, but opened its doors at a permanent location last month.\nMr Frandsen's foray into coprolite hunting arose after he first saw one as a teenager in a rock and fossil shop in Utah, having already been fascinated by fossils as a child. \n\"Instantly, I found it both hilarious and fascinating,\" he said, which sparked his \"curiosity\" to learn all he could about them.\nIn an interview with Guinness World Records, the collector said he realised they were \"prehistoric time capsules\" into the lives of ancient creatures.\nMr Frandsen has held the record since 2015, when his coprolite collection's official count was 1,277. Nearly a decade later, his collection stands at 8,000 pieces, and includes dinosaur coprolites.\nRealising the lack of them on display, he created a travelling exhibition and donated it to museums across the country. \nThe temporary exhibits were met with an \"enthusiastic response\" and highlighted the need for a dedicated space where they could be displayed, he said.\n\"This realisation ignited my resolve to establish a permanent home for the collection, allowing my vision for the Poozeum to be fully realized and appreciated by all,\" he explained to Guinness.\nEarlier this year, the 45-year-old quit his job in a healthcare company - where he had worked for 14 years - to see his dream of opening a poo museum come to fruition.\nHaving accumulated specimens over the years, he now concentrates on finding the \"most incredible pieces in the world\u201d.\nAmong the fossilised finds, is \"Barnum\", the largest coprolite found that belongs to a carnivore, which measures at 67.5cm.\nPoozeum is \"one of a kind\", Mr Frandsen said, and is free as he believes \"financial constraints should never hinder anyone from experiencing the wonders\" within.\n\u201cInitially, many people react with a \u2018yuck\u2019 face or laughter when they first hear about the Poozeum,\" he said, adding their reactions shift to shock after witnessing the collection.

    "A village dealing with a petrol station fuel leak that has affected water safety and led to an underground explosion risk has been told a road will close until repair works are completed.\nThames Water told more than 600 households in Bramley, Surrey, on Thursday not to drink their tap water after elevated levels of hydrocarbons were found in water samples.\nThe water company said it was now half-way through digging down to pipes that must be replaced.\nIt said Station Road would be closed from 4 June for the duration of the works.\nA Thames Water spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are using special noise-supressing barriers to help reduce disturbance as much as we can while we carry out this essential work.\n\u201cStation Road will be closed from Tuesday for the duration of these works. We are very sorry for the additional disruption this will cause. It will mean there may be disturbance overnight and we will do our best to keep noise and additional disruption to a minimum.\u201d\nRegional operations director Tess Fayers told BBC Radio Surrey that the works were expected to be a \"massive disturbance\" for residents. \nBramley resident Evan Venn said residents were in \"camping mode\", drinking bottled water.\nHe said the main concern in the village was making sure deliveries of water supplies continued after some people had not received any.\n\"The traffic on Tuesday will be horrendous in this area,\" he added.\nMs Fayers said Thames Water was looking at making alternative transport arrangements and was moving towards overnight working.\nSome businesses in the village have also received offers of compensation from independent water retailer Castle Water. \nOn Saturday, it emerged repair works could take up to four weeks - and that the petrol leak had led to an underground explosion risk after it impacted the Openreach telecommunications network.\nOn the radio Ms Fayers said three schools in the area had been impacted by the ongoing water issues, but they were all planning to open as usual on Monday.\nMs Fayers explained that Thames Water was making arrangements to ensure they were supported with \"tanker supplies\". \nOn Sunday, Conservative candidate for Godalming and Ash Jeremy Hunt said there was \"confirmation\" from Surrey County Council leader Tim Oliver that it was setting up \"strategic gold command\" for the fuel leak.\nOn Thursday, 616 properties were told not to drink, cook or brush teeth with the tap water, or wash up with it or give it to pets, even if it had been boiled.\nThe water was safe for washing and flushing toilets, Thames Water said.\nTwo bottled water stations are open from 09:00 to 21:00 BST at Bramley Community Library, which is a walk-in site, and at Artington Park & Ride, Guildford, for those with cars.\nSupplies are also being delivered to properties affected, Thames Water has said.\nThe fuel leak is from a petrol filling station owned by Asda, which said it inherited the problem when it bought the site.\nResidents have complained about the issue since 2021 and Thames Water has carried out additional water sampling since October 2023.\nThames Water said it \u201cwould like to reassure its customers that the village water supply has been safe to drink up to this point\u201d.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

    "The Government of Jersey's ability to ensure continued energy supplies across the island in an emergency has been criticised as \"weak\" and \"limited\".\nThe Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) made the comments in a report into Jersey's critical infrastructure resilience.\nLynn Pamment, the C&AG, said the government had \"a great deal to do\" despite learning from several critical incidents in recent years.\nThe government said it acknowledged more needed to be done and it was already working on putting additional measures in place.\nThe report looked at how resilient Jersey's energy supplies were during emergencies.\nIt went on to evaluate Jersey's strategy to withstand damage to critical energy infrastructure, but found \"no cross-cutting infrastructure policy\" existed.\nMs Pamment's report said although the government had learned lessons from recent events, including Covid, the gas explosion at Haut du Mont and Storm Ciar\u00e1n, not enough action had been taken afterwards.\nThe report said capacity in the government to manage resilience was \"currently very limited\" and arrangements to underpin effective resilience were \"not yet adequate\".\nIt said: \"Government arrangements to assure the resilience of energy supply as both a community leader and as a key customer are weak.\"\nThe report noted Jersey imports 98% of all its energy supplies.\nMs Pamment said \"clear, resourced action plans\" should be developed to manage the risk. \n\"Critical incidents in recent years should be the catalyst for the government and its partners to address weaknesses in managing energy resilience,\" she said.\n\"There is work to be undertaken by government to enable it, as community leader, to provide islanders with assurance on energy supply, fuel storage and distribution.\"\nConstable Andy Jehan, Minister for Infrastructure, said ministers welcomed the review which he said was carried out in a \"collaborative way\" and involved the island's energy companies.\n\u201cStorm Ciar\u00e1n, the Haut du Mont disaster and the other major incidents of the last two years have shown how resilient Jersey is, and how effective we are when we all work together,\" he said.\n\"But the new government is the first to acknowledge there is still more to be done on our resilience in the current challenging global environment, and we are already working to put the necessary measures in place.\"\nHe said the government was improving resilience laws and the community risk register.\n\"We will look carefully at how we can best address the other potential improvements highlighted in the Comptroller and Auditor General\u2019s review,\" he said.\n\"We'll continue to work closely with our local energy providers, and I expect them to respond to this review practically and promptly, especially in terms of resilience planning.\"\nFollow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "Labour is promising to cut net migration to the UK if it wins the election next month, but will not set an overall target.\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her party would reduce the need for overseas workers by improving training of British workers.\nShe argued that not setting a target was \"sensible\" because the Conservatives had \"discredited the whole system\" by previously missing targets.\nBut the Tories said \"no-one believes Keir Starmer is serious about tackling immigration\". \nSpeaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Cooper acknowledged that new salary levels announced by the government were yet to \"play through\" and would further restrict companies' access to work visas.\nBut she added that Labour wanted to go further to cut reliance on foreign workers in sectors including construction, IT, social care, health and engineering.\nThe party says if it wins power, it will pass a new law to force different parts of the government to draw up skills improvement plans in high-migration sectors. It is not yet clear how these plans would be enforced.\nMs Cooper said Labour wanted to see \"significant changes in place\u201d across the economy to reduce reliance on overseas workers.\nBut she added the party would not set a migration target because the Conservatives had \"ended up being totally all over the place\" when they did.\nShe also argued that other factors would produce variations \u201cfrom one year to another,\" citing the pandemic and the UK's decision to accept Ukrainian refugees as recent examples.\nLeader Sir Keir Starmer told the Sun on Sunday: \"Mark my words, a future Labour government will bring down net migration.\"\nLast year, net migration - the number of people coming to the UK, minus the number leaving - was 685,000, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.\nEarlier this year, the government introduced new laws designed to cut immigration numbers.\nThey included increasing the minimum salary requirement for some skilled work visas by nearly 50%, as well as increasing the salary requirements for skilled workers, British citizens and those with settled status to bring family dependents into the UK.\nMs Cooper said Labour supported \"some further restrictions on visas\" introduced by the government.\nLabour also wants to lengthen the bans on hiring foreign workers that can be handed down to firms that breach employment law, such as by paying below the minimum wage.\nA spokesperson for the Conservative Party said the Labour policy announced on Sunday was a \"U-turn\" on Sir Keir's principles.\n\"This is the man who called all immigration laws racist and voted against tougher border controls 139 times,\" the spokesperson said.\nThat refers to a book review Sir Keir wrote when he was a lawyer in the late 1980s, in which he said the author had highlighted the \"racist undercurrent which permeates all immigration law\".\nAlison Thewliss, from the SNP, said: \u201cInstead of coming forward with policies based on Scotland\u2019s needs, Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are both amping up the far-right belief that migrants are to blame for all of our problems - but it\u2019s not migrants, it\u2019s Westminster.\"\n\"From our care sector and our NHS to our economy, the cruel immigration policies that both the Tories and Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour have now adopted directly harm Scotland,\" she said.\nA spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats said: \"It\u2019s clear the Conservatives have failed on immigration and broken every promise they\u2019ve ever made.\"",
    "A campaign group has formed to oppose plans to run a 60km (37 mile) corridor of electricity pylons through Derbyshire.\nResidents in Amber Valley say the National Grid\u2019s plans will ruin their landscape by running power lines held aloft by 50m high pylons between substations in Chesterfield and Willington in South Derbyshire.\nNational Grid said existing power lines did not have capacity to cope with the increased power flows from offshore wind turbines.\nA consultation is currently under way on the plans, and a new campaign group Save Amber Valley Environment (SAVE) has formed to push for alternatives to be considered.\nHigham resident Catherine Harris, of SAVE, told the BBC: \u201cWe can\u2019t believe that National Grid, who are supposed to be supplying green energy, can even contemplate putting 50m high pylons across this wonderful landscape.\n\u201cSurely they can look at other ways. These pylons are archaic; they\u2019ve been used since World War Two.\u201d\nDavid and Caroline Wakefield, owners of grade II*-listed Ogston Hall in Brackenfield, also oppose the scheme.\nMr Wakefield told the BBC: \u201cThe present house dates back to about 1550. It will have a disastrous impact, it would dwarf all the trees.\u201d\nMrs Wakefield said: \u201cI hope it will be rerouted somewhere else, quite frankly, and if that\u2019s not possible, bury it underground.\u201d\nThe overhead lines would carry six gigawatts of electricity - enough to power six million homes, said the company.\nThe route for the project, designed to help harness the energy generated from offshore windfarms, will only be decided after consultation, says National Grid.\nThe National Grid said that its infrastructure was largely built in the 1960s and needed upgrading.\nProject manager Leanne Evans said: \"The Chesterfield to Willington project is one of 17 projects that's happening across the country.\n\"We are expecting electricity demand to double over the coming years, and we are seeing an increase in electricity generation, largely in offshore wind turbines, and we need to be able to get that energy from where it is generated to where it is needed.\n\"We recognise the concern that communities will have in hosting this type of infrastructure.\n\"We are very much in the early development stages of this project, so we would really encourage people to give us that feedback and help us shape our proposals.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Caring for patients in hospital corridors has become \"normal\", despite being unsafe and unacceptable for patients, says a report from the Royal College of Nursing.\nAt its annual conference starting on Monday, RCN boss Prof Nicola Ranger will say corridor care is \"a national emergency for patient safety\".\nThe Conservatives said the NHS budget had increased by a third since 2010 and more community diagnostic centres had opened to ease the pressure on A&E.\nLabour said nurses were sounding the alarm because of 14 years of Conservative neglect, while the Lib Dems said they have an ambitious plan to fix the health crisis.\nIn the RCN's report, the nursing union is calling for corridor care to be reported whenever it happens so that the problem can be eradicated everywhere in the UK.\nIts annual online survey of 11,000 nursing staff - out of a total of more than 700,000 in the UK - found one in three had witnessed patients being cared for in inappropriate places during their most recent shift. This figure has risen over the past two years.\nNurses who responded said they had been involved in caring for patients on chairs, rather than beds or trolleys, in waiting rooms, corridors and other locations not designed for patients.\nThe survey is part of a campaign by the union to improve the working conditions of nurses.\nWhen nurses were asked about the impact on patients, two-thirds said their privacy and dignity were compromised while more than half said it meant a lack of access to toilet facilities and drinking water, as well as vital equipment, such as oxygen.\nA stroke patient recently told BBC News he'd waited more than 36 hours on a trolley at a Brighton hospital.\nAnd a BBC Newsnight investigation featured a patient who had spent three days on a corridor before being moved to a ward, and said his care had been \"horrendous\".\nHowever, some NHS bosses say so-called corridor care is freeing up ambulances and saving lives.\nThe waiting list for NHS treatments in England currently stands at 7.5 million.\nThe Conservatives said thousands more permanent hospital beds had been created to free up capacity and cut waiting times.\nHealth minister Andrew Stephenson said waiting lists for surgery and treatments had experienced the biggest six-month fall in 10 years outside the pandemic.\n\"We have boosted the budget by over a third in real terms since 2010, while the 160 community diagnostic centres we have opened across the country are delivering millions more scans, tests and checks to people outside of hospital settings to deliver more care closer to home,\" he added.\nWes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said only Labour had a plan to deliver change for the NHS.\n\"NHS nurses are sounding the alarm on the appalling state of the NHS after 14 years of Conservative neglect,\" he said.\n\u201cPatients and staff alike can see that the NHS is broken. Only Rishi Sunak and his party won\u2019t acknowledge that the crisis in the NHS is a national emergency, and if they can\u2019t diagnose the illness then how can they be trusted to cure it.\"\nLib Dem health spokesperson Daisy Cooper said the Conservatives had run the health service \"into the ground\".\n\"The Liberal Democrats have an ambitious plan to fix crumbling hospital buildings and provide everyone with the high-quality social care they deserve. This is at the heart of our offer to voters at this election and our plan to fix the health crisis.\"\n\nNHS waiting lists in Scotland have also reached a record high, with latest figures showing more than 690,000 waits for appointments or treatment for non-urgent care.\nA Scottish Government spokesperson said health boards were taking action to improve patient flow and reduce delays.\nIt said the 2024-25 Scottish budget provided more than \u00a319.5bn for health and social care.\n\u201cAlthough challenges and difficult decisions remain, this has given our NHS a real terms uplift in the face of an extremely difficult financial landscape.\"\nA new act has recently been introduced to help ensure appropriate staffing levels are in place in all health and care settings, the Scottish government added.\nAn NHS England spokesperson said one of its key ambitions in urgent and emergency care was to improve patient flow in and out of hospitals.\n\"The NHS delivered an extra 5,000 core beds this winter, alongside measures to help patients avoid an A&E admission in the first place, and tools like our world-leading virtual ward programme and discharge lounges all help to improve care for patients,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are working closely with colleagues in local authorities and community settings to send more patients home when they are medically fit to leave, freeing up beds for patients who need them most.\u201d",
    "Young women from West Yorkshire have criticised a \"lack of support\" available for a painful and debilitating medical condition.\nThe three patients, all in their 20s, said they either struggled to get a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) confirmed despite numerous GP appointments, or were not given effective treatment.\nPCOS causes painful and irregular periods, and affects up to one in 10 women in the UK.\nThe NHS said it \"strongly advised\" any woman concerned about their health to contact their GP.\nAlex Offer, 24, from Leeds, said it took nine years before she was told she had PCOS after doctors \"ignored\" her concerns from the age of 15.\nOne GP dismissed her symptoms as being caused by stress and anxiety, she said.\nShe told the BBC: \"I was 14 when I got my first period and then I didn't get another for about a year and a half.\n\"From the ages of 15, 16, 17 I still wasn't getting regular and I was having only three periods a year.\"\nAt the age of 18, Ms Offer was given a pelvic ultrasound scan, but was told that nothing was wrong with her body.\nShe then developed cystic acne, a common symptom of PCOS that affected her self-confidence.\nIt was only at the beginning of 2024 that she requested a second ultrasound, which resulted in her diagnosis.\nMs Offer was then told that seven cysts were present on her ovaries, but was given little information and no treatment options.\nShe said: \"I've had to do all the research by myself. I was being told what was wrong with me by someone else, when I know my body and I'm saying 'there is something wrong, I know it's not me being silly, I know that there is something going on'.\"\nPCOS can also cause rapid weight gain, excess facial and body hair and insulin resistance.\nResearch by the charity Verity PCOS UK found that 60% of women with the disorder have struggled to get a diagnosis, while 95% said they had encountered problems trying to access NHS support.\nLaaraib Khan, 24, also from Leeds, reported a similar experience.\nAlthough she received her diagnosis at the age of 13 after her mother pushed her GP to take her complaints seriously, in the past 11 years she said she had been given \"little support\" and was left to manage the syndrome herself.\n\"You have to lean on other women who are going through it rather than going to your GP, who will most likely turn you away,\" she said.\n\"When you do go, you're told to manage your weight, go outside, go to the gym, go on a mental health walk.\n\"Women with this condition have been told by their GP that they will struggle to lose weight, so how will my weight problems be solved by going on a walk or going to the gym more?\"\nOnline support groups and resources such those provided by Verity PCOS UK have all been vital in providing Ms Khan with information, but she said she had researched them herself rather than being signposted by health services.\n\"It's frustrating having to take charge of it and find help yourself.\n\"GPs should be sharing more knowledge on it and pointing us in the direction of where we can get help.\"\nMeanwhile, PCOS patient Jo Battiste, 28 and from Huddersfield, was told her painful periods were \"normal\" and was offered the contraceptive pill as a treatment.\nShe was diagnosed in her mid-20s but had first gone to her GP as a teenager.\n\"They put me on the pill, but it didn't interact with me well so I had to come off it myself\", she said.\n\"Years passed and I was going to different GPs and no one could get to the bottom of the issue.\n\"I was told that it's normal because you're a teenager just starting your periods.\n\"There was no support whatsoever and the way people spoke to me was not great.\"\nMrs Battiste said she thought health professionals needed to be more \"empathetic\" towards women.\nVerity PCOS UK trustee Rachel Morman said that delays to diagnosis were often due to variations in symptoms between women.\n\"It's such a complex condition that presents differently from person to person.\n\"Women's health does not have enough prioritisation, time and investment in education.\n\"During medical training, women's health topics are often underserved and that's a problem that results in delayed diagnosis.\"\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"NHS staff should support women experiencing polycystic ovary syndrome and we strongly advise any woman concerned about their health to speak to their GP in the first instance.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter), and\u00a0Instagram.

    "A non-league football club based near Sheffield has said it needs up to \u00a340,000 to survive the upcoming season.\nEighth-tier side Stocksbridge Park Steels, who were founded in 1986, said they were \"fighting for survival\" in a statement issued on Thursday.\nVice chairman Roger Gissing said the cost of running the club was about \u00a3140,000 each year.\nHe said he and other volunteers at Stocksbridge would do \"all we can to make sure the club survives\".\nThey were \"positive that we can pull through\", he added.\n\"We are talking to lots of people,\" said Mr Gissing, who is one of about 40 volunteers who help run the Northern Premier League Division One East outfit.\n\"We are not going to say that we are not going to make it, we probably need thirty to forty-thousand to guarantee we can get through the season with everything we want to do and need to do.\n\"We have a plan that will see us through, as long as we can manage to get a bit of sponsorship.\"\nThe club has helped launch the careers of several professional footballers, most notably Premier League and FA Cup winner Jamie Vardy, who went on to represent England.\n\n\"Everybody thinks Jamie Vardy should bail us out because he played there - he doesn't owe us anything,\" said Mr Gissing, who has been a committee member at Stocksbridge for 10 years.\n\"It's not beholden to him. It's down to the club to make sure they are self-sufficient. That's what we are trying to do.\"\nThe club had lost \"a substantial amount of sponsorship\" in recent seasons, which Mr Gissing said had contributed to its financial predicament.\nStocksbridge's average home attendances were also among the lowest in the league, Mr Gissing added.\nNor are they able to profit from the stadium bar, which is not owned by them.\nBut all hope is not lost. \nNational and international businesses have shown an interest in sponsoring the club in recent days, Mr Gissing said.\n\"The committee is positive that we can pull through.\n\"There are lots of people committing to smaller things.

    "A service has been held to remember the 29 people killed in an RAF Chinook helicopter crash on the 30th anniversary of the disaster.\nThe helicopter carrying leading security personnel crashed on the Mull of Kintyre peninsula on the west coast of Scotland on 2 June 1994.\nThe aircraft was on its way from RAF Aldergrove near Belfast to a security conference in Inverness when it crashed into a hillside in thick fog.\nThe incident was the worst RAF peacetime disaster and the reasons for the crash remain unclear.\nRev Roddy McNidder, who was the parish minister at the time of the crash, delivered the sermon at Southend Parish Church and described the 25 passengers and four crew who died as \"extraordinary people who were selflessly devoted to duty in the service of their country\".\nDuring the service, he said: \"Our service this early afternoon continues our promise that we care.\n\"This church is here for you and your families and loved ones, to remember, to honour their memory and their service.\n\"To bring the gift of encouragement, sensitively and graciously, and to hold fast the standards and principles they represented.\"\nThe crash came just two months before the 1994 IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland.\nPassengers on RAF Chinook ZD576 included leading security personnel from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), MI5 and the Army.\nThe pilots, flight lieutenants Jonathan Tapper and Richard Cook, were initially accused of gross negligence over the crash.\nA Scottish fatal accident inquiry (FAI) concluded it was impossible to establish the exact cause of the crash and in 2011 the pilots were exonerated.\nFamilies of those killed previously said they had been \u201cfailed\u201d by the Ministry of Defence who did not organise a 30th anniversary memorial.\nThe MoD said it was a \u201ctragic accident\" and said it does not fund new memorials.\nA special act of remembrance is being held at a memorial cairn at the crash site on Sunday afternoon.\nMr McNidder added: \"\"Each name inscribed on this cairn and which shines out every time the sun reflects upon it, calls us to remember the unique person whose name is written there, and to acknowledge our memories, experiences and encounters with them, along with the hopes of what might have been over these 30 years, and years still to come.\"",
    "A BBC investigation has found the number of children moving to home education in the UK is at its highest level since the pandemic.\nCouncils received almost 50,000 notifications in the last academic year from families wanting to take their children out of school. This does not include children already being home educated.\nThe latest government figures suggest mental health is the biggest reason for the rise.\nThe Department for Education in England said it supports families choosing to home educate and most do an excellent job, but it was important that it did not risk children falling off the radar, poor education or children's wellbeing.\nDakota from Portsmouth moved to home education in February 2024 for her mental wellbeing. She said: \u201cI like learning maths a lot, because it\u2019s more fun and less stressful\u201d. She also enjoys geography, history and creative writing.\nThe 10-year-old's cerebral palsy means her writing can be slower than other children her age. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t get rushed like I did at school, I\u2019m more relaxed at home.\u201d\nDakota sees friends at a weekly art club and enjoys chatting to them online. She loves doing animation and drawings and wants to be a game designer.\nHer dad Clarke, a blind artist who left school at 14, enjoys being Dakota's main teacher, and her mum Anita helps with reading and spelling.\n\u201cShe\u2019s more happy as she\u2019s more relaxed,\" Anita said. \"The amount of work she\u2019s done since being at home is more than what you do in a year at school. She\u2019s so much happier in herself.\u201d\nThe number of pupils moving to home education has risen by 22% in the past year.\nFreedom of Information requests showed UK councils received at least 49,819 notifications in 2022-23 from families wanting to home educate a child.\nThis is the highest level since 2020-2021, when there were at least 49,851 new notifications.\nIn the last four years, home education notifications have more than doubled in the North East, North West, West Midlands, Scotland and Wales.\nMillie, 13, from Rotherham moved to home education in February 2021. Her mum Kim, 32, said when schools were shut to most pupils during lockdown, it gave her a taste of how different things could be.\nWhen Millie\u2019s brother became home educated due to his special educational needs, she wanted to join him. She said one reason was her mental health, and that the atmosphere at school \"was very stressful\u201d.\nKim said Millie experienced bullying and developed a tic due to anxiety. \u201cWhen she came out of school, she probably carried on with that for a month or two, and then it just stopped. So she doesn\u2019t really do it now unless she\u2019s under high stress.\u201d\nMillie is not planning to do GCSEs, but enjoys studying psychology, foraging and theatre skills. She enjoys spending time with friends at different weekly groups, loves reading and volunteers with women in their 80s at a local bookshop.\nAccording to government census data, there were an estimated 92,000 children in home education in England on census day (Autumn 2023). This was the total number of children being home educated on that day, not just those new to it.\nThis figure was based on around 95% of English local authorities, and has been adjusted for non-response. It is up by around 11,100 on Autumn 2022.\nThe census suggested that while the biggest known reason for moving to home education was still philosophical beliefs, mental health was the biggest factor in the recent rise.\nThe number of families choosing home education because of mental health rose by 64%, from around 7,281 in 2022, to 11,960 in 2023.\nHome education in England makes up the bulk of the figures, with at least 46,711 new council notifications in 2022-2023, up from at least 47,008 in 2020-2021.\nThe biggest rise in new home education notifications in the devolved nations was in Wales. It saw a 17% rise between the pandemic and the last academic year. \nA Welsh Government spokesperson said it recognises the right of parents to home educate, but in most cases school is the best place for them. They added that currently, around 1% of children in Wales are home educated. \nIn Scotland, there was a 3% rise, although the figures for new notifications were the lowest of all the UK nations. \nA spokesperson from the Scottish Government said recognising the impact of the pandemic, it is progressing measures to support pupils in schools. \nNorthern Ireland saw a 13% drop in new home education notifications. \nA spokesperson from its Education Authority said during the pandemic, there was a notable rise in the number of children being electively home educated - but it does not hold information on decisions parents made about this. \nWendy Charles-Warner, who chairs the home education charity Education Otherwise, said the UK\u2019s children were going through a \"mental health crisis\". \nShe said many parents felt their children\u2019s schools could not meet their needs and they home educated as a last resort.\n\u201cThey are left with no choice, and every parent should have a gen",
    "The sudden closure of the Plymouth Fish Auction last month has rocked Looe's fishing industry.\nWhen the fish market in Looe closed in 2019, fishing crews in the town began to rely on the company Plymouth Trawler Agents to take their catches.\nTo help out the fishermen, Looe Harbour Commissioners are temporarily transporting the day-catch twice a day to Brixham in Devon for its fish auction.\nHowever, Cornwall crews said it was not the commissioners' job to do such work, while other members of the industry have warned that prices could rise as a result.\nMike \"Moogie\" Pengelly has been fishing off Looe after leaving school in 1967 and owns the small stern trawler the Ganesha with his two sons.\nHe said things could be \"disastrous\" after the closure of the Plymouth market \"put us in a bit of a pickle\".\nHe said: \"We're relying on Brixham now. That's it.\n\"We used to land on Looe Market, but that collapsed and we went to Plymouth, which was successful.\n\"Now that's wrapped up and we're in a bit of a mess at the moment.\" \nHe said the issue was transport and, although the harbour commissioners had been very good at helping sell catches, he said that was not their job. \n\"Whether we buy our own transport... we don't know what to do at the moment,\" he said. \nDave Bond, chairman of the Looe Harbour Commissioners, said: \"To get the fisherman out of trouble, we are providing the transport to Brixham Market. \n\"Fishing has always been the mainstay of Looe. We feel it right to try and help the situation.\n\"We are in that position at the moment, but, hopefully, it's only an interim arrangement and a transport company or something will develop.\"\nSam Chapman, of Pengelly's Fishmongers in Looe, had relied on the Plymouth auction house to supply his fish. \nWhen Plymouth Trawler Agents ceased running the fish market on 17 May, he started going to Newlyn to collect fish for sale. \nThe average time it takes a lorry to get to Newlyn, unload and return is about five hours. \nMr Chapman said he was now considering buying another lorry and employing another member of staff to collect the day-caught fish from Brixham Harbour. \nWith increasing costs, this could lead to increasing prices of fish, he said. \n\"Fish is already at an all-time high, and people are being put off by the price. \n\"This can only go one way, and it's not going to make it cheaper,\" said Mr Chapman.",
    "A couple who have a daughter with Down's syndrome called for a change in the law on abortion.\nSteve and Natalie, from Northampton, said the birth of Verity, 15 months ago, had changed their view on the current legislation.\nAt the moment, pregnancies which involved foetuses with Down's syndrome could be terminated up to the point of birth.\nThe couple want legislation for Down's syndrome amended so that it is in line with the 24-week cut-off for standard pregnancies, which Natalie said was \"about equality\".\n\"She [Verity] wants to eat, she wants to sleep, she wants to have a clean bum - she has no extra needs than any other child her age,\" Natalie added.\nPeople with Down's syndrome are born with an extra chromosome, usually by chance due to a change in the sperm or egg before birth. There are estimated to be around 47,000 people with Down's syndrome in the UK.\nAccording to the Down's Syndrome Association, people who have Down's syndrome will have some level of learning disability, but also a range of abilities. \n\"Some people will be more independent and do things like get a job,\" it said.\n\"Other people might need more regular care.\"\nSteve added: \"I was very much of the old-fashioned view that I didn't want to take on that burden - that was the word that would have been in my head at the time.\n\"Now I can see how many possibilities there are for any child with a disability.\"\nThe law as it stands effects a range of disabilities - but an amendment that had been due to be voted on this week would have only changed the abortion law as it relates to Down's syndrome.\nA vote will not now be taking place due to Parliament being dissolved after the calling of the general election for 4 July.\nIt would have been a free vote, with MPs not forced to follow a party line.\nHowever, some charities and professional bodies said the current legislation gave parents the time to get medical advice and make difficult decisions.\nJane Fisher, chief executive of Antenatal Results and Choices, said a change to the law \"would put undue pressure on women and families at a time that it would feel almost unbearable\".\nShe added: \"You're grappling with what to do, you're gathering information, you're taking advice from your medical team... if you're told you have days, or even hours to make that decision... it makes a really distressing circumstance even worse.\"\nIn November 2022, a woman with Down's syndrome lost a legal challenge to the existing law - the 1967 Abortion Act as amended by the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act - when judges at the Court of Appeal decided it did not interfere with the rights of living disabled people.\nHeidi Crowter argued that the rules discriminated against people with Down's syndrome and \"doesn't respect my life\".\nShe later said she would take her case to the European Court of Human Rights.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The Duke of Edinburgh (DofE) awards at HMP/YOI Pentonville in north London are now in their third cohort since beginning in 2023, with 32 young inmates about to receive their bronze and silver medals. BBC London went to see how it is going.\nWhile one dedicated DofE award hopeful delicately places raspberries on to a cheesecake as the finishing touches, another makes a pot of tea, politely asking all the guests how they like it.\nBut this is not a normal afternoon tea. We went through a labyrinth of bolted doors to get to this kitchen and in the corners of the room, officers with jingling keys are looking on.\nInside Pentonville, Morgan, 21, and Mo, 24, are two young offenders hoping that the skills they learn with the award - such as cooking, literacy, sports, mental health education and leadership skills - will help turn their lives around when they are back on the outside.\nTeenagers at school are typically the candidates for DofE, which sees them completing extra curricular activities for a more well-rounded skillset before leaving school. It's been running in prisons since 2021 and by the end of next year, it is expected to have expanded to 40 prisons across the country.\nMorgan and Mo are both serving time for non-violent drugs offences and although they appear relaxed, articulate and friendly when they chat to us on the sofa in the prison library, they say they have come a long way to even get to a position they would be able to do this.\nThey tell us that for many of them doing the award, it has been the first time in their lives they feel they have had an opportunity to achieve anything at all, even something that to many would seem to be an everyday task, such as making a cheesecake.\nIt's not Morgan's first on the wrong side of the law, but he's determined this will be his last.\n\"I'm only really used to crime, even environments like this [the library], I'm not used to, this room speaks volumes, it's crazy and it's something I've never done before,\" he says.\n\"If I'm being totally honest, I only signed up as a way of getting out of my cell, but as time went on I saw for what it was, I started to enjoy it. It's opened a lot of doors and it's opened my mind.\"\nMo added: \"It's been a good journey, there's been skills that we've been allowed to do like football and cooking that you wouldn't be allowed to do as a normal prisoner so Duke of Edinburgh has been opening doors for us.\n\"Rather just being in cell, I'm on a path, I'm rehabilitating and I'm changing my life.\"\nPrison teacher Elizabeth Dear, who is the force behind the project, tells us that it was the only prison class that had 100% attendance, at another prison she worked at. \nAs such, she was determined to make it an option for the young offenders at Pentonville, which is now on its third cohort since March 2023.\nWhat makes it unique, she says, is that the prisoners can choose their own topics, they are not regular school subjects and it gets them doing practical things and that have real-life uses.\n\"The best part of it is the individualisation of it, in prison there aren't that many choices that you get to make every day that are your own, so the fact that you can choose your skill and where you volunteer,\" she explains.\n\"It's so important for these guys to have that freedom of choice and to feel like they are in control of what they're learning and they can do something they are genuinely interested in.\"\nFor Morgan, learning to how present himself was a vital skill he didn't previously realise he needed.\nHe explained: \"You've got to learn how to conduct yourself and change your vocabulary - how to speak, act in different environments. \n\"I didn't always speak like this, a lot of the time I used words that people don't understand.\n\"A lot young people have no people skills, the way they speak to officers, the way they come across seems rude and that just creates a clash. \n\"After doing this, I have seen young people that now know how to talk and approach people. \n\"It's helped them go a long way in here and I can only imagine how much this would help them on the outside too. It's the teamwork that helps so much too, picking skills up from other people.\"\nHe added that the support inside was vital to their success outside and stopping the cycle of reoffending.\n\"A lot of people leave prison and come straight back because they are not given the opportunities to really better their lives. It starts here,\" he says.\n\"There's no support on release, so if you're not helping people in here and they are not going to know what to do when and navigate life afterwards and put a plan together and make the right decisions when they get released.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "More children are being home educated in Jersey, a Freedom of Information (FOI) Request has found.\nGovernment figures show the number of children being educated at home has risen from 57 in the academic year 2020/21 to 84 in 2023/24 - an increase of nearly 50%.\nIn the UK, a BBC investigation has found the number of children moving to home education has risen to the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOne mum in Jersey said home education allowed her to shape learning around the needs of her children.\nKayleigh, who recently took her two children out of primary school, said their behaviour had improved. \nShe said Sampson, 6, seemed to be neurodivergent and was getting quite angry at school, while Dahlia, 4, was struggling with noise levels in the classroom.\nKayleigh said she was \"not a fan\" of the traditional school system, which had \"too much focus on English and maths\" and not enough on the creative side.\nShe said half their time was structured lessons, loosely following the school curriculum and the rest was led by the children, including nature walks, bug hunts and art lessons.\nKayleigh said there should be more government support for parents who home educate, including funding towards books and other resources.\nIn Jersey, parents have to apply to register their children with the government department for Children, Young People, Education Skills (CYPES) before they begin home educating.\nGovernment data shows the number of children registered as home educated with CYPES increased by 20% from the academic year 2022/23 to 2023/24.\nMinister for Education Deputy Rob Ward said the government had taken a \"step forward\" by appointing a point of contact for parents during the registration process.\nUnder Jersey's education law, children do not have to follow the curriculum taught in schools but they must receive education that is \"equal to\" what they'd get in school.\nMr Ward said the government had set up an exam centre at Highlands College for home educated children and also covered some of their exam costs.\nHe said ongoing support for home educated children with special educational needs was also provided, adding there was \"a positive relationship with those who are home educating because we all want the same thing for the children, which is the best possible outcomes\".\nThe government has also worked with the Jersey Association of Home Educators (JAHE), which was set up as a non-profit in 2021 to support home educating families.\nOccupational therapist and home education campaigner Anne Laure Jackson has worked in schools at the same time as home educating her own children.\nShe said attitdudes towards home education had changed since she moved back to Jersey in 2012.\n\"It was almost like how dare you be so audacious to think you can home educate,\" she said, adding there had been a \"phenomenal change\" in the island with a growth in understanding from the education department and the community.\nShe said the pandemic opened the eyes of a lot of families to what was possible for their children.\n\"Home education is not anti-school it's about where is the best fit for your child,\" she said.\nFollow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "New measures to crack down on car cruising are being considered in south Staffordshire.\nThere have been an increase in such incidents on roads including the A449 and A460 in the Coven and Featherstone areas in recent months, district councillors heard.\nStaffordshire Police said in a report for the meeting it had powers to seize vehicles being driven in an antisocial manner on the routes from the A449/M54 junction to the island junction with Brewood Road. \nHowever signs have been removed in several places and, without them, enforcement could not take place, the study for South Staffordshire Council\u2019s Overview and Scrutiny Committee said.\nCar cruising sees owners showing off their modified cars to fans and can include vehicles driven in convoy, speeding, racing and the revving of engines.\nThe committee heard on Tuesday a High Court injunction had been considered and such a move would forbid anyone who was a driver, rider or passenger in or on a motor vehicle to take part in gatherings in specific locations. \nPolice would then have the powers to arrest anyone who breached the injunction but concerns were raised about how police officers would handle a situation if there were several arrests at the same time.\nA car cruising injunction is already in place in the Black Country, covering Wolverhampton, Dudley, Sandwell and Walsall.\nCannock Chase Council had an injunction in place for several years but had recently reviewed it and were investigating alternative approaches, the council heard.\n\"Although the power of arrest gives police the power to arrest and bring offenders before the court in 24 hours, should there be multiple arrests the police suggest this is unworkable due to the number of officers required,\" the report added.\n\"If there are multiple offenders, taking them to court will be resource intensive to the council\u2019s solicitor and cost approximately \u00a31000 per visit.\"\nThe council is now considering introducing a Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) in the area. \nPSPOs were introduced by the government in 2014 and aim to restrict certain activities in set locations, allowing officials to deal with breaches through issuing fines\nIn this case, the council heard offenders could face a fixed penalty notice or prosecution through a magistrates\u2019 court with a  potential fine of up to \u00a31,000.\nCouncil officer Maggie Quinn said those watching car cruising could also be targeted by the order if they were supporting it.\n\"It could save lives because there have been a few lives lost of spectators at car cruising events,\" she added.\nCommittee members backed the PSPO proposal which was due to go out for a public consultation.\nApproval was also sought for the installation of replacement signs for those the police said were missing.\nThis news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",

What happened to him happened to us both. I\u2019ve spent 70 years without him. I feel I deserve to know what happened, to know the truth,\" Ms Hart, 69, said.\nThe mother-of-two, from Solihull, also tried to verify information regarding her own birth but learned that her early records up to the age of 21 were lost.\nIn 2020, Nadine Dorries MP told the House of Commons: \"Until the 1980s and 1990s, bereaved families of stillborn children were kept in the dark by doctors and midwives, ostensibly for their own protection.\n\"It was assumed that if a mother or father was allowed to see their stillborn baby and establish any kind of connection with it, this would only prolong and worsen their grief.\"\nOften the records of the burials were not kept, were lost or in some cases mothers were told their child was buried with a woman when in fact they were buried in a mass grave with other babies.\nIn some cases fathers were asked to take their stillborn children for burial in a cardboard box tied up with string.\n\"It\u2019s the lies told that are hard to live with and to find out there is no record of the baby you carried and lost after nine precious months is a travesty,\" Ms Hart said.\n\"I do think it is vital for mothers still alive to know the truth.\"\nMs Hart's  brother was taken to an undertaker in Stourbridge after he died.\nThe family was told John had been buried with a woman in the town.\n\"I was so angry at him leaving me to face the traumas of life as his little sister.

    "A man who attacked his ex-partner over the head with a rubber mallet in front of their two young children has been jailed for life for her murder.\nCarolyn Kemp, 34, was lured by Trevor Baker, 53, to his home in Romford, east London, in November 2009.\nHe then attacked her in the hallway as their son Callum, aged four, watched and daughter Kiera, aged three, hid under a blanket, the Old Bailey heard.\nAfter Baker admitted Ms Kemp's murder in March, Judge Alexia Durran handed him a life sentence, reduced to five years and eight months due to the time he has already served in prison.\nAfter the attack Ms Kemp was left in a pool of blood for 24 hours before she was found by her worried family.\nShe had suffered a permanent brain injury, and in 2010 Baker admitted attempted murder and was handed indeterminate sentence with a minimum term of eight years.\nHowever, Ms Kemp died 13 years later in September 2022.\nProsecutor Henrietta Paget KC told the court the couple had been together for nine years, but that following their separation Baker became depressed, drank heavily and became \"fixated\" with Ms Kemp.\nThe Old Bailey heard before the attack he confided in a neighbour he was planning to give away the family pet and said of his ex-partner: \"I have got to kill her, she's got to go.\"\nOn the day of the attack Baker told Ms Kemp he was too ill to return their children to her after an access visit and she should collect them from his home instead.\nLater, Callum heard a crashing sound and saw his father hitting his mother repeatedly over the head \"as hard as possible\", the court was told.\nBaker then left with the children and used Ms Kemp's car to drive to his mother's house, with blood on the sleeve of his jumper.\nHe told his mother that he hit Ms Kemp with a rubber mallet and called an ambulance, leaving the door open.\nBut the Old Bailey heard Baker had not alerted emergency services, and Ms Kemp was not found for 24 hours until her concerned brother Christopher and their mother Sylvia forced open the door.\nThey discovered Ms Kemp lying on her right side with a large wound to her forehead, whimpering and covered in blood.\nAfter she was taken to hospital police searched the home and uncovered drag marks, a clump of hair and various weapons, including a mallet in the shoe rack.\nThe family dog had been killed by Baker and was found dead in the shed.\nThe court was also told Baker had a history of violence and coercive and controlling behaviour towards women.\nHe has previous convictions for making threats to kill and assault, including on his ex-wife in 1997 and was on bail at the time of the attack on Ms Kemp.\nIn an emotional statement read to the court, Callum Baker said seeing the attack \"left me with severe psychological scars I will carry with me for the rest of my life,\" adding his father was a \"danger to society\" and he hoped he would not \"see the light of day\".\nKiera Baker said in a statement read to the court that she had also suffered \"deep childhood trauma\".\nShe said after her mother was attacked \"so horrifically\", Ms Kemp was trapped in her own body  - unable to move, talk or even give her a hug.\nMs Kemp's mother Sylvia Kemp, who went on to raise her two grandchildren, said: \"You, Trevor Baker, will never know how much you have put my family through.

Whether gates are nice and easy to open, and whether they open both ways,\" he added.\n\"When we were carrying out the access audit we were asking our participants, who were disabled people and carers, about the barriers that would impact them, and that varies from person to person.\"\nAmong those who have taken part in the audit is Chantelle, a mum-of-three from Hartcliffe in south Bristol.\nTwo of her children are disabled, and she joined the group in the hope it would help make her local park more accessible.\n\"It's also to deal with anti-social behaviour that makes the children feel unsafe,\" she said.\n\"We want to provide more lighting here (at Millennium Green in Hartcliffe), which would be brilliant.\n\"It would mean the local community could keep a closer eye on their park to keep it safe.\"\nThe group is also creating a \"best practice tool kit\" to help councils and other authorities get involved. \nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "In the build-up to D-Day 80 years ago, every port, harbour and river along the south coast was packed with ships and landing craft. \nSome of them set sail several days before the invasion took place and had to bob around in the Solent and the English Channel until they got the order to go.\nAmong those who boarded a landing craft at Lepe Beach in the New Forest, Hampshire on 3 June 1944, was 20-year-old trooper Cecil Newton. \nNow, aged 100 and living in Aldbourne in Wiltshire, Mr Newton has shared his memories of being seasick on the voyage across the Channel, with the BBC.\nMr Newton served in the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards and worked as a loader in the crew of an amphibious Sherman Tank.\nAt dawn on D-Day his landing craft approached Gold Beach, with the objective of knocking out a fortified German blockhouse.\nHe said: \u201cI was never nervous. I was too young to be nervous. I hadn\u2019t got the imagination.\u201d\nMr Newton and his crew were in action for only a few moments. \nHe continued: \u201cIt was just off the landing craft into the water, an engagement with the blockhouse and then we sank.\u201d\nCecil\u2019s amphibious Sherman tank was among several not to make it off the beach, but all his crew got out when they sank in a water-filled shell hole.\nThey then went off to have a look at the blockhouse they had just destroyed, where Mr Newton found a bike to ride. \nLater in the war, Mr Newton and his crew were among the first British troops to enter the city of Lille, but triumph quickly turned to tragedy.\nIn November 1944, he was severely wounded when his tank came under attack in a German village.\nHe suffered a serious leg injury and was then shot three times as he got out of the tank.\nHe explained: \u201cI got out last as the loader and landed in the road behind the tank and said to myself \u2018Now what do I do?'

I was exceptionally lucky to survive.\u201d\nMr Newton will be travelling back to France to take part in the D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations. \nHe will be visiting a French school named after him and some of the places his friends fell in battle.\nAmong the fallen Mr Newton will be honouring during his trip, is his brother Frederic, who was shot dead by two Germans who raised their hands to surrender \u2013 but then opened fire.\nAsked what he thinks about the sacrifices made by his friends, he told BBC South: \u201cWaste of time.

    "The number of children being home educated in the South East has risen sharply, a BBC investigation has found. \nA total of 11,541 children were being educated at home in April compared with 6,435 in 2020. \nSome parents told BBC South East that schools couldn't cater for their children's special educational needs. \nThe Association of Directors of Children's Services (ADCS) says school dissatisfaction and mental and emotional health issues are reasons given by families.\nKellie Milano, who home educates her 13 year-old autistic daughter, said: \"She was anxious going into school, she didn't want to be there.\n\"She didn't feel she was listened to, but couldn't communicate what was wrong.\n\"I would end up with a little girl in the back of the car crying,\" she said. \n\"I was forcing her to go into school, but actually that wasn't the right thing to do, she was masking in school, and that was doing more damage than anything.\"\nKellie, who started Club Ausome in Rochester to support other families,  says a growing number of parents are now teaching their children at home\n She said: \"Numbers are massively increasing, there are always parents discussing the options of home educating.\"\nGovernment data from the education census in Autumn 2023 shows that whilst the biggest known reason for moving to elective home education remained philosophical (16% of the total), mental health came a close second (13%)\nExperts also believe behaviour issues after the pandemic have made school a difficult place to be for some pupils.\nLeanne, from Sussex, has been educating her teenage son, who has autism, for over three years. \nShe said: \"He wasn't able to go to school - the noises, the smells, it was too much for him. The school did their bit, but they couldn't do any more.\n\"His sensory got worse, he didn't want people to see his rituals.\"  \nLeanne says she is aware of more families opting to remove their children from school. \n\"Some schools are incredible at the special needs schools, but there are not enough teaching assistants in schools, there is a lot of pressure,\" she said. \n\"Whereas before it was a bit of a stigma, now it seems pretty normal. \n\"When I first home educated people were shocked, but now I know so many parents are doing it, just in my local area.\" \nThe national charity Education Otherwise said it was also aware of more families who felt their children's special educational needs were not being met in school.\nIts chair, Wendy Charles-Warner, said: \"They feel that they have no choice.

    "Jay Sean is seen as a trailblazer among South Asian musicians.\nHe's considered one of the first artists from an Indian background to make it as a popstar in the West, and one who's paved the way for others to follow him.\nBut it was a moment closer to home that really showed him how far things had come.\nSpeaking to BBC Asian Network, he recalls his daughter, now aged 10, and her classmates being asked to \"draw five different things that meant a lot to them\". \n\"One of them was the Indian flag,\" he says.\n\"And I almost teared up.\"\nJay says watching his daughter \"taking on her culture in a way she could feel proud\" was a long way from his own childhood.\n \"I am a first-generation British-born Indian, so it was very difficult for me to assimilate into society, into British culture,\" he says.\n\"We had to hide our culture for so long, in order to not be picked on or bullied.\n\"I feel like my generation has provided a safer space for our children, so they don't have to feel like they can't be proud to show off their culture.\"\nJay, who's been writing and performing since the early 2000s, says he didn't have many role models when he first broke into the music industry.\n\"When I started off there were close to zero South Asians in mainstream music and I found it quite lonely,\" he says.\nJay says his music, with hits such as Ride It and Down, has always been influenced by his culture, because it felt \"natural and organic\" to include it.\nHis latest track Heartless - a collaboration with Canadian producer Ikky - blends R&B with English and Punjabi lyrics.\nBut he admits to growing tired of feeling like \"the lone soldier for so many years\".\nWith a string of achievements, such as topping the US Hot 100, Jay says he expected other South Asian artists to be signed once he'd established himself. \nBut when it never really happened he decided to do it himself.\nJay's music label 3AM Entertainment has partnered with Virgin Records to support new artists.\n\"I got tired of waiting for other people to do it,\" he says. \"Because I just saw and witnessed too much talent around me on my travels.\"\nJay says he's at a point in his career where he wants to give back and support upcoming South Asian artists across the globe.\n\"I will always put out music but what's next for me is a bigger because I've been working towards that for many years,\" he says.\n\"I\u2019m just so proud to be able to provide a platform where we can sign artists from a South Asian background who never really had a chance to shine without some struggle or without being understood.\"\nSouth Asian music has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, and Jay says he's seen a shift in the way artists can connect with fans.\n\"As an artist you have to think where is the audience? In the '90s that might have been MTV. Now to promote your music you have to be on TikTok and Reels.\"\nJay 2009 hit Down featuring Lil Wayne recently went viral with users trying to copy the US rapper's verse.\nAnd his social media accounts - particularly his TikTok - are a mix of music promotion and more comedic clips.\n\"Acting goofy on camera is not comfortable for every artist, but I've always been a bit of a joker way before I did music,\" says Jay. \n\"And now I think a lot of my fans can connect with my personality through social media.\n\"And I'm very grateful for that.\"\nBut there's still a feeling among South Asian artists that they still don't get enough mainstream recognition.\nMore acts have been making it on to the line-ups of major festivals such as Coachella, and Radio 1's Big Weekend saw up-and-coming artists including Saloni, Deeps and Shehxna perform on the Introducing Stage.\nAlongside that, the first-ever Official British Asian Music Chart launched in April, aiming to help more young talent into the big time.\nJay says he hopes his new partnership will allow new artists to be appreciated on mainstream platforms and make a global impact.\nHe's already signed three artists - yet to be revealed - and believes it's the start of something bigger.\n\"We're feeling really, really positive about the kind of talent that we're taking on. \n\"And we want our artist to feel supported and represented.\"\nIf more artists from South Asian backgrounds break through, Jay says, the hope is that they can elevate the whole genre. \n\"K-pop has gone mainstream, the same way that Latin music has gone mainstream, and they\u2019re singing in their mother tongue.\n\"I feel like we should have that same opportunity and share it with the world.\"\nListen to Ankur Desai's show on BBC Asian Network live from 15:00-18:00 Monday to Thursday - or listen back here.",
    "A toddler who suffered sinus pain and lethargy for three months was found to have a raisin stuck up her nose.\nPeyton Handley, of Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, told her parents, Craig and Kirsty, that she had a pain and would scratch around the area.\nBut despite several GP appointments nothing was found until the three-year-old was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) in Glasgow.\nOnce there ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists managed to solve the mystery by fishing out a raisin that had been lodged in her nose.\nMr Handley, a former army medic, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that his daughter had been showing symptoms, like bad breath, for around three or four months \nHe said: \"We put it down to being viral and kids catching everything.\n\"We had brought her to the GP who had pretty much dismissed our concerns that maybe there was something blocking her airway\n\"We did have a good look up with torches and we couldn\u2019t see anything.\n\"But we haven\u2019t got the right kind of instruments to look properly.\"\nAs Peyton's symptoms persisted, the toddler showed discomfort as she scratched her nose, further leading her parents to believe she had something trapped in her airway.\nAnd when she was examined at the QEUH a specialist discovered the raisin \"within five minutes\".\nMr Handley said it was hard to tell when and how the raisin got into his daughter's airway.\nHe said: \"You turn your back for two seconds and they pretty much do what they want at that point.\"\nMr Handley praised the specialists who treated his daughter.\nHe said: \"The ENT guys at the Queen Elizabeth couldn\u2019t have been any more amazing to be honest. \n\"They were totally focused on Peyton, kept her at ease and found exactly what they were looking for within the first five minutes.\n\"I think if other parents were to go through the same thing, with similar symptoms, I would take it further properly.

    "A newborn baby found earlier this year in Newham, east London, is the third child abandoned by the same parents, the BBC can report.\nDNA tests presented to the East London Family Court established that \u201cBaby Elsa\u201d is the sibling of two babies, a boy and a girl, found in very similar circumstances in 2017 and 2019.\nDespite appeals by the Metropolitan Police, their parents have not been identified.\nThe BBC and PA Media were given special permission by the court to report the sibling link - and that the children are black.\nJudge Carol Atkinson said the story was of \"great public interest\" as babies are very rarely abandoned in modern Britain.\nAn expert told the court that, in his opinion, the genetic findings provided extremely strong scientific support for the view that Baby Elsa was \u201ca full sibling\u201d of the other two babies.\nThe older children have been adopted and Baby Elsa remains in foster care.\nShe was found by a dog-walker in January in sub-zero temperatures - the coldest night of the year - wrapped in a towel inside a bag.\nThe other babies - named Harry and Roman - had also been abandoned after birth in the same area of London.\nThey had been wrapped in blankets. One was also inside a bag.\nFamily Court documents stated Baby Elsa\u202fstill had her umbilical cord, and doctors estimate she had been born only an hour before.\nAlthough she was extremely cold when found, Elsa was described as crying and responsive. The court has since heard that she is doing well.\nThe Family Court has heard that the children - whose names have now been changed - will all know that they are full siblings, and there are plans for them to have some form of contact as they grow up.\nThe reporting of the sibling link was not supported by the local authority and England's Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass), which advises courts about children's best interests.\nThe Met Police said it was up to the court to determine whether the link between the children should be reported, but they told the court they did not wish to \u201cinadvertently promote or encourage struggling mothers to abandon unwanted babies in public spaces\u201d.\nEast London Family Court is taking part in a transparency pilot, which has been extended to cover almost half the family courts in England and Wales. This makes it easier for the BBC and other journalists to report cases.\nThe BBC and PA Media argued in court that it was a matter of public interest that the three children had been abandoned at birth by the same parents.\nCarol Atkinson, the most senior judge in East London Family Court, agreed.\n\u201cAbandonment of a baby in this country is a very, very unusual event,\u201d she said, adding that there was considerable public interest in such cases, for that reason.\nShe said the fact the three babies were full siblings was, for the same reason, \u201cof enormous interest\u201d in \u201cour current society\u201d.\nShe said that if she were to refuse reporting, it would affect the \u201cpublic consciousness\u201d of these matters, and restrict open justice in such cases.\nThe BBC and PA said further reporting was likely to assist the authorities in locating the children\u2019s parents, and that highlighting the relationship would put the focus back on the children\u2019s mother.\nVery few babies are recorded as abandoned at birth in England and Wales.

    "Warning: This article contains spoilers.\nFor hot, young singles looking for love, chances are there's a reality dating show to help them in their search for the one.\nITV's Love Island returns to our screens on Monday, just after an explosive finale drew BBC Three's I Kissed A Girl to a close.\nBut for Lailah Muscat, it was only when the cameras stopped rolling that her relationship story could start.\nDuring Sunday's I Kissed a Girl reunion, she and fellow contestant Meg Homer revealed they started dating shortly after the show wrapped - even though no sparks between them were caught on camera.\n\"I don't think reality dating is for me,\" Lailah tells BBC Newsbeat.\n\"There's so much pressure. \n\"You prepare for it because it's not going to be like anything you've experienced in the real world, but once you're in it, it can be so overwhelming.\"\nThe 25-year-old from Cardiff left the show in episode seven after struggling with dating multiple people and having to move on quickly from couples.\n\"Especially for the girls that had lasting relationships, it can build up a lot,\" she says.\n\"And I think then coming into the real world from that relationship, it's a big shift. \n\"It's really difficult and it's not for everyone.\"\nSwapping the Love Island villa for the Italian Masseria, I Kissed A Girl otherwise follows a similar format with a cast thrown together to face love triangles, budding romance and wandering eyes.\nBut there's a key difference, as all the contestants are lesbian and bisexual women.\nLailah tells Newsbeat it was \"a really wholesome experience\".\n\"It was such a positive experience for me, I've probably never felt so comfortable in who I am.\"\nAnd it introduced her to 24-year-old Meg, who confesses sliding into her DMs a day or two after filming stopped last summer. \n\"I knew she wasn't feeling herself in there,\" Meg, from Goole, says. \n\"So I thought I'd drop her a little message, see how she was getting on.\n\"A few days after that I thought, 'I'll test the waters, do a little flirt'.\"\nAway from the pressures of filming a reality show, the couple say they were able to explore their relationship in a more authentic way.\n\"We're both not the type of people to talk to three different people at the same time,\" says Meg.\n\"So we could explore it in our own time and in our own way.\"\nLailah says she and Meg \"kind of liked each other in there but just nothing came of it because we were focusing on our own connections\".\n\"After the experience and coming back to reality, I started thinking, 'Oh wait, maybe there was something there'.\"\nTheir first date was more real life than reality TV too, meeting up in Manchester for \"a cheeky Nando's\".\nThey say they've been an official couple since December and have introduced each other to friends and family. \nMeg says it's been \"difficult\" to watch the series back though.\n\"I don't think anybody wants to watch a relationship back with someone in the past,\" she says.\nOne of the major shocks in the finale was when Meg was stood up by fashion graduate Eva, who didn't turn around to kiss her at the end.\n\"She completely blindsided me,\" says Meg.\n\"It's not nice to watch, but I wouldn't have done anything different because I wouldn't be where I am today.\"\nFilming finished eight months ago and Meg and Lailah have been keeping their relationships under wraps to avoid spoiling the show.\nBut now the series has finished, \"I can hold Lailah's hand in public,\" says Meg.\n\"It's such a relief.\"\nThe only other couple from the show to stay together are Lisha and Abbie, who matched during filming. \n\"Even though there aren't winners of the show, it does kind of feel like we won,\" Lailah says. \nIn May, the BBC confirmed it had renewed I Kissed a Boy - which follows single gay and bisexual men - for a second series. \nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "Go to vote if you don\u2019t want to go to war.\nThat\u2019s the stark choice that Poland\u2019s Prime Minister Donald Tusk is presenting ahead of the European elections this weekend. His team is highlighting security, or, more precisely, the threat of Russian aggression, as the big theme.\nWith parties sympathetic to Russia set to make gains elsewhere, including in central Europe, Tusk\u2019s Civic Coalition is stressing that the EU needs to stand firm and united against the danger from Moscow.\nHe\u2019s urging the Polish people to get out and vote, to protect themselves.\nThe message taps into real concerns among the country\u2019s electorate, as many Poles are instinctively wary of their giant neighbour for reasons both of history and geography.\nFor more than 230km (142 miles), northern Poland butts up against Kaliningrad, the heavily militarised Russian exclave. Marked by thick rolls of barbed wire fencing, the border is monitored by vehicles fitted with thermal imaging cameras.\n\nAt the main crossing point, the word RUSSIA is clearly spelled out in red letters on the other side. Every busload of passengers is screened meticulously using a sniffer dog before it can pass.\nSecurity was already tightened when President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. But in the run-up to the Euro vote, Donald Tusk has declared that he\u2019ll do more.\n\"Shield East\" is a 10-billion-zloty (\u00a31.992bn) project to reinforce Poland\u2019s border, with everything from high-tech surveillance to trenches. It\u2019s intended to make sure \"the enemy\" knows to \"stay away\" from Poland, the prime minister announced.\nIt\u2019s to be coordinated with Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, three Baltic states with their own reasons to be wary of Russia.\nIn smaller Slovakia to the south, and in Hungary, politicians talk of the need for \"compromise\" with Moscow. That translates as concessions from Kyiv.\nThey issue statements that are filled with Kremlin talking points.\nBut Poland has remained firmly convinced of the risk from Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, should Ukraine be allowed to lose this war.\nFor this election, as Donald Tusk\u2019s team has hijacked the security agenda, the main opposition Law and Justice party, PiS, has focused elsewhere.\nIt\u2019s been busy slamming the EU\u2019s migration deal and slurring the Green Deal against carbon emissions, a policy the party fully backed whilst in power.\nBut Poland was already investing heavily in defence under a PiS government, because of the Russia threat. And the party hasn\u2019t abandoned the theme completely.\nOne PiS candidate for this election became a mini internet sensation with a campaign video showing him single-handedly stopping a Russian tank, Tiananmen Square-style.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped evil many times before and we will stop it again,\u201d Karol Karski intones, a bearded professor in suit and spectacles with one arm outstretched towards a tank smashing through the forest.\nHere in Poland, even the younger generation are being put on guard.\nIn a school just outside Warsaw, children have been learning survival skills. It\u2019s part of a new programme that\u2019s sending soldiers from the Territorial Defence to teach emergency drills in classrooms across the country.\nFrom evacuation to orienteering, via resuscitation, they\u2019re useful skills. But the teenagers we met were clear why they\u2019re getting the training.\n\"Because there is a war in Ukraine and we are in danger,\" 17-year-old Sebastian told me, in a break between drills.\nNot nervous, just matter of fact.\n\"Russia is near to us and they could attack us, I think,\" Igor agreed. \"We need to learn how to defend ourselves.\"\n\"One of the factors behind the creation of this project is the situation on our eastern border, and the state\u2019s response to the real threat,\" Captain Dominik Pijarski of the 6th Mazovian Brigade confirmed.\nI asked whether he was concerned about a military threat from Russia.\n\"Only fools are not afraid,\" the soldier replied, before adding: \"I believe that the entire nation has learned the appropriate lessons from what is happening \u2026 and is preparing to be ready at the highest level, in the face of a real threat.\"\nBut wariness of Russia doesn\u2019t always translate into unconditional support for Ukraine.\nA short drive out of Warsaw leads deep into farming country and small villages marked by towering crucifixes and Catholic shrines.\nLately, some of the fruit farmers here have left their fields to protest both on the Ukraine border and in central Warsaw.\nThey\u2019re upset at the EU Green Deal which will increase their production costs.\nBut they\u2019re also worried by the competition from Ukrainian farmers: exporting certain goods tariff-free as a form of support to the war-blasted economy.\n\n\"The competition from Ukraine leaves us no chance,\" says farmer Mariusz Konarzewski, who has been working this land since he was 18 and now fears for his livelihood: long, neat rows of slender apple trees.\nUkraine\u2019s farmers have better soil and higher yields, Mr Konarzewski explains.

    "Creating a Bridget Jones-esque character is nothing new.\nIn hundreds of books, films and TV series you will find chaotic, boy-obsessed millennial women all in pursuit of the same goal: finding their one true love. \nBut one of those characters that has managed to cut through is Queenie.\nDubbed as \"the black Bridget Jones\" by the book's author Candice Carty-Williams, Queenie is a 25-year-old British-Jamaican woman from Brixton, south London.\nAs well as navigating the usual trials and tribulations of a single woman in her 20s - think dating horror stories and daily identity crises - she is also battling a system that seems to be against her.\n\"That is what makes her a thousand times more political than Bridget Jones,\" explains 34-year-old Carty-Williams. \nThe 2019 best selling book has now been adapted into an eight part Channel 4 drama. \n\u201cIt was a huge challenge having to cut down 100,000 words into eight lots of 25 minute episodes,\" Carty-Williams says. \"You feel protective over the storylines and you want to make sure you stay true to the characters and events.\"\nDescribed by The Guardian as an \"important political tome of black womanhood and black British life\", Queenie doesn't shy away from addressing issues such as everyday racism, feeling out of place and mental health. \nIn the first episode alone, Queenie deals with a gynaecology appointment that doesn't quite go to plan, her boyfriend's elderly relatives commenting on the skin colour of her future children, and a tragic break-up.\nShe also grapples with men who only want to sleep with her because she's black, and accusations from her Jamaican grandmother that she is bringing shame on the family for going to therapy. \n\"I was desperate for a black woman that wasn't the sassy sidekick or angry girlfriend but was just real and honest,\" Carty-Williams tells the BBC.\n\"That's why you do have this messy girl Queenie who is trying to figure out who she is, away from all the stereotypes.\"\nBut there is also a universality to the character. \n\"Everyone experiences heartbreak, loss and anguish so this story isn't just for black women, it's for every woman out there and I often meet women of all ethnicities and backgrounds who tell me about the impact Queenie has had on them,\" Carty-Williams says.\nDoing justice to such a powerful character was at the forefront of actress Dionne Brown's mind, particularly as it was her first major acting role since drama school.\n\"When I read the book it felt like a weight off my chest, I had no idea that other people also felt like this,\" explains the 28-year-old actress.\n\"So there was a pressure straight away, knowing that this character has done so much for so many people and you don't want to let anyone down.\n\"But eventually you just have to let go of that and focus on doing the best you can.\"\nIn 2020, Queenie won Book of the Year at the British Book Awards, and was runner-up for the Costa First Novel Award.\nThe novel reached number two on the Sunday Times bestseller list and was also shortlisted for book of the year prizes by Waterstones, Foyles and Goodreads.\nAnother new challenge for Brown while shooting the TV adaptation was filming sex scenes.\nThroughout the show, Queenie has a number of sexual encounters and some of them are particularly traumatic. \n\"I never did any romantic scenes at drama school so filming these were definitely nerve-wracking, especially the harrowing ones,\" Brown says. \nShe credits the intimacy coordinator on set for being \"so helpful in informing me about my rights and dispelling myths\".\n\"There were loads of things I just assumed were normal, but when I told the intimacy coordinator she said that wasn't the case.\n\"If you're not comfortable with being touched in certain places or have someone else's tongue in your mouth then you absolutely do not have to do it,\" she says.\nStriking the balance between addressing such sensitive topics as well as making people laugh takes a special kind of talent.\n\"I was raised believing that if you don't laugh then you'll cry so actually laughing things away has always been a coping mechanism for me,\" says Carty-Williams. \n\"Given that we are touching on such dark themes like miscarriage and trauma I knew we just had to have that humour in there as well.\"\nAnd the series is not short of funny moments - there's a bolshie Pakistani BMW driver who is convinced that Queenie is in love with him, a grandma who warns Queenie about Gemini men and a best friend, Kyazike, who refers to Queenie's boyfriend as \"the ivory king\" and \"parchment paper papi\". \nThere are also some rather poignant moments, notably how her WhatsApp group of friends, nicknamed The Corgis, support her through her breakup and how her relationship with her family develops and improves. \nAcross the eight episodes, Queenie begins to learn that romantic love isn't the only, and definitely not the most important, love that exists.\nIt is the love provided to her by friends and family that is far more powerful.\nQueenie begin",
    "At the Conservative Party conference in Manchester last year, I saw a long queue, snaking up and down stairs, around corners, and corridors. It was for a rally where Nigel Farage had offered to make a guest appearance alongside former PM Liz Truss.\nNigel Farage was there in his capacity as a GB News presenter, but he was often stopped and asked for selfies. He also went viral for singing Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You at a conference bash.\nAnd he spent some time fielding questions from journalists about whether he was pondering a run as a Conservative MP. Some wondered openly whether one day he'd try to run for leader. \nHe batted it away, but he later told the BBC that while he wouldn't join the Conservative Party in its current form, he would \"never say never\" and if after the next election they \"reset and re-align, then I might\u201d.\nNigel Farage\u2019s announcement on Monday to run as a candidate for Reform UK in this general election is a move that has the capacity to both reset and re-align the Conservative Party.\nDespite having stood to be an MP unsuccessfully seven times, he is more of a household name than some Conservative ministers. Many Conservative campaigners and strategists feared him standing for Reform UK, worried that he might split the vote in some seats that the Conservatives are trying to hold on to - or even ones where they\u2019ve previously enjoyed a pretty safe majority.\nWhile they won't admit it publicly, some in the Labour camp are privately delighted at the news of his campaign for exactly this reason.\nThis is the first way Mr Farage has the potential to \"reset\" the Conservative party - by potentially denying it seats.\nA poll that was published just minutes after Mr Farage announced his candidacy (and so were carried out some time before), suggests that Reform UK are not currently on course to win any seats. Of course this is just one poll, the usual caveats apply, other polls may vary.\nBut even if they don't win seats, if the right-wing vote is splintered in some constituencies, especially those that are more marginal, that could spell quite severe trouble for the Conservative party.\nThat matters because when parties suffer a very large defeat, as Labour experienced in 2019 for example, it can often be a moment of reckoning - a point of reflection about whether the party needs a total handbrake turn of direction, purpose - and, usually, of leader.\nSecondly, by becoming leader of Reform UK, he likely feels that he has the capacity to \"re-align\" the Conservative party in policy terms too. And, again, he wouldn't necessarily need to win seats to do so - the threat alone might be enough.\nArguably, by worrying Conservatives afraid of losing their seats, Reform UK has the capacity to influence Conservative policy even if it currently doesn't have any seats.\nWhether it has been rhetoric about being tougher on migration, or announcements on national service or pensions, the Conservative Party have already put out a number of policies which seem targeted at stopping some of their so-called \u201ccore\u201d vote - those who traditionally skew more right-wing and are perhaps an older demographic - from switching.\nThe test for Nigel Farage on a personal level will be whether this election is finally the time that he gains influence from within parliament itself, or whether he must continue to shape it from the outside.\nHe clearly feels he has a shot at becoming an MP. Clacton is a seat that voted heavily to leave the EU. Its former MP Douglas Carswell defected to UKIP in 2014, when Nigel Farage was party leader. Mr Farage's Brexit Party did not field a candidate there in 2019 as part of an election strategy to not split the Brexit-supporting vote, allowing the Conservatives to win a safe majority there.\nWinning a seat will still be a challenge.\nHe used his speech on Monday to argue the election result is already a foregone conclusion and that he believes Labour will win. He sees this now as a race to shape the opposition in the next parliament, and he clearly intends to shape the future of the Conservative party in the UK.\nAs a member, or even leader one day? As ever with Nigel Farage, you can't really ever rule anything out. As he made clear in his speech, he's not afraid of changing his mind.\n\nThe other candidates announced as standing in Clacton so far are:\nGiles Watling, Conservative Party\nJovan Owusu-Nepaul, Labour Party\nMatthew Bensilum, Liberal Democrats\nNatasha Osben, Green Party\nA full list will be published on the BBC News website after nominations close on Friday\nBBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

    "Some voters in November may see a less familiar option on their presidential ballot when in the polling booth this November: Chase Oliver. \nMr Oliver is this year's presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party, a political party that typically wins around one per cent of the national vote and is known for promoting civil liberties and small government. \nAt 38 (just three years above the constitutional threshold to be a presidential candidate), Mr Oliver is by far the youngest contender in this year\u2019s field. \nHe is also the only openly gay candidate, which he says he hopes serves as an example to aspiring LGBT politicians. \nThe former Georgia congressional candidate finds himself as a third-party presidential nominee in an election where voters have a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Former President Donald Trump has won the Republican party nomination and President Joe Biden is fighting for his second term as the incumbent Democrat, setting the stage for a re-match between the two candidates. \nOn Saturday, Trump spoke to the Libertarian Party national convention in Washington DC and asked for their support. He was roundly booed.\nThis was no surprise to Mr Oliver, who ultimately won the party\u2019s presidential nomination after seven rounds of balloting the following day.\n\u201cHe came here to try to court our voters,\u201d Mr Oliver told BBC\u2019s Americast podcast on Thursday. \u201cHe got the exact Libertarian reception someone like him deserves.\u201d\nMr Oliver said Trump represents \u201cthe warfare state around the world\u201d and criticised his expansion of the US national debt and the Covid lockdowns during his four-year term in office.\nIn the end, the Libertarian convention chair ruled that Trump, as the presumptive Republican nominee, was ineligible to be the Libertarian nominee.\nThe Republican former president wasn\u2019t the only outsider to address the convention. Robert F Kennedy, who is currently organising an independent bid for president, also spoke \u2013 and his reception was significantly warmer.\nWhen it was time for balloting, however, he only received support from only about 2% of the delegates and was eliminated in the first round.\nIn polls of the American public, however, Mr Kennedy has been doing significantly better than any third-party or independent candidate in decades, polling around 15% at his highest. That\u2019s well above the 3% that was the high-water mark for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson in 2016 election results.\nMr Oliver says he understands why Mr Kennedy, the nephew of US President John F Kennedy, would do well \u2013 but he told Americast that voters looking for an outsider are better served with his party, which is trying to build a lasting alternative to the two-party system.\nMr Kennedy, he warns, is a \u201cone-and-done\u201d option who won\u2019t be around after this election.\n\u201cDo you want to cry out with a protest vote?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr do you want to build something that can last and build up a foundation so that we can tear down the abuses of the state together?\u201d\nDan John, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has been a Libertarian since the 2000s and recently became a delegate for the Libertarian party ahead of this year's national convention. \nMr John said he thinks a Libertarian candidate could have more sway in this year's election cycle than in years prior.\n\"We've had one term of each [Biden and Trump] and you've got people who hate their lives under both,\" the 39-year-old said. \"We've got the protest vote for that reason.\"\nBut if Mr Kennedy cuts too deeply into the Libertarian vote share in November, the party could drop below the mark many states set to receive an automatic line in upcoming presidential elections. Such a result could deal a devastating blow to the Libertarian hopes of further broadening the party\u2019s support.\nLana Leguia, 32, attended the Libertarian convention and said she plans to vote for Oliver in November.\n\u201cI think a Libertarian candidate... is going to be direct competition for Kennedy and I think people are ready for something new, something outside of the duopoly. They\u2019re done with Trump and Biden,\u201d said the resident of Sussex County, New Jersey.\nCentral to the Libertarian pitch is an aggressive effort to limit the scope of government by paring back spending and regulation and expanding personal freedoms. In practice, this includes decriminalising most drugs and prostitution, expanding the right to own firearms, drastically curtailing US military spending and allowing open immigration.\nSome of the party positions have limited public support and cut against the mainstream political debate at the moment.\n\u201cWe have to educate the public that immigration is not a scary thing,\u201d Mr Oliver said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a natural thing that we\u2019ve seen for hundreds of years on the continent of North America and something that I would like to continue seeing.\u201d\nHe adds that one of his goals for the upcoming campaign is to expand the appeal of his party to younger voters, who have expressed a particular dissatisfaction with the politi",
    "Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton died from cancer over 15 years ago - now, his unfinished \"passion project\", about a humanity-threatening volcanic eruption, has been completed by fellow literary giant James Patterson and is already generating heated interest in Hollywood.\nEruption takes readers on a thrilling journey through Hawaii's biggest island, which, unbeknown to its residents, hides dangerous military secrets dating back decades.\nThere has been no formal screen auction yet - but Sherri Crichton, who discovered her late husband's unfinished manuscript over a decade ago and controls his estate, told BBC News she was now in talks with Steven Spielberg about a possible big-screen adaptation. \nCrichton's earlier works, such as Twister, Westworld and ER, have sold for huge amounts, making him one of the world's most successful book, film and television writers - even in death.\n\"We have an incredible amount of interest,\" Patterson told me in a joint interview with Sherri, \"including five or so stars who've raised their hands, a lot of filmmakers, studios.\n\"When Jurassic Park came out, Michael and Steven Spielberg figured out a way to elevate the genre - and it was quite wonderful and different - and I think that's what we're hoping to do with this. \n\"We have partners in mind where the spirit of this will be not to make just another disaster movie.\"\nJurassic Park, Spielberg\u2019s highest-grossing film, is now a global franchise worth more than $6bn (\u00a34.7bn). \n\"We have gone back to Steven,\" Sherri said. \n\"What was so magical about it was they introduced things, like what Jim was saying, that have never been put on film before - and that's what this deserves. \n\"We need this elevated, where you are really taken for that ride like you went on with Jurassic. \n\"This is that same type of heart-pumping, feeling-chills experience - and to partner with the right team is everything.\"\nSherri knew Patterson, the world's biggest thriller writer, who has read all of Crichton's novels, was the one she wanted.

    "A British bank that escaped prosecution for money laundering carried out billions of dollars of transactions for funders of terrorist groups, US court papers allege.\nStandard Chartered, one of the UK\u2019s largest banks, avoided prosecution by the US Department of Justice after Lord Cameron\u2019s government intervened on its behalf in 2012.\nNew documents filed to a New York court claim thousands of transactions worth more than $100bn were carried out by the bank from 2008 to 2013 in breach of sanctions against Iran.\nAn independent expert has identified $9.6bn of foreign exchange transactions with individuals and companies designated by the US government as funding \u201cterror groups\u201d, including Hezbollah, Hamas, al-Qaeda and the Taliban.\nIn a statement, the bank said it disputes the whistleblowers\u2019 claims, saying their previous allegations had been \u201cthoroughly discredited\" by US authorities.\nStandard Chartered was publicly accused of falsifying transaction data on Swift - an international payment system used by thousands of financial institutions - to move billions of dollars through its New York branch on behalf of sanctioned entities such as the Central Bank of Iran.\nBut in September 2012, George Osborne, then chancellor in Lord Cameron\u2019s government, secretly intervened on the bank\u2019s behalf.\nThree months later, the US Department of Justice decided not to prosecute the bank.\nThe foreign exchange transactions identified in the court filings were yet to come to light and it is not suggested that Mr Osborne or Lord Cameron had any knowledge of these transactions at the time.\nThe bank has twice admitted breaching sanctions against Iran and other countries - first in 2012 and then in 2019 - paying fines totalling more than $1.7bn. But it has not admitted conducting transactions for \u201cterrorist\u201d organisations.\nThe transactions lay hidden in confidential bank spreadsheets first handed to the US authorities in 2012 by two whistleblowers, including a former Standard Chartered executive, Julian Knight.\nThey allege US government agencies made false statements to a court in order to have their claim for a whistleblower\u2019s reward dismissed.\nThe US authorities involved in investigating the bank successfully applied to have their case dismissed in 2019. A FBI agent claimed to a court that it showed nothing that \u201cindicated or suggested that the bank had engaged in improper US dollar transactions\u201d after 2007.\nUS authorities argued the whistleblower\u2019s allegations \u201cdid not lead to the discovery of any new \u2026 violations\u201d and the court dismissed the case as \u201cmeritless\u201d.\nHowever, independent analysis by an expert with decades of experience with counter-terrorist financing, including at the US Department of Defense (DoD) and in the private sector, David Scantling, contradicts that.\nIn a court filing last Friday, he states that the spreadsheets contain records of more than half a million separate transactions between 2008 and 2013 that were \u201ccloaked\u201d, meaning they were not immediately visible in the spreadsheets but could be extracted through a simple technique well-known to analysts in his field.\nHis declaration says that among the records are numerous transactions by Standard Chartered Bank (SCB), \u201cwith or on behalf of Iranian banks, Iranian companies and Middle Eastern money exchanges that, according to [the US government], finance designated foreign terrorist organisations\u201d.\nHe says SCB processed transactions for a bank fronting for the Central Bank of Iran after it claimed to have stopped its Iranian operations in 2007.\nThat happened at the same time it was borrowing an average of $2bn a day from the Term Auction Facility, an emergency programme set up by the US government to support banks through the global financial crisis of 2007-2009.\n\u201cThe newly extracted data simply cannot be reconciled with the government\u2019s representations to the court in this matter that the [whistleblowers\u2019 evidence] contains no evidence of undisclosed sanctions violations,\u201d the Scantling declaration says.\nThe transactions include those of a Pakistani fertiliser company, Fatima Fertiliser, known for selling explosive materials that were used by the Taliban in roadside bombs that killed or maimed thousands of UK and US military personnel in Afghanistan.\nSCB, the shirt sponsor for Liverpool FC, also facilitated 73 transactions for a Gambian front company owned by a key Hezbollah financier, Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi, the documents allege.\nDaniel Alter, former general counsel at the New York Department of Financial Services, which first pursued SCB for breaching sanctions, called the new disclosures \u201cshocking\u201d and  \"exponentially worse\u201d than the bank admitted in 2012.\n\u201cThis shows a frightening connection to not just commercial entities, but terrorist organisations, terrorist front companies for organisations such as Hamas, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda, the Taliban - things that make up a regulator's nightmare - and we didn't know that: it was never disclosed to us.

    "The state visit to the UK by the emperor and empress of Japan will go ahead later this month, says Buckingham Palace.\nThere had been speculation it would be postponed because of the general election on 4 July.\nThe visit, from 25 to 27 June, will include traditional highlights such as a state banquet hosted by the King and a carriage parade along the Mall.\nIt will be the first state visit in modern times to take place during an election campaign.\nState visits take place on the advice of the government, with the King hosting events as head of state.\nSuch diplomatic showcases usually involve senior politicians, prompting questions about whether it would be delayed to avoid overlapping with political campaigning, but Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako's visit is going ahead.\nBuckingham Palace indicated the visit would be \"adapted\" because of the general election, but no specific changes have been revealed.\nThe state banquet is a centrepiece of such visits, with speeches and, in recent times, greetings from the King in the language of the visiting dignitaries.\nThe prime minister, foreign secretary and leader of the opposition usually attend - although the visit is now in the middle of the election campaign.\nThe state banquet is on 25 June and the BBC's head-to-head debate between Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer is on 26 June in Nottingham.\nA spokeswoman for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said the attendance of ministers at state visit events was not yet confirmed.\nThe last time there was a potential clash between an election and a state visit, in 2017, the visit by the Spanish king was rearranged.\nThis will be the first Japanese state visit to the UK since 1998, with a visit planned for 2020 cancelled because of the Covid pandemic.\nSuch state visits are a \"soft power\" mix of pageantry and international politics.\nThe Japanese royal couple, representing an important trade and defence partner, can expect the red-carpet treatment.\nThere will be a ceremonial welcome at Horse Guards Parade, with a guard of honour, and then a carriage procession along the Mall to Buckingham Palace.\nDuring their time in the UK, the Japanese royals will visit the Francis Crick Institute, a Young Victoria and Albert Museum exhibition about Japan and the world's largest collection of wild plant seeds at Kew Gardens.\nThere will be a visit to St. George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor Castle, to lay a wreath at the burial place of the late Queen Elizabeth II.\nBoth Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako were students at University of Oxford and they will make visits to the colleges where they studied.\nWhile the Japanese state visit goes ahead, the general election has prompted other changes to the King\u2019s diary, in case engagements were a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the election.\nThat included postponing a trip to a project in Crewe which supported families in poverty, including providing food and shoes.\nThere have been questions about the timing of the King\u2019s meeting with the incoming prime minister after the election.\nThe King would traditionally spend a week in Scotland, known as \u201cRoyal Week\u201d or \u201cHolyrood Week\u201d, at the end of June and the beginning of July.\nIf this clashes with the result of the 4 July election, it could mean the King having to travel back to Buckingham Palace or else the newly elected prime minister going to Scotland.\nWhen the new government is formed, the King will have a prominent part in the State Opening of Parliament on 17 July. \nIt will be his biggest constitutional role since his cancer diagnosis.",
    "Donald Trump has joined TikTok, despite attempting to ban it on national security grounds during his presidency.\nIn 2020 he signed a presidential executive order attempting to ban the platform for its links to China, which was ultimately blocked by US courts.\nHe has since criticised recent attempts to curtail it, saying this would empower Facebook-owner Meta.\nMr Trump, who has amassed more than 3.6 million followers since launching his account on Saturday, said he will use \"every tool available to speak directly with the American people\".\nPresident Joe Biden is also using the platform to campaign for re-election in November, but he has only picked up 340,000 followers - ten times fewer than that of his rival.\nIt comes after President Biden signed into law a bill which gives the social media platform's Chinese owner, ByteDance, nine months to divest the app or it will be blocked in the US.\nThe law was introduced because of concerns TikTok might share user data with the Chinese government - claims it has always denied.\nThe move by Mr Biden came as some surprise to the platform's estimated 170 million users in the US.\nMarcus Bosch, a researcher at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, said some TikTok users might see Mr Trump as \"a potential preserver\" of the app in the face of a potential ban - which might explain the speed at which he gained his following.\n\"TikTok alone is not decisive for the election but it has been a great real-time sensor for cultural and social atmosphere,\" he told the BBC.\nKaroline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, told NBC News the former president had \"already gained significant ground with young voters and this is another way to reach them\".\nHis first TikTok, a 13-second video of him attending a mixed martial arts event, has been viewed more than 60 million times.\nIt comes after Mr Trump was convicted following a seven-week criminal trial.\nJurors found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, as part of an effort to conceal hush-money payments to adult film performer Stormy Daniels.\nMr Trump acknowledged in an interview with CNBC in March that the app did pose a national security risk, but argued a ban would strengthen Facebook as \"an enemy of the people along with a lot of the media\".\nHis Facebook and Instagram accounts were suspended following the US Capitol riots on 6 January 2021, but these have since been reinstated.\nMr Trump launched his own alternative social media platform, Truth Social, in 2022 - he reportedly owns a near-65% stake in its parent company, Trump Media.",
    "Palestinians who have returned to Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza in recent days have expressed shock at the level of destruction following a three-week Israeli military operation there against Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups.\nOne displaced man who was among the more than 60,000 people who fled the intense battles and bombardment in the camp and its surrounding area last month said he had witnessed \u201chorrifying scenes\u201d.\n\u201cEven the sand beneath our feet is scorched; it's unbearable to walk on,\u201d he told BBC Arabic. \u201cThe streets are strewn with rubble and demolished buildings.

There are no clinics or medicines,\u201d he added. \u201cWells have been destroyed, shops and supermarkets demolished, and there is a shortage of food.\u201d\nThe town of Jabalia and its decades-old urban refugee camp - the largest in Gaza, with more than 110,000 registered residents - witnessed weeks of devastating bombardment and fighting after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops had secured control over the camp at the end of December after a series of operations in which it said \u201cmany terrorists\u201d were killed.\nIt subsequently scaled down combat operations across northern Gaza, declaring that Hamas\u2019s local battalions had been dismantled. But that left a power vacuum in which the group was able to rebuild.\nOn 12 May, the IDF said troops were going back into Jabalia for an operation \"based on intelligence information regarding attempts by Hamas to reassemble its terrorist infrastructure and operatives in the area\".\nOver the next three weeks, battles raged as tanks and troops advanced into the refugee camp under the cover of intense air and artillery strikes. One military official described the fighting as \"perhaps the fiercest\" they had seen over the past seven months.\nOn Friday, the IDF announced that troops had completed their mission, having \u201celiminated hundreds of terrorists in intense combat and close-quarters encounters\u201d and destroyed dozens of \u201cterrorist infrastructure and combat compounds\u201d.\nThe troops also located and destroyed more than 10km (six miles) of an underground tunnel network and retrieved the bodies of seven Israelis taken hostage by Hamas in October, it said.\nDisplaced families were soon pictured walking back to the camp along streets lined by destroyed buildings, carrying what remained of their belongings.\nA spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run Civil Defence force, Mahmoud Bassal, said on Friday that its rescue teams had found dozens of bodies across Jabalia camp -  mostly women and children - including 30 members of one family.\nOn Sunday, the director of the Kamal Adwan hospital in the neighbouring town of Beit Lahia, Dr Husam Abu Safiyeh, told Al Araby TV that 120 bodies had been recovered from Jabalia and the surrounding area, and that many more were believed to be buried under rubble.\nThe identities of the dead were not yet clear. But the IDF\u2019s Arabic spokesman, Lt Col Avichay Adraee, played down such reports on Friday, insisting on X that they were members of Hamas and other armed groups. \nMr Bassal also said Israeli forces had destroyed most of the homes in the camp, as well as its central market and almost all of its infrastructure. \nHe added that the fifth floor of al-Awda hospital in Jabalia had been destroyed along with the main electrical generators at Kamal Adwan.\nThe head of the municipal emergency committee for north Gaza, Naji Sarhan, declared Jabalia town, Jabalia camp, Beit Lahia and nearby Beit Hanoun as \u201cdisaster zones\u201d on Sunday,  estimating that 50,000 housing units had been destroyed there, according to a UN situation report. \nHe appealed to the international community for immediate shelter assistance and support in repairing water wells and other critical infrastructure.\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, meanwhile said it had received \u201chorrific reports\u201d from Jabalia camp, where it provides services.\nThey included displaced people, including children, reportedly being killed and injured while sheltering in an Unrwa-run school that was besieged by Israeli tanks, according to a post on X, formerly Twitter. There were also reports of Unrwa offices being destroyed by air strikes and bulldozed by Israeli forces, it added.\nUnrwa chief Philippe Lazzarini said thousands of people from the camp now had \u201cno choice but to live amid the rubble and in destroyed Unrwa facilities\u201d. \nOne of the returnees told BBC Arabic\u2019s Gaza Lifeline programme that he and his seven-year-old son had seen \u201cthe bodies of martyrs scattered everywhere in the streets\u201d on Saturday.\n\u201cEast Jabalia has been subjected to an unprecedented devastation,\u201d Diab Abu Salama said. \u201cAll the stores in Jabalia have been destroyed, as well as ",
    "The Post Office\u2019s most senior in-house lawyer when it fought the landmark case brought by Alan Bates and other sub-postmasters has been challenged by BBC News in Australia, after she refused to appear before the public inquiry into the Horizon scandal.\nA BBC team questioned Jane MacLeod, who was the Post Office\u2019s general counsel between 2015 and 2019, while she was walking her dog outside her home in Sydney.\nShe replied with \u201cno comment\u201d when asked why she wasn\u2019t attending. She had been due to give evidence this week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unsurprising, but it speaks volumes,\u201d says Jo Hamilton, one of the wrongly convicted former sub-postmasters. \u201cIf she was determined to help the inquiry, she\u2019d be there,\u201d she added.\nBorn in Australia, Jane MacLeod returned to live there in 2020. \nLast month Sir Wyn Williams, chair of the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry, revealed that while Ms MacLeod had submitted a witness statement, she had decided not to give oral evidence, despite being asked to do so.\nThe inquiry heard that the reason, offered by Ms MacLeod\u2019s lawyers, was that given the passage of time, she considered her written statement was the best evidence she could offer.\nSince then, Ms MacLeod has not responded to BBC requests for comment.\nSir Wyn said that even before seeing her written evidence, he\u2019d decided that Ms MacLeod was \u201can important witness\u201d from whom he wished to hear in person.\nHe added that despite the offer to have her travel and accommodation expenses covered, Ms MacLeod \u201chas made it clear that she will not co-operate with the inquiry by providing oral evidence\u201d, either in person or via video-link.\nHowever, Sir Wyn explained that his options to force her to attend were limited because she lived abroad.\nUnder the Inquiries Act 2005, witnesses can be legally compelled to give evidence \u2013 but this only applies to UK nationals.\nIn her written statement to the inquiry, Ms MacLeod says: \u201cI am very aware that the decisions in which I was involved during my time at Post Office Limited regarding the group litigation and the investigation of Horizon's performance and robustness have had implications for many sub-postmasters and their families.\u201d\nShe adds: \u201cI regret that this has happened and apologise to those so affected for the adverse outcomes they have suffered.\u201d\nJane MacLeod was the general counsel at the Post Office covering the period when it fought sub-postmasters in court in the landmark litigation led by Alan Bates.\nGiving evidence last month, the former boss of the Post Office, Paula Vennells named Jane MacLeod as one of the senior executives she had trusted to give her information \u2013 when asked by Sam Stein KC to list those who had let her down.\nMs Vennells also recounted asking Ms MacLeod why they were proceeding with the court case against sub-postmasters, which she said had felt \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.  \nShe told the inquiry that, after first suggesting the Post Office would most likely settle the cases, Ms MacLeod\u2019s view had been that the court case was \u201cthe only way to solve this\u201d.\nEarlier this year, a BBC investigation revealed documents showing the Post Office had evidence in 2017 that losses could be due to errors in the Horizon IT system or remote tampering.\nIn March, in response to the story, Jane MacLeod gave a statement to the BBC saying that she supported the ongoing public inquiry into the Post Office scandal and was assisting it.",
    "From the moment former Mayor of Mexico City Claudia Sheinbaum threw her hat in the ring for the presidency, the result was rarely in doubt.\nThroughout the long and often gruelling campaign, as she criss-crossed the nation on commercial flights, her double-digit lead in the polls would have reassured her that she was on track to make history.\nShe has now done so, becoming Mexico\u2019s first woman president by a huge margin.\nIt is a watershed moment both for Mexico and her personally. She has already served as Mexico City\u2019s first female mayor. Now, in a few months, she will occupy the National Palace, succeeding her mentor, outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, known by his initials, Amlo.\nNo matter what else happens in her political career or where her six years in power lead her, she will always be the woman who managed to break the glass ceiling in Mexican politics. Given the country\u2019s deeply ingrained patriarchy and entrenched machismo, that is no small feat.\nYet once the campaign leaflets are binned and the billboards bearing her face taken down, Mexicans could be forgiven for wondering exactly what kind of president she will be. In a campaign so full of words and speeches, there was precious little policy detail and few specifics about governance.\nOn the stump, she often repeated her basic premise: that she would build the \"second floor\" of the \"Fourth Transformation\" \u2013 that is, the political project of her ally, Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador.\nPresident L\u00f3pez Obrador and his supporters call it the \"Fourth Transformation\" or \"4T\" because they put his movement on a par with three transformative moments in Mexican history: Independence in 1810, the Reform War (and separation of church and state) of 1858 and the Mexican Revolution in 1910.\nUnsurprisingly, opponents say Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador and, by extension, Ms Sheinbaum have delusions of grandeur promoting such a title. But the 4T has become shorthand for a social agenda of universal pensions, student grants and family stipends which have been hugely popular across Mexico. The programme has lifted an estimated five million people from poverty throughout the country, although there is still widespread deprivation in many regions.\n\u201cThe essence of this transformation is to separate economic power from political power,\u201d she told the BBC in an interview in the eastern state of Veracruz. \"Economic power has its path, but government must be directed towards the poor in Mexico.\"\nPresident L\u00f3pez Obrador laid the foundations and built the first floor of the project, she said. \"Now, we are going to build on the changes he made to the country.\"\n\"It means more rights, a welfare state, education, health, access to housing, and that a living wage is a right, not a privilege,\" she added. \"That is the difference between neoliberalism and our model, which we call Mexican Humanism.\"\nIn essence, she stood on a platform of continuity, pledging to double down on President L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s agenda. Her win shows that was a proposal supported by a sizeable majority of the Mexican electorate.\nStill, the accusation from her detractors, in particular the second-placed candidate, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, is that the 4T is mere populism. Furthermore, she suggested Ms Sheinbaum would not be her own woman and would live under her mentor\u2019s authoritarian shadow. \nVote for Sheinbaum, get Amlo, her critics suggested.\nBut while some commentators in Mexico seem to expect her to slavishly follow her popular predecessor\u2019s lead, it does not necessarily follow that she will. There are many recent examples in Latin America where a supposed disciple has confounded expectations by striking out on their own. \nMs Sheinbaum herself is dismissive of the accusation. \"I will govern with the same principles as Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador, and that\u2019s a good thing for Mexicans,\" she told the BBC.\nAn urbane technocrat from a well-heeled Jewish family, whose maternal grandparents fled the Holocaust, she cuts a very different figure to Amlo. Their rhetorical styles are far apart. He hammers his points home with a flourish, enthralling his base, while she tends to be more measured and clipped.\nShe speaks fluent English, having completed her doctoral thesis in California. Before entering politics, she was an accomplished environmental scientist who served on the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nAccordingly, she is likely to be more comfortable on the world stage than her predecessor, whose success partly stems from his direct connection with ordinary people, particularly in indigenous regions and his home state of Tabasco. \nFor his part, Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador insists he has no intention of meddling in her administration. He is looking forward to retirement at his ranch in the southern state of Chiapas, he claims.\nStill, however their relationship evolves once he leaves office, most people want to see a marked improvement from Ms Sheinbaum in one key arena: security.\nFrom the launch of her campaign to her victory party - both of ",
    "Meme stock favourite GameStop is rising again, after a social media post seemingly from the investor known as \"Roaring Kitty\" claimed a sizeable stake in the video game retailer.\nShares in the firm opened for trade on Monday priced above $40 apiece, up more than 70% from Friday, before later retreating a bit. \nThe surge followed a screenshot shared by the Reddit account tied to Keith Gill, claiming he owned 5 million GameStop shares - nearly 2% of the firm's stock - a holding worth more than $100m (\u00a378m). \nThe post was one of a series in recent weeks that follow a long period of silence from the Roaring Kitty accounts.\nThe veracity of the post could not be confirmed. Neither Mr Gill nor GameStop responded to emails seeking comment. \nMr Gill became famous in 2021 for inspiring an army of online investors to back GameStop. \nIt led to an unexpected surge in the struggling firm's shares, creating a financial squeeze on professional Wall Street firms that had bet against the retailer.\nA post from that year showed Mr Gill held about 200,000 shares, worth $30.9m.\nShares in some other so-called meme stocks - whose rise and fall appears disconnected from the fundamentals of the business - also headed higher on Monday, such as AMC and Blackberry. \nAnalysts had argued the original rise of meme stocks was driven by the surge in savings and time many households had during the pandemic, thanks to government support programmes and the shutdown of many in-person activities.\nWith markets rising again this year, trading firms such as Charles Schwab and Robinhood have reported another uptick in new accounts and activity by retail investors - people not working for investment houses or other private firms.\nGameStop cashed in on the interest last month, raising $933m in a share sale.\nBut the activity has been a source of some disquiet in the financial industry and in Washington, which hosted hearings on the GameStop phenomenon in 2021.\nIn an interview last month with business broadcaster CNBC, former financial regulator Jay Clayton, who led the Securities and Exchange Commission under former President Donald Trump, compared it to gambling.\n\"It bothers me on many levels,\" he said. \"It's a lot closer to gambling than it is to trading and it's certainly not investing.\n\"Is this something we should be tolerating in our markets?\" he added.\n\"Whether it's legal or illegal, I don't think so.\"",
    "A company that breeds animals for medical testing has been fined a record $35m (\u00a327m) after 4,000 beagles were rescued from its facility in Virginia in 2022. \nThe fine against Envigo RMS LLC for animal cruelty is the largest fine ever issued under the Animal Welfare Act, according to the US Department of Justice (DoJ).\n\u201cEnvigo promoted a business culture that prioritized profit and convenience over following the law,\u201d Christopher Kavanaugh, the US attorney for the Western District of Virginia, said in a statement.\n\u201cThis callous approach led to dire consequences: the inhumane treatment of animals and the contamination of our waterway,\u201d he said.\nEnvigo's parent company, Inotiv, has agreed to pay the record eight-figure settlement. It has also agreed to not breed dogs for the next five years.\nBy committing the crimes it was charged with \"and by not making the necessary infrastructure upgrades and hiring the requisite staff, we fell short of our standards for animal and environmental welfare and apologize to the public for the harm caused by our conduct,\" Inotiv said in a statement on it's website on Monday.\nThe breeding facility in Cumberland, owned by Envigo RMS, was sued in May by the US Department of Justice. The federal agency accused it of multiple acts of animal cruelty.\nInspectors found some dogs were being killed instead of receiving basic veterinary care for conditions that can be easily treated. The animals were also being fed with food that contained maggots, mould and faeces, while some nursing mothers were not given anything to eat at all.\nThe rescue of the 4,000 dogs from the facility in August 2022 led to a nationwide effort by animal shelters to find the dogs new owners in the US. \nThe justice department said on Monday that Envigo had admitted that it had \"conspired to knowingly violate the Animal Welfare Act by failing to provide, among other things, adequate veterinary care, adequate staffing and safe living conditions for dogs housed at the Cumberland County facility\".\nThe breeder's sister company, Envigo Global Services Inc, has also admitted to breaking the Clean Water Act by not properly treating wastewater, adversely affecting the dogs' health and contaminating the environment.\nThe agreement calls for the company to pay $22m to the US government, as well as pay approximately $1.1m to the Virginia Animal Fighting Task Force and approximately $1.9m to the Humane Society of the United States for their help rescuing the beagles.\nThe deal will be formally approved by a judge on 7 October.",

It also described a former MP who was  \"maintaining a relationship with a foreign intelligence officer\u201d.\nOther examples in the report include \u201chow Indian officials developed and built a network of contacts through whom India conducts interference activities\". It also described a scheme where Indian officials were \"likely reimbursing a proxy who had provided funds to candidates of two federal parties\u201d.\n\"These activities continue to pose a significant threat to national security, and to the overall integrity of Canada's democracy,\" the report concludes.\nThe report concedes, however, that its conclusions are \"unlikely to lead to criminal charges\" despite it describing behaviour that may have been illegal. \nIt also takes aim at Mr Trudeau's Liberal government for being aware of these issues since at least 2018 and gathering intelligence but failing to \"implement an effective response\".\nDemocratic Institutions Minister Dominic LeBlanc, a member of Mr Trudeau's government, said in a statement that the government welcomes the report but disagrees with several aspects, including how some intelligence was interpreted.\nThe government last month introduced legislation that would accomplish many of the reforms laid out by the report.",
    "French intelligence officials believe Russia is behind a stunt in which five coffins draped in a French flag and bearing the inscription \u201cFrench soldiers of Ukraine\u201d were deposited near the Eiffel Tower.\nThree men were seen arriving in a van at about 09:00 (07:00 GMT) on Saturday. The coffins that they left were later found to contain sacks of plaster.\nPolice rapidly apprehended the driver, who claimed he had been paid \u20ac40 (\u00a334) by the two others to transport the coffins. He himself had arrived in Paris only the day before from Bulgaria.\nLater, police caught the two others at Bercy coach station in central Paris, where they were allegedly planning to board a bus to Berlin.\nThey told police they had been paid \u20ac400 to deposit the coffins, according to French media.\nPolice said the driver was Bulgarian and the two others were Ukrainian and German.\nThey were taken before a judge on Sunday, ahead of the expected opening of a judicial investigation for \u201cviolence with premeditation\", the prosecutor\u2019s office said.\nOfficials said that investigations were under way \u201cto see if this was organised from abroad\".\nThe circumstances recall two recent episodes in which French police believe Russian agents may have been involved. Both appear to have been attempts to manipulate public opinion.\nIn October \u2013 not long after Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking hundreds of hostages - Stars of David reminiscent of the Israeli flag were stencilled on several walls in Paris.\nA Moldovan couple was arrested, who French officials believe were paid by Russian intelligence.\nLast month, red hands were painted on a Holocaust memorial in Paris, and police believe the perpetrators fled abroad.\nAccording to Le Monde newspaper, quoting a source in the investigation, one of the individuals held on Saturday had been in telephone contact with a Bulgarian suspect wanted for the red-hands affair. Le Monde named this suspect as 34 year-old Georgi F.\nMoscow reacted angrily last month to President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s repeated refusal to rule out sending soldiers to Ukraine.\nLast week, Ukrainian officials confirmed that discussions had been held over the despatch of French military instructors.\nThis could provide the context for the coffins affair, investigators think, with Russian intelligence seeking to show that there is big opposition to deeper French involvement in the Ukraine war.\nIn both the Stars of David and red-hands affairs, the teams included a photographer whose pictures subsequently appeared on Internet sites linked to Russian propaganda.",
    "Shein, the controversial fast fashion giant whose popularity soared during Covid, may soon tighten its ties with the UK with plans to sell shares in the business on the London Stock Exchange.\nThe Chinese firm could file the relevant paperwork as soon as this week, potentially valuing the company at $66bn (\u00a351.7bn).\nShein's formula of offering a huge range of cheap clothes - backed up by campaigns with social media influencers - has turned it into one of the biggest fashion retailers in the world.\nBut it has faced severe criticism over its environmental practices, as well as allegations around the use of forced labour in its supply chain.\nA spokesperson for Shein declined to comment.\nIn a bid to boost its green credentials, the company launched a resale platform for shoppers in France on Monday, two years after the option first popped up for US customers. \nThe platform is set to launch in the UK and Germany later, although no date has been specified.\nThe company is looking at the UK as a place to sell its shares after facing hurdles and intense scrutiny in the US. Shein filed documents in the US last November.\nSome US lawmakers raised concerns about Shein's links to China as tensions between Washington and Beijing intensified.\nShein relies on thousands of third-party suppliers, as well as contract manufacturers, near its headquarters in Guangzhou, China.\nIt is able to turn around a new item in a matter of weeks, having sped up the \"test and repeat\" model, first used by the likes of Zara owner Inditex, where companies place small orders of clothing items, see how they perform with shoppers before ordering more if they are a hit.\nIf Shein chose the UK over the US, it would be a significant boost for the City of London.\nA UK share listing generates significant business for the wider financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy.\nAfter several firms have opted for the US instead, the UK government has been scrambling to make the country more attractive for companies to set out their stall.\nShein may choose to file the initial paperwork - known as a prospectus - with the Financial Conduct Authority this week, sources said, or it could happen later in June.\nFiling a prospectus with the FCA is a required first step for any company that wishes to sell shares on the London Stock Exchange.\n\u201cThis could be big news for the London stock market,\" said Colleen McHugh, chief investment officer at Wealthify, the investment firm, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme.\nBut she admitted the company may face some difficulties over claims about how it conducts business.\nThe filing with the financial watchdog is a necessary first step but doesn't guarantee that a float will go ahead.\nLast year, a group of US lawmakers called for Shein to be investigated over claims that Uyghur forced labour is used to make some of the clothes it sells.\n\"We have zero tolerance for forced labour,\" Shein told the BBC at the time.\nMeanwhile in May, a report suggested that workers for some of Shein's suppliers are still working 75 hours a week, despite the company promising to improve conditions.\nThe investigation by Swiss advocacy group Public Eye found that a number of staff across six sites in the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou were doing excessive overtime.\nAccording to the group, who interviewed 13 employees from six factories in China supplying Shein, excessive overtime was common for many workers.\nShein told the BBC it was \"working hard\" to address the matters raised by the Public Eye report and had made \"significant progress on enhancing conditions\".\nOn a London listing, Ms McHugh said: \"It\u2019ll be down to the regulator as to whether or not the listing can go ahead here [in the UK] \u2013 but it won\u2019t be without controversy.\"\nShein's executive chairman Donald Tang is an American citizen who was a former banker for Bear Stearns in Asia. \nHe has met both Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, in recent months to discuss the possibility of floating in London after hitting resistance from regulators and lawmakers in the US.\nA Labour spokesperson said that it had met a range of companies, including Shein, \"that are looking to invest or list in Britain\".\n\"We expect the highest regulatory standards and business practices from any company operating in the UK. We believe the best way to ensure this is to have more companies operating from and regulated by UK law,\" the spokesperson added.\nHM Treasury declined to comment.",
    "Scampi is sourced in a way that causes \"extensive environmental damage\", a charity complaining to the UK competition authority has claimed.\nOpen Seas is disputing the sustainability of the popular seafood snack and has asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate supermarkets who claim it is \"responsibly sourced\".\nThe charity alleged \"extensive damage\" is caused from trawling the seabed with heavy nets when catching langoustines for scampi, and other marine life caught in the process is often wastefully discarded.\nThe British Retail Consortium said retailers were working closely with suppliers to \"ensure products meet customer expectations on sustainability\".\nIt added: \"Retailers are committed to sourcing scampi responsibly.\"\nHowever, Open Seas claimed describing the product as \"responsibly sourced\" breaches CMA guidance.\n\"We've raised these concerns with supermarkets, but they continue to sell scampi as 'responsibly sourced',\" said Nick Underdown, head of campaigns at Open Seas.\nA spokeswoman for Whitby Seafoods, which describes itself as the \"home of scampi\", said: \"We strongly dispute the claims made by Open Seas.\"\nCMA guidelines require marketing claims to be both truthful and accurate, and \"clear and unambiguous\".\n\"Consumers should not be misled by products being marketed in this way,\" Mr Underdown added.\nScampi is sold in the frozen aisles of supermarkets and, in the UK, is supposed to be made from langoustines. Although shrimp scampi, scallop scampi and other variations are also served in restaurants across Europe.\nMr Underdown told the BBC that there was \"no effective vessel tracking\" to reduce the harmful effects of catching nephrops, the group of marine life that predominantly makes up scampi ingredients.\n\"There is a vessel monitoring system but no means to monitor the composition of those catches,\" he said, adding the level of \"bycatch\" - marine life caught unwittingly in the nets -  can often include small animals and fish, which impacts the populations of that species in the future.\n\"Catching large volumes of young fish against scientific advice is not responsible. Trawling over fragile marine habitats is not responsible,\" Mr Underdown said.  \n\"Businesses failing to address these problems is not responsible. The way scampi is produced has all the hallmarks of an irresponsible fishery.\"\nWhitby Seafoods said that it has \"a strong track record in building on the work of the scampi fishing industry in driving improvements to sustainability\".\nIn its complaint to the CMA, Open Seas said supermarkets' claims that their fisheries were \"responsible\" was ambiguous, due to the term being \u201cdefined by a self-interested industry group without reference to international norms for defining responsible seafood\u201d.\nA spokeswoman for Whitby Seafoods, said: \"The claim that scampi is \u2018responsibly sourced\u2019 is used in line with strict third-party guidance from the Sustainable Seafood Coalition.\"\nThe Sustainable Seafood Coalition was founded by companies including M&S, Waitrose and Young's.\nEdward Whittle, Whitby Seafoods' sustainability director sits on its steering committee alongside other seafood producers including Young's and supermarket Sainsbury's.\nWhitby Seafoods states on its website that it is part of an industry-led Fisheries Improvement Project (FIP). \nProject UK, which oversees the implementation of the FIPs for the industry, is funded by industry players including Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Young's, Lidl, Co-op, Tesco and Whitby Seafoods itself.\nBut Mr Underdown told the BBC he was \"extremely concerned about inaccurate self-reporting and the lack of progress being made by\" the FIP for the scampi industry.\nA spokeswoman for Whitby Seafoods, said: \"We welcome the opportunity to explain to the CMA, or any other relevant party that asks us for clarification, about this important subject.\"\nThe BBC has contacted major supermarkets and suppliers of UK scampi for comment.\nMorrisons said on its website that it uses third-party certification to ensure its fisheries are \"credible and sustainable\", with 99% of its farmed seafood \"certified to global sustainable seafood initiative standards\".\nSainsbury's meanwhile said it was the first-ever retailer to be awarded various accolades including one from the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). M&S said on its site that it sits on the Board of Trustees for\u202fFisheries Innovation Scotland\u202fand\u202fthat it is an active participant in a number of Fisheries Improvement Projects.\nYoung\u2019s said it is part of several sustainability organisations.\nA spokesperson for Tesco said the UK's largest supermarket was committed to sourcing seafood products responsibly and that it was making steps towards MSC accreditation for its seafood. \nThe MSC is a non-profit that certifies fisheries for their sustainability and receives license fees for use of its blue certification logo on products.\nSome firms which use the MSC certification on their seafood include McDonald\u2019s ",
    "A trial over one of America's largest pandemic-fraud schemes has taken a mysterious turn following an alleged attempt to bribe one of the jurors.\nThe juror was dismissed after she claimed that a woman dressed in black visited her home and offered her a bag filled with $120,000 (\u00a393,770) in cash. In return, she was to vote to acquit the seven defendants.\nThe juror was part of a trial that centres on the alleged theft of more than $40m from a taxpayer-supported food aid program for children.\nAll of the defendants were arrested after the juror revealed the alleged bribery scheme to the court.\n\"This is stuff that happens in mob movies,\" Assistant US Attorney Joseph Thompson, a government prosecutor, told the court as he requested the arrests.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, it wasn\u2019t someone outside of this room.\"\nThe bribe occurred as the jurors were set to begin deliberating after one week of jury selection and five weeks of witness testimony.\nBribing a juror is a felony that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. The seven people currently on trial - six men and one woman - already face a total of 41 charges including wire fraud and money laundering.\nProsecutors have argued the defendants - all of whom are Somali immigrants to Minnesota - operated their charity as a front to receive funds from the federal Child Nutrition Program.\nProviding fake names of non-existent children they were claiming to feed and creating a fraudulent paper trail of how those numbers skyrocketed during the Covid-19 pandemic, the men allegedly pocketed millions of dollars.\nJurors were shown evidence of how this money was allegedly spent: on Porsche and Tesla convertibles, a luxury vacation in Dubai, real estate purchases in Kenya, among other things.\nThe joint defence has cast doubt on the FBI's sprawling investigation as well as on the credibility of the prosecution's star witness.\nBut six of the seven defence attorneys rested their case without calling any witnesses, while the seventh defendant took the stand himself.\nWith closing arguments due to wrap, Mr Thompson disclosed the episode of attempted jury tampering that had taken place on Sunday night.\nHe said a woman had dropped off a gift bag filled with wads of cash at the juror's home.\n\u201cThis is for Juror 52,\" the woman allegedly said. \"Tell her there will be another bag for her if she votes to acquit.\"\nJurors in the case have not been publicly identified, as is common practice, but attorneys and defendants briefly viewed their names and addresses at the start of the trial.\nJuror 52 is a 23-year-old woman who, according to the Sahan Journal, was the only person of colour on the panel.\n\"This can't be allowed,\" Mr Thompson said. \"This strikes at the integrity of our system.\"\nAn FBI affidavit describes a black woman, \u201cpossibly Somali, with an accent, wearing a long black dress\u201d, approaching Juror 52's home in a Mazda.\nThe juror was not at home but her father-in-law reportedly answered the door, collecting the white bag packed with $20, $50 and $100 bills.\nJuror 52 immediately reported the incident to local police and turned over the money to the FBI. She was excused from the jury on Monday.\nUS District Judge Nancy Brasel agreed with prosecutors that \u201csomeone obviously has the addresses of the families of these jurors\u201d, ordering the detention of all seven defendants.\nThe court later granted a search warrant that led to the confiscation of cell phones belonging to the defendants.\nThe men were escorted from the court in handcuffs, some openly weeping and embracing their family members before they were led out.\nJudge Brasel questioned all the remaining jurors to determine whether they had experienced something similar.\nIn a rare move, she also \"reluctantly\" sequestered the jury for the remainder of the trial, removing them from all outside contact and barring their use of electronic devices until the trial has finished. \nMonday's twist was the latest in an investigation that has seen prosecutors indict 70 people. Eighteen defendants have so far pleaded guilty and the government has recovered about $60m of the stolen funds.",
    "US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci faced intense questioning from Republican lawmakers in his first public appearance before Congress since leaving his White House advisory role in 2022.\nFor more than a year, he has faced scrutiny from Republicans in the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic for his role in the pandemic response.\nIn his Monday testimony, Dr Fauci forcefully rejected allegations that he tried to hide information about the virus's origins, calling them \"simply preposterous\".\nThe origins of the pandemic have been a matter of strong debate in the US.\nDuring the pandemic, Dr Fauci, who is now retired,  became the face of the US Covid-19 response and has been the subject of both praise and fierce criticism.\nBefore lawmakers on Monday, he disputed claims there was any attempt to cover up evidence suggesting the virus may have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, China.\nHe read from an email he sent in February 2020 where he spoke about encouraging a colleague worried about a lab leak to examine the evidence \"as soon as possible\" and, if the concerns were valid, report the findings to the \"appropriate authorities\". \nHe told the subcommittee: \"It is inconceivable that anyone who reads this email could conclude that I was trying to cover up the possibility of a laboratory leak.\"\nDuring the sometimes heated hearing, Republicans also pressed Dr Fauci on allegations that he used his personal email to conduct official business, which he denied. \nQuestions about his emails come after messages from a former adviser, in which the adviser discussed with colleagues using personal email to avoid disclosure under public records laws, came to light.\nDr Fauci said he had not been aware that the adviser used an unofficial email. \nThe adviser, Dr David Morens, faced criticism from lawmakers from both parties in testimony last month before the panel. \nDr Fauci also faced questions about National Institute of Health (NIH) funding for virology research at the Wuhan lab. \nAn US-based organisation - EcoHealth Alliance - was awarded a grant in 2014 from the NIH to look into possible coronaviruses from bats. Some funds were given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in an agreement that was terminated in April 2020.\n\"I have always said, and will say now, I keep an open mind as to what the origin [of Covid-19] is,\" Dr Fauci said on Monday. \n\"But the one thing I know for sure is that the viruses that were funded by the NIH, phylogenetically, could not be the precursor of SARS-CoV-2.\"\nDr Fauci received support from Democratic lawmakers on the subcommittee, who accused some Republicans of making irresponsible claims. \n\"Over the past four years you have been personally targeted by extreme narratives of the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and the US governments response to it,\" Democrat Representative Raul Ruiz said.\nThe infectious disease expert also spoke about threats he and his family have faced since the pandemic. \n\"There have been credible death threats, leading to the arrests of two individuals. And credible death threats means someone who was clearly on their way to kill me,\" Dr Fauci said.\n\"Every time someone gets up and says I am responsible for the death of people throughout the world, the death threats go up.\"\nIn a declassified report released last year, US intelligence agencies found no direct evidence that Covid-19 broke out from a Chinese laboratory.\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence said both a natural and laboratory origin remain plausible scenarios.\nMore than 1.2 million American deaths have been linked to Covid.

    "The Australian Defence Force (ADF) will allow recruits from foreign countries, including the UK, to help grow its ranks.\nAustralia has been struggling with enlistment shortfalls, as it seeks to beef up its armed forces in the face of what it says are growing regional threats.\nFrom July, New Zealand nationals who are permanent residents of Australia can apply to join, and from next year that will expand to recruits from the UK and other countries including the US and Canada. \nMinister for Defence Richard Marles said the changes to eligibility requirements were \"essential to meet the nation\u2019s security challenges through the next decade and beyond\".\nAustralia and New Zealand already have a longstanding \"Anzac bond\", he said, pointing to their history fighting side-by-side at Gallipoli in World War One.\nAnd Australia has in recent years sought to boost ties with the UK and the US, in 2021 signing the Aukus pact - a far-reaching defence and security alliance aimed at confronting Chinese military expansion in the Indo-Pacific region. \nAustralia, the UK, US, Canada and New Zealand also work closely together in intelligence sharing under an alliance called the Five Eyes.\nThere is a focus on recruiting people from these nations, but Defence Personnel Minister Matt Keogh has said from January 1 \"any\" eligible permanent resident can apply.\nCanberra has repeatedly expressed growing concerns about Beijing's assertiveness, and a strategic review of the ADF released last year pointed to the \"growth and retention of a highly skilled defence workforce\" as a key measure to counter it.\nThe previous government in 2020 announced A$38bn (\u00a319.8bn; $25.4) of funding to increase the number of uniformed personnel by 30% within two decades.\nBut Mr Keogh says low levels of unemployment in Australia has made it \"very difficult\" to recruit - with recent government figures estimating the ADF is already short about 4,400 people.\nWhile Australia has a history of accepting small numbers of military transfers from a few allied nations, the new eligibility rules are aimed at significantly widening the pool of potential recruits.\nAs well as meeting ADF entry standards and security requirements, those wishing to join must have been permanent residents of Australia for over a year and must not have served in a foreign military in the previous two years.\nThey must also be eligible for Australian citizenship - something they will be offered  and \"expected\" to take up after 90 days of service, says Mr Keogh.\nThe opposition spokesman for foreign affairs said they were not against the plan, but that the government's defence strategy was undermining confidence and morale in the defence force. \n\"We want to see, ideally, Australians wearing the Australian uniform,\" Simon Birmingham told Sky News Australia.",
    "A US Army veteran turned foreign volunteer fighter has lost his bid to avoid extradition from Ukraine on murder and robbery charges.\nCraig Austin Lang, 34, will appear in a Florida court on Monday in connection with a 2018 double homicide and armed robbery.\nMr Lang is said to have killed Serafin and Deana Lorenzo, and stolen from them to fund a new escapade in Venezuela.\nEarlier this year, a federal jury found his alleged accomplice guilty on all of the charges Mr Lang now faces.\nMr Lang's extradition is the culmination of a decade-long globe-trot that saw him desert the army and join volunteer paramilitary forces against Russian separatists in Ukraine and al-Shabab terrorists in East Africa.\nHe has lived and fought in Ukraine on and off since 2015, and has been under the threat of extradition for at least the past five years.\nAccording to a US justice department statement, he \"went on an international crime spree\" and evaded the government \"by trading guns, a grenade, and cash... to apply for a US passport under an assumed name\".\n\u201cLang\u2019s alleged conduct is shocking in its scope and its callous disregard for human life,\" Nicole Argentieri, head of the criminal division, said.\nThe Arizona native served as an infantryman for the US Army from 2008 to 2014 before - according to his father - developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from overseas tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nIn 2013, he deserted his posting at Fort Bliss, Texas and drove non-stop for nearly 2,000 miles (3,218km) with all his military equipment in an alleged attempt to kill his wife amid the couple's divorce proceedings. \nHe was jailed for several weeks and later dishonourably discharged. His ex-wife subsequently won a restraining order and sole custody of their child.\nAfter struggling to find work and taking on debt, Mr Lang fled to eastern Ukraine, where he joined the Right Sector volunteer militia in their fight to wrest control of the Russian-controlled Donetsk region.\nSoldiers of the Right Sector are believed to hold overtly far-right nationalist ideologies but have fought alongside Ukraine's armed forces in the ongoing war against Russia. \nIn a 2021 interview with Buzzfeed News, Mr Lang said he joined the group \"because I thought they were the most active on the front line\". Fighters who knew him, however, told the outlet he held extremist political views and routinely displayed troubling conduct.\nThe US government alleges that Mr Lang met Alex Jared Zwiefelhofer, a fellow army deserter who had joined the Right Sector, and that they together concocted a plan to fight the jihadists of al-Shabab, the al-Qaeda affiliate in Africa.\nBut they were arrested at the border between Kenya and South Sudan for trying to cross without proper documents. Both were deported back to the US after spending two months in a Nairobi jail.\nBy 2018, authorities say they had hatched a new plan - to fight alongside the rebels seeking the overthrow of Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro.\nThey met that April in Florida, where they allegedly developed a scheme to steal money for their journey.\nA fake classified advertisement offering a trove of firearms for $3,000 (\u00a32,343) attracted the attention of Serafin and Deana Lorenzo, from Brooksville, authorities say.\nThe couple, both military veterans themselves, had previously exchanged guns for profit and promised cash on hand when the deal was made.\nAuthorities said Mr Lang and Zwiefelhofer allegedly ambushed the Lorenzos and stole their money at a meeting point in a car park in the village of Estero on 10 April 2018.\nNeither man travelled to Venezuela. Federal authorities arrested Zwiefelhofer a month later.\nIn March this year, a federal jury convicted 27-year-old Zwiefelhofer, a Wisconsin native, on robbery, conspiracy and weapons charges. He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison, while also facing separate charges for possession of child sexual abuse material.\nMr Lang fled to Kyiv, where he married a local woman and had two children.\nSince 2019, he has staved off efforts to extradite him back to the US in relation to the murder.\nIn past interviews with ABC News and Buzzfeed News, he has claimed the US is persecuting him over alleged human rights abuse and war crimes from his volunteer service in Ukraine.\nLast November, the European Court of Human Rights cleared the way for Mr Lang's deportation after American officials agreed not to seek the death penalty or a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\nBut he may still face life in prison over the charges in the Middle District of Florida.\nMonday's court appearance could be one of many for Mr Lang. He also faces charges in North Carolina for passport fraud and identity theft, and in Arizona for passport misuse.",
    "Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been acquitted of leaking state secrets but will remain in jail because of a conviction in another case. \nIn the run-up to elections in February, the 71-year-old - who was ousted as prime minister in 2022 - was hit with three prison sentences for cases he insists were politically motivated.\nKhan was sentenced to 10 years in prison in January on charges of making public a diplomatic cable in 2022.\nThe Islamabad High Court upheld his appeal and cleared him in that case on Monday, but he is not expected to leave prison for now. \nThe former cricket star and his third wife Bushra are both serving prison sentences after a court ruled that their 2018 marriage had been un-Islamic and illegal as it came too soon after her divorce. \nThe couple were also found guilty of corruption over gifts received during his term as prime minister.\nEven behind bars, the former cricket star remains a powerful force in Pakistani politics.\nDuring the February elections, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which had been forced to run candidates as independents, emerged as the single largest bloc. \nHowever, they fell short of the majority and their rivals united to form a new government.\nIn the so-called \"cipher case\", the prosecution argued that Khan had leaked a classified cable sent to Pakistan\u2019s ambassador in Washington.\nAt a rally in March 2022, the then prime minister appeared on stage waving a piece of paper that he said showed a foreign conspiracy against him. \nHe didn't name the country - but was subsequently highly critical of the US. Washington and Pakistani officials denied the claim. \nProsecutors said Khan's actions amounted to leaking a classified document and damaging diplomatic relations. \nKhan's foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, was also sentenced to 10 years in prison. \nBoth men were acquitted of the charges on Monday. \n\"Thank God, the sentence is overturned,\" PTI spokesman Naeem Panjutha, said in a post on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

    "YouTube superstars the Sidemen have launched their own reality show, locking 10 influencers in a house for a week to battle for a prize worth up to \u00a31m.\nThe first episode of Inside racked up more than four million views on YouTube within 24 hours, after being released on Sunday.\nThe contestants include Love Island's Chloe Burrows, Made In Chelsea star Liv Bentley and YouTuber Joe Weller.\nInside is the Sidemen's own spin on successful reality TV formats like Big Brother, and will provide competition for Love Island, which was back on TV screens on Monday.\nThe Sidemen - the seven-strong group of British internet stars, which includes content creator, rapper and boxer KSI - have more than 130 million YouTube subscribers between them.\nAnother member, Vik Barn - aka Vikkstar123 - told the BBC last week: \"We've always grown up in the UK and watched reality TV throughout our whole childhoods, from Big Brother to Love Island to I'm a Celebrity.\n\"We were thinking, 'OK, this year, what is our new project?'. Why not have a stab at our own spin on a reality TV show?\"\nBarn, who grew up in Sheffield, told BBC Radio Sheffield's Toby Foster that Inside was \"a bit more raw\" than a regular reality TV show, and \"a bit like our videos where you kind of hit record and see what happens\".\n\"I think we've found a really nice medium between something that looks really professionally produced, as if you'd see it on a big TV channel, but at the same time it's got us in it and our spin and the kind of chaos that only I think we could curate.\"\nAnd unlike Big Brother, which famously asked inmates, \"please do not swear\", there are no such restrictions on Inside.\nThe Sidemen act as hosts and executive producers, putting their inmates through fiendish challenges that can see the \u00a31m prize pot reduced.\nThe winnings can also be whittled away at the in-house shop, where contestants can buy luxuries - at a high price.

    "When the fighting stopped and World War Two\u2019s end came, towns and cities across the UK moved quickly to honour Britain\u2019s most famous general.\nBernard Law Montgomery commanded the Allied forces on D-Day, a pivotal moment that turned the tide of the war.\n'Monty', as he was known, was made a freeman of countless cities, including London, Edinburgh and Manchester.\nAmong them was a place that Montgomery said felt most like home - Londonderry.\n\u201cIn Tripoli in 1943 he told soldiers of the 9th Londonderry Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, \u2018I am a Derry man myself',\u201d military historian Richard Doherty told BBC News NI.\n\u201cAnd indeed he did see himself as being from the north west (of Ireland),\u201d he added.\nIt was on 15 September 1945 that Montgomery arrived in Derry to receive the honour.\nSuch was the crowd that the ceremony did not take place in the city\u2019s Guildhall.\nInstead it took place, for the first and only time, on Derry\u2019s historic walls.\nA crowd of about 4,000 people had come to see Monty, according to The Derry Journal of 17 September.\n\u201cIt is with very great pleasure that I am here today in your fine city, which I almost feel is my home town,\u201d the newspaper records Montgomery as telling the crowd.\nThe field marshal\u2019s ancestors, Mr Doherty said, were Normans and by the 17th Century had made their way to Ireland.\nSome had settled in County Down, others, the field marshal\u2019s branch of the family, in Killaghtee, County Donegal, near the town of Killybegs.\nBy the late 18th Century, Samuel Law Montgomery, Monty\u2019s great-grandfather, had ventured north and settled in Derry.\nThere, Mr Doherty said, he traded as a wine merchant, making a small fortune, marrying and raising a family.\nHis son Robert, Monty\u2019s grandfather, was born in Derry and schooled at Foyle College. He became a noted colonial administrator in India.\nIn 1774, Samuel bought an estate close to the shores of Lough Foyle, some 19 miles from the city, at Moville in County Donegal.\nThis was long before Ireland\u2019s partition and Donegal\u2019s Inishowen peninsula was a natural hinterland to the city of Derry.\nThe estate would become New Park, the Montgomery family home until the middle of the 20th Century.\nMr Doherty said the young Monty \u201ccertainly regarded New Park as home, he was certainly much happier there than in London\u201d.\nMonty was born in London in 1887.\nHis father Henry was an Anglican clergyman and his mother Maud Farrar was a daughter of the archdeacon at Westminster.\nIn 1889, Henry was appointed Bishop of Tasmania.\nIt's there that Monty would live until the age of 13, when he returned to England.\nBut it was Moville, and New Park, which his father had inherited in 1887, that he thought of as home.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t born in Moville, but he spent all his holidays there,\u201d Sean Beattie from the Donegal Historical Society told BBC News NI.\n\u201cHe sailed Lough Foyle in the summer time, played croquet on the lawn and attended church in Moville,\u201d he said.\nHis parents were quick to become part of the community and would help build the local Church of Ireland.\nA row of terraced houses, Montgomery Terrace, named in the family\u2019s honour, still looks out over the town\u2019s shoreline and to Lough Foyle.\nA plaque close by remembers that the bishop gave back part of the land bought by Samuel to the community.\n\u201cPeople are very much aware of the Montgomery connection in Moville, it\u2019s very much alive,\u201d Mr Beattie said.\n\u201cThe bishop and Lady Montgomery were very active in the community, the family were very much part of Moville.\n\u201cBishop Montgomery would have walked daily through the town, called to certain houses in the square. The path he took became known as The Bishop\u2019s Walk.\"\nLady Montgomery, Monty\u2019s mother, was the last member of the family to live at New Park.\nShe died in 1949, seventeen years after her husband, and the house fell out of the family\u2019s ownership not long after.\nAs Monty flew into Derry to receive the city's freedom, the Derry Journal reported his Dakota plane \u201cflew low over Moville\u201d so he could see his parental home.\nThe paper also noted Monty had not been able to visit New Park for seven years.\nBy this time, the island of Ireland had been partitioned, with Derry in Northern Ireland, Moville in the Irish Free State.\nThe Journal further reported that while eating lunch in Derry, Monty said that as he \u201clooked out the windows and saw the hills of Donegal on which he used to roam as a boy he wondered to himself whether it was quite proper that they should make a Free Stater a freeman of Derry\u201d.\nD-Day, also known as the Normandy landings, was one of the most significant events in World War Two.\nTens of thousands of Allied troops landed in gliders and on the beaches of northern France on 6 June 1944.\nIt was the largest seaborne invasion in history and marked a turning point in the fight against Nazi Germany. \nField Marshal Montgomery\u2019s contribution to the war should not be under estimated, Mr Doherty said.\nWhile best known for victory at El Alamein and for planning and leading the tro",
    "China has accused the UK\u2019s intelligence agency of recruiting a couple as spies - the latest in a string of tit-for-tat allegations between Beijing and the West in recent months.\nAccording to the Ministry of State Security, the two Chinese government employees were successfully recruited after MI6 operatives exploited the man\u2019s \u201cstrong desire for money\u201d.\nThe man, named as Wang, then convinced his partner, named only as Zhou, to join him as a British spy, the ministry said.\nThe accusations come weeks after the UK charged two men with spying for China. \nThe men were accused of giving \"articles, notes, documents or information\" to a foreign state, while China has called the allegations \"malicious slander\".\nEarlier this month, a former Royal Marine charged with assisting the Hong Kong intelligence service was found dead in the UK, police there said.\nChina did not reveal how it uncovered the case involving Mr Wang and Ms Zhou, saying only that it came after a \"thorough investigation\".\nThe case is still under investigation and Chinese officials did not say if the couple would be charged. \nThe BBC sought a response from the UK government, which said it would neither confirm nor deny claims relating to intelligence matters.\nChina\u2019s Ministry of State Security alleged that MI6 started cultivating Mr Wang when he was studying in the UK under a Sino-British exchange programme in 2015.\nThe operatives took \"special care\" of him in the UK, such as inviting him to dinners and tours to better \"understand his interests and weaknesses\", the ministry alleged.\nThey befriended him on campus under the guise that they were alumnus, and got him to provide \"paid consulting services\".\nThrough Mr Wang the MI6 operatives also recruited Ms Zhou to spy on China, the country's Ministry of State Security claimed. They both had \"core confidential roles\" in an unnamed state agency, it added, without elaborating on what they did or where they worked.\n\"Wang was initially hesitant but could not resist [the operatives'] repeated persuasion, enticement and even coercion, and eventually agreed,\" the ministry said in a statement on WeChat. \n\"Under Wang's strong instigation, Zhou agreed to collect intelligence... and he and his wife became British spies.\"\nIt is unclear why Beijing has chosen to publicise this case, says Chong Ja-Ian, a scholar at Carnegie China. It could be making the case public as a form of retaliation, but Beijing has also arrested people for espionage in the past.\nAnd without more information, it is difficult to ascertain the veracity of Beijing's claims, Dr Chong said.\n\"Sometimes these do not appear... The opacity of [the Chinese Communist Party] including its judicial system, especially when it comes to espionage cases, can make understanding the details of the case especially challenging,\" he added.\nChina's Ministry of State Security has been posting frequent updates on its official channel since it was launched in August. \nIn January, it warned its citizens against \"exotic beauties\" seeking to lure them into the hands of foreign spy agencies.\nAmong other things, it has also cautioned citizens against photographing military equipment and warned against organisations \"recruiting aviation enthusiasts as volunteers\" to transmit China's flight data to other countries.",
    "More than one million tonnes of raw sewage is estimated to have been released from a pumping station into the North Sea in 2023. \nNorthumbrian Water produced the estimate of how much sewage was released from its Whitburn site after a Freedom of Information (FoI) request from South Tyneside resident Steve Lavelle. \nA tribunal ruled the company needed to provide Mr Lavelle with the data. \nA spokesperson for the water firm said it has \"some of the lowest amounts and durations of spills in the country\".\nThe estimate was provided following several unsuccessful FoI requests by Mr Lavelle, with a first-tier tribunal ruling in April that the firm had to release figures within 35 days. \nThe water firm's calculations suggest 1.007 million tonnes of sewage was discharged into the North Sea at Whitburn in 2023. \nThe area along the Whitburn coast is part of the Durham special area of conservation. \nProf Charles Tyler, an environmental biologist at the University of Exeter, said if the estimate is accurate it is an \"appalling state of affairs\".\nMeanwhile, Prof Darren Grocke, a biogeochemist at Durham University, said that if the figure is correct, an \"environmental and ecological assessment is urgently needed in the region\".\nMost of the UK has a combined sewerage system, meaning both rainwater and wastewater are carried in the same pipes, and capacity can sometimes be exceeded during periods of heavy rain.\nNorthumbrian Water said: \"2023 was the UK\u2019s eleventh wettest year on record, with rainfall for the North East around 35% higher than 2022.\n\"Storm overflows are designed to spill into watercourses, mostly surface water, when rainfall is heavy to prevent flooding in our customer\u2019s streets, homes and businesses. \n\"Consequently, the data for 2023 shows an increase in the operation of storm overflows.\"\nIn 2012 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that sewage discharge by Northumbrian Water at Whitburn broke EU water treatment laws. \nThis led to a project to upgrade the system which was completed in December 2017.\nIn 2023 the European Commission wrote to Bob Latimer, a retired engineer, who had put forward the case to the ECJ.\nIn the letter the Commission said it was \"not of the opinion\" that \"the situation in Whitburn with regard to ongoing spills at the long sea outfall has been sufficiently improved to bring the UK into full compliance with the judgement of the court\".\nHowever, as the UK had left the EU, it would no longer be following up with its concerns, the letter said. \nIn response to the latest FoI figure, Northumbrian Water said: \"We have the best environmental record of any water company in England, with no serious pollution incidents throughout the whole of 2023, or any since 2021.\nThe company also said Whitburn had achieved \"excellent\" bathing status every year since the guidelines were introduced. \nA spokesperson added that, between 2020 and 2025, the firm invested over \u00a380m on upgrading its wastewater network and it plans to spend a further \u00a31.7bn from 2025 to 2030 to stop storm overflow spills. \nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "In September 2019 a BBC podcast started reporting on the extraordinary tale of Ruja Ignatova, a Bulgarian woman wanted by the FBI after scamming investors out of $4.5bn (\u00a33.54bn) through her fake cryptocurrency, before vanishing into thin air.\nNow we have gone on her trail to try to discover her fate. BBC Eye Investigations and Panorama have looked at her close ties to a suspected Bulgarian organised crime boss and allegations she was brutally murdered. Did Ms Ignatova enjoy the stolen billions or was she killed by the very people paid to protect her?\nOxford University graduate Ruja Ignatova was born in Bulgaria and raised in Germany, pursuing a successful career in finance before launching the cryptocurrency OneCoin in 2014.\nMs Ignatova convinced millions of people around the world to invest in OneCoin, promising to eclipse the kind of huge returns seen by early Bitcoin investors.\nBut in reality, Ms Ignatova - known to many as Dr Ruja - had created a cleverly-disguised investment fraud, without the digital record that underlies legitimate cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nAs investigators from Germany and the US closed in on Ms Ignatova in October 2017, she took an early morning Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens, never to be seen again.\nFor the past year, BBC World Service\u2019s Eye Investigations and Panorama have been trying to find out more about what happened to her, and whether she is even alive.\nKey to this was establishing who her inner circle was.\nRichard Reinhardt, who began the investigation into OneCoin for the US Internal Revenue Service alongside the FBI, told the BBC about a key character investigators have never publicly named before.\nThe Missing Cryptoqueen: Dead or Alive?\nCEO of fake cryptocurrency OneCoin, Ruja Ignatova, is the FBI\u2019s most wanted woman. She stole billions, then vanished. New evidence reveals what may have happened. Is she missing or was she murdered?\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 3 June (22:40 in Wales). Outside of the UK, watch on YouTube\nThe Missing Cryptoqueen\n\nThe search for Dr Ruja Ignatova takes an unexpected turn when a story emerges alleging she's been murdered. But with sightings of Dr Ruja still coming in, can it be true?\nThe BBC understands it is the man who had been given the role of keeping Ms Ignatova safe - Hristoforos Nikos Amanatidis, commonly known as Taki.\n\u201cWe were told, allegedly a big-time drug guy was in charge of her physical security,\u201d Mr Reinhardt told us in his first interview since retiring in late 2023.\n\u201cTaki came up more than once, it wasn\u2019t like it was a one-off. That was a recurring theme.\u201d\nThis chimed with the information we already had - US government lawyers had said in 2019 that Ms Ignatova\u2019s head of security was a major organised crime figure in Bulgaria but hadn\u2019t named him.\n\u201cWe do have evidence that a very significant, if not the most prolific, drug trafficker of all time in Bulgaria, was closely linked to OneCoin - served as [Ruja Ignatova\u2019s] personal security guard,\u201d an assistant attorney said.\nThis was the same \u201chead of security\u201d a different US government lawyer said was \u201cinvolved in the disappearance\u201d of Ms Ignatova in court a day earlier.\nAccording to Mr Reinhardt, Ms Ignatova was a far more sophisticated criminal than most people realise.\n\u201cThis is like a white-collar criminal combined with a drug trafficker or mafia guy on steroids.\u201d\nThis theory appears to be supported by leaked Europol documents, seen by the BBC, which show that - before Ms Ignatova disappeared in 2017 - Bulgarian police had established connections between her and Taki.\nIn the documents, police suspect Taki of using OneCoin\u2019s financial network to launder the proceeds of drug trafficking.\nIn his native Bulgaria, Taki has an almost mythical status - an El Chapo or Pablo Escobar. He is widely suspected of being the head of a Bulgarian organised crime organisation and a prolific drug smuggler. He and his associates have been investigated there for armed robbery, drug smuggling and murder, but he has never been successfully prosecuted for anything.\n\u201cWhen we talk about Taki, he\u2019s the head of the mafia in Bulgaria. He's extremely powerful,\u201d says a former Bulgarian deputy minister, Ivan Hristanov, who in 2022 investigated allegations Taki ran a criminal network with the help of corrupt officials - and believes that was the case.\n\u201cTaki is the ghost. You'll never see him. You only hear about him. He's talking to you through other people. If you don't listen, you just disappear from earth.\u201d\n\u201cThe only person who can protect her [Ignatova] from all those investigations, including from foreign agencies - it was Taki.\u201d\nThe BBC wrote to the Bulgarian government about the allegations regarding corrupt officials. It did not respond. The prosecutor\u2019s office in the capital Sofia says it \u201cdoes not cover up crimes and persons who have possibly committed crimes\u201d.\nTaki is now believed to live in Dubai, where Ms Ignatova bought a luxury penthouse and whe",
    "Lilian Seenoi-Barr has made history after becoming Northern Ireland\u2019s first black mayor, and only the third on the island of Ireland.\nShe was installed as mayor of Derry City and Strabane at a special council meeting on Monday evening.\nMs Seenoi-Barr, who arrived in Londonderry 14 years ago as a refugee from Kenya, said it was an honour to become first citizen.\nA crowd of about 300 people assembled inside the Guildhall to watch Ms Seenoi-Barr receive the mayoral chain of office.\nAmong those in attendance were family and friends of Ms Seenoi-Barr, a delegation of Kenyan political representatives and members from various ethnic minority groups from across the island of Ireland.\nSeparately, the new lord mayor of Belfast is Councillor Micky Murray who describes himself as the first \u201copenly gay\u201d first citizen of the city.\nMr Murray, from the Alliance Party, said it was \"an important milestone for my community\". \nIt has been quite a journey from Ms Seenoi-Barr's native Narok in southern Kenya to Londonderry's Guildhall.\nFollowing her instillation as mayor, she said she came to the city in search of a better life.\n\u201cIf you told me that I would become the first citizen of the second city, I would not have believed you,\" she told the chamber. \nMs Seenoi-Barr has been a councillor for the Foyleside ward since 2021 when she was co-opted by the Social Democratic and Labour Party.\nA fall-out over the mayoral selection process, which led to two party colleagues resigning, and racist abuse including death threats followed the announcement of Ms Seenoi-Barr being chosen for the role.\nShe said the \u201canti-immigrant sentiment\u201d that spread on social media was a \u201creminder of the issues we face as a community\u201d but it was \u201cnot reflective of people in this district\u201d.\n\u201cI have witnessed the warmth and kindness of the Derry that I know and have loved with all my heart, through the kindness of strangers and the outpouring of solidarity and support,\" she said.\nMs Seenoi-Barr said she was committed to working hard for the entire community.\nShe said she would be \u201cone who is accessible and one who will lead with hope\u201d.\n\"It is our time to build a more inclusive, prosperous and vibrant Derry City and Strabane District Council, under the banner of unity and progressive change,\" she said.\n\"Thank you for your trust, your time and your support. Together let\u2019s embrace our differences and build a new future together.\u201d\nMs Seenoi-Barr had already made history last year when she became the first black politician to be elected to any public office in Northern Ireland. \nShe retained her seat in the Foyleside ward with a victory in the 2023 election.\nShe came to Derry in 2010 with her son Brian and was granted refugee status.\nPrior to that, her work in her native Kenya involved helping women and girls from the Massai tribe challenge the traditional tribal practices of early marriage and female genital mutilation.\nIt was work, she said, that came with \"a lot of risk\".\nMs Seenoi-Barr's son, Brian, has autism. She said, as his mother, she was concerned by the \"many misconceptions and negative beliefs\" around the condition in Africa.\nThat, coupled with the threats she had received, prompted Ms Seenoi Barr to leave Kenya.\nHer experience as a refugee led her to set up her own charity, the North West Migrants Forum, in 2012 which supports migrants and asylum seekers.\nShe was involved in organising the June 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in Guildhall Square.\nFor those from a minority ethnic background in Northern Ireland, Monday's mayoral appointment is seen as a landmark moment in terms of representation and visibility in public office.\nAndy George joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 1999 and is in his second term as president of the National Black Police Association.\nHe is the first Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officer to hold the role.\nThere are just over 40 PSNI officers from ethnic minority backgrounds in a police service of just under 7,000 people.\n\"Lilian becoming mayor is a beacon of hope for the future and long overdue\" he said.\n\"We have one of the most under-represented police services anywhere in the UK.\n\"The visibility of a mayoral role allows others from ethnic backgrounds to see how they can thrive.\n\"If you see it, you can be it. This is a moment in history\".\nDerry nurse Beverly Simpson said seeing Northern Ireland's first black mayor was highly emotional.\n\"It means everything. It means difference, change, inclusion, diversity and acceptance,\" she said.\n\"I came to NI in 2005 and there weren\u2019t many other black people.\n\"To see the growth from then until now with political inclusion is very significant.\n\"It\u2019s a big journey for Northern Ireland.\"\nBeverly's 15-year-old daughter Jada agreed.\n\"I feel so happy about it,\" she said.\n\"When I was younger and even now, you rarely see black people represented at all so for a black woman to be become mayor is a really big step.\n\"I feel it will inspire others to get into politics and positions o",
    "A man has been jailed for 15 years for raping a homeless woman while he was on a night out and filming the attack.\nLiam Stimpson, 24, from Llanrumney, Cardiff, was convicted of two counts of rape and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent on Thursday.\nThe attack on the 40-year-old, which Stimpson filmed on his phone, happened on 27 December last year in Cardiff city centre.\nDuring sentencing at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday, Judge Jeremy Jenkins said the attack was \u201cgratuitous, repeated and sustained violence against a woman in no position to defend\u201d.\n\u201cYou completely humiliated her \u2013 you took the last ounce of dignity from her,\u201d Judge Jenkins told Stimpson, describing the attack as \u201cbordering on sadistic\u201d.\nIn a statement read out on her behalf, the victim said it had \u201cchanged my whole opinion of men\u201d.\n\u201cI want this male to end up in prison for what he has done. I worry about him doing this to another female,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m unable to socialise with others at the moment. I just want to be alone, to block out what has happened to me.\u201d\nRhianydd Jones from the Crown Prosecution Service said the case \"highlights the extreme violence and disregard for human dignity exhibited by the defendant\", thanking the jury for their \u201ccareful consideration\u201d, as well as the victim for coming forward.\nA jury had already found Stimpson guilty of a separate charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\nDet Insp Katherine Barry, from South Wales Police, said the footage of the rape was the \"most shocking, heinous\" she had seen in her 21-year career.\n\"The fact that the jury was exposed to it concerns me, because I have never seen anything like it,\" she said. \n\"It was sadistic, it was prolonged, this lady was humiliated, and it will stay with me for a very long time.\"\nDet Insp Barry said Stimpson\u2019s defence, that the victim had suggested filming as part of role play, was \u201cludicrous\u201d.\n\"Any person with a shred of humanity watching it would see if for exactly what it was, which was a depraved, brutal attack, on a lone vulnerable female,\" she said. \nShe added that incidents like this in the city centre were \"exceptionally rare\" and she hoped the sentence would encourage victims of sexual offences to speak to the police.\nWarning: Contains distressing content\nStimpson denied the charges, claiming the woman suggested the filming as part of role play after he paid her for oral sex.\nStimpson\u2019s victim was punched and kicked during the attack under a bridge near Cardiff Central railway station in the early hours of the morning. \nShe begged her attacker to stop as she was stripped naked, beaten and raped twice.\nVideos taken from Stimpson's mobile phone showed the woman with a severely swollen and bleeding face, her right eye completely closed.\nShe lifted her hands to her attacker and said: \"Don't beat me up baby, don't beat me please. I've got kids.\"\nStimpson could be heard replying: \"I'll tell you what to do. I'm the boss.\"\nHe then demanded she remove her coat, despite the cold and wet conditions.\nShe eventually escaped and ran naked into a nearby pub, telling early morning cleaning staff \u201cI\u2019ve been raped\u201d.\nThe videos were discovered by police on the defendant's  mobile phone. \nHe refused to provide the PIN, but officers guessed it was his date of birth.\nStimpson also admitted possession of cannabis.\nMany of the jurors were in tears as they watched the footage.\nRuth Smith defending, said her client had been diagnosed with disabilities of a neurodiverse nature.\nA psychiatric report had confirmed a longstanding diagnosis of ADHD, and he was more recently diagnosed with autism.\nMs Smith said her client found custody very difficult, adding he had been picked on and bullied in Parc Prison, Bridgend.\nThe court was also told his girlfriend is pregnant with his child.\nAs he was sentenced, Stimpson cried and rocked in the dock. \nHe refused to leave and had to be carried out by staff.",
    "The number of Blue Badge thefts in London has more than quadrupled in the last decade, new figures from a London Assembly member have revealed.\nWhile 1,230 of the badges were stolen in the capital in 2014, the number has risen almost every year since then to hit 6,415 in 2023.\nBlue Badges are intended to help people with disabilities or health conditions park closer to their destination, but fraud is widespread in London and other big cities across the country, Blue Badge Fraud Investigations (BBFI) said.\nMik Scarlet, who has had his badge stolen four times since 2010, said when he does not have the badge it \"shrinks my world\" as it is difficult to get around.\nThe data was released in response to a written question from Unmesh Desai, a Labour member of the London Assembly.\nMr Scarlet, a wheelchair user who lives in Camden, north London, told BBC News: \"Mine has been stolen four times now and it happened so often I thought 'oh, not again'\".\nThe method used to steal the badge has involved smashing windows on the car, he said. \nSo often has this happened, Mr Scarlet said, he now keeps his badge in a \"blue metal cage with a padlock\". \nMiranda Mellor, who lives in Ealing, west London, said her Blue Badge was stolen about six weeks ago in a \"smash and grab\"  when her car was parked in a disabled parking bay outside her home. \n\"I'm a wheelchair user so public transport is not that accessible,\" she said \"I had to use taxis which costs and meant lots of the admin too.\"\n\"Not only did I have to sort myself out, getting to and from work in a taxi, but also getting the kids to and from school became difficult,\" she added.\nMs Mellor described her car as her \"lifeline\" and not having it has \"massively impactful on all aspects of life\".\nMr Scarlet said he thinks there has been a shift in public attitudes on Blue Badges from something disabled people need to more of a \"freebie\". \n\"I'd love to be able to just wheel down the road to my local Tube station, jump on the Tube and go anywhere I want, but I can't - it's not accessible,\" he said.\nPaul Slowey, founder of BBFI \u2013 a community interest company working to tackle the problem \u2013 said the new figures were \u201ca sad reflection on London in 2024\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cThe true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members, but on average 18 Londoners a day find themselves a victim of crime purely because they are disabled. This is clearly unacceptable.\"\nMr Slowey said the figures show a \"neglect of disabled Londoners\" and put it down to \"overstretched police budgets\". \nMr Scarlet said a possible deterrent could be to redesign the badges to better identify them with their owner, including having an ID-type photo on it.\nHe added: \"Your life becomes shrunk down, staying within your local area.

This is the guy who has taught me the game of golf and I just can't believe I have done this with him on the bag.\"\nMacIntyre senior was also in tears when he described his son's win as \"unbelievable\". \n\"I'm a grasscutter not a caddie,\" he said. \n\"Last Saturday night, I'm sitting on the couch at home and I'm [thinking], can I leave my job here, I'm busy at work.\n\"Eight o'clock the next morning, I'm on a flight out here, and wow.\"\nAfter his arrival, There was a rush across Canada to sort visas and a struggle to get Dougie credentials for the event.  \nSpeaking after the win, Robert admitted: \"Everything was just carnage until we actually stepped on the golf course on Thursday.\"\n\"[Dad] thought that being here was a bit easier on his own mental health with watching the scores but I don't think this week's done him great with the head because of the stress.\"\nHe added that he could not thank his dad enough for his help, adding: \"He's the guy that's taught me the game of golf and he knows my game inside out.\"\nRobert grew up playing at Glencruitten Golf Club, which now proudly states their \"local hero\" honed his skills on its hilly course, complete with \"tricky blind shots\". \nHis dad Dougie tends the greens and fairways as head greenkeeper, and spent his evenings coaching a young Robert, who had his first hole-in-one on the course at the age of 12. \n\"We used to go out every night in the summer, no matter the weather, we would play four holes every night,\" Robert recalled. \nWhile he was growing up, Robert's parents also fostered children who had \"been in a tough spot\".\n\"I think it makes you realize that hitting a white ball around a golf course isn't the most important thing,\" Robert said.\n\"I wasn't given everything as a kid. I was given a great opportunity. \n\"My dad was obviously a really good sportsman - football, golf, shinty - but didn't have the finances to really chase it, and I think it was something that my mum and dad always wanted to do. \n\"I've got two older sisters who are right into their horses, horse riding and stuff, but they even sacrificed quite a lot of that just to give me a chance.\n\"I couldn't play in golf tournaments as a junior because we couldn't afford it. I think that made me; that makes me fight and never give up.\"\nBack at home, Robert's mum Carol was on a video call in the early hours of Monday morning, greeting her son with a thumbs up and blowing kisses before telling him the win was \"incredible\".\n\"Guess what Mum, that might be the mortgage paid off\" Robert told her.\nThe support from his hometown has also spurred him on, with his early successes and his win as part of last year's Ryder Cup team being celebrated in Oban. \nRobert joined the US-based PGA Tour earlier this year but has spoken of his difficulties with home-sickness. \nHe said there was \"no chance\" he could have won the Canadian Open if he had not addressed this with a three-week trip home to Oban.\nBoth generations of MacIntyre men have played shinty with the local club, Oban Celtic, and their friends there were among the first to congratulate them on social media.\nAt a press conference after his win, Robert was asked by the Canadian press how it compared to their national sport, ice hockey.\nHe described it as \"rough and tough\".\n\"It's a lot of body contact,\" he said. \n\"I would say it's more like field hockey with no rules.\n\"It's what I've been brought up doing. My dad was a really good player and I stupidly still play, but it's part of me.\"\nDougie was heading back to Scotland on Monday, leaving Robert without a caddie once more. \n\"To be honest, I tried to get other people, but they didn't want to do a one-weeker,\" Robert admitted, and said he had no caddie lined up for the next tournament. \n\"My dad's not going to do that full-time. He's going to go home and get back on the mowers and work at Glencruitten. \n\"But, yeah, if in doubt, phone dad,\" he said.",
    "A major research project will take place to \"reach the undisturbed archaeology\" at a site famous for unearthing an Anglo Saxon burial ship. \nThe National Trust, which owns the site, said the two-year research project at Sutton Hoo near Woodbridge, Suffolk, will aim to grow its understanding of the land.\nThe area is famous for the discovery of an Anglo Saxon burial ship in 1939, which has been described as one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of all time.\nAngus Wainwright, a national trust archaeologist, said: \"We can\u2019t wait to see what this next chapter will bring.\"\nThe excavation will be filmed by Time Team as a series exclusive for a documentary special, hosted by Sir Tony Robinson.\nThe project, which starts in June, will build on work carried out by Time Team in 2021 and 2023. \nMr Wainwright said previous work by Time Team identified mysterious features in Garden Field, Sutton Hoo. \n\"We know from previous work in this field, it\u2019s likely we will find prehistoric flint tools and fragments of Anglo Saxon objects from burials scattered through the plough soil, but working out what the mysterious geophysical anomalies are will be our focus.\"\nThe team said it hoped to discover evidence of the prehistory of the site and more information about an Anglo Saxon cemetery that was discovered in 2000, when the National Trust was building a visitor centre. \n\"The discovery of the Great Ship Burial in 1939 not only stunned the archaeological world but set the scene for further exploration. \n\"Later archaeological campaigns at Sutton Hoo helped solve mysteries left by the original dig and revealed more about life in the Anglo Saxon kingdom of East Anglia. We can\u2019t wait to see what this next chapter will bring,\" added Mr Wainwright.  \nThe discovery in 1939, was fictionalised in the film The Dig, with Carey Mulligan starring as landowner Edith Pretty and Ralph Fiennes as archaeologist Basil Brown.\nTim Taylor, the creator and series producer of Time Team, said: \"We are incredibly thrilled to expand our relationship with Sutton Hoo, delving deeper into the history of one of Britain\u2019s most iconic sites. \n\"The story of Sutton Hoo has captured the world\u2019s imagination, as we can see by the success of the award-winning film The Dig, and we hope to reveal yet another exciting chapter.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Justice Minister Naomi Long has rejected claims she misled the Northern Ireland Assembly over a law that granted anonymity to sex offence suspects.\nShe was speaking after a High Court judge ruled the Stormont legislation was not compatible with human rights or press freedom.\nThe law granted anonymity for life - and for 25 years after death - to people suspected of sexual offences who were not charged.\nMrs Long denied the act was \"rushed through\" the assembly and said she would \"carefully consider\" whether to appeal the judgment.\nMedia organisations jointly sought to have sections of the Justice (Sexual Offences and Trafficking Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 declared legally invalid.\nIt was argued during a judicial review that victims of sexual assault could be jailed if they publicly named their suspected abusers.\nThe court also heard the law, which came into effect in 2023, meant that suspects could not publicly deny allegations.\nAt Belfast's High Court on Friday, Mr Justice Humphreys said the relevant sections were \"not law\" and failed to strike a fair balance between suspects' rights to privacy and press freedom.\nSpeaking in the assembly on Monday, Mrs Long said she would take time to consider the \"complex and detailed\" judgment.\n\"Appeal is therefore always an option. However I will want to carefully consider all my available options, and in conjunction with the department's legal team, before arriving at a decision to the best way forward,\" she said.\nMatthew O'Toole, leader of the opposition in the assembly, said an appeal would \"just double down on bad law and be a waste of public money\".\nThe Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) assembly member said \"while the intentions may have been good, it is important to recognise that this has been terrible law\".\nJoanne Bunting, chair of the assembly's justice scrutiny committee, said there had been \"reputational damage for the minister, her department and indeed this house\".\nThe Democratic Unionist Party assembly member said \"significant unintended consequences\" were missed because Stormont \"rushed and sacrificed quality for quantity\".\nShe asked if officials \"did not know the potential ramifications, did they not understand, or did they mislead?\".\nMrs Long said \"neither I nor my officials misled this assembly in any way - not in any way\". \nThe Alliance Party leader said the relevant provisions of the bill were included at its introduction.\n\"They were neither hidden, nor was there any failing on my part or that of the department,\" she added.\nThe minister also said she did not accept claims that \"legislation was rushed through in the last political mandate\".\nShe said \"while it was a challenging period for all, no processes were condensed\".\nThe legislation had been passed by assembly members following a review carried out by retired judge Sir John Gillen.\nAlthough Sir John recommended a prohibition on identifying those under investigation for sexual crimes prior to being charged, his report did not suggest extending anonymity beyond their deaths.\nTraditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister claimed the minister had \"walked the assembly into this folly, not least by exaggerating\" Sir John's proposals.\nMrs Long said she \"did not walk the assembly into anything\".\nShe denied Sir John's position had been \"exaggerated\", saying he considered the legislation \"entirely consistent with his report\".\nMedia organisations involved in the legal challenge included the BBC, The Irish News, Mediahuis - which publishes the Belfast Telegraph - and The Times' publisher News Group Newspapers.\nRuling on the challenge, Mr Justice Humphreys said the law imposed a \"chilling effect\" on public interest journalism.\nHe said the legislation was not in accordance with law and that the assembly had acted outside \"the margin of appreciation afforded to it in this field\".",
    "A company that bankrolled Vaughan Gething's successful bid to become Wales' first minister was linked to a criminal investigation at the time, the BBC can reveal.\nMr Gething's leadership campaign accepted \u00a3200,000 from a firm controlled by millionaire businessman David Neal.\nA criminal investigation into suspected environmental offences by one of Mr Neal's firms, Resources Management Limited (RML), is being carried out by Natural Resources Wales (NRW).\nA spokesman for Welsh Labour told the BBC on Friday the issues had \"previously been addressed\" by Mr Gething - but later the first minister said he was \"not aware of any of the details\" of the criminal investigation.\nOn Monday Mr Gething told the BBC: \"Why on earth would I have known about an investigation at that time?\n\"I've complied with all the rules throughout the process and the BBC have said today there's no evidence at all that I have broken any rules in the contest.\"\nAsked when he first knew about the criminal investigation, Mr Gething said he \"found out when it was reported\". The issue had been put to him by a BBC reporter at the Urdd Eisteddfod on Friday.\nBBC Wales Investigates can also reveal that a senior Welsh Labour figure offered to lend Mr Gething money so he could pay back the donation in full, but he declined to take up the offer.\nMr Gething, who narrowly won the Welsh Labour leader contest earlier this year,  previously said he had done nothing wrong and has not broken the ministerial code.\nThe continuing row in Wales is an unwelcome distraction to Sir Keir Starmer during the general election campaign - although the Labour leader has publicly backed Mr Gething.\nRML runs the Withyhedge landfill site near Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, which people have complained since October 2023 is a \"stink bomb on steroids\". \nRML said it would \"continue to fully cooperate with any pending investigations by Natural Resources Wales\".\nBut it is not the first time a waste management company controlled by Mr Neal has been investigated.\nHe was twice convicted for environmental crimes relating to two companies in 2013 and 2017, and one of those also pleaded guilty in March this year to another offence.\nOne woman said she moved back to her childhood home in the nearby village of Crundale with her partner and two young children for a \"better quality of life\", but it has been marred by the Withyhedge site.\n\"I went out of the house to go to work and was hit with a horrible stench of rotten eggs, I held my breath until I got to the car. It was horrible,\" Jenny Clubbe told Wales Investigates.\n\"When I got to the car, my lips started tingling and I started getting headaches soon after. \n\"We've been shutting the windows because we don't want to wake up to my house smelling of rotten eggs, which is worse than my son's nappy.\"\nRML said it would no longer be accepting \u201ca number of waste streams\u201d they say contributed to the smell, and are planning engineering work to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\nRetired council worker Colin Barnett, who also lives near the landfill, has organised community protests over the smell and has been complaining to NRW for seven months. \n\"We started a Facebook campaign based on the fact that the local Facebook for Spittal village got overwhelmed by questions about the tip.\n\"When the drone footage [of the site] that I took went public, they started investigating it more, and it's only since then there's been more pressure from us that they've had to keep going back.\"\nThe group Mr Barnett started now has more than 2,000 members and he said it was a \"massive campaign now\". \n\"They're probably very surprised they've had such fierce resistance from a rural area that they thought was quite small, but the problem is, they've affected so many of those villages. \nHe added that very early on in a public meeting Mr Neal stood up and said he wanted to be a good neighbour.\n\"Well, if this is being a good neighbour, forget it. Just go away.\" \nNRW says it has identified the smell as hydrogen sulphide. \nHuwel Manley, head of operations for the South West, said the regulator was working with the local authority, local health board and Public Health Wales to fix the issues.\n\"We identified issues of concern late last year,\" he added.\n\"The company is under investigation at the moment\".\nNRW is overseen by the Welsh government and it had been briefing ministers about the Withyhedge site controlled by Mr Neal since before Mr Gething became first minister in mid-March. \nHealth secretary Eluned Morgan and then-climate change minister Julie James both had meetings with the regulator about problems at Withyhedge in February.\nIt was revealed in March that Mr Gething has also previously spoken to NRW on behalf of Mr Neal back in 2016, asking them to ease restrictions on one of his businesses, Atlantic Recycling Ltd. \nThe second chunk of money Mr Neal gave Mr Gething in January 2024 was donated the day before another of Mr Neal's company's outlined plans for a new solar farm",
    "Plans to cut the school summer holiday have been shelved until after the next Welsh Parliament election - with teaching groups calling the proposal \"a waste of time\".\nEducation Secretary Lynne Neagle said postponing the change until the next Senedd term would let schools focus on other major improvements.\nShe admitted \"opinion was hugely divided\" on the issue, which had been strongly opposed by teaching unions, as well as organisers of Wales\u2019 biggest agricultural show The Royal Welsh, and some tourist attractions.\nIf the proposals had gone ahead, the half term break in October 2025 would have been extended to a fortnight, with a five week rather than six week holiday in summer 2026.\nEithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said it was \"disappointing\" the issue has been given such a high priority by the Welsh government, branding it an \"unwelcome distraction and an enormous waste of time\". \n\"We are relieved that this decision has been made, although calling it a 'pause' sounds like a face-saving exercise as it is surely pointless to go round this loop again.\n\"As the consultation proved, and as we knew all along, there is no unanimous call from parents or teachers for changes to be made to the school holidays.\"\nIf the proposals had gone ahead, the half term break in October 2025 would have been extended to a fortnight, with a five week rather than six week holiday in summer 2026.\nThere are about 470,000 pupils in Wales who would be affected by the changes if they were to go ahead, according to the latest figures.\nMinisters argued that disadvantaged pupils would benefit most from a shorter summer break and more regular terms would be less tiring for pupils and staff.\nThey said many families struggled with childcare over the long summer holiday, and the changes would \"align more effectively with how families live and work\".\nBut education unions said it was a distraction from other challenges schools face and could deter teachers from joining the profession.\nThe response to a public consultation - the biggest on record about education -   generated more than 16,000 responses, the Welsh government said.\nIt said \"a narrow majority\" of those who responded were in favour of changing school holidays, but there were \"contradictory\" findings - so more discussion was needed before anything was finalised.\nMs Neagle said a \"pause\" would allow reforms such as the new curriculum for Wales and an overhaul of additional learning needs to be rolled out before another major change.\n\"We need to continue listening to and engaging with schools, teachers, unions as well as children, young people and parents on how best we can implement any changes in the future,\" she said.\n\"They are supporting our ambitious transformation of education in Wales and they need the time and the space to ensure these reforms deliver for children and young people.\"\nShe said she wanted to prioritise ongoing school reforms and improving attainment and therefore, no changes will be made to the school year this Senedd term.\nAny decision to go ahead with the changes to school holidays would be taken after the next Welsh Parliament election in May 2026 - making any change to the school holidays unlikely before the 2028-2029 school year.\nThe Welsh government said: \"The total cost of the work around the structure of the school year is approximately \u00a3350,000.\"\nThe Conservative shadow education secretary Tom Giffard said the school system is \"in crisis with soaring absenteeism, a shocking decline in education standards, the worst PISA results in the UK and rising incidences of violence plaguing our schools\". \nHe said \"the policy needs to be scrapped completely\".\nPlaid Cymru\u2019s education spokesperson, Heledd Fychan MS said: \"It\u2019s clear that there is a crisis in education in Wales. This requires Welsh government to take action to improve school attendance, educational attainment and safety, as well as recruit and retain more teachers and improve support for learners with additional learning needs.\"\nLaura Doel, national secretary at the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, said changes to holidays should \"never have been a priority\" and praised Ms Neagle for not pressing ahead \"with a reform which would have had no benefit to learners\".\nNeil Butler, national official for Wales for the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers  said this \"bizarre attack on the summer break\" needed to be \"consigned to the dustbin of history\".\nHe added: \"Wales has already got the shortest summer break in the whole of Europe.\n\"There\u2019s no educational reason for it whatsoever, and in fact we believe that it would have been educationally damaging.\"\nSchool holidays in Wales are broadly in line with England, but there are some variations between local authorities across the UK.\nScotland has a different pattern where the summer term ends earlier and resumes in August.\nSome local authorities in England and Scotland have tw",
    "A Morris dancing group said they have been left heartbroken after a bus they spent months repairing was targeted by \"mindless\" vandals. \nThe double-decker, belonging to Tanhouse Morris Dance Group in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, was found with its windows smashed, fuel siphoned off and seats ripped out.\nLancashire Police said the bus, which was parked up in a garage on Potter Place, was targeted some time overnight on Saturday. \nThe dance group, run by volunteers, had hoped to use the bus to travel to a competition.  \nAngela Eadie, the group's treasurer, said: \"It was heart-breaking after the effort everyone had gone to making sure it was all ready for Sunday's competition. \n\"It's a double-decker bus which as a group we had to do major fundraising to get. \n\"We keep it clean and tidy so it's upsetting someone would do such mindless vandalism.\"\nThe group had spent more than \u00a31,000 repairing the bus over the last few months, with the last of repairs being completed on Saturday. \nMs Eadie said items including their kit trolley and deckchairs were also stolen from the bus.\n\"It has caused a lot of stress\" she added.\n\"It's hard work doing all this alongside a full-time job and family, and while we are insured, the excess is high so it will cost a lot and the equipment list won't be covered.\"\nThe non-profit group was founded in 1970 by Sue McCluskey, who is still principal. \nIt relies on fundraising, grants and sponsorship and the bus offered subsidised transport to families who do not drive.\nThe group hope they can make the necessary repairs following the support they have received since, including more than that \u00a31,500 from a crowdfunding appeal. \n\"I'd like to say a massive thank you to everyone who has donated,\" Ms Eadie said.\n\"It has restored my faith in our community.

    "Colin Gibb, the longest-standing member of pop band Black Lace, has died at the age of 70. \nThe group were best known for their 1984 novelty hit Agadoo, which reached number two in the UK.\nBlack Lace also represented the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1979, finishing in seventh place with the song Mary Ann.\nGibb's bandmate Dene Michael confirmed his death to the BBC, describing it as \"awful news\".\nMichael also posted a tribute on Twitter with a picture of himself and Gibb, writing: \"Rest in peace my friend, God bless you x.\"\nIn a Facebook post, Gibb\u2019s wife Sue Kelly said it was \"heartbreaking\" to tell fans her \"dearest husband\" had died.\n\"I love you Colin, [we] spent 22 years living your Agadoo dream, we were due to retire to Spain on Thursday, you were so happy, so looking forward to our new life, now you\u2019re gone.\n\"As we used to say, always love you forever.\"\nBlack Lace were also known for songs such as Do the Conga, Superman, Hokey Cokey, Wig-Wam Bam and I Am the Music Man.\nBut Agadoo was their biggest success, selling more than a million copies worldwide and becoming a staple of school discos and wedding parties. \nThe band underwent several line-up changes over the years, and Gibb himself occasionally took breaks from performing with the group.\nBut cumulatively, Gibb spent more time in the band than any other member, his time with the group spanning several decades.\nA statement from the group's management Now Music to the PA news agency said: \"Unfortunately Colin passed away unexpectedly yesterday afternoon.\n\"He'd recently announced his departure from the entertainment industry and was looking forward to enjoying his retirement with his with wife Susan.\n\"We are all deeply shocked and saddened by the news.

    "The BBC can reveal the former TV personality and convicted sex offender Stephen Bear has settled the sum he was ordered to pay under the Proceeds of Crime Act.\nIn December 2022 Bear, of Loughton, Essex, was found guilty of voyeurism and two counts of disclosing a private sexual film.\nHe was given a confiscation order of \u00a322,305 in March 2024 and had three months to pay.\nChelmsford Crown Court has confirmed the amount was paid in full on 8 May.\nBear, 34, was reported to Essex Police by his ex-girlfriend and Love Island star Georgia Harrison, after he shared a CCTV video of the pair having sex in his garden without her consent.\nHe sent the video to a friend via WhatsApp and later uploaded it to the adult content subscription site OnlyFans.\nBear was charged under new \"revenge-porn\" laws, and was sentenced to 21 months in prison in March 2023.\nGeorgia Harrison waived her right to anonymity in order to raise awareness about the impact this type of crime can have on victims.\nIf Bear failed to pay the money he owed by 28 June he would have faced a further nine months in prison.\nHalf the payment will go to the Home Office, with the remainder of the sum split between the Crown Prosecution Service and Essex Police.\nOf the total given to Essex Police, the majority will go into a fund to buy equipment for future asset recovery; a contribution will also be made to the Essex Community Foundation charity.\nThe amount does not include a \u00a35,000 victim payment to Ms Harrison, which must be paid on top of the confiscation order taking the total to more than \u00a327,000\nBear, who has featured in reality TV programmes including Celebrity Big Brother, sold his home in Loughton while he was in prison to pay legal bills.\nDetails from the Land Registry show the three bedroom end-of-terrace house was sold for \u00a3400,000 in July last year, although it was bought in 2018 for \u00a3475,000.\nDebbie Price, the deputy chief crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"It\u2019s important criminals understand that aside from the sentence they receive, we will also go after their bank accounts and assets to prevent them from enjoying the money they made from their crimes.\u201d\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Most of Tuesday's front pages feature the return of Nigel Farage to lead Reform UK, and a poll suggesting the Conservatives could be reduced to just 140 seats. \n\"Rishi's darkest hour\" is the headline in the Daily Mail, while \"Farage blows apart Tory election plan\", is the i's take. \nIn what's called a \"shock U-turn\" by the Daily Express, Mr Farage also announced he would attempt to become the MP for Clacton in Essex. \nThe Sun reports that the bookmakers have him at evens to claim the seat, in his eighth attempt to enter Parliament. \nAccording to the Times, he changed his mind about standing at about 14:00 on Sunday afternoon following a day fishing, walking his dogs and going to the pub.\nA senior Tory is quoted in the Guardian as saying Nigel Farage's return poses an \"existential\" threat. \nThe Financial Times has spoken to Conservative insiders who believe Reform could take the former Brexit strongholds of Clacton, Hartlepool and Boston & Skegness. \nThe Daily Telegraph details some of the anger towards Downing Street for failing to neutralise the threat of Reform. \nOne Conservative candidate says they should have done a deal with Mr Farage's party. Another adds that Tory members and MPs have been \"thrown to the wolves\" by the \"incompetence\" of Number Ten.\n\"Vote for Farage is more likely to end up with Starmer in Number Ten\", is the message from the prime minister in the Daily Express. \nLaying out what the paper says is a \"clear choice\" facing Conservative voters, Mr Sunak says progress on tackling the small boats crisis will be lost, punishing green penalties will hit hard-pressed families and taxes will rise if Labour win.\nThe Sun's leader says a \"dull and petty\" election campaign \"changed with a bang\" yesterday when Mr Farage made his announcement. \nHighlighting his talent for \"guerrilla politics\", the Times' leading article says his intervention \"threatens to tear an arm\" off the Conservatives. \nBut there's a note of caution for Mr Farage in the i's letter from the editor, namely that everyone who was attracted to Reform is already backing the party, meaning his comeback does little to shift the dial.\nThe poll suggesting the Tories could be reduced to just 140 seats represents \"meltdown\", according to the Daily Mirror. \nThe paper says a Labour majority of 194 would be on the cards. In what the Metro says would be \"a record rout\", cabinet ministers including the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and the defence secretary, Grant Shapps are forecast to lose out. \nAccording to reports in the Times, the findings of the YouGov survey of 50,000 voters also suggest the Prime Minister's own seat of Richmond and Northallerton is no longer considered safe.\nAnd finally, away from the election, the Guardian reports on the Olivier award-winning play that will be rewritten based on the England football team's performance at Euro 2024. \n\"Dear England\" charts the side's rise under Gareth Southgate. The show is returning to the stage next spring. \"I don't want to jinx it\", playwright James Graham says, \"but in terms of the talent we have, this feels like a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring it home at last\".\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "A 104-year-old RAF veteran who admits he was afraid of heights has recalled his part in the D-Day landings.\nHarry Garthwaite, from Birmingham, flew senior military personnel to Normandy and brought home casualties.\nHe said he remembered seeing \"thousands of army men being launched towards France in sky tugs and gliders\".\nHe has appeared on large digital screens in London and Portsmouth in a campaign by Blind Veterans UK charity to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Operation Overlord.\nMr Garthwaite, who was 24 at the time, was with the Second Tactical Air Force 84 Group and was told to go to Hawkinge aerodrome to prepare for the landings.\nBut he said: \"When I got to Hawkinge, it was heaving with people and there was no room in the mess so we were sent down into Folkestone.\"\nOn the day of the invasion he said: \"I collected army officers to take them to airfields near strategic points involved in the operation. They were everything from lieutenant colonels upwards to generals.\"\nHe remembered one officer tapped him on the shoulder and asked him to cut his engines to hear an announcement on the tannoy that the invasion had gone according to plan.\nShuttling officers to France and wounded soldiers back to waiting ambulances in Sussex, he recalled \"the Royal Engineers did a great job building little landing strips here, there and everywhere\".\nMr Garthwaite was demobbed in December 1945, having flown 23 different aircraft and clocked more than 2,231 hours, 517 of which were operational.\nHe said: \"There's a funny thing because I can't stand heights. I'm terrified on the top of the ladder.\"\nBut he found no problem flying and added: \"The first flight I took never worried me. As long as the plane's moving, I'm moving.\"\nLater in life he lost his sight to macular degeneration and said he felt \u201ccompletely lost\u201d.\nHe turned to Blind Veterans UK and the charity was able to provide him with a CCTV magnifier, which meant he was able to read again.\nHis story is one of 16 being re-told by the charity on its website and on the giant digital screens.\nThe CEO of Blind Veterans UK, Adrian Bell, said many veterans played down their role in D-Day and say they were just \"a small cog in a huge enterprise\".\nBut he said: \"It could not have succeeded without such commitment from so many people playing their part.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A man whose wife died from motor neurone disease (MND) has called Rob Burrow \"inspirational\" in how he raised awareness of the condition.\nSteve Howe, from Rendlesham, Suffolk, lost his wife Rachael in 2022. Before she passed away they had been planning to walk the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route in Spain, starting from their home more than 1,000 miles away. \nMr Howe has decided to cycle the distance on his own to raise money for the Motor Neurone Disease Association.\nHe said: \"There's so many people like Rob who don't get the headlines but they carry on, they do what they can until the very end.\"\nMr Howe originally started the challenge last summer on foot, but had to retire outside Paris after injuring his Achilles tendon. \nThe couple met in Norwich in 1979 as students at the University of East Anglia. \nMotor neurone disease affects nerves and causes messages from the motor neurones to gradually stop reaching the muscles, causing them to weaken. \nLike Rachael MND affects many people such as the former Leeds Rhinos and Great Britain rugby league player Rob Burrow, who died from the disease on Sunday. \n\"It's sad that Rob has gone, he's inspirational... There's so many people like Rob who don't get the headlines but they carry on, they do what they can until the very end,\" said Mr Howe.  \nHe added: \"The end is always painful... we took Rachael all the over the place - and to see the world through someone's eyes who you know will never see those views again, is very humbling. You're prepared but the end is never what you want.\"\nMr Howe has so far raised more than \u00a35,000, which will go towards researching a cure for the disease. \n\"If you get MND it's palliative care, and most of the money that's raised will go to research to try to find a cure, so your children won't need to suffer like Rob and Rachael have.\"\nMr Howe has completed 1,200 miles (1,931km) of the trip from Rendlesham, Suffolk, to Santiago de Compostela, Spain, but he still has 90 miles (145km) to go. \n\"As a word camino means a way or a path. Sometimes it means just a geographical path from A to B, sometimes it's a journey that you take to reflect on life, to enjoy life.\n\"So this is Rachael's camino, her path that has helped me get through the past couple of years and to celebrate her life.\" \nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "About half a million people have been left without their Child Benefit payment, after a technical issue at HMRC.\nThe tax authority said a batch processing issue meant around 30% of Monday\u2019s scheduled payments did not go through and would not be made until Wednesday.\nMany parents took to social media to complain about the missing money with some saying they had been left unable to buy food or pay for their child\u2019s bus fare.\nHMRC, which administers Child Benefit payments, says that anyone who has incurred a loss can apply for redress.  \nSince April, parents have been able to claim \u00a325.60 a week for one child and \u00a316.95 for each subsequent child. \nPeople who earn up to \u00a360,000 a year can claim the benefit in full. It is taken away entirely when an individual earns \u00a380,000.\nThe payments, which are usually made every four weeks, arrive on a Monday or Tuesday.\nHowever, they sometimes show in people's accounts over the weekend.\nLaura, a mum of one from Sussex, told the BBC she had noticed the payment wasn't there and had been worrying all weekend.\nShe needs it to pay direct debits for her TV licence and daughters' school clubs and has had to borrow money from her dad to get to the end of the week.\n\"I was up at 2:30am this morning checking my bank account \u2013 there was no comms from HMRC to warn us or tell us what to do next, it\u2019s been a guessing game.\"\nPeople can claim Child Benefit if they are responsible for bringing up a child under 16, or under 20 if they are in approved education or training.\nOnly one parent receives the payment per child, but there is no limit to how many children you can claim for.\nAnyone impacted by the technical problems can submit a complaint online.\nThose affected are advised to keep any evidence such as receipts or screenshots to add to their complaint if they want to claim redress.\nSusan, a mother of two from Dundee, can\u2019t work as she has a chronic illness. The family rely on child benefit to make ends meet and she fears they won't be able to afford gas and electricity this week.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really stressful day to be honest with you, making phone calls to HMRC, struggling to get through, being told lines are busy and that there are technical faults,\" Susan told the BBC. \n\"When I did get through after one hour, they said they were not able to offer any information until Tuesday.\u201d\nShe said waiting until Wednesday for the money was \u201cnot good enough\u201d and she may have to turn to friends and family for help.\n\u201cThe stress has left me in tears,\" she said.\nDanielle, a mum from London, tweeted: \"In 14 years, I've never had a problem getting my CB on time. I was very surprised by this issue. Hopefully, it'll be rectified quickly. I feel for anyone who was relying on this money this morning.\"\nHMRC said it was \"sorry\" for the delayed payments and that it understood \"the concern and difficulty this may have caused\". \n\"We have now fixed the problem and are putting measures in place to prevent this from happening again,\" a spokesman said.\n\"Affected customers will now receive their payments on Wednesday morning. Anyone who has incurred a direct financial loss because of the delayed payment can apply for redress by completing our online complaints form.\u201d\nIt added that payments scheduled for Tuesday would be made on time.\nAs of August, there were 6.91 million families receiving Child Benefit payments.\n",
    "The events of D-Day and the spirit of the war effort are best told by those who lived through it.\nWith each passing year such first-hand accounts become more precious to record as photographs, mementos and stories are passed on for future generations.\nTo mark the upcoming 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings, BBC News NI has spoken to two veterans with different experiences to share, at home and overseas.\nGeorge Horner is one of the last surviving Royal Ulster Rifles veterans from D-Day.\nAda Chell followed events from a barracks in County Antrim and lost someone special to her.\nAda, from Bangor, joined the women's branch of the Army, the Auxiliary Territorial Service, when she was 17 in 1941.\nThree years later she followed the events of D-Day from Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn.\nNow 100, she remembers the scenes of celebration when news of the Normandy landings began to filter back.\nThe war was a busy time for young Ada.\n\"I seldom got out because it was, I would say, a 24-hour job,\" she told BBC News NI. \n\"In the front office we had a brigadier and his assistant. Then in the back office was a sergeant major and then the big map on the wall.\n\"I was in charge of the dispatch riders for all of Northern Ireland. \n\"At that time to get a cup of petrol was difficult. And the dispatch riders had to go to all the barracks. I was in charge of them and it was trying to not send them on a long journey, but to try and break up that journey. \n\"It saved a lot of petrol.\"\nThis was essential work as the riders were bringing important messages from London.\nNot only was petrol hard to get, but food was becoming increasingly scarce. \nBut despite the Belfast Blitz, and nearly five years of war, Ada said people's resolve had not faltered by June 1944.\n\"It was difficult, you had to queue for food and things like that, everything was rationed, even coal, you couldn\u2019t get coal to heat your fires,\" she recalled.\n\"I think it was more worrying that they were going to get a notification [of a death or serious injury]. But then all the news that was coming through about what was going on in Germany and finding out about these [concentration] camps. \n\"And seeing these people, the cruelty that had gone on, that was something that the young today have no idea about, the horror.\"\nOn D-Day itself, she remembered the sense that \"something big\" was happening.\n\"They had something going on that day - like a celebration. That\u2019s what I can remember. I worked in the pay office. Oh jubilation, that it was over, at least they thought it was over.\n\"Oh yes, something big was happening and there was joy, yes, at that moment.\"\nWith the joy, however, came a personal loss - a young suitor of Ada\u2019s, Robert Nicholson, a Royal Marine, died of his injuries.\n\"You know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re young, and you meet someone you like and they like you, and you got a peck on the cheek and that\u2019s all you got,\" she said.\n\"We were very old fashioned in those days.\n\"On D-Day, the day of the invasion, he was in the Royal Marines, and I got a letter from him saying he was going to be moved. \n\"Then I got a card from him, I saw him briefly for an hour and then he was called back again. \n\"He got shrapnel in his lungs, he was a commando.\"\nRobert Nicholson died in January 1945 of wounds inflicted in the Netherlands.\nLess than a year later, victory was declared in Europe.\n\"It was unbelievable, but it was sad,\" Ada explained. \n\"I had lost so many friends. Some came home but some didn\u2019t. There was joy and there was sadness.\"\nAnd still to this day Ada remembers her friend Nicky, as she calls him.\n\"I went to a British legion concert. They asked me to make a speech. I couldn\u2019t speak, the only thing I could see was Nicky\u2019s - all I could see was his gravestone. He was only 21.\"\nD-Day, also known as the Normandy landings, was one of the most significant events in World War Two.\nTens of thousands of Allied troops landed in gliders and on the beaches of northern France on 6 June 1944.\nIt was the largest seaborne invasion in history and marked a turning point in the fight against Nazi Germany. \nGeorge Horner, from Carrickfergus in County Antrim, was a sergeant with 2nd Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles (RUR) on D-Day, landing at Sword beach.\nThe 97-year-old said his father had served in the 36th Ulster Division during World War One and offered him one piece of advice: \"Keep the head down and get behind somebody taller than you.\"\nGeorge said he ignored the paths of his brothers in the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force as he \"wasn't a great swimmer\" and he \"didn't like flying in case the plane crashed\". \nAfter starting his Army career in Omagh, County Tyrone, he moved to England and worked for a time as a Morse code signaller.\nHowever, D-Day is etched in George's memory.\n\"6 June 1944 - I remember it well,\" he said.\nThe 2nd Battalion began landing at the Queen Red Beach area of Sword from midday. \nTheir objective was to move quickly inland and prepare to fight for the city of Caen.\nDuring a",

    "A \"dishonest\" nurse who submitted fake timesheets for 77 shifts she never worked and pocketed \u00a326,000 in wages has been permanently banned from the profession.\nFrancesca Del-Greco was struck off the nursing register for gross misconduct after a Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing.\nMs Del-Greco worked for an agency and was deployed to a hospital in Blackpool when she made the false claims, the disciplinary panel heard.\nAltrix Nursing Agency, which employed Ms Del-Greco, ended up footing the bill as her deception came to light before the hospital had paid an invoice.\nThe panel said in a written ruling that her \"systematic\" dishonesty came to light when the agency discovered \"discrepancies\" in timesheets submitted between October 2021 and February 2022\nSuspicion was heightened further when managers at Altrix were unable to recognise the signatures on those timesheets.\nMs Del-Greco was asked about the shifts in question on 2 March, 2022, but offered a series of false explanations. \nA counter fraud specialist working for Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust conducted an investigation, and could find no trace of Ms Del-Greco working at the hospital on 77 of the shifts in question. \nWhen confronted by the investigator and interviewed, she admitted she had submitted the timesheets for shifts she never worked. \nShe told investigators she had spent all the money but had offered to repay the agency at \u00a3200 per month, although some of those payments were missed. \nThe panel heard the hospital believed fraud had been committed, but because they had not yet paid the agency the matter was not referred to the Crown Prosecution Service.\nThe ruling said Ms Del Greco had \"engaged in a premedicated, systematic, and longstanding deception\".\n\"Her dishonesty was repeated and sustained,\" it added. \nThe panel concluded Miss Del-Greco\u2019s \"actions and dishonest conduct is fundamentally incompatible\" with her being able to stay on the nursing register.\nMs Del-Greco had stopped working as a nurse and did not attend the hearing. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Hospital beds could be cut and care packages scaled back due to cutbacks in Northern Ireland's health service, it has been warned.\nIn a joint statement, the heads of Northern Ireland's six health and social care trusts said they were deeply concerned at the finances of frontline services.\nThe chairpersons warned of  \"catastrophic impacts\".\nThey said \"intensive efforts\" were ongoing to deliver significant savings for the current financial year, but even with these a \"very significant shortfall remains that could only be filled by measures with high and catastrophic impacts\".\n\"Such cutbacks would inevitably include bed closures as well as reductions in outpatient care, operating lists, domiciliary care and nursing care packages,\" their statement added.\nHealth Minister Mike Nesbitt has said funding cuts that cause \u201ccatastrophic impacts\u201d to services will not be made on his watch.\nHe was speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday after taking over as health minister last week from his Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) colleague Robin Swann.\nThe party opposed Stormont\u2019s budget after raising concerns over the level of funding provided for the Department of Health.\nMr Nesbitt said he has been \u201cstunned by the budget briefings\" he has received.\n\"I fear this house, or parts of it, may not fully understand the consequences for healthcare,\" he said.\n\"The stark reality is that if I implement the current budget, the consequence will be that many patients will suffer harm.\"\nThe minister said proposed savings were at an \u201cunprecedented level\u201d and a break-even budget would require \u201chigh and catastrophic-impact decisions\u201d.\nHe said this would lead to \u201creductions in acute beds, in home care hours and in care home beds\u201d which there would be \u201csignificant and sustained consequences\".\n\"In short, catastrophic cuts will simply make the situation worse. Pressures on services and staff that are already at severe levels will be significantly intensified,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt also means that as we currently stand, there is no feasible route to affording pay awards.\"\nSpeaking in the assembly chamber, he added: \"Let me be clear, deputy speaker: cuts with catastrophic impacts - not on my watch.\"\nOutlining his plans as minister, Mr Nesbitt said health inequalities represented the \u201coverarching issue for so many of the critical challenges facing health and social care\u201d.\n\"I do not want a two-tier system where timely access to treatments is the preserve of those who can afford to go private,\u201d he added.\nIn February, devolved government in Northern Ireland was restored after a 24-month hiatus.\nFor most of that time no ministers were in office.\nChairman of the Western Trust Dr Tom Frawley told BBC News NI the absence of politicians had created difficulties for the transformation of the health service.\n\"The health service knows what the blueprint is, knows what it needs to do and has been developing the analysis to inform that,\" he said. \n\"But we\u2019ve had no politicians, who are required to make these judgements and finalise those judgments.\"\nReferring to strains on GP and pharmacy services as well as on hospitals, Dr Frawley said the whole system was under intense pressure and was therefore not in a position to cope with a significant financial cut.\nHe said \"crucial services would be affected because of the level of cuts trusts were being told to make\".\n\"What worries me is that it is the most vulnerable who will suffer in these circumstances and those are the people we should be most concerned about,\" he added.\n\"When you take a large sum of money out of the system then you reduce its capacity to respond to those pressures even further, with the implication that circumstances will become worse.\" \nThe health trusts' warning comes after the chair of the Royal College of GPs in Northern Ireland said pressure on the health service means patients were either paying with \"their livelihoods or... their lives\".\nDr Ursula Mason said doctors could not \"keep doing more and more with less and less\".\nLast week, the Northern Ireland Assembly passed its first budget in three years, despite several parties voting against the move.\nThe Ulster Unionist Party - which the health minister is a member of - and the assembly's official opposition, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, refused to support it.\nPrevious UUP health minister Robin Swann opposed it when it was agreed by other executive ministers in April.\nThe health department got the largest share of day-to-day funding (\u00a37.8bn).",

    "Women are still being routinely strip-searched in prison despite promises by Scottish ministers five years ago to reduce the practice, BBC News has found.\nWendy Sinclair-Gieben, the head of the prisons watchdog, has written to the justice secretary demanding this \u201ctraumatic\u201d practice stop immediately for all prisoners.\nThe Scottish Prison Service said it had installed scanners in many prisons and only conducted body searches where necessary to keep people safe.\nJustice Secretary Angela Constance said the prison service aimed for a trauma-informed approach but she shared the inspector\u2019s concerns about the continued routine body searches of women.\nBody searches are used in prisons to check for drugs, weapons and other contraband.\nPrison officers are allowed to conduct a search which involves the remove an inmate's clothing and making a visual examination of the external parts of their body.\nThey can also make a visual examination of the prisoner's open mouth but no equipment or force may be used.\nHowever, following a review of two deaths in Polmont Young Offenders Institute in 2018, ministers said the strip-searching of female prisoners and young people - without evidence - should be reduced.\nThey said it should be replaced with technology including scanners and metal detectors. \nLinda Allan, whose daughter Katie who took her own life in Polmont, said repeated strip-searching was a major factor in her death.\nMs Sinclair-Gieben, the chief inspector of prisons in Scotland, said strip-searches were \u201cre-traumatising\u201d for prisoners \u2013 especially those who have suffered abuse in their past. \nShe said that contraband could be found more effectively with body scanners.\nThe chief inspector, who revealed to the BBC she will retire this summer, said she wanted the ending of routine strip-searching of prisoners to be her legacy.\nIn her letter to the justice secretary, she said: \u201cI accept there can be a legitimate role for body searching when it is based on robust evidence or reasonable ground for suspicion, but I do not regard it as justifiable when it is based purely on routine random searching of a set percentage of prisoners.\u201d\nMs Sinclair-Gieben called for the practice to end for young people in Polmont as far back as 2018 and in HMP Edinburgh in 2019.\nShe said she \u201chad been surprised and disappointed\u201d to find women continued to be subject to random searches.\nEarlier this year she also found routine strip-searching being used in the new community custody units for women.\nDawn, who was automatically strip-searched while in prison on remand four years ago, told the BBC it made her feel \"absolutely humiliated\". \nShe said she was caught in a cycle of addiction, shoplifting and poor mental health and being strip-searched made her feel even more isolated.\n\"I'd lost all self-respect - any little bit that I had left, I felt it had been taken away,\" she said. \n\"I felt I was looked at. I feel I was looked down at. It was very humiliating and embarrassing.\"\nDawn, whose name we have changed to protect her identity, said being told to remove your clothes for a search is even more upsetting for those who have suffered sexual abuse.\nSince she was in prison, Dawn has gone through rehab and now volunteers at the charity Sisco to help others with addiction in jail.\nThe issue of strip-searching has long been highlighted as a problem across the UK.\nIn England in 2007 the suicides of six prisoners at HMP Styal highlighted the practice of routinely strip-searching female prisoners as a contributing factor in their deaths.\nTechnology - including scanners and metal detectors - was meant to replace routine strip searches but the practice continues.\nMs Sinclair Gieben said: \u201cIt's not only degrading, it's not only re-traumatising, but it's also resource intensive and it's not pleasant for the staff to have to do it either. \n\"So why do we carry on with an anachronistic, outdated method that does not have a proven effectiveness?\u201d\nA Scottish Prison Service spokesperson said: \u201cThe rights and wellbeing of those in our care, and the safety and security of our establishments, are key priorities.\n\u201cWe have installed body scanner machines in 11 establishments and only conduct body searches where necessary to keep people safe.\u201d\nJustice Secretary Angela Constance said: \u201cI am committed to ensuring that the human rights of the people in our prisons are respected, protected, and fulfilled.\n\u201cWhile there can be a legitimate role for body searching when it is based on robust intelligence or reasonable grounds for suspicion, I share the chief inspector\u2019s concern that body searching of women in custody has been carried out on a more routine basis.\n\u201cThe Scottish Prison Service is committed to becoming a more trauma-informed organisation and always look to utilise available technology which can be used to help create safe and secure environments for those who live, work, and visit our establishments, where this is viable.\u201d",

    "Ahead of the anniversary of D-Day BBC News has spoken to veterans across Cornwall and Devon about what they experienced.\nOn 6 June 1944, Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, in what was the biggest sea invasion in history.\nThe D-Day landings marked the start of the campaign to free north-west Europe from the Germans during World War Two.\nBill Johnston was 21 and among the first ashore at Gold Beach on D-Day.\n\"There were splashes in the water round about us,\" he recalled from the comfort of his Plymouth home.\n\"We took one or two casualties, one of our lads\u2026 it was shrapnel where a shell burst near him.\n\"But it wasn\u2019t hard going.\"\nMr Johnston, now 100 years old, added ruefully: \"War is frightening , especially when you are being shot at.\"\nHis unit pushed on into France after the landings, but his war came to a sudden end a few weeks into the invasion when he was blown into the air by a mortar shell. \nThe explosion damaged his spine and he was unconscious for several days but went on to make a full recovery.\nLooking back on his service Mr Johnston said: \u201cIt was something that had to be done and I was part of it. I was well trained for it. \n\"You did what you had to do and when the day arrived that was what it was like and you did it.\u201d\nRichard Aldred was 20 years old and a tank driver when he crossed the channel to play his part in the liberation of Europe. \nArriving a few weeks after the main invasion, he described Normandy as a scene of carnage.\n\"It came as a shock, I had never seen a dead body before,\" he said. \n\"I soon got used to it and the smell of death and animals being wounded was bloody awful.\"\nNow 100 years old and living in Callington some memories remain painful: \"I had to bury two of my mates.\"\nHe continued: \"It was an artillery shell I think. He looked perfectly alright until you turned him over and his back was finished.\n\"It was awful, awful.\"\nMr Aldred fought through France, Holland and into Germany and is returning to Normandy for the D-day commemorations. \n\"It\u2019s very humbling,\" he said.\n\"When you see all those tombstones it makes you realise Normandy was no walk in the park.\"\nSuzanne Sparrow came from a Plymouth military family and she joined the Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service at 17.\nAs part of a boat crew it was her job to ferry personnel from ship to shore in all weathers.\nShe saw first-hand the Allies assembling for the Normandy landings. \n\u201cThe American ships started coming in. We were told not to talk about it obviously, but we knew something was brewing, but we had no idea what.\u201d \nMrs Sparrow, now 99, has vivid memories of watching the troops leaving Plymouth for D-Day.\n\"These young men had come over from America. They had no idea where they were going to go or what they were going to be doing, and it suddenly struck me actually that they were the same age as myself going out to fight. \n\"I was really a bit shattered.\"\nAs a member of the Royal Artillery, Colin Young landed in Normandy about a week after the invasion had begun. \nShortly afterwards at the age of 18 he saw his first major action when enemy troops on high ground put his unit under fire. \n\u201cThey could see every move that we made. \n\"There was nothing that we could do that they couldn\u2019t see. \n\"It was like picking rabbits off. Shooting them like at a fair ground. We were the rabbits.\"\nNow aged 98, Plymothian Mr Young had hoped to make the trip back to Normandy for the 80th anniversary commemorations.\nHe said: \"I lost a few mates\u2026 I will just go over there and say cheerio, I won't be able to go back again.\" \nUnfortunately since the interview, Mr Young has become too unwell to travel.\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "After giving up alcohol in January, the way that I socialise has slowly started to change.\nI recently cancelled going to a party where I only knew the host.\nIf I had been drinking, I would have gone. But that evening, I lacked the confidence to meet a group of new people without a glass of wine in my hand.\nInitially, I was disappointed in myself for not going. But I'm learning to adapt how and when I socialise - and that doesn't mean saying no to fun.\nI've been to nightclubs, festivals and gigs in the past few months, finding new ways to enjoy them all.\nCaffeine saw me through the nightclub and festival - who doesn't love a latte while watching the headliner? \nAnd I found a new way to enjoy gigs - which was a bit of a fluke.\nI went to see Cymande, a funk band that started making music in the 70s, at O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire.\nMy partner booked seated tickets - the only option available at the time - and it was fantastic.\nThe music was outstanding and we weren't getting pushed about in a crowd of drunk people. No drinks were spilled down my back, and I had more space to myself. Perfect.\nBut the crisis of confidence I felt at the prospect of going to my friend's party without a drink isn't unique to me.\nMillie Gooch, founder of the Sober Girl Society, told me how she started organising events in London after she stopped drinking aged 26.\n\"I started running meet-ups probably about seven months into getting sober,\" the 32-year-old said.\n\"I think it can feel like a really isolating experience when you stop drinking, no matter how supportive all your friends and family are, there's just stuff that you're going through that other people don't necessarily respond to.\n\"I didn't realise it would kind of turn into this large community that it has.\"\nEvents have included brunches, dance classes, arts and crafts, book swaps and burlesque.\nEach one aims to help people feel confident or relaxed, where alcohol would have previously played a role, Millie explained.\n\"We do a whole spectrum of events, but hopefully each one people can take away something different,\" she said. \"Something that can actually help them on this journey.\"\nLaura Willoughby, 49, runs Club Soda, an alcohol-free tasting room near Covent Garden.\nShe said her life became more varied and more social after she stopped drinking in 2012.\n\"The social life we imagine we're having with alcohol isn't always the reality,\" she said.\n\"My generation is the biggest drinking generation of women.

    "The US House of Representatives has voted to pass legislation that would sanction the International Criminal Court (ICC) after its prosecutor applied for arrest warrants against Israeli officials.\nThe move comes after The Hague-based court's prosecutor said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant should be arrested on charges relating to the war in Gaza.\nThe prosecutor is also seeking warrants for three leaders of Hamas.\nThe bill, proposed by pro-Israel Republicans, targets ICC officials involved in the case by blocking their entry to the US.\nOn Tuesday, it passed with a majority of Republican support by a vote of 247-155. Two Republicans voted \"present\" and 42 pro-Israel Democrats crossed the aisle to back the legislation.\nThough the bill passed in the House, it is not expected to become law. \nThe legislation will likely be ignored by Democrats who control the US Senate, where it would have to pass before it could be signed into law by the president.\nBut President Joe Biden has also indicated that he \"strongly opposes\" the bill and the administration has said it does not support the sanctions. \nIf it did become law, however, the legislation would also revoke any US visas held by  ICC officials and restrict them from making property transactions in the US.\nSome Senate Democrats, like John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, an outspoken supporter of Israel, have indicated they would support legislation sanctioning the court.\n\u201cI really would like to sanction the ICC for that. That was trash,\u201d Fetterman said of the arrest warrants. \nCongressman Chip Roy, a Texas Republican who introduced the legislation in the House, titled the Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act, has called the ICC \u201ca massive threat to US sovereignty\u201d.\nThe Democrats who opposed the measure largely support Israel, but have criticised Mr Netanyahu's conservative government. Some Democratic opponents said it risked forcing the US to sanction ally nations that support the ICC.\nWhen the measure cleared the House Rules Committee on Monday, Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said: \u201cThis bill makes a mockery of the rules-based international order that America helped build.\u201d\nThe bill's passage comes shortly after Mr Netanyahu was invited by US lawmakers to deliver a speech to Congress this summer, although the date of his speech has not been finalised.\nLast month, ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan said he had \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant, as well as Hamas\u2019s Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, military chief Mohammed Deif and political leader Ismail Haniyeh, bore \"criminal responsibility\" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza.\nIt marked the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close US ally.\n\"The ICC has to be punished for this action,\" Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said on Tuesday. \"We cannot allow this to stand.\"\n\"If the ICC was allowed to do this and go after the leaders of countries whose actions they disagree with, why would they not come after America?\"\nIsrael\u2019s government and Hamas reacted with outrage to Mr Khan's announcement last month.\nMr Netanyahu denounced the warrant applications against him and Mr Gallant as a \u201cmoral outrage of historic proportions\u201d.\nMr Gallant accused the prosecutor of drawing a \u201cdespicable\u201d parallel between Israel and Hamas and attempting to deny his country\u2019s right to self-defence.\nHamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and other countries - demanded the cancellation of the warrant applications for its leaders and denounced what it called Mr Khan's attempts \u201cto equate the victim with the executioner\".\nIf the ICC\u2019s judges decide to issue the arrest warrants, it will be up to its 124 member states - including the UK and many other US allies - to decide whether or not to enforce them.\nThe White House said in a statement on Monday that while the ICC prosecutor\u2019s warrant applications for Israeli leaders were \"outrageous\", it did not support sanctioning the ICC.\n\"There are more effective ways to defend Israel, preserve US positions on the ICC, and promote international justice and accountability, and the administration stands ready to work with the Congress on those options,\u201d it said.\nCreated by a UN treaty in 2002, the ICC investigates and brings to justice those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, intervening when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute.\nThe US - like Israel - is not a member of the ICC and does not recognise its jurisdiction, but has backed its previous prosecutions and arrest warrants not related to Israel and the Palestinians.\nIn 2020 under the Trump administration, the US imposed sanctions on top ICC officials, including Mr Khan\u2019s predecessor, after the court began investigating alleged war crimes committed by the US and others in the Afghan conflict.\nThe ongoing conflict in Gaza began when Hamas g",

    "Major hospitals in London have declared a critical incident after a cyber-attack led to operations being cancelled and emergency patients being diverted elsewhere.\nIt applies to hospitals partnered with Synnovis - a provider of pathology services. \nKing\u2019s College Hospital, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 - including the Royal Brompton and the Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital - and primary care services are among those affected.\nThe incident has had a \"major impact\" on the delivery of services, especially blood transfusions and test results.\nIt is thought to have happened on Monday, meaning some departments could not connect to a main server.\nSome procedures have been cancelled or have been redirected to other NHS providers as the hospitals try to establish what work can be carried out safely.\nThe NHS said emergency care continued to be available.\nGP services across Bexley, Greenwich, Lewisham, Bromley, Southwark and Lambeth boroughs have also been affected.\nA spokesperson from Synnovis said the company had sent in a \"taskforce of IT experts\" to \"fully assess\" the impact.\nThe NHS apologised for the inconvenience and said it was working with the National Cyber Security Centre to understand the impact.\nOne patient, Oliver Dowson, 70, was prepared for an operation from 06:00 at the Royal Brompton. He was told by a surgeon at about 12:30 that it would not be going ahead.\n\u201cThe staff on the ward didn\u2019t seem to know what had happened, just that many patients were being told to go home and wait for a new date,\" he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been given a date for next Tuesday and am crossing my fingers.\n\"It\u2019s not the first time that they have cancelled, but that was probably staff shortages in half-term week.\u201d\nVanessa Welham from Streatham, south-west London, said her husband's blood test at Gracefield Gardens health centre was cancelled on Monday evening.\n\"My husband received a text message last night advising his appointment this morning had been cancelled due to circumstances beyond their control, and that all major south London hospitals are unable to take any bookings for an indefinite period of time.\n\"He went on to the Swift website and made a new appointment - the earliest available was June 17, but that's probably questionable.\"\nA spokesperson for NHS England London region confirmed Synnovis was the victim of a ransomware cyber attack.\n\u201cEmergency care continues to be available, so patients should access services in the normal way, and patients should continue to attend appointments unless they are told otherwise,\" they said.\n\"We will continue to provide updates about the impact on services and how patients can continue to get the care they need.\"\nA spokesperson for Synnovis said: \"We are incredibly sorry for the inconvenience and upset this is causing to patients, service users and anyone else affected. \n\"We are doing our best to minimise the impact and will stay in touch with local NHS services to keep people up to date with developments.\"\nThe spokesperson added it had \"invested heavily\" in \"ensuring our IT arrangements are as safe as they possibly can be\". \n\"This is a harsh reminder that this sort of attack can happen to anyone at any time and that, dispiritingly, the individuals behind it have no scruples about who their actions might affect.\n\"The incident is being reported to law enforcement and the Information Commissioner, and we are working with the National Cyber Security Centre and the Cyber Operations Team.\"\nCyber security expert Steve Sands, from the Chartered Institute for IT, said ransomware threat was now an \"ever-present danger to critical institutions from schools to hospitals\".\nHe added: \u201cOf course, the perpetrators have no conscience, and they will attack any organisation whose cyber defences are not sufficiently robust.\n\u201cWe need to ensure that all public sector organisations have contingency plans in place to manage cyber attacks, that staff are regularly trained on risk and there is sufficient investment in software resilience.\n\u201cWhoever forms the next government needs to make sure the NHS has this resource and that it is spent correctly, to ensure that lives are not put at risk.\u201d\nProf Awais Rashid, head of the Bristol Cyber Security Group at the University of Bristol, said digital infrastructures were often a complex combination of many different systems and third-party service providers. \n\"Hence, cyber-attacks can have significant and substantial cascading impacts as we are seeing in this unfolding situation where critical health services are being impacted.\"\nA government spokesperson said patient safety was its priority and support was being provided to the company.\n\"We are working [with Synnovis] to minimise the impact on services for a number of NHS organisations in south-east London.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A hospital has paid \u00a33,000 in compensation after failing to follow its own protocol to get consent to take a patient's DNA.\nStuart Brown, 57, complained his genetic data was taken for a research project without informed consent and while he was in a coma.\nHe had been admitted to Yeovil District Hospital's intensive care unit in November 2021 when he contracted Covid.\nSomerset NHS Foundation Trust has admitted \"deviation from protocol\" in gaining consent to take DNA from seven patients, but maintains they were still properly informed.\nWhile Mr Brown was in a coma, his wife Annette was called by the hospital on his behalf, as the trust had to obtain consent to take his DNA. \nIt was for the GenOMMIC research study - a UK-wide project which aims to find genetic factors that determine outcome in critical illness in more than 23,000 adults.\nMrs Brown said: \"I fully appreciated it was a national study, but the benefit that swung the balance of him doing it was that he would potentially benefit.\n\"The suggestion was that he could potentially find out about any genetic factor that would predispose him more to being affected by Covid.\"\nMr Brown, from Sturminster Newton in Dorset, then accessed his medical records and found out this was not the case. \nHe told the BBC: \"My wife said she was asked to give consent over the phone and that giving consent would be a direct benefit to me and that when the paperwork arrived it was not the case.\"\nMr Brown subsequently withdrew from the study months later after being discharged home. The DNA sample was destroyed.\nHowever, to maintain the integrity of the study, his genomic sequence was kept in an anonymous form.\nMr Brown said: \"One of the very highest people in the trust wrote me an email which said he appreciated that the form said that this information sheet should be read out [to the patient], but for practical purposes that didn't happen.\"\nHe added: \"What upsets me is I have spent 18 months [working on this]. I have tried with regulatory authorities, I have tried with the hospital, GenOMMIC to say 'look is it not reasonable to have an audit to find out how wide this problem is?'\n\"But I have been unsuccessful in doing that.\"\nThrough a Freedom of Information request, Mr Brown found out 70 patients at  Yeovil took part in the study, and 23,400 in UK. \nThe trust has confirmed with the BBC that seven patients in total had DNA taken when there was a \"deviation in protocol\", including in Mr Brown's case.\nMr Brown added: \"Bearing in mind the person said they don't keep to the consent procedure because of practical reason, it is not a big leap to say there's lots of other people involved.\"\nA letter from a hospital solicitor in response to his complaint said: \"As to what harm you have suffered as a result of your DNA being taken and included in the study however, this appears to be limited to the physical act of taking the blood sample without consent.\"\nThe solicitor dismissed Mr Brown's claim he had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, saying: \"We have not seen any evidence that meets the diagnostic criteria  and links the condition you allege you suffer from the taking of blood sample without consent as opposed to your illness with Covid and the circumstances surrounding this.\n\"While our [hospital] trust client is very sorry that there were deviations from the protocols for taking consent, our investigations find that liability is not established.\"\nDespite this, Mr Brown accepted \u00a33,000 compensation from the hospital trust.\nThe NHS in Somerset has told the BBC there were two deviations from protocol in the way Mr Brown's consent was obtained, but it concluded \"none of these deviations mean that proper informed consent was not obtained before the sample was taken\".\nIt continued: \"A copy of the record of telephone consent was to be posted. The site confirmed it was sent and perhaps lost in the post.\"\nDavid Orr, a transparency campaigner based in Somerset, said: \"It\u2019s fairly clear that because they haven\u2019t said how they are going to use the information that [means] that technically there hasn\u2019t been permission of the patients to go ahead with it.\"\nHe added he thought it was \"a significant failing and I think the Information Commissioner's office would not be happy\".\nThe University of Edinburgh, which is in charge of the GenOMMIC research study, said: \"We are respectful of participants' right to withdraw their consent at any time and we can confirm that all procedures relating to the giving of consent, and its withdrawal, have been correctly followed for all participants in this study.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

Who were they and what is their story?\nOf the 22,442 people under British command who died in the 12-week Battle of Normandy, just two were women.\nSister Mollie Evershed, from Soham, Cambridgeshire, and Sister Dorothy Field, of Ringwood, Hampshire, were nurses on a hospital ship when it struck a mine off the French coast.\nAs it went down on 7 August 1944, they helped save the lives of 75 wounded men before losing their own.\nNow 8ft-high (2.5m) silhouettes of the pair stand at the centre of the Standing With Giants installation overlooking Gold Beach and marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\nDan Barton, who founded the project, said he was \"humbled to honour them in this way\".\nThe silhouettes are made from reclaimed aluminium and plastic signage often found on building sites and new housing developments.\n\"When people see these giant figures, they start to grieve,\" said Mr Barton.\n\"They seem to release an emotion. We call them giants because of the enormity of their sacrifice.\" \nMost are generic silhouettes of the men who died, but Mollie and Dorothy's are based on real photographs provided by relatives.\n\"We wanted to do them justice, and what's incredible is that you see them in so many different ways,\" said Mr Barton.\n\"You see them one way with your eyes and another way through a camera lens, and they cast different shadows looking towards or away from the sunlight.\n\"They come to life and it really is quite magical.\"\nAfter leaving Ely High School for Girls, Mollie trained at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.\nDorothy - better known by her middle name, Anyta - trained at King's College Hospital, London.\nIn 1944 they were serving on the SS Amsterdam. At 07:00 on a foggy morning in a heavy swell, the ship was swinging at anchor off Caen when it hit a mine.\nPacked with wounded men, it was about to make its third trip back across the Channel to Southampton.\nAs the ship began to sink and with the engine room completely wrecked, Mollie and Anyta left the safety of their lifeboat and went below deck to try to save the lives of the wounded men in the wards below.\nPatrick Manning worked in the galley and survived the tragedy. In 2005 he wrote an eyewitness account on the BBC's WW2 People's War pages.\n\"There was a heavy swell, so, finding it hard to swim in a lifejacket, I paddled,\" he wrote.\n\"I could hear a lot of screaming and shouting.

I was told afterwards that they were nurses.\"\nMollie's niece Christine Cranfield is 80 and lives just a few yards away from the Soham war memorial that carries her aunt\u2019s name.\nAs a baby, she was brought up by Mollie for a while until she returned to the hospital ship and met her fate.\n\"Nobody in the family mentioned it when I was growing up,\" she said.\n\"It just wasn't talked about. But it was Mollie's job. She obviously cared about the men to the best of her ability.\n\"I do hope that one day the silhouette of Mollie can come home to Soham.\"\nMollie died a week before her 28th birthday.

    "China says its lunar probe has successfully taken off from the far side of the Moon to begin its journey back to Earth carrying the first samples ever collected from the region.\nState media says the collecting module of the Chang'e-6 craft lifted off about 07:38 on Tuesday (23:38 GMT Monday) to begin the journey back.\nOn Sunday, the robot landed in a giant crater close to the Moon's south pole in a world-first feat celebrated by the international science community.\nChina is the only country to have landed on the far side of the moon, having also done so before in 2019.\nThe Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA) described the mission's landing and lift-off as an ''unprecedented feat in human lunar exploration''. \nThe far side of the Moon - which faces away from Earth - is technically challenging to reach due to its distance, and its difficult terrain of giant, deep craters and few flat surfaces.\nSpace officials have had to use a satellite to direct and maintain communications with the Chang'e-6 craft.\nChina aims to be the first country to bring back rock and soil samples from the far side of the Moon, which scientists say could be very different from rock formations on the near side.\nState media published videos from China's space agency showing the Chang'e-6 craft sticking out a little arm and waving the Chinese flag after it collected the precious samples. \nIt is China's sixth mission to the Moon, named after the moon goddess Chang'e in Chinese mythology.\nThe CNSA announced the sampling's conclusion on Tuesday saying the craft had \"withstood the test of high temperature on the far side of the Moon\" and was now beginning its return.\nIts ascender module successfully \"lifted off from the lunar surface\" on Tuesday with samples in a metal vacuum container.\nAfter taking off, the module then entered a \"pre-set orbit around the Moon\". The container will be transferred to a re-entry capsule set to return to Earth, landing in the deserts of Inner Mongolia around 25 June.\nChang'e-6 had spent two days gathering rocks and soil - using a mechanical arm and drill to collect about 2kg (4.4lb) of material.\nIt has been based in the South Pole-Aitken basin - a gigantic crater on the Moon's far side which is one of the largest known in the Solar System.\nDirecting the craft there had been fraught with risks because it is very difficult to communicate with spacecraft once they reach the far side of the Moon. \nChina's space authorities described the operation as involving \"many engineering innovations, high risks and great difficulty\".\nScientists are excited about the samples which could potentially be from some of the Moon's oldest rocks.\nThose in China will be given the first chance to analyse the rocks, and later researchers around the world will be able to apply for the opportunity too.\n\"Everyone is very excited that we might get a look at these rocks no-one has ever seen before,\" Prof John Pernet-Fisher, a lunar geology specialist at the University of Manchester told the BBC last week.\nHe said the chance to analyse rock from a completely different area of the Moon could answer fundamental questions about how planets form.\nThe Moon's South Pole is the next frontier in lunar missions - countries are keen to understand the region because there is a good chance it has ice.\nAccess to water would significantly boost the chances of successfully establishing a human base on the Moon for scientific research.\nThis is China's second mission to collect samples from the Moon - but it is the first aimed at extracting them from the far side.\nIn 2020, its Chang'e-5 craft brought back 1.7kg of material from an area called Oceanus Procellarum on the Moon's near side.\nAnd the year prior, China became the first country to reach the far side of the Moon with the landing of its Chang'e-4.\nChina is planning three more uncrewed missions this decade as it looks for water on the Moon and investigates setting up a permanent base there. The country already has its own space station known as Tiangong, or Heavenly Palace.\nBeijing's broader strategy aims to see a Chinese astronaut walk on the Moon by around 2030.\nThe US also aims to put astronauts back on the Moon, with Nasa planning to launch its Artemis-3 mission in 2026.",

They quickly performed CPR on her. \nMs Glantz was quickly taken to hospital, but officials said that she was later declared dead - for a second time - soon after.\nPolice are now investigating the incident, but they said there is no evidence of criminal intent by the nursing home.\n\"This is a very unusual case,\" Chief Deputy Ben Houchin from the Lancaster County Sheriff's Office said at a press briefing on Monday. \n\"Been doing this 31 years, and nothing like this has ever gotten to this point before.\"\nA coroner was not sent to the nursing home after it declared her dead because Ms Glantz had been placed in hospice care, and the circumstances did not fall within a coroner's remit, Mr Houchin told reporters. \nMs Glantz's death had been anticipated, he explained.\nAdditionally, \"a physician had seen her in the last seven days, and the physician was willing to sign the death certificate, and... there was nothing suspicious at the time of the death\".\nOn Tuesday at around 16:00 local time she was pronounced dead for a second time, Mr Houchin later told reporters. \nHe added that a post-mortem examination had been scheduled later on Tuesday, and that results could take up to 12 weeks.\n\u201cThe funeral home did absolutely nothing wrong,\u201d Mr Houchin added. \u201cThey are the ones who found that she was still alive.\u201d\nMr Houchin did not name the homes at the centre of the mishap, but the BBC has requested comment from a nursing home named by local media.\nThe BBC also contacted the funeral parlour named in local media - Butherus, Maser and Love Funeral Home - which said in a statement: \u201cWe are proud that our directors and staff handled the recent incident in the news appropriately and with upmost care.\u201d\nMs Glantz is not the only person to be pronounced dead only to reveal themselves as still being alive.\nIn June last year, 76-year-old Bella Montoya in Ecuador was declared dead following a suspected stroke, placed in a coffin and taken to a funeral parlour for a vigil ahead of her burial. Five hours later, she was found to be alive after the coffin was opened to change her clothes. She did, however, die days later.\nIn 2018, a South African woman who was initially declared dead following a road accident was discovered alive in a mortuary fridge.\nDr Stephen Hughes, a senior lecturer in medicine at Anglia Ruskin University's School of Medicine in Chelmsford, has said that such cases are rare, but that \"death is a process\".\n\"Sometimes somebody may look like they're dead but they're not quite dead,\" Dr Hughes told the BBC after the incident in Ecuador. \"Careful examination is necessary.\"\nDr Hughes added that doctors would often look for heart sounds or breathing effort for at least a minute before declaring someone dead, and that some drugs could also slow down body processes, giving someone the false appearance of having passed away.",
    "Donald Trump is heading towards an election rematch with Joe Biden in November, and this time he will do so as a convicted felon.\nThe 77-year-old is the first former president in US history to be criminally tried and convicted. He was found guilty of falsifying business records in relation to a hush-money payment to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels.\nHe faces three more criminal cases that have not been tried yet.\nTrump has also been embroiled in civil cases relating to, among other things, the business empire that made his name. There are crucial legal appeals playing out too, including one on whether he is immune from prosecution.\nIt's a complicated legal picture.\nHere, we'll focus on the four criminal cases and explain what could happen next and, crucially, what's at stake as he seeks to return to the White House.\nWhat's it about?\nA payment made to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election.\nMs Daniels was paid $130,000 (\u00a3103,000) to keep quiet about her claim that she had sex with Trump, which he denies.\nProviding so-called hush-money is not illegal. \nInstead, this case was more technical and centred on how Trump's former lawyer, who paid Ms Daniels, had his reimbursement recorded in Trump's accounts.\nThe former president was found guilty of falsifying his business records by saying the payment was for legal fees. Jurors listened to weeks of testimony and found him guilty under all 34 counts of fraud under campaign finance laws.\nTrump has said the case is politically motivated. \"This was a disgrace, this was a rigged trial,\" he told reporters after the verdict. \nWhen was the trial? \nThe first criminal trial of a US president began in mid-April and ended on 30 May.\nThe prosecution's key witness was ex-lawyer Michael Cohen, who testified that his former boss knew about the elaborate scheme to disguise the payment.\nIn days of heated cross-examination, Trump's lawyers sought to undermine Cohen and paint him as an unreliable witness and convicted liar.\nThe jurors deliberated over two days before returning a guilty verdict.\nCould Trump go to prison?\nEach of the charges carries a maximum of four years in prison, although a judge could sentence Trump to probation if he is convicted.\nLegal experts told the BBC they think it is unlikely Trump will be jailed and that a fine is the more likely outcome.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, used a rare strategy to bring felony charges rather than less serious misdemeanours.\nWhat's it about?\nWhether Trump illegally conspired to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden.\nFederal prosecutors allege he pressured officials to reverse the results, knowingly spread lies about election fraud and sought to exploit the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021 to delay the certification of Mr Biden's victory and stay in power.\nHe's been charged with four criminal counts, including conspiracy to defraud the US and conspiracy against the rights of citizens. \nSome had speculated he would be charged with insurrection, or aiding insurrection, but that is not one of the charges.\nHe has denied wrongdoing and claimed the Biden administration is behind the prosecution.\nWhen's the trial?\nIt has been postponed indefinitely while an appeal from Trump plays out.\nThe Supreme Court will rule on Trump's argument that a former president cannot be prosecuted like any other citizen. \nJustices heard the case on 25 April and will decide by June.\nThe challenge increases the chances that this trial may not happen before November's election.\nAnd if Trump were to win the vote, he could in theory pardon himself or order the charges to be dismissed.\nCould Trump go to prison?\nPenalties for the charges include:\nBut there are logistical, security and political questions around whether Trump would actually serve time in jail even if convicted.\nA conviction at trial would take the US into uncharted territory.\nWhat's it about?\nTrump and some 18 other defendants are accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his very narrow defeat in the state of Georgia in the 2020 election.\nThe racketeering investigation, led by Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis, was sparked in part by a leaked phone call in which the former president asked the state's top election official to \"find 11,780 votes\".\nTrump was hit with 13 criminal counts, subsequently reduced to 10. They include one alleged violation of Georgia's Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico). \nThe former president has pleaded not guilty.\nWhen's the trial?\nA date has not been set. The timeline has been complicated by an effort by Trump and his allies to disqualify Ms Willis because of her romantic relationship with a man she hired to work on the case.\nAn appeals court has tentatively set a date of 4 October to hear oral arguments in the bid to have Ms Willis removed.\nCould Trump go to prison?\nThe racketeering charge carries a maximum 20-year jail sentence.\nGeorgia prosecutors would need to prove that there was ",
    "A man who made tens of thousands of pounds selling illegally modified TV Firesticks on Facebook has been sentenced after police raided his home.\nKevin O'Donnell, 41, sold the devices online, made deliveries and also ran annual subscriptions, giving cheap access to hundreds of channels including movies, Sky Sports and other Premier League football coverage.\nHe had profited by more than \u00a3130,000 before he was caught following an investigation, Liverpool Crown Court heard.\nO'Donnell, of Altcross Road, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to two copyright and fraud charges and was handed a two-year suspended sentence.\nIt followed a joint investigation in July 2022 by the Federation Against Copyright Theft (Fact) and Merseyside Police's cyber crime unit.\nFor a fee of between \u00a340 and \u00a385, O'Donnell's customers were provided with fully loaded Firesticks which gave 12-month access to sports, television channels, and movie content, bypassing legitimate providers. \nThe investigation began after Fact uncovered O\u2019Donnell's operation on Facebook under the alias Kevo James, with his account boasting more than 3,600 members.\nO\u2019Donnell facilitated transactions through Facebook direct messaging and WhatsApp and provided delivery services by post or in person, the court heard. \nHe was arrested at his home on 4 July 2023 and devices including computers, laptops, mobile phones and modified Firesticks were seized.\nKieron Sharp, chief executive officer of Fact, said: \"The message is very clear - if you sell a device that provides access to content that is not licensed to you or owned by you, you could face criminal investigation, prosecution and a conviction.\"\nDet Insp Steve Frame said O'Donnell made money over a period of several years.\nHe said: \"Illegal streaming is far from a victimless crime, and as well as the impact it has on businesses and content creators, it essentially means that legitimate subscribers pay for those who illegally access such services. \n\"Illegal streams also increase the risk of users receiving malware.\"\nO'Donnell also received a 25 day rehabilitation activity and was ordered to complete 150 hours unpaid work. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Indian PM Narendra Modi has won a third consecutive term in a much tighter general election than anticipated.\nHis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks set to fall short of a majority and is leading in the 543-seat parliament, below the required 272 seats. However its coalition partners have gained additional seats. \nThe results are a personal blow to Mr Modi, who has always secured majorities in elections as both chief minister of Gujarat state and India\u2019s prime minister, and dominated the country's politics for a decade.\nThe verdict marks a surprising revival for the Congress Party-led INDIA opposition alliance, defying earlier predictions of its decline, and sharply diverging from both exit polls and pre-election surveys.\nMore than 640 million people voted in a marathon seven-week election, hailed as a \"world record\" by election authorities. Nearly half of the voters were women.\nMany world leaders have crawled across the finishing line in their third term elections and Mr Modi is no exception. The BJP remains India\u2019s single largest party by seats, and if Mr Modi secures a third term with his allies, the prime minister matches the record of Jawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first premier.\nBut the significant loss of seats for his party - more than 50 - dims the allure of a third term, especially given Mr Modi's campaign targeting 400 coalition seats, making anything less seem like an under-achievement.\nThis has led to jubilation in the Congress camp and some despair in BJP quarters. Despite the BJP emerging as the single largest party, the burden of hype and expectations has left many of their supporters disheartened.\nMr Modi's supporters believe securing a third term can be attributed to several factors: a record of stable governance, the appeal of continuity, efficient welfare programmes, and the perception that he has enhanced India's global image.\nTo his Hindu nationalist base, Mr Modi delivered on key manifesto promises: revoking the autonomy of Indian-administered Kashmir, building the Ram temple in Ayodhya and implementing a controversial citizenship law. Many BJP-ruled states have implemented laws tightening regulations on interfaith marriages.\nThe BJP's significant drop in seats may be linked to joblessness, rising prices, growing inequality and a controversial army recruitment reform, among other things. Mr Modi's harsh and divisive campaign, particularly targeting Muslims, could also have alienated voters in some regions.\nHis ambitious slogan \"Ab ki baar, 400 paar,\" aiming for more than 400 seats for his NDA alliance, may have backfired, with such a massive majority raising fears of constitutional changes among the poor.\nMr Modi\u2019s party faced its largest setback in Uttar Pradesh (UP), a state larger than the United Kingdom and three times as populous. With 80 parliamentary seats, UP holds significant sway in national politics - many consider it the gateway to Delhi. Both Mr Modi and Rahul Gandhi hold seats there.\n\n\nSo what are the main takeaways of this election?\n\nA dent of Brand Modi\nMr Modi\u2019s popularity has been also attributed to his mastery of branding, transforming routine events into spectacles and astute messaging. A weak opposition and a largely friendly media also helped him build his brand.\nThe election results show that Brand Modi has lost some of its shine, indicating that even Mr Modi is susceptible to anti-incumbency. In other words, he is not as invincible as many of his supporters believed. This offers renewed hope to the opposition.\nA return to coalition politics\nIndia has a history of chaotic coalition governments, although some in the early 1990s and 2000s played a significant role in implementing economic reforms.\nIf the BJP forms the government, it will be dependent on allies and will need to adopt a more consultative and deliberative approach.\nThis dependency makes it vulnerable to collapse if allies feel neglected. The party, once perceived as all-powerful, is now reliant on allies, unlike in 2014 and 2019.\n\n\nA jolt to the dominant BJP\nMr Modi's uninterrupted decade-long reign at the top has underscored India's embrace of what some political scientists term the one-party dominant system. \nThis has five key traits: a charismatic leader, unrivaled control over resources and communication, unmatched organisational machinery, and an opposition in disarray. Shrinking freedoms also characterise a one-party dominant system.\nMr Modi\u2019s BJP is not the first party to dominate Indian politics. For many years after Independence the Congress ruled without a break. Tuesday\u2019s result has restored India to what many consider \"normal politics\", with a range of parties sharing and competing for power. \nA resurgent opposition\nThe results will energise the much-criticised Congress-led opposition. \nIn February, the diverse coalition known as INDIA, short for Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, faced turmoil when one of its key leaders, Nitish Kumar, exited - only to later rejoin the BJP.\nBut",
    "Flood waters are continuing to rise in parts of southern Germany, and are now spreading down the Danube to Austria and Hungary.\nFive people are now known to have died since heavy rain led to rivers bursting their banks in Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\nOne of the victims was a woman who died when her car left the road and became submerged west of Munich. A Bavarian firefighter is missing.\nAlthough the Germand DWD weather service has declared an end to the torrential rain that has hit southern Germany for days, water levels in the historic city of Passau, where three rivers meet, have now risen close to 10m (32ft), the highest for more than a decade. \nRiver levels on the Danube have also been rising in Austria and Hungary. \nThe Danube burst its banks in Austria's third-largest city Linz leaving areas close to the river banks submerged.\nLocal resident Gertrude told the Kurier website that the flooding brought back bad memories from August 2002 when a fifth of the city was left underwater. \nThe river reached 6.86m on Tuesday morning and was expected to peak during the afternoon. \nAll river traffic along the Danube was brought to a standstill in the Lower Austria area. \nIn Hungary, forecasters warned of significant rainfall in the coming three days and Gabriella Siklos of the National Water Directorate warned the situation was changing by the hour.\nThere were also concerns that the rising water levels would spread to the Danube floodplain in Slovakia.\nCargo shipping remains halted on the Rhine in some areas of southern Germany, although authorities in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in the south west say water levels are set to fall in the coming days.\nTorrential rain has fallen for days in much of southern Germany and a state of emergency has been declared in the Rosenheim area of Bavaria. \nThree people have now died in Bavaria, and a man and a woman were found dead in their basement in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg on Monday. A 22-year-old firefighter is missing in Bavaria.\nBavarian state premier Markus S\u00f6der has described the situation as \"serious and critical\".\nIn some areas of southern Germany, experts spoke of once-in-a-century levels of rainfall.\nCars were swept away and residential areas were flooded, although by Tuesday morning all severe weather warnings in southern Germany were lifted.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said that the flooding in the south is a reminder that \"halting man-made climate change\" cannot be neglected.",
    "More than 34 million Americans are preparing for extreme temperatures, as a heat dome descends on the western part of the US this week. \nForecasters are warning residents in California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona to prepare for temperatures to reach around 40C (104F) before Friday. \nLater in the week, extreme temperatures are expected to reach parts of the Pacific Northwest. \nSimilar temperatures last year killed at least a dozen people in the American Southwest. The US Border Patrol in Texas says four migrants attempting to enter the US died over the weekend died due to heat-related illnesses.\nForecasts show temperatures could reach 42.2C (108F) across a wide swathe of California, from Sacramento to Bakersfield. \nSacramento surpassed 38C (100F) on Tuesday. Last year, California's capital city did not get that hot until the end of June. \nOn Wednesday that warning will expand further east from Las Vegas to the Lake Havasu City, Arizona, region. \nSome areas of south Texas saw temperatures reach 47.2C (117F) Tuesday. \nThursday is expected to be the worst day this week for excessive heat. \nForecasters expect temperatures to be 5.5-11C (10-20F) above normal. \nPhoenix, Las Vegas, Albuquerque and Fresno could see previous records for high temperatures squashed. \nResidents facing the heatwave have been advised to drink extra fluids, stay inside in air-conditioned rooms out of the sun and wear loose-fitting clothing. \n\"Heat stroke can be DEADLY,\" the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Phoenix cautioned in a post on Tuesday evening.\nCalifornia's Environmental Protection Agency added in an alert that outdoor workers, the elderly and children were particularly vulnerable to extreme heat, which \"is an invisible but dangerous consequence of climate change\".\nFirefighters across the region are also anxiously watching to see if the heat causes any wildfires to break out. \nThe Corral fire, which broke out on Saturday about 60 miles (95km) east of San Francisco - and briefly threatened a weapons-testing facility - is now mostly contained. \nBut there is concern the temperatures could cause the fires to flare up again in the coming days.\nResidents in the California Bay Area who may have hoped to escape the heat by visiting local beaches have been warned that a north-west ocean swell is expected to bring 15-20ft (4.6-6m) waves to the coast. \nInexperienced swimmers were advised to stay out of the water and beach-goers to be on the lookout for waves that can suddenly pull people into the ocean. \nThis new heatwave follows last year's sweltering summer, during which Phoenix saw 31 consecutive days of temperatures at 43.3C (110F).\nThis week's high temperatures are the result of a heat dome. \nAn area of high pressure pushes air towards the ground, trapping it and causing it to heat up. As a result, temperatures can rise and linger. \nThe pressure also prevents other weather systems that might cool down an area -  such as rain clouds - from forming. \nA heat dome that struck the south-western US last July was described by the NWS as \"one of the strongest\" of its kind to hit the region. \nA 2023 June heat dome that struck Louisiana and Texas killed 12 people and sent hundreds to hospital for heat-related health issues. \nWhile heat domes were once described as rare, heatwaves and heat domes are becoming more common and intense because of human-induced climate change, scientists say.

    "After Israeli forces pulled out of Gaza City\u2019s vast al-Shifa hospital complex on 1 April, following their second raid there, stunned Palestinians who pored over the burnt-out ruins said it reeked of death.\nDuring the past eight months of war, hospitals have come under repeated attack, with Israel claiming they are used as bases by Hamas; something the group denies. \nBut events at al-Shifa \u2013 once the biggest and best equipped medical facility in the Gaza Strip \u2013 have arguably been the most dramatic.\nThe two-week surprise raid, launched after Israel said Hamas had regrouped at the site, was described by the Israeli government as \"precise and surgical\".\nIts spokesman, Avi Hyman, asserted that it had set \"the gold standard of urban warfare\". He said: \u201cWe took out over 200 terrorists. We apprehended over 900 terrorists with not a single civilian casualty.\u201d\nWith decaying bodies sticking out of the sand piled up by combat bulldozers in the courtyards of al-Shifa, the claim that there had been no civilian casualties was immediately questioned.\nIn recent weeks, four mass graves have been uncovered at the site, with Palestinian search teams saying that several hundred bodies have been found. \nWe have worked with a journalist in Gaza to follow developments.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve extracted martyrs, many of whom are decomposed and completely unidentifiable,\u201d a Palestinian Civil Defence worker, Rami Dababesh told us grimly on 8 May as he stood by a line of white plastic body bags at al-Shifa, wearing a face mask and full protective gear.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found corpses of women, children and individuals without heads as well as torn body parts,\u201d he added.\nThe Civil Defence lacks forensic equipment and expertise, but its teams have been using photos and videos to document the remains. A director, Dr Mohamed Mughir, told us there were suspicious finds; describing how \u201csigns of field executions, binding marks, gunshot wounds to the head and torture marks on the limbs were observed on the bodies of some martyrs\".\nThe UN Security Council has expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d at the discovery of mass graves at both al-Shifa and Nasser hospital in southern Gaza. Along with the US and the European Union, it has called for an independent investigation into possible war crimes.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says that during its raids of the Gaza hospitals, its soldiers exhumed bodies that Palestinians had buried earlier as part of its search for the remains of some 250 hostages captured during the deadly Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October. \nIt maintains bodies were examined respectfully and those not belonging to Israeli captives were returned to their place. \nHowever, at least some of the corpses found recently at al-Shifa were those of patients who died during Israel\u2019s latest military action. A paramedic involved in the search said some had IV catheters still attached.\nOn 15 April, the BBC met two men whose dead mothers were last seen being treated at the hospital. Their bodies had just been recovered from a mass grave.\n\u201cI came running here when they told me of the grave,\u201d said Mohammed al-Khatib, who had spent days searching for his mother, Khawla. \u201cBy the grace of almighty God her body was found.\u201d\nWalid Fteima said his elderly mother, Lina Abu Leila, was being treated for malnutrition and severe dehydration when she died. Her body was decomposed, and he could only identify her from injuries she had from an Israeli bombing last year. \u201c[She] had a toe amputated on each foot,\u201d he explained.\nAfter it began its operation at the hospital early on 18 March, the IDF ordered thousands of civilians sheltering there and living in the vicinity to leave and head south. However, it said the hospital could continue to function. By the end of two weeks, only some 140 patients and medics reportedly remained.\nThe local WHO representative, Dr Rik Peeperkorn, says this group endured \u201chorrific conditions\u201d. After being repeatedly moved around the complex, he says, they \u201cactually ended up in the human resources building which was completely unfit for treatment\". Ultimately, he says, 20 patients died.\nSeveral surviving patients \u2013 all wounded in previous Israeli strikes \u2013 told us they were given only tiny quantities of food such as canned tuna. They said there were severe shortages of drinking water and medication.\n\u201cThe bombing surrounded us 24/7,\u201d said Mohamed al-Nadeem who is half paralysed. \u201cI am sick and unable to move. I was sleeping on the floor without blankets.\u201d \n\u201cThere were no dressings or painkillers,\u201d said Rafif Doghmush, 15, whose foot has been amputated.\nThe IDF has told journalists that no staff or patients died as a \u201cdirect result\u201d of its action, but that some may have died of \u201cnatural causes\". \nDuring its raid, it said it helped patients by moving them out of harm\u2019s way and that medical supplies and devices as well as food, water, and a generator were brought to the hospital.\nGrainy drone footage shared by the IDF after it launched its raid on 18 March showed Palest",

    "It was better late than never for spoon-bending performer Uri Geller.\nThe self-proclaimed psychic recently made a nearly five decades old discovery when rummaging through some cardboard boxes in his storage unit in Israel. \nHe found a book - about himself - that he had checked out of the Los Angeles Public Library 47 years prior.\nMr Geller borrowed The Geller Papers in January 1977. \n\"I slash open the tape and I start pulling out the books and lo-and-behold the yellow paper is in front of my eyes,\" he told BBC News.  \nThe showman, now in his 70s, said that he left Israel in 1972 for the United States to participate in several CIA-conducted experiments looking into his purported psychic powers.  \nA group of scientists further investigated Mr Geller, leading to publication of The Geller Papers in 1976.\nIt includes a collection of scientific papers that detail the investigations and experiments conducted on him when he was in the US.\nThe book, like Mr Geller, is well-travelled. \nHe unknowingly brought it with him from California to New York to Connecticut, back to New York, then to London and Massachusetts and finally to Israel.\nMr Geller checked the book out of an LA public library branch when he was in the city spending time with his friend, New Age writer Carlos Castaneda. \nHe was telling Mr Castaneda about the book but didn't have a copy at hand, so opted to check it out from the Cahuenga branch of the library instead. \nHe ended up bringing it back to New York with him and \"totally forgot about it\".\nHe found it while rummaging through some storage containers in search of the lids to two Ming Dynasty vases. \nA self-proclaimed hoarder, Mr Geller said he was \"elated\" when he found the book. \n\"When I saw it, the first thing that came to my mind was: 'Wow, I've gone through so much in my life,'\" he said.  \nHe also wanted to return it. \nLuckily, Mr Geller's daughter, Natalie Geller Kaldes, lives near LA with her family.\nMr Geller shipped the book to her and she took charge.\nFearing a hefty fine for the overdue book, Ms Kaldes was surprised to learn there would be no consequences. \nThe LA public library no longer charges late fines, according to public relations representative Monica Valencia. \nMs Valencia said The Geller Papers was added to the library's Cahuenga branch in 1977 but at some point was withdrawn and is no longer available there - though it remains part of the library system's wider collection.\nStill, \"it truly was a delight to have this particular work brought back by Uri Geller's daughter\", she said.\nBecause the book has been withdrawn from the branch, Ms Kaldes was able to keep her copy. \n\"It kind of makes it even more special that we get to keep it now,\" she told BBC.",
    "Grammy award-winning producer and songwriter The-Dream has been accused of rape and sexual battery, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles\nThe 47-year-old, born Terius Gesteelde-Diamant, was named as the defendant in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Chanaaz Mangroe, who performed as Channii Monroe.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Ms Mangroe says Mr Gesteelde-Diamant repeatedly forced her to have sex, throttled her and on one occasion filmed an intimate encounter and then threatened to show it to other people.\nMr Gesteelde-Diamant, who has written songs for Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, Justin Bieber and Mariah Carey, has denied the allegations.\nAccording to the 60-page lawsuit, seen by the BBC, Ms Mangroe is seeking damages for \"lost wages\" and for \"mental pain and anguish and severe emotional distress\".\nMs Mangroe, originally from the Netherlands and who worked in the US hoping to break through as a singer and songwriter, says in the lawsuit she first met Mr Gesteelde-Diamant in January 2015. \nThe 33-year-old alleges he \u201csubjected\u201d her to \u201cviolent sexual encounters\" that left her bruised; forced her into drinking \u201cexcessive amounts of alcohol\u201d; strangled her to the point she \"almost lost consciousness\u201d; forced her into sexual acts in a movie theatre and raped her in a renovated sprinter van.\nShe also says he \u201ctold her that he would make her the next Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna\u201d.\nWithin days of that initial meeting, Ms Mangroe claims Mr Gesteelde-Diamant had begun pressuring her for sex, telling her it was \u201cpart of the process\u201d, the lawsuit claims. \nThe 33-year-old says he locked her in a dark room and \u201cwould only stop aggressively having sex with her once she said that she loved him\u201d.\nMs Mangroe alleges in the lawsuit that unwanted sexual encounters continued, while Mr Gesteelde-Diamant made her promises such as suggesting he could arrange for her to be the opening act of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s next tour, and Grammys.\nIn a statement given to the BBC by her legal team, Ms Mangroe said choosing to speak \"has been one of the most difficult decisions of my life\".\n\"But ultimately, what Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter.  \n\"Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal.  \n\"I hope that doing so will also help others and prevent future horrific abuse.\u201d\nMr Gesteelde-Diamant has won eight Grammy Awards and was nominated for the newly created category of Songwriter of the Year at the 65th Grammy Awards in February 2023.\nIn a statement supplied by a representative of Mr Gesteelde-Diamant to the New York Times, he said the claims are \"untrue and defamatory\".\n\"I oppose all forms of harassment and have always strived to help people realize their career goals,\" the statement said.\n\"As someone committed to making a positive impact on my fellow artists and the world at large, I am deeply offended and saddened by these accusations.\u201d",
    "One of the last surviving veterans of the D-Day landings has been recalling the sacrifices of those involved in the largest air and sea invasion in history. \nJim Glennie was an 18-year-old soldier when he took part in Operation Overlord on 6 June 1944  to liberate Europe from Hitler's Nazi regime.  \nThe veteran from Aberdeenshire said he put his survival to the age of 98 down to \"sheer luck\". \nA series of commemorations are taking place this week to mark the 80th anniversary of the invasion. \nMr Glennie told BBC Scotland how he saw the body of a fallen soldier as he entered the water from a landing craft, but knew he had to carry on.\nA week later he was injured and captured, eventually arriving in a prisoner of war camp on what was his 19th birthday. He will be 99 in August.\nWhen he was called up, Pte Glennie began his military service at the Bridge of Don Barracks in Aberdeen.\nWhen Allied forces began landing on the beaches of Northern France on 6 June 1944, Pte Glennie, from Turriff, was with the Gordon Highlanders.\n\"I remember getting into the water, my two mates couldn't swim, they stuck to me like glue,\" he said.\n\"This body came up with the waves. I just carried on. You had to carry on, and that's what I did.\"\nAmid heavy German resistance, Mr Glennie and comrades managed to advance inland.\nEventually he was shot in the arm, and was taken prisoner.\nHe ended up at Stalag IV-B - one of Germany's largest prisoner of war camps - on what was his 19th birthday.\nHe said food was \"scarce\" and that they were always hungry.\nAsked what his secret to long life was, he said: \"Just lucky I think.\n\"I feel I was a very lucky loon (boy), I was only 18.\"\nHe was asked how he remembers D-Day.\n\"I was just a soldier, he said. \"It was an experience.\"\nHe was filling bomb holes as part of his prisoner duties when his German captors vanished in early 1945.\nThe camp was liberated, and he made his way to American forces before being taken home to his relieved family.\nOnce Europe was liberated, he was due to deploy to Japan but the war ended before he was sent.\nHe later married and had two children.\nHe hopes future generations will remember the sacrifices which were made in the war. \n\"This day I'll never forget,\" he said.",
    "Hidden among thick bushland in the outer suburbs of southern Sydney sits an expansive facility housing a technological breakthrough.\nIt\u2019s here that Australian company SunDrive Solar makes its \u201cspecial sauce\u201d: a new - top secret - formula that it says has solved \u201ca very high value problem\u201d.\nIts big innovation? Finding a way to replace the silver used in solar cells with copper, which was previously thought impossible.\n\u201cSilver is expensive, scarce and environmentally disastrous, and it limits how much solar can be rolled out around the world,\u201d explains chief commercial officer Maia Schweizer.\n\u201cCopper is also highly in demand, but it's 1,000 times more abundant, and 100 times lower cost.\u201d\nThe start-up is one of the beneficiaries of the government\u2019s Future Made in Australia plan - a suite of policies that aim to turn the country into a \u201crenewable energy superpower\u201d by investing in homegrown green industries.\nBut some experts question whether the $A22.7bn ($15bn; \u00a311.8bn) package, which comprises tax incentives, loans, and kick-starter grants - is enough to meet those lofty ambitions.\nAnd climate scientists say that if Australia wants to be a major player in the net zero transition, it needs to stop peddling fossil fuels.\nAustralia\u2019s economy has long been powered by its natural resources, such as coal, gas and iron ore.\nBut its critical minerals - many of which underpin crucial low emissions technologies - are exported raw, and refined abroad, predominantly by China.\nIt\u2019s a dig-and-ship model of trade that has earned Australia a reputation as the world\u2019s quarry, and seen it lose out on a significant chunk of change further up the supply chain.\nLithium - which is used in the batteries that store renewable energy and power electric vehicles - is one example.\nDespite being responsible for more than half of the world\u2019s supply, Australia captures just 0.5% of the global $57bn lithium battery market, according to the country\u2019s national science agency.\nThe Future Made in Australia policy - which was formally announced in April - seeks to change that, by offering tax breaks and loans to companies seeking to process critical minerals at home.\nDoing so, the government argues, is a national security priority, as countries examine their trade dependence on Beijing, and look to insulate themselves against supply chain shocks.\n\u201cThis is not old-fashioned protectionism or isolationism \u2013 it is the new competition,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, when announcing the plan.\n\u201cWe need to aim high, be bold, and build big, to match the size of the opportunity in front of us.\u201d\nQueensland-based Alpha HPA is one of the companies the government has tapped to execute its vision.\nLike SunDrive, it views itself as a disruptor, due to its ability to create ultra-high purity aluminium products - used in things like semiconductors and iPhones - with a lower carbon footprint than overseas competitors.\nThanks to a A$400m federal loan, it is building one of the world\u2019s largest alumina refineries near the coastal city of Gladstone, which it says will create hundreds of local jobs.\nIt\u2019s a huge source of pride, given that there is still scepticism over whether Australia can make things, after decades of outsourcing its manufacturing to China, Alpha HPA\u2019s chief operating officer Rob Williamson says.\n\u201cAnybody that puts forward the case that we don't have people in this country to do [this work] is just not trying,\" he adds.\nSunDrive is on a similar journey.\nWithout government support, Ms Schweizer says, the company might have moved offshore.\nInstead, it's looking to transform one of the country\u2019s oldest coal power stations into a massive solar panel manufacturing hub.\nCurrently, one in three Australian households have solar panels, the highest rate in the world, and yet only 1% are made locally - with China responsible for more than 80% of global production.\n\u201cEvery single mineral that you need to make a solar panel, we've got one of the top three reserves in the world,\u201d Ms Schweizer explains.\n\u201cNow there's the possibility of the end-to-end value chain coming onshore in Australia for the first time, which is super, super exciting.\u201d\nThe Made in Australia pledge has won the support of the country\u2019s biggest renewable energy industry trade bodies, who say the investments could be \u201cgame changing\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big opportunity for us to be an exporter of climate solutions to the world instead of climate problems,\u201d John Grimes, who heads the Smart Energy Council, says.\nBut some climate experts warn it is being \u201cseverely undermined\u201d by the government\u2019s recent decision to champion gas until 2050 and beyond despite global calls to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sending a really mixed message to investors,\u201d says Polly Hemming, the director of the Australia Institute\u2019s climate and energy programme.\n\u201cThis government has continued to approve new gas and coal projects - it's flown to Japan, India, Korea, and Vietnam to secure long-term markets for gas and coal",
    "Instagram is testing adverts that users cannot skip past.\nThe social media platform currently allows people to swipe or scroll past adverts that appear in its main feed of images and videos, as well as in its Stories and Reels feeds.\nBut it is now trialling a feature called \"ad break\", which users say they can not flick past as usual.\nImages shared online show a timer, which counts down to zero before normal functionality can resume.\n\"Sometimes you may need to view an ad before you can keep browsing,\" the Meta-owned platform tells those who click for more information.\nInstagram has confirmed to the BBC that a trial is under way.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always testing formats that can drive value for advertisers,\" it said in a statement, adding that it would provide further updates if the test resulted in permanent format changes.\nIn a subsequent statement, Meta said it was \"always experimenting with new products and ad solutions in line with the evolving consumer trends and business needs.\"\nIt remains to be seen if the trial pleases advertisers - but it certainly does not appear to have gone down well with users.\nOne person on Threads called the move \"bonkers\" - adding that it \"seems like an aggressively pushy move to earn more ad dollars for Meta\".\nOthers have raised the prospect of boycotting the platform.\n\"We will simply not be scrolling,\" said one X (formerly Twitter) user.\nMeta is not the first big tech firm to force people to watch adverts.\nYouTube is known for showing non-skippable ads to users watching videos on its platform or TV app who do not pay for its ad-free premium tier.\nAdvertisers can target YouTube viewers with 15 to 30 second-long, non-skippable promotional videos that appear before, during or after other videos if they want people to view their entire message.\nThey can also advertise using similarly non-skippable \"bumper ads\" - shorter videos of up to six seconds long - on YouTube videos.\nSome users have responded by turning to ad blocking tools and browser extensions as a way around adverts that interrupt videos on the platform.\nGoogle, YouTube's parent company, is in turn trying to clamp down on ad blockers.\nHowever it is not clear that forcing users to watch more ads actually helps companies' bottom lines.\nA study carried out by TikTok, published in January, suggested forcing viewers to watch adverts might actually lead to less engagement.\nMore than 70% of its participants said they were more likely to engage with the experience of an advert if there was an option to skip it.",
    "Wales has been named the second best country in the world for recycling and is within touching distance of the top spot, new analysis shows.\nWales is listed just behind Austria in the global rankings, with both countries managing to recycle 59% of their waste.\nNorthern Ireland is ranked ninth, England 11th and Scotland 15th among the 48 countries included in the comparison.\nFirst Minister Vaughan Gething said the \"fantastic news\" was thanks to the efforts of \"householders and workplaces across Wales\".\nWales has put a particular focus on improving recycling rates in recent decades - with statutory targets for local councils and all homes asked to separate out their food waste among a number of initiatives.\nSome councils have moved to only picking up general waste at the kerbside once a month, with Denbighshire being the latest - introducing four weekly collections for black bags in June.\nIn Denbigh, Catrin Juckes-Hughes, 32, said she had tried to make recycling part of her family's \"everyday routine\".\n\"If people are recycling properly you don't notice the difference (with the bin collections),\" she said.\n\"The general waste you have is actually just a small amount.\"\nBut Wendy Davies, 78 said the situation was a struggle for older people.\n\"How can they cope having to split everything in their kitchen?\" she said.\n\"If you live in a flat like I do it's a complete mess trying to keep everything to put in the bins outside\".\nThe Welsh government puts the average recycling rate in Wales at 66% - this is based on municipal waste collected by local authorities from households and some businesses.\nIt varies from 59% in Torfaen to 72% in Pembrokeshire and Swansea.\nTo compile a global league table, researchers used a country's reported recycling rate and other waste data to try and rank different nations' efforts on a like-for-like basis.\nThe report, by Eunomia Research and Consulting and Reloop, examined the performance of 48 countries, including the world's largest economies.\nEnvironmental consultant Rebecca Colley-Jones, said Wales had been on a \"journey\" with recycling, ever since control over waste management was devolved to what is now the Welsh Parliament.\n\"If you look at 1997 (the rate) was around 9% - now some councils have reached 70%,\" she said.\nShe believes that a series of strategies, with accompanying targets and funding, is responsible for the success.\n\"There's been the funding, there's been the will there, everybody's been on board - local companies have adapted, to be able to provide the collection infrastructure,\" she said.\nAWD Ltd in Port Talbot - run by former rugby player and coach Alun Wyn Davies - receives hard plastic waste from 18 of the 22 Welsh local authorities and sells it on to be made into new products.\nThe company already employs 38 people to sort through the different grades of plastic, with another 22 due to start soon.\n\"The only snag is that a lot of it leaves Wales - it all stays in the UK but it goes over the bridge,\" Mr Davies said.\nLong term he hopes to be able to start using the waste material for manufacturing himself, but said companies like his needed support to innovate.\nOn the latest recycling figures, Mr Davies joked that it was nice to see Wales at the top because \"we're not doing very well at the rugby at the minute are we?\".\nThe Welsh government is aiming for Wales to be recycling, reusing or composting 70% of its waste by 2025 and be a \"zero waste nation\" by 2050.\nLatest statistics suggest that of the 155kg of household waste each person in Wales sends to landfill annually, most of it could be recycled.\nLike the rest of the UK, Wales intends to introduce the collection of soft or stretchy plastic - things like crisp packets and salad bags - from households by March 2027.\nMeanwhile, a stricter recycling regime for businesses was introduced in April - forcing them to separate their waste and leading to concerns over the cost implications from some.\nClimate change secretary Huw Irranca-Davies said that as well as improving the environment, recycling offered \"important benefits to the economy\".\n\u201cI often talk about a Welsh way of doing things and the team effort which had led to today\u2019s achievement is one we should all be rightly proud of \u2013 da iawn Cymru!\" he said.\nPlaid Cymru\u2019s climate change spokesperson, Delyth Jewell MS, said Wales had set \"an example to the rest of the UK\".\n\u201cWe cannot rest on our laurels with this \u2013 and the recent push-back that there\u2019s been to the recycling rules for businesses show how important it is that adequate support is given to make doing the right thing, the easy thing too,\" she said.\n\u201cWales must now aim for the top place in these global rankings.\u201d\nThe Welsh Conservatives' climate change spokesperson Janet Finch-Saunders MS said that while she was pleased by the news, recycling rules were \"extremely confusing and chaotic\".\n\u201cBusinesses with outdoor space are seeing large areas filled up with numerous different bins, and no consideration has been g",
    "Kanye West is being sued for sexual harassment, breach of contract and wrongful termination by a woman who worked as his assistant for two years.\nIn a lawsuit, Lauren Pisciotta alleges the star sent her lewd texts and performed sex acts while on the phone with her, according to US media.\nShe claims she was fired in 2022, but that a $3 million (\u00a32.4 million) severance package was never paid.\nThe BBC has contacted West's lawyer for a response to her allegations, but has yet to receive a reply.\nThe lawsuit was first reported in the US by TMZ, and later confirmed by Rolling Stone, The Wrap and US Weekly, which says court papers were filed on Monday in the US.\nThe BBC has so far been unable to verify the filing.\nAccording to the documents, Pisciotta was primarily supporting herself via an OnlyFans profile in 2021 when she met West. \nShe says he hired her to work on the first season of his Yeezy women\u2019s fashion line, and they ended up collaborating on three tracks from his Donda album (Pisciotta does not have any formal credits on the record, however).\nWest subsequently hired Pisciotta as his personal assistant, with an annual salary of $1 million (\u00a3780,000), on the condition that she was available \"24-7\". She says she agreed to the terms.\nAccording to her lawsuit, West was initially comfortable with her continuing her OnlyFans business. However, in 2022, he allegedly stated that he wanted Pisciotta to be \"God like\" and asked her to delete her account in exchange for a further $1 million.\nAfter she closed the account, she claims she was bombarded with explicit text messages from West, including pornographic videos.\nPisciotta also claims he masturbated while talking to her on the phone and that, on one occasion, he pleasured himself in front of her after \"trapping\" her in a private room on his plane.\nAround September 2022, she was promoted to Chief of Staff for his various companies, but was abruptly fired soon afterwards, her lawsuit claims. Her severance package was allegedly never paid.\nIn addition to sexual harassment, breach of contract, and wrongful termination, Pisciotta is also suing West and his Yeezy businesses for fraud, unpaid wages, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\nThis is not the first time the rapper has been accused of lewd behaviour.\nLast November, multiple employees of his Yeezy fashion line told Rolling Stone he had played pornographic films during staff meetings, and showed an intimate photograph of his then-wife Kim Kardashian in job interviews.\nWest has not responded to the allegations at the time, and has maintained his silence ever since.\nIn the past, the star has referred to a \u201cfull-on pornography addiction\u201d that \u201cdestroyed my family\u201d.\nHe once told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that it had played a major role in his life since childhood.\n\u201cFor me, Playboy was my gateway into full-on pornography addiction,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad had a Playboy left out at age five and it\u2019s affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life.\u201d\nThe star has already faced two other lawsuits this year.\nIn April, he was accused of racial discrimination and harassment by a former security guard at his now-closed school, the Donda Academy.\nBenjamin Deshon Provo claimed he had faced discrimination because he is Muslim and was ordered to cut his dreadlocks or be fired. \nWest has yet to respond to the allegations.\nIn February, the star was also sued by the estate of Donna Summer for using a sample of her song \u201cI Feel Love\u201d without permission. The case was later settled out of court.\nThe musician was one of the most successful and prolific rappers of the 2000s and 2010s, with multi-platinum hits like Gold Digger, Stronger and All Of The Lights.\nHowever, his recent career has been beset by controversies. Most notably, his lucrative contract with Adidas was terminated in November 2022 over antisemitic comments West made on social media.\nDespite that, the star returned to the top of the US charts earlier this year both with the hit single Carnival, and its parent album Vultures.",
    "Rising global conflict means countries will spend the next 10 years restocking arms, the boss of one of the UK\u2019s largest weapons manufacturers has said.\nChemring, which describes itself as a key supplier to Nato, said countries are reacting to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine as well as \u201can increasingly assertive China\u201d.\nThe firm wants sales, which are already hovering around record levels, to quadruple to nearly \u00a31bn by 2030.\n\u201cThe increase in geo-political tensions around the world is driving a fundamental rearmament upcycle which is expected to last for at least the next decade,\u201d said Chemring chief executive Michael Ord.\nThe company builds aerospace, defence and security technology for nations all over the world.

    "When Victoria Arthur's Child Benefit was not paid on Monday, her immediate concern was that she would not be able to afford nappies and milk for her four month-old daughter. \nLike many, the mum-of-three from Romford relies on the \u00a3238 she gets each month to pay for essentials for her kids. \nBut a payment processing error at HMRC has meant that almost 580,000 claimants did not receive their money as planned, sparking panic for many families. \nUnable to reach the tax agency and with nothing in her bank account, Victoria was forced to call the council to get a food bank voucher which she spent on formula, food and cereal. \n\"I couldn\u2019t believe it when I woke up on Monday,\" she told the BBC. \n\"There wasn't a penny [of Child Benefit] in my account and no explanation, no automated text message. \n\"I tried calling HMRC but they weren't accepting calls. It was so stressful. We were left in the dark.\"\nThe tax agency has apologised and said the missed sum will be paid on Wednesday. \nIt also said anyone who incurred a loss as a result of the glitch can apply for redress through its complaints system. \nBut there has been an outpouring of anger on social media. Some parents have said they were left unable to afford food or pay bills because of the error.\nHMRC has also been criticised over its communications after telling worried parents not to call its helplines on Monday and to check social media for updates instead. \nJohn Pain,  a single parent of three children - two of whom have special needs - only realised that his Child Benefit had not been paid when he got a notification from his bank saying that a direct debit had not gone through. \nInitially, he was confused. \nThen he panicked. \nThe 32-year-old relies on Child Benefit to pay for his daughter's ballet classes, food bills and days out with the kids. \n\"The last year as money\u2019s got tighter, I am using it more and more to pay certain bills too,\" John told the BBC.\nJohn was also unable to get answers from HMRC directly, much to his frustration. \n\"I had to find out what had happened on Facebook and they didn\u2019t say 'we are going to sort this out in the next couple of days', it was just 'keep checking social media\u2019. So I was worrying about it all day.\"\nLuckily he was given breathing space to pay the direct debit he missed on Monday, although he was fined for a late bill payment and will have to claim it back though HMRC's complaints process.\nPeople can claim Child Benefit if they are responsible for bringing up a child under 16, or under 20 if they are in approved education or training.\nOnly one parent gets the payment per child, and there is no limit to how many children you can claim for.\nThe benefit - which is usually paid every four weeks - is vital for many families on low incomes. Parents can claim \u00a325.60 a week for one child and \u00a316.95 for each subsequent child. \nMegan Dragon, 26, said she was \"shocked\" when her benefit did not arrive because it is usually \"really reliable\".\nThe mum-of-four from Northamptonshire, who does not work, said the money was \"crucial\" as her husband's income alone was \"not enough to cover us\". \n\"We need it for fuel, food, our mortgage,\" Megan told the BBC. \nThe family almost missed a mortgage payment on Monday because of the delay but managed to get a three-day extension from their lender. \nMegan also struggled to work out why the benefit had not turned up, only finding out after stumbling on a thread on the networking site, Mumsnet.\n\"I was disappointed and annoyed with HMRC as it seemed that people had warned them about this on Friday evening and Saturday morning and they\u2019d ignored it.

    "Nigeria\u2019s trade unions have suspended a general strike by workers that has brought economic activity to a halt this week.\nThe decision comes after the government promised to increase the national minimum wage to at least 60,000 naira ($40, \u00a332) a month.\nThis falls below the $330 that unions have been demanding, but is double the current monthly wage.\nThe strike began on Monday and led to the shutdown of the country's power grid, leaving millions without electricity.\nGovernment and union representatives say they will now meet every day for a week for further negotiations in the hopes of a permanent resolution.\nA civil servant in the northern city of Kano told the BBC he was disappointed by the offer, and wanted at least 100,000 naira ($67) a month.\n\"Even 100,000 naira won\u2019t be enough as prices in the market have gone up but it will be better than what we have now,\u201d said Shittu Lawal, who works in the information ministry in Kano.\n\"I spend 500 naira to get to work every day which is not easy, we will return to work now and continue to push for more,\" he added.\nEarly on Monday, the country was plunged into darkness shortly after 02:00 local time (01:00 GMT) when union members prevented operators at the country's power control rooms from working and closed electricity substations.\nMany flights were also cancelled in the country's busiest airport in Lagos, and in the capital, Abuja, with passengers left stranded.\nSchools, offices and hospitals across the country have also been closed.\nThis strike is the fourth since President Bola Tinubu came to power a year ago.\nHis government has removed a subsidy that kept the price of fuel low and ended the policy of pegging the value of the naira to the US dollar.\nThe removal of the fuel subsidy and collapse in the value of the naira has lead to the worst economic crisis in a generation.\nUnions have warned they will not hesitate to strike again in seven days if their negotiations prove fruitless.\nPower cut across Nigeria as workers go on strike\nIs Nigeria on the right track after a year of Tinubu?\nNigeria cost of living: People turn to 'throw-away' rice for food\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",
    "France\u2019s young prime minister, Gabriel Attal, has been accused of an act of classic \u201cmansplaining\u201d after he invited himself on to a broadcast debate featuring his party\u2019s lead candidate for the European elections, Val\u00e9rie Hayer.\nPoliticians of all stripes have joined in the attacks,  saying Mr Attal\u2019s impromptu intervention did Ms Hayer no favours - leaving her looking sidelined and superfluous.\n\u201cAttal would never have let himself do that if [Ms Hayer] had been a man,\u201d said Marine Le Pen, head of the far-right National Rally (RN).\n\u201cShe may be my political adversary, but the way the prime minister humiliated her \u2026 was utterly shameful.\u201d\nMr Attal, who is 35 and France\u2019s first openly gay prime minister, appeared unexpectedly on the stage at a radio debate organised on Monday morning by state broadcaster France Info.\nTo sparse applause from the auditorium and embarrassed laughs from Ms Hayer,  the prime minister said: \u201cI am so sorry for bursting in like this \u2013 I was just being interviewed upstairs, and it\u2019s important to me to come and lend support to Val\u00e9rie.\u201d\nHe then spoke for three or four minutes about the challenges facing Europe at this weekend\u2019s elections, and the reasons why young voters in particular should choose President Macron\u2019s Renaissance party.\nAt the end of his speech, Ms Hayer had the time he spoke deducted from her allocation.\nComments from other opposition leaders immediately flooded in on X, formerly Twitter, asking why Mr Attal couldn\u2019t simply allow his party\u2019s candidate \u2013 an experienced MEP \u2013 to do the job of leading the campaign herself.\n\u201cI share the anger that many people have, watching the prime minister \u2013 and the president \u2013 wiping their feet on Val\u00e9rie Hayer,\u201d said Marie Toussaint, who heads the list of the Green party.\n\nFor Olivier Faure, who heads the Socialist Party: \u201cMacron and Attal are doing everything to undermine and render invisible their candidate. Every day they are putting themselves in her place.\u201d\nMs Hayer \u2013 who had little public profile in France before the campaign \u2013 faces a likely rout at the weekend at the hands of National Rally under its 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella.\nThe latest polls put Mr Bardella\u2019s RN at 33%, with Ms Hayer battling it out with the Socialists at around 15%.\nCommentators said President Macron and Mr Attal appeared to have lost faith in their top candidate's dwindling campaign \u2013 which was why they were both projecting themselves on to the media front line.\nMr Attal has already held a two-way election debate with Jordan Bardella \u2013 earning angry attacks from other parties who say that Renaissance and the RN have a shared interest in turning politics into a perpetual fight between President Macron and the far right.\nMr Macron has also been accused of unfairly using presidential privilege to help his party in the elections, with a major speech on Europe last month and a television interview on Thursday on the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a bit macho, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy, who heads the conservative Republicans\u2019 list. He summed up Mr Attal's intervention as: \"Listen Val\u00e9rie, I can do this better than you; I\u2019m going to explain how it works at a European election.\"\n\u201cCome on, when is this all going to stop?\" he added. \"In the middle of a campaign is it normal for the executive to spend its time saturating the media space?\u201d",
    "Gunmen have killed the female mayor of a town in Mexico just hours after the country celebrated the election of Claudia Sheinbaum as the nation's first woman president. \nYolanda S\u00e1nchez was shot in the town of Cotija, which she had governed since September 2021. \nShe was the first woman to be elected to the post. \nWidespread violence against politicians has overshadowed Mexico's general election, which saw two women run for the presidency.\nYolanda S\u00e1nchez was ambushed by gunmen in the centre of Cotija, Michoac\u00e1n, on Monday.\nLocal media say she was shot 19 times and died in hospital shortly after the attack. Her bodyguard was also killed in the gun battle. \nNo arrests have been made so far in connection with the attack but it is widely thought that the gunmen belonged to an organised crime group. \nMs S\u00e1nchez had reported receiving death threats after taking up office in September 2021. \nShe was held for three days by armed men who had seized her at gunpoint during a visit to the neighbouring state of Jalisco in 2023. The politician said that her kidnappers had made \"demands\" and inflicted \"psychological terror\" before releasing her. \nWhile she said that she did not know what criminal group they belonged to, local newspapers said the most likely culprits where the Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG).\nThe CJNG engages in drug trafficking as well as kidnapping for ransom and extortion.\nIt is also infamous for targeting public officials who refuse to do its bidding.\nMs S\u00e1nchez had said that the men who had threatened her after she had taken office had demanded that she hand the security of the town over to state police officers in the pay of organised crime groups.\nShe refused and asked for the military to reinforce the town. The mayor was also provided with armed bodyguards after the incident.\nHer murder on Monday came less than a day after a general election that was overshadowed by the murder of local candidates.\nMore than 20 people running for office have been killed since September according to official figures, but independent surveys have put the number closer to 40.\nThe presidential race was won by Claudia Sheinbaum, who will be sworn in on 1 October as the first woman to hold the top office in Mexico.\nMs Sheinbaum's defeated rival, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, has been critical of the violence which marred the campaign.\nMs G\u00e1lvez said that when she called Ms Sheinbaum on Monday, she told her that \"I saw a Mexico with a lot of pain and violence. I wished that she could solve the severe problems our people have\u201d.\nWhile Ms G\u00e1lvez conceded defeat after Ms Sheinbaum's unassailable lead in the polls was announced, she has since described the campaign for the presidency as an  \"unequal competition against the entire state apparatus dedicated to favouring its candidate\".\nShe also said that she would challenge Ms Sheinbaum's win without specifying how she would do that.\nWith more than 95% of the votes tallied in the preliminary count, Ms Sheinbaum had a lead of over 31 percentage points over Ms G\u00e1lvez.\n",
    "A major chicken supplier in the UK has breached environmental laws in the way it discharged waste, a BBC investigation has found.\nDocuments filed with Stormont\u2019s Department for the Environment, Agriculture and Rural Affairs show the company has breached legal limits on hundreds of occasions across three different sites in Northern Ireland.\nThe agri-food company, which is valued at over a \u00a31bn, is Northern Ireland\u2019s largest private-sector employer.\nMoy Park said all trade effluent is strictly controlled and treated before it is discharged, with it undergoing additional treatment by Northern Ireland Water before it enters waterways.\nMoy Park supplies branded and own label chicken products to retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.\nTrade effluent is the name given to the liquid waste produced by factories and businesses which typically ends up in the sewage system.\nThe discharges have the potential to be highly polluting and are subject to strict environmental limits set out in trade effluent consents.\nThese are overseen by Stormont\u2019s Department for Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA).\nBreach those limits and businesses could be committing a crime.\nAs part of a wider investigation into pollution at Lough Neagh, BBC Spotlight examined thousands of environmental compliance documents filed by Moy Park with the regulator since 2017.\nThe documents revealed hundreds of breaches of the company\u2019s trade effluent consents.\nSampling by Northern Ireland Water found that Moy Park had breached legal limits relating to a number of potential pollutants, including ammonia and hexane extractable materials including oils, fats and grease.\nAndrew Muir, Northern Ireland\u2019s Agriculture and Environment Minister, told BBC Spotlight he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d after the programme brought him its findings.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be writing to Moy Park seeking an explanation in terms of the situation you outlined. This can\u2019t continue.\u201d\nThe environmental regulator, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), operates within DAERA.\nWhen asked why the regulator had not prosecuted the breaches previously, Mr Muir said he would be seeking answers from his officials.\nMoy Park told BBC Spotlight, that any breaches of its trade effluent consent incur a charge payable directly to NI Water for further treatment to ensure the water is safe before any discharge to a waterway.\nIt added that the algal blooms on Lough Neagh were a complex issue, not specifically linked to any one sector.\nThe company said it is \u201ccommitted to working with all partners in line with a science-based approach to preserve the vitality of Lough Neagh\".\nCampaigners fear that breaches of trade effluent consents, sewage spills and agricultural pollution are combining to fuel the growth of toxic cyanobacteria at Lough Neagh.\nBlooms of the toxic blue-green algae developed on the lough last summer, with signs already showing it is returning.\nMoy Park, which is owned by American agri-food giant Pilgrim\u2019s, has a number of factories in Northern Ireland.\nIt recently sponsored the Belfast Marathon and has previously advertised at high-profile sporting events including the 2010 World Cup.\nThe company\u2019s sites in Dungannon, Ballymena, and Craigavon sit within the catchment area for Lough Neagh and each reported multiple breaches of the trade effluent consent.\nTrade effluent discharged from these sites typically receive additional treatment at one of Northern Ireland Water\u2019s (NIW) treatment plants.\nThis is intended to ensure that the effluent does no damage to the watercourse it flows into.\nHowever, NI Water told Spotlight that a portion of the wastewater at its sites is discharged before it can be treated.\nOn 25,000 occasions each year, raw sewage and untreated trade effluent spill from its facilities.\nNI Water said \u201cdischarges from trade premises at higher levels than set within their consent conditions will pose an additional risk to the environment during the operation of storm overflows\".\nIt blamed historic under-investment for shortcomings in its network and said the spills cannot be stopped without additional sustained investment.\nMr Muir also announced the creation of a new team with a specific focus on stopping pollution at Lough Neagh.\n\u201cI\u2019m re-prioritising within the department towards environmental protection and I am setting up an enforcement team around the issues associated with Lough Neagh.\n\u201cWe have over 20 people dedicated to that area and it\u2019s absolutely critical that we do that,\" he said. \nMr Muir told Spotlight he would be bringing a report on Lough Neagh to the next executive meeting along with an action plan, which he hopes other ministers will sign off on.\nWater pollution campaigner and Undertones frontman Feargal Sharkey told Spotlight he was horrified by the extent of the problem.\n\u201cThe simple truth of the matter is \u2013 putting all that poo, all that waste, all that animal bi-product into a waterway like Lough Neagh, you simply add a ",
    "The directors of the Borders Book Festival have announced it will end its sponsorship deal with Baillie Gifford after this year's event.\nIt comes after Edinburgh International Book Festival ended its deal with the investment company following pressure from climate change protesters.\nThe Borders Book Festival said it had taken the decision with \"great regret\" after eight years working together.\nThe event - staged in Melrose - runs from 13 to 16 June this year.\nClimate change protesters have criticised other book festivals for their links to the company which they claim has links to fossil fuel firms and Israel.\nThe Edinburgh book festival and the Hay festival in Wales have recently ended sponsorship deals with the company.\nBaillie Gifford has defended its ethical record, saying it is not a significant fossil fuel investor and described claims that it had significant amounts of money in the occupied Palestinian territories as \"offensively misleading\".\nThe Borders Book Festival said it had made its decision following protests around the sponsorship deal at its own and other festivals.\nIt said: \"We took this decision with great regret because we have enjoyed eight happy and productive years working together to make our festival better, more accessible and in particular more attractive to children and families.\n\"Without the support of Baillie Gifford we would not have been able to mount such a vibrant and varied children\u2019s festival - where adults go free - and do all that we do with schools in the Borders.\n\"Baillie Gifford\u2019s support has enabled us to put free books into the hands of thousands of children, and that aspect of their support will be sorely missed.\"\nIt thanked the company for its \"solid and passionate support\" not only for its festival but for others around the country.\n\nAndres Ordorica, of Fossil Free Books, welcomed the announcement and defended the group's decision to target book festivals. \nHe said the group involved about 100 book workers from a range of sections of the industry.\n\"The aim has always been - and will continue to be - to call upon Baillie Gifford to divest,\" he said.\n\"We appreciate them listening to writers and book workers,\" he said.\n\"The aim has never been to target festivals -  it is about using these festivals' very unique relationship with this investor.\"\nHe said he appreciated that their tactics might not be welcome but said there was a long history of such protests being used to draw attention to campaigns.\nHe said book festivals did not have to rely on corporate sponsorship and hoped it could lead to the pursuit of better public funding.\nThe Wigtown Book Festival, which will be held in neighbouring Dumfries and Galloway later in the year, also receives support from Baillie Gifford.\nDirector Adrian Turpin said the festival was in \u201cdialogue\u201d with the company over their relationship.\nHowever, he said he was confident that sponsorship the festival received conformed to \"transparent ethical standards\".\nHe said: \"It is not our role to make a case for them, but we encourage everyone to look at the facts and the misrepresentations that have been made, both regarding their climate-related and Israel-related investments.\n\"They have been exemplary supporters.\"\nHe added that the situation was a \"disaster\" for literature organisations across Scotland.\nDozens of Scotland\u2019s top writers including Val McDermid, Liz Lochead, Jackie Kay, Chris Brookmyre, Andrew O\u2019Hagan and Alexander McCall Smith last week criticised the impact of protests over the sponsorship on the Edinburgh International Book Festival. \n In an open letter to the Scotsman newspaper they said as citizens they felt it was right to campaign for fossil fuel divestment and a ceasefire in Gaza, but said that tactics that risked the closure of book festivals were \"ill-thought out\". \nThe Edinburgh International Book Festival has meanwhile launched its programme for this year, featuring authors like Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie, Lorraine Kelly and Richard Osmond.\nDirector Jenny Niven said she believed the festival could be a forum to discuss the \"really serious things going on in society\".\n\"We have Israeli and Palestinian authors on stage together, we have got conflict resolution programmes, we have got people looking at green tech and how to finance the green economy,\" she said.\n\"Come and educate yourselves and share your views and think about why does this matter to you and get involved in the conversation.\n\"Everybody's voice needs to be heard in that.\"",
    "The build on the Irish border has begun.\nPreparatory works on the Narrow Water Bridge - a cross-border project, linking County Down and County Louth, have been ongoing since February.\nOn Tuesday political representatives from both sides of the border gathered as the project was officially launched.  \nThis is a project decades in the making that does not have a publicly-known cost - with suggestions from \u20ac60m (\u00a351.1m) to \u20ac110m (\u00a393.6m).\nWhatever the official tab, it is due to be picked up by the Irish government who included Narrow Water in \u20ac800m (\u00a3681.4m) worth of investments as part of its Shared Island unit.\nNarrow Water is a site that effectively marks the meeting point of three counties - Down, Armagh and Louth - and two jurisdictions, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nIt is also a site that has seen more than its fair share of significant events, including the Narrow Water bombing of August 1979, where 18 soldiers were killed in an IRA double bomb attack. \nIt is also believed to be the point where US President Joe Biden\u2019s ancestors crossed from County Louth before sailing across the Atlantic from Warrenpoint.\nOnce a tourism hotspot, Warrenpoint and Omeath\u2019s border locations effectively became their stumbling block during the Troubles.\nNow that location has offered them a second chance to establish themselves.\nThe bridge is expected to take three years to build.\nWhen it opens it is hoped it will create a new tourism destination along the island\u2019s main transport corridor, equidistant between Belfast and Dublin and linking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and Cooley mountains.\nThe bridge will connect the A2 Newry to Warrenpoint dual carriageway in Northern Ireland with the R173 at Omeath in the Republic. \nIt is also hoped that it will help develop the wider Carlingford Lough area into a major Irish tourism destination, linking access between the villages of Warrenpoint, Rostrevor and Carlingford.\nThe final pieces of a cross-border greenway, which will link Carlingford village and Newry, are also under way. \nIt will intersect with the bridge.\nSpeaking as ground was broken, the Taoiseach (Irish PM) Simon Harris said the bridge would be a \"symbolic\" and \"practical\" piece of infrastructure that would \"unlock the full potential of this beautiful border region\".\nThe Tanaiste Miche\u00e1l Martin said the project had the potential to be a \"defining, iconic symbol of the journey our country has made\".\nNorthern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister John O'Dowd said the bridge was \"connecting communities. It is connecting history. It is connecting to the future.\"\nBrian Murtagh lives in Omeath and helps out the local Tidy Towns committee on litter picks twice a week. \nHe is hopeful the bridge will stimulate the local economy, and that the former Park Hotel and Dublin House Pub, which have been long closed, will re-open as a result.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll certainly get busier and you might end up with more rubbish on the road to get picked up, but it\u2019ll be good for the business community,\u201d he said. \nPatrick Wall, originally from Melbourne, is working on that public realm scheme in the centre of Omeath. \nHe lives in nearby Carlingford village.\nIt's already a tourism hotspot and he feels Warrenpoint and Omeath have nothing to fear from a potential influx of visitors.\n\"If you come down at the weekend it is packed down here,\" he said.\n\"Parking might become the biggest issue but the more people the better.\u201d\nAcross the lough in Warrenpoint, talk is also brewing about what derelict buildings will be redeveloped.\nBerni Lively, the general manager of Whistledown Hotel on the front shore, has no concerns about the possibility of increased competition.\n\u201cObviously we will benefit but also the town as a whole. Competition is no bad thing,\" she said.\n\u201cI think Warrenpoint will go back to how I remember it as a child.\"\nIn 2013 a previous attempt to build the bridge collapsed after \u00a314.5m of European funding was withdrawn.\nSince then, the Narrow Water Bridge Community Network has led a campaign for the bridge to be built. \nAs one member, Bill Reilly said: \u201cIf you keep turning over stones you might eventually find what you were looking for.\u201d\nNow that the big stone has been overturned, the group\u2019s secretary Adrian O\u2019Hare is pointing ahead to new battles.\n\u201cOn the seafront we have a swimming pool (The Baths) that was once the pride of Edwardian Ireland. It is now the biggest eyesore in the area. \n\"We have a number of hotels that have been derelict for a generation and we are also aware of other investment coming into the area because of the bridge.\u201d\nIan Cumming, who runs the East Coast Adventure Centre out of the Baths building, said the local council has an \"excellent\" plan to redevelop the site and that the bridge project helps drive that forward.\n\u201cWe just need to get the funding in place to make that happen and we are confident it will happen,\u201d he said.\nOn dry land is teacher Leah Kells - she's been impressed by what she has seen in Warrenpoint.\n\u201cI ",

    "A Canadian YouTuber accused of sedition in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago has appeared in court and been ordered to surrender his passport. \nChristopher Arthur Hughes, who posts under the account \"Chris Must List\", is known for videos in which he travels to dangerous places across the globe. \nHe was arrested on Thursday after publishing videos in which he interviewed Trinidadian gang members about their opposition to the government. \nMr Hughes was charged under the Caribbean country's Sedition Act once Trinidadian officials became aware of the videos.\nOn Monday, a judge in a Port-of-Spain District Court set the video blogger's bail at TT$100,000 (\u00a311,709).\nA lawyer representing Mr Hughes told the BBC on Tuesday that his client was \"simply exercising his constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press\".\nAttorney Anand Ramlogan said they intend to sue the state for breaching his constitutional rights.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Global Affairs Canada said it was aware of the reports of a detained Canadian and was providing consular assistance. \nThe investigation into Mr Hughes began after he posted videos from Trinidad and Tobago to his YouTube page, where he has 326,000 subscribers. \nThe Trinidad and Tobago Police Service said in a statement that the videos featured \"individuals professing to be gang members, advocating criminal activities, and using threatening language\".\nLaw enforcement sources told BBC News that police executed a search warrant at a location in west Trinidad, where Mr Hughes was staying. They seized several items during the search, including cameras and a laptop.\nOver a number of years, Mr Hughes has developed an online persona as a globe-trotting content creator. His YouTube videos allegedly show him visiting the \"most dangerous\" areas in a long list of countries, including Haiti, Kenya and the United States.\nVideos featuring Trinidad posted to the Chris Must List social media accounts - which were deleted from his YouTube account - appeared to show Mr Hughes in areas that local authorities consider \"hot spots\" due to the high crime rates.\nHe is seen or heard off-camera interviewing people in various Trinidadian communities, including a popular entertainer, a well-known senior police officer and schoolchildren.\nSome videos appear to show Mr Hughes speaking with men in Trinidad and Tobago while they brandished handguns and assault rifles.\n\u201cWant to see toys?\" one man says while showing the camera his high-capacity handgun in a video shared on the Chris Must List Instagram page. \"For real. We don\u2019t play out here.\u201d\nProsecutors could recommend a summary trial, leaving the defendant some options. If he accepts that route, the matter would be decided by a magistrate. Mr Hughes could decide to have his case reviewed by the High Court, however, which would also bring stiffer penaltiies. \nWith a summary conviction, Mr Hughes could expect a fine of TT$3,000 or two years in prison. However, if he's convicted in the High Court - the highest judicial body on the islands - he could face a TT$25,000 fine and five years in prison.\nAccording to the Trinidad and Tobago Guardian newspaper, Mr Hughes has previously faced legal issues with authorities in Cuba and Somalia.

    "A pregnant mother due to go into hospital for a planned Caesarean section tried to wake her partner on the day of the birth only to realise he was dead. \nThomas Gibson, 40, suffered a cardiac arrest while sleeping on the couch after a hospital doctor \"misinterpreted\" a scan 11 days earlier, an inquest at Stockport Coroner's Court heard.\nHis partner, Rebecca Moss, shed tears as she described telling Mr Gibson to \"wake up, it's baby day\" but found he was \"cold and stiff\" when she tried to touch him. \nMs Moss, from Stretford, Greater Manchester, had to give birth to their daughter, Harper, just hours later on 7 June, 2023. \nShe told the court Mr Gibson was sleeping on the couch when she woke up at about 05:15 BST and realised he was not breathing. \nShe said she called 999 and was told to get her partner onto the floor and begin chest compressions, which she did. \nMs Moss told the court: \"The shock, trauma and not to mention the physical exertion of having to pull Tom off the couch and perform chest compressions at 39 weeks pregnant was overwhelming.\"\nShe described her partner as \"caring, charming and funny\" and said he was excited at becoming a father, spending every weekend building furniture for their baby.\n\"We say goodnight to his picture every night before bed and she has a quilt which has been made from his favourite jumpers,\" she said. \n\"Tom will live on through his daughter but that doesn't change the fact that he should still be here with us today.\"\nThe inquest heard Mr Gibson attended Wythenshawe Hospital A&E on 27 May, 2023 having suffered from a severe stomach bug for about three weeks. \nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) was carried out and was escalated to Dr Thomas Bull by a junior doctor who recognised a potential blockage. \nDr Bull, giving evidence, said he recognised there were signs of an abnormality on the ECG but at the time he did not think it was clinically \"significant\" without other heart symptoms.\nMr Gibson was discharged and advised to come back if his stomach bug did not clear up. \nIt later emerged the ECG showed signs of a \"complete heart block\" which can lead to sudden cardiac death.\nDr Bull told the inquest: \"I can see now, in retrospect and in hindsight, there is abnormalities over and above those I could see present.\"\nManchester University NHS Foundation Trust has made a full admission of liability that it provided negligent medical care, according to lawyers for Mr Gibson's family. \nDr Matthew Thornber, a consultant at the hospital, said the condition required \"nuance and experience\" to diagnose.\nThe inquest continues.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A second murder by a man who had killed before has been described as \"horrific\" but \"rare\" by the Probation Service.\nLiam Jones, 45, inflicted at least 37 injuries on disabled father-of-five Phillip Breach in Oxford in November 2022.\nHe had been jailed for another man\u2019s murder in 2002 but was released on parole in 2021.\nA Parole Board spokesman said its reviews were \"undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care\". \nJones was jailed for life again, with a minimum of 37 years, at Reading Crown Court last month.\nA Probation Service spokesperson said: \"This was a horrific crime and our thoughts remain with the family of Phillip Breach.\n\"Serious further offences (SFOs) like this one are rare but have a devastating impact on victims and their families which is why each one is thoroughly investigated so we can improve the work we do to keep the public safe.\"\nThe BBC understands a review into the case has been completed and will be presented to the Breach family.\nFewer than 0.5 % of people under Probation Service supervision go on to commit SFOs, according to government figures.\nA Parole Board spokesman said its decisions were \"solely focused on what risk a prisoner could represent to the public if released and whether that risk is manageable in the community\".\n\"A panel will carefully examine a huge range of evidence, including details of the original crime, and any evidence of behaviour change, as well as explore the harm done and impact the crime has had on the victims,\" he continued.\n\"Members read and digest hundreds of pages of evidence and reports in the lead-up to an oral hearing.\"\nHe said evidence from witnesses such as probation officers, psychiatrists and psychologists, officials supervising the offender in prison, as well as victim personal statements may be given at a hearing.\n\"It is standard for the prisoner and witnesses to be questioned at length during the hearing which often lasts a full day or more.

    "A mum who has spent two months dealing with whooping cough in her family has described it as \u201crelentless and exhausting\u201d.\nJayne Saywell, from Portobello in Edinburgh, was scared when her 16-year-old son Tom started having coughing fits in April and it soon spread to herself and her youngest son Peter.\n\u201cThe lack of sleep is the worst because you\u2019re waking up coughing again and again and again,\u201d Jayne said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s relentless and you\u2019re exhausted.\n\u201cI thought it was from medieval times, I thought it had been eradicated, I didn\u2019t think it was a thing anymore at all. It was a bit of a shock.\u201d\nThe latest figures from Public Health Scotland (PHS) show more than 2,800 cases of whooping cough have been recorded in Scotland so far this year.\nAnalysis of the first three months of the year showed that most cases have been in the 10-14 age group.\nThe NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lothian and Grampian health board regions had the largest number of confirmed cases in the first quarter of 2024.\nAlso known as pertussis or the \"100-day cough\", experts say the infection is a cyclical disease with peaks seen every three to five years.\nJust 73 cases were reported in Scotland in 2023.\nThe last significant outbreak saw 3,084 cases detected over a two-year period in 2012 and 2013.\nAnd cases have been rising recently across the UK and Europe. \nThe UK Health Security Agency said a steady decline in uptake of the vaccine and the very low number of infections seen during the Covid pandemic were both factors in the recent rise in cases.\nJayne and her family had previously been vaccinated against the cough. The infection started in April during the Easter school holidays and has since been treated with antibiotics. But some symptoms are persisting.\nWhen nine-year-old Peter started coughing he was tested for the infection, but the rest of the family were not because it was presumed they had it. This suggests the true number of cases across the country is likely to be higher.\nJayne said: \"Go to the GP if you are coughing and you can\u2019t stop coughing, don\u2019t wait for the \u2018whoop\u2019 noise.\n\"That did manifest in my older son but it didn\u2019t in us, so it took a while to realise what it was.\"\nPeter said he wasn\u2019t able get out with friends or do any activities for weeks.\n\"I was just sitting down all the time, I couldn\u2019t really do anything,\" he said.\nDr Sam Ghebrehewet, head of immunisation and vaccination at PHS, said infections would probably not peak until the autumn.\nSpeaking to BBC Scotland News last month, he said: \"It is likely to get worse.\n\"The cycles we have seen over the last 10 years is usually that it starts in the first (quarter of) the calendar year - January, February, March.\n\"It goes higher and higher and it doesn't peak until the third quarter, so I think it has a long way to go as far as we understand from the previous years.\u201d\nThe first signs are similar to a cold, with a runny nose and sore throat.\nAfter about a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last a few minutes and are typically worse at night.\nYoung babies may make a distinctive \"whoop\" or have difficulty breathing after a bout of coughing.\nThe bacterial infection spreads through coughs and sneezes.\nPeople of all ages can catch whooping cough, but it is most serious for young children and babies.\nFive babies have died from whooping cough in England since the start of the year, according to the UK Health Security Agency. The last whooping cough death recorded in Scotland was in 2015.\nPHS is encouraging pregnant women to ensure they are immunised against infection.\nNew babies cannot be immunised until they are at least eight weeks old.\nDr Ghebrehewet said: \"Whooping cough is spread by respiratory droplets, either directly between people or through contaminated items. It can cause severe illness and death, particularly in young unimmunised children. Babies under one year of age are most at risk.\n\"Whooping cough can be prevented with immunisation which is given to infants, younger children and pregnant women. \nGetting immunised during pregnancy is the best way to protect your baby in the first few vulnerable weeks of their life.\"\nBetween baby sensory classes at the Toddle In on the southside of Glasgow, new mums discuss the challenges of parenthood, including health issues affecting their children.\nMolly Mulhearn and Holly McPhee were both vaccinated against whooping cough during pregnancy.\nHolly said she wanted to give her son Patrick as much protection as possible.\n\"You want to protect yourself and you want to protect the baby you\u2019re carrying at the same time,\" she said.\n\"Then when they\u2019re in the world you want to give them as much protection as possible.\"\nBoth mums believe it is important for parents to be told about infection risks with newborns and the availability of vaccinations.\nMolly said: \"It can be overwhelming - your first child - so having as much information and time to process it makes such a difference.\n\"I think it\u2019s lovely to come to classes wi",
    "The theatre landscape is changing. A few decades ago, the West End was packed with classic musicals and Shakespeare adaptations, but now they're making way for a new type of show. \nEnter Kathy and Stella Solve a Murder, a musical about two true crime podcast-obsessed friends who find themselves in the middle of a murder mystery. \n\"We're two northerners singing about true crime, we really didn't think it would make it to the West End,\" says Bront\u00e9 Barb\u00e9 who plays Stella.\nHer co-star Rebekah Hinds is equally as excited about \"bringing northern female voices to the stage\", particularly as it is the first time Hull has featured as the setting for a West End musical.\n\"People really feel seen as a result of this show and that's amazing especially as stories of people from Hull are rarely the main plot of a play or in big musicals,\" Hinds tells the BBC. \nOlivier award-winning producer, Francesca Moody, who also produced Fleabag, says that because the show is about a pair of outsiders, it \"feels even more rewarding to be bringing greater representation to the stage with this musical\". \nThe characters of Kathy and Stella \"haven't found their way in life and don't really fit in,\" according to Barb\u00e9.\nThe audience meet the pair eight years into recording a true-crime podcast in Kathy's mum's garage. \nDespite the lack of listeners, they live and breathe the podcast and become even more obsessed with crime when their favourite author is murdered.\nNaturally the pair take it upon themselves to investigate.\n\"And it all unravels from there,\" Barb\u00e9 says laughing.\nAs well as it being about two outsiders, the musical also touches on a number of other themes. \n\"It's so jam packed with ideas and storylines, it's not about one particular thing,\" explains Hinds. \nOf course one of the central themes is people's obsession with true crime. \n\"I think people are fascinated by the psychology of a criminal mind and trying to understand how someone turns into a monster,\" says Barb\u00e9.\nFor Hinds, the love that Kathy and Stella share for true crime is actually \"more about finding a community that you can belong in and a safe space as opposed to just learning about murderers\". \nWhile most musicals feature a strong romantic love story, one of the biggest themes in this show is platonic love. \n\"My friends are the loves of my life and so it feels right to be championing platonic friendship that can be some of the strongest and steadiest love in your life,\" Hinds says. \n\"And it means we pass the Bechdel test,\" adds Barb\u00e9 laughing. \nA movie passes the Bechdel Test if there are at least two named female characters that have a conversation with one another about something other than a man.\nUnusually, this story about a friendship between two millennial women was actually written by two men - Jon Brittain and Matthew Floyd Jones.\nMoody says some people \"can't get their head around the fact it was written by men\" but both Barb\u00e9 and Hinds have worked on the script with the writers to \"create these really authentic women\".\nThe play started its life in 2022 at the Edinburgh Fringe festival and was a \"pandemic project\" according to producer Francesca Moody. \nIt has since been \"scaled up and made bigger and better\" for runs at the Bristol Old Vic and Manchester's Home. \nIn its previous Manchester run, the Guardian's Clare Brennan awarded the show four stars and said it delivers \"power ballads and comic routines with physical and musical dexterity\". \nThe Evening Standard's Tim Bano said it was \"one of the most fun shows at the Fringe\" last year and gave it four stars. \nTalking about how much of the play has changed for its West End run, Barb\u00e9 says that \"we've been able to flesh out some of the characters more, but also there are some bits that are identical to how they were day one of the Fringe festival\". \nWhen the show started it had a run time of 70 minutes and now, with a running time of over two hours, Hinds says \"it's been great to add bits back in that we once had to cut\". \n\"Nothing has been crowbarred in and these aren't random fillers, they are wonderful bits that we didn't ever want to get rid of but had to.\"\nMoody adds that even though \"we've gone bigger\" the show \"hasn't lost the silliness of small theatre\" and \"is still being held together with Pritt Stick and Sellotape.\"\nAnd Kathy & Stella Solve a Murder is not the only British musical having a moment in the spotlight. \nCritics have raved about Two Strangers (Carry A Cake Across New York) - a new rom com musical about two twenty-something strangers meeting ahead of a wedding has impressed critics.\nOther brand new musical comedies to hit the West End soon include Jack Godfrey's pop ode to being a teenager, Babies which has already gathered a cult following in its previous run. \n\"What's lovely is that it doesn't feel like a competition between us all but instead it's a moment for us all to celebrate how amazing this is,\" says Hinds. \nMoody agrees and thinks it is an exciting time to be a British m",
    "A venue that hosts local traders under one roof has to close due to a decrease in footfall during the cost of living squeeze.\nThe Emporium, in Wellington, rents spaces to 75 local traders and craftspeople in one combined shop.\nOwner Cato Cooper said she has seen a decline in footfall since the end of the pandemic, which has meant a decrease in sales.\n\"It's very sad. I feel that we've had nine very good years, we survived Covid, we've survived all sorts of things, so you'd think we'd still be going,\" Ms Cooper said.\nShe started the business together with her husband nine years ago.\n\"When this space became available I thought: 'This looks like a challenge, I want to take this',\" Ms Cooper said.\n\"Because we were already local makers, we wanted to support local makers, I knew how hard it was to run your own little High Street shop.\"\nThey divided the 5,000sq/ft building into 100 units for traders to rent.\nAfter nine years, they announced they would have to shut the shop.\n\"We feel times are a bit different at the moment, I think people are feeling the pinch a little bit,\" Ms Cooper said.\n\"I owe it to my traders for all of them to do well and at the moment I don't really think they all get a chance to do well. It's time to close the doors,\" Ms Cooper added.\n\"However, all the other traders still have their own business and will keep going, it's only my physical shop that is closing.\"\nA social media post got a lot of people commenting that they will miss the Emporium.\nOne customer told BBC Somerset: \"It's sad for the community. It's such a diverse shop you can get all sorts of stuff here.\"\n\"I didn't expect that kind of reaction,\" Ms Cooper said. \"It's really special and amazing. It just shows that people care.\"\nLin Moore, a candlemaker who runs Beachhouse Botanics, has been a trader at the Emporium for five years. \nShe said: \"Things have been extremely hard since Covid, so to be seen with lots of other small businesses has been amazing for my business. It's really sad.

    "First Minister Vaughan Gething attempted to prevent the release of details that he lobbied on behalf of a company which had broken the law and whose holding company later donated to his leadership campaigns.\nEmails, obtained by Newyddion S4C, show Mr Gething twice attempting to persuade Natural Resources Wales (NRW) not to release information requested under environmental information regulations. \nMr Gething, who faces a vote of no confidence on Wednesday, has been criticised over a donation by Dauson Environmental Group, controlled by David Neal.\nA Welsh Labour spokesperson said \"there is absolutely no suggestion that Vaughan Gething didn\u2019t want the information released\".\nBBC Wales revealed in March that Mr Gething had lobbied environmental regulator NRW to ease restrictions on another of David Neal's companies, Atlantic Recycling Ltd, in 2016. \nAtlantic Recycling and its director David Neal were prosecuted in 2013 for illegally dumping waste on the Gwent Levels, and in 2017 for failing to clean the waste up.\nMr Neal was fined \u00a310,000 and given a three-month suspended sentence in 2013, and was handed an 18-week suspended sentence in 2017, together with fines and costs of \u00a3230,000.\nCompanies controlled by Mr Neal have donated tens of thousands of pounds to Mr Gething's campaigns to become Welsh Labour leader, including two donations totalling \u00a3200,000 in the campaign which ended with him victorious earlier this year.\nBBC Wales Investigates revealed this week that another of Mr Neal's companies was under criminal investigation at the time the donations were made. \nIn a statement Mr Neal said: \"All donations made have come from a separate account to those used for the development of our business; we have never requested or expected anything in return.\"\nActing on a tip-off, Newyddion S4C requested correspondence between Mr Gething and NRW after BBC Wales's original request for information relating to Mr Gething lobbying on behalf of Mr Neal's companies.\nThe emails released by NRW show it contacted Mr Gething on 4 March, asking whether there was any reason the information it gathered should not be released under environmental information regulations.\nVaughan Gething first responded the next day, claiming the request was a \"fishing expedition\" and that his constituents would expect correspondence on their behalf by an elected representative to remain confidential. \nHe also queried whether releasing the information would breach data protection laws.\nAn NRW representative replied saying the disclosure was legal and required under the environmental information regulations. \nMr Gething then responded once more saying he did \"not understand how my correspondence, whether in full or in part, amounts to environmental information\".\nHe cited releasing the information would \"have a material impact\" on the way he did  his job for his constituents.\nThe information requested was released by NRW on 8 March. Mr Gething was announced as leader of Welsh Labour on 16 March.\nOpposition parties have criticised the responses by the first minister revealed in the email exchange.\nPlaid Cymru MS Mabon ap Gwynfor said: \"This latest revelation is further proof of Vaughan Gething\u2019s aversion to scrutiny and transparency.\"\n\"If the first minister has nothing to hide and is unconcerned about any perception of acting on behalf of a significant donor \u2013 he surely would have been more than happy to co-operate with a reasonable request for information.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives said: \"Vaughan Gething\u2019s perceived conflict of interest is one of the key reasons why he is fighting for his political life.\"\nLeader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds MS, described the emails as a \"disturbing revelation\" which \"raises further questions about the First Minister's ability to perform his role\".\n\"The scandals that have surrounded Vaughan Gething during his short time in charge have muddied the waters of Cardiff Bay. For the sake of our devolved institutions he must go,\" she added. \nWelsh Labour denied Mr Gething did not want the information released, stating he was \"merely clarifying the principle of what information was being released and how it impacts on the work of MSs for their constituents\".",
    "Last night's head-to-head debate between Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer is poured over in detail. \nPapers that are often sympathetic to the Conservatives praised the prime minister's performance. \"Fiery Rishi comes out swinging\" says the Daily Mail. \"Starmer on the ropes over tax\" says the Daily Telegraph. \nIt highlights Mr Sunak's claim that families will pay more under Labour, an accusation Sir Keir branded as \"false\". \n\"Kapow!\" is the headline in the Daily Express, which calls the attack line on tax a \"knockout blow\". \nThe Daily Mirror is less sympathetic in its analysis: \"Keir has stormer as Sunak gabbles\". \nThe Guardian's sketch writer, John Crace, says the Tory leader \"got snippy\" and came across as \"tetchy\". The \"i\" said the \"angry TV clash\" saw both leaders \"falter under pressure\".\nThe Times points to a snap poll by YouGov, on who won the debate - with 51% of respondents backing Rishi Sunak and 49% Keir Starmer. \nThe paper's columnist, Matthew Parris, summed up his opinion of both men's performance: \"Divided by little, united by not really knowing what to do next\".\nA picture of Nigel Farage wincing as a milkshake flies towards his face features on several of the front pages. \nThe Metro calls the incident a \"shaky start\" for his election campaign. But it also quotes the chairman of Mr Farage's Reform UK party, Richard Tice, as saying \"the juvenile moron who threw a drink over Nigel just gained us hundreds of thousands more votes\". \nThe Sun says the woman accused of throwing the milkshake is a \"Labour-backing OnlyFans model\".\nThe Financial Times leads on the  fallout of the much larger Indian general election for prime minister, Narendra Modi. \"Indian voters deliver shock to Modi - after ruling BJP fails to win majority\", is the paper's headline. \nIts editorial says the result will inspire a \"hubristic\" BJP into \"more deliberative policymaking\". The Daily Telegraph's analysis says the world may have reached \"peak Modi\".\nImages of tearful Second World War veterans marking the eightieth anniversary of D-Day on a trip to Normandy appear in several of the papers. \n\"Once more unto the beach\" says the Sun. The paper reports that during a meeting at Buckingham Palace earlier this week, a 100-year-old veteran showed the King his dog tags, which are still bloodied from a gun shot wound he suffered.  \nThe Daily Mirror quotes another man who took part in D-Day as saying: \"If I had my time again, I would go again if necessary\".\nAnd a few of the papers carry a health update on the cavalry horses that bolted through the streets of London six weeks ago. \n\"Wounded horses are on the road to recovery\", reports the Times - alongside a picture of two of them nuzzling each other in a field. \nThe Daily Telegraph reports that three of the five animals are expected to be well enough to join the King's Birthday Parade later this month.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

    "Residents in Derby have called for the city's overgrown grass to be cut after branding it a dangerous eyesore.\nGrass has been left to grow in many parts of the the city, which the Local Democracy Reporting Service said had led to a \"deluge\" of complaints to Derby City Council.\nMotorists said they could not see oncoming traffic at some roundabouts and junctions because of the long grass.\nThe council said its teams were responding accordingly to \"one of the wettest winters on record\".\nHardyal Dhindsa, a Labour cabinet member at the city council, said recent wet weather meant grass cutting teams were not able to mow as much over the past few months.\nHe said the lack of grass cutting was not due to the No Mow May scheme, which sees a temporary stop on mowing during May to allow flowers to blossom and wildlife to thrive.\n\"Our teams began cutting at the end of March and have only had to stop because of waterlogged sites following one of the wettest winter periods on record\", he said.\n\"As the weather improves, we will be able to return to these areas.\"\nMany of the complaints have come from people living in Mickleover.\nResident Mrs Hann told the BBC: \"It is dangerous on corners of roads with the high grass, you can\u2019t see what\u2019s coming.\"\nAnother Mickleover resident Rosara Lakin said: \"It looks unkempt.

    "King Charles has resumed some public duties, as he continues to be treated for cancer. \nThe King temporarily stopped most of his public engagements after his diagnosis in February. \nThe King's first visit was to a cancer treatment centre with Queen Camilla, and he also made a surprise visit to an army barracks in Hampshire, where he joked about being \"allowed out of my cage\".\nHowever, Charles will not undertake a full summer programme of engagements.\nHe will attend Trooping the Colour on 15 June, but is expected to inspect soldiers from a carriage rather than on horseback.\nThe King and Queen will also welcome the emperor and empress of Japan for a state visit from 25 to 27 June. The visit will go ahead, even though it takes place during the election campaign.\nCharles will deliver the King's Speech on 17 July as part of the State Opening of Parliament after the general election. \nThroughout his treatment, the King has held private meetings as head of state and completed official paperwork.\nWeekly meetings with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also continued, although not all were in person.\nKing Charles made his first major public appearance since his diagnosis on Easter Sunday, when he and the Queen greeted crowds after a church service in Windsor.\nThe King is the UK head of state, but his powers are largely symbolic and ceremonial. He remains politically neutral.\nHe receives daily dispatches from the government in a red leather box, including briefings ahead of important meetings, or documents needing his signature.     \nThe prime minister normally meets the King on a Wednesday at Buckingham Palace. \nThese meetings are completely private, and no official records are kept of what is said.\nThe King also has a number of official parliamentary roles:\nHe also leads the annual Remembrance event in November at the Cenotaph in London.\nThe King hosts visiting heads of state, and regularly meets foreign ambassadors and high commissioners. \nThe King is also head of the Commonwealth, an association of 56 independent countries spanning 2.5 billion people.\nHe is head of state for 14 of these, known as the Commonwealth realms, as well as the Crown dependencies - the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.\nCharles also confers official honours on people from all walks of life, in public recognition of their merit, service or bravery. Most honours are awarded at new year and on the monarch's official birthday, in June.\nThe King is also patron to a number of organisations, including the RNLI, the Samaritans, RAF Museum, the Yorkshire Agricultural Society, the Penny Brohn cancer charity and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society, Orchestra, and Choir.\nThe Queen also holds a number of patronages, including the Royal Literary Fund, the Royal Academy of Dance, the  Royal Voluntary Service and the Army Benevolent Fund, and undertakes her own public engagements.\nCamilla, William and Kate receive royal honours\nThe order of succession sets out which member of the Royal Family takes over as monarch when the existing one dies or abdicates. \nFirst in line - the heir to the throne - is the monarch's eldest child. Sons no longer take precedence over their older sisters. \nKing Charles's heir is his elder son, the Prince of Wales. \nWilliam's eldest child Prince George is second-in-line to the throne, and his daughter Princess Charlotte is third. Her younger brother Prince Louis is fourth and Prince Harry is fifth. \nThe Royal Family receives an annual payment from the taxpayer, known as the Sovereign Grant, which is used to pay for official expenses, such as the upkeep of properties and staff costs.\nThe amount is based on a proportion of the profits of the Crown Estate, a \u00a316.5bn property business owned by the monarch but run independently. \nThe Sovereign Grant is worth \u00a386.3m for 2023-2024, as it was in 2021-2022 and 2022-23, although the Royal Family's total spending was more, with the difference covered by reserves. \nTo keep the annual payment at the same level of \u00a386.3m in 2024-2025, the grant will be a smaller percentage of Crown Estate profits, which have been boosted by six new offshore wind farms. \nHowever, if Crown Estate profits continue to grow as predicted, even under the reduced formula, the amount given to the Royal Family is expected to increase substantially in 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.\nThe King also receives money from a private estate called the Duchy of Lancaster, which is passed down from monarch to monarch. It covers more than 18,000 hectares of land, including property in central London. Worth \u00a3654m, it generates about \u00a320m a year in profits.\nThe Duke of Cornwall (currently William, Prince of Wales) benefits from the Duchy of Cornwall, which mainly owns land in the south-west of England. Worth \u00a31bn, it generated a net surplus of \u00a324m in 2022-23.\nThe King and William receive the profits from the duchies personally, and can spend the money as they wish. Both voluntarily pay income tax on the proceeds. \nSome Royal Family members",

The tourism market is really important, but [it's about] ensuring there are enough places for them to stay.\u201d\nOn Monday, a meeting of the decision-making executive at Calderdale Council heard that, despite the challenges of the pandemic and the cost of living crisis, there had been \u201creal growth\u201d in the area's visitor economy over the past five years, helped by exposure on screen and the \u201clocal distinctiveness\" of lesser-known towns and landmarks.\nThe new tourism plan would help \"improve the size and quality of the tourism sector\", the meeting was told, while \"making sure that we who live in this place also feel the benefit\".\nCalderdale is marking its 50th anniversary as a borough with a year of culture, called CultureDale, which complements similar events elsewhere in West Yorkshire, including Bradford's forthcoming tenure as the UK City of Culture in 2025.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "Residents and business owners near a busy route through Essex said they had almost given up hope of seeing any improvements, or an end to the congestion, on a single carriageway stretch.\nThe A120 links Stansted with the port at Harwich and is mainly dual carriageway, apart from a 10-mile (16km) stretch between Braintree and Marks Tey.\nWhile plans and proposals for adding an extra lane to that section have been in the pipeline for years, responsibility for the upgrade was transferred from Essex County Council to National Highways in 2020 - but no date for any work has been agreed.\nThe scheme is now potentially pushed back to beyond 2030 according to the last ministerial update in March 2023. The BBC contacted National Highways. \nPeople living and working near the busy route spoke to BBC News about how the road affected their lives. \nSean Rider lives near Coggeshall and works at Energy Efficient Homes at Marks Tey.\n\"I live and work on this road so it's a double-edged sword for me, really,\" he said.\nHis commute, of just four miles (6.5km), regularly takes at least half an hour instead of the few minutes he said he would expect.\nBut it was the human cost that worried him the most.\n\"Where the junctions are, the locals get so frustrated that people start taking chances and pull out onto the road,\" he added. \n\"There have been numerous death along this road - it's not fit for purpose in this day and age.\"\nTalk of improvements and new routes \"keep getting put back\", he said. \n\"I'm not even sure that I'll see - in my lifetime - anything change.\"\nWendy O'Riordan owns Wendy's Hair And Beauty, a salon at Marks Tey and said constant hold-ups on the road made her customers \"panic - because they can't get to their appointment\".\nCancellations and re-arranging schedules were commonplace, she said.\n\"The A120 is hard work generally, but add to that the A12 [improvement roadworks] and it's a double whammy.\"\nAsked about turning the A120 into a dual carriageway, she said: \"I've been here over 40 years and it was supposed to be done - but it has never been done.\"\nMartin Cowan runs Poplar Nurseries in Marks Tey, a company founded by his father about 88 years ago and which has been at its current site off the A120 since 1947.\nMr Cowan said even back then, there was talk of building a new road.\n\"Father told me they talked about putting a road from Braintree to the A12 in 1947 - and here we are in 2024 and we still haven't done anything,\" he said.\n\"Whether I shall ever see it bypassed...?\"\nHe said a bypass could be helpful as a lot of customers said they no longer came because of the hold-ups.\nThe road \"does our business harm\", said Mr Cowan. \nHe admitted he had \"just about given up\" on seeing any improvements to this stretch of the A120.\n\"It could be another 80 years - who knows?\"\nLaura Said has lived in Marks Tey for 27 years, during which time the A120 has been \"the bane of our lives\", she said.\n\"Accidents, traffic - and on bin day you can't move on that road.\"\nShe said it sometimes took her an hour to do a five-mile (8km) journey from work to home and would often take a long detour to avoid just sitting in traffic.\n\"They've promised a dual carriageway for all this time and it's never materialised,\" she said.\n\"They're just building more houses but there's no infrastructure to support that.\n\"It's only going one way - and that's gridlock.\n\"This road?

    "A Wellington food bank has said it faces closure if it cannot get financial help by the weekend.\nNotJUST, formerly the Food Share Project, has been running for five years, and has more than 30 volunteers.\nA meeting will be held on Friday to see if it can be saved, as maintenance and repair costs have skyrocketed since lockdown.\n\"I'm having to use the foodbank every single day to live. I\u2019m in that situation and I run the organisation,\" said Lea Bevan, its founder.\nThe food bank operates by collecting surplus food from around the country, and distributing it to other organisations or to those in need locally.\nIt has three tiers - a free food bank service for people in crisis, a service that costs \u00a33 per person, per family, and a shop which is open to the public.\nThe shop is what raises the funds to operate the entire business.\nMs Bevan said the organisation was given funding during lockdown, but since then it has struggled with repair and maintenance costs for things like fridges and vans. \n\"We had seven vehicles at one point, and now we've got one, and that's off the road,\" said Ms Bevan.\n\"This week, we've had to close our food bank because we haven't got a van.\"\n\"We're basically running on a deficit of between \u00a32,000-3,000 a week,\" she added.\nThe money issues are also affecting Ms Bevan's own situation.\n\"I'm a full time volunteer myself, I\u2019m on universal credit,\" she told BBC Radio Shropshire.\n\"I've had to say that I\u2019m being paid at work, put wages through at work, but not take them, because there isn\u2019t enough money to take them.\"\n\"I\u2019m exhausted,\" she added.\nThe meeting, which will be held on Friday at Meeting Point House, Southwater Square, is a last-ditch attempt to secure some funding to keep the doors open.\n\"We'll invite everybody who would possibly be interested in sponsoring us,\" said Ms Bevan.\n\"We'll invite councillors, all the mayors, everybody that's anybody that might be interested, or has a little pot of money.\"\n\"In three months time, we\u2019ll be able to get out of this situation ourselves, but for the next 3 months we are about \u00a33,000 a week short, so I need to fill that gap,\u201d she added.\nThe meeting starts at 10:00 BST.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Google must face a \u00a313.6bn lawsuit alleging it has too much power over the online advertising market, a court has ruled.\nThe case, brought by a group called Ad Tech Collective Action LLP, alleges the search giant behaved in an anti-competitive way which caused online publishers in the UK to lose money.\nGoogle parent company Alphabet called the case \"incoherent\" in its attempts to get the legal action dropped. \nBut the Competition Appeal Tribunal, in London, has ruled the case can now go to trial.\n\u201cThis is a decision of major importance to the victims of Google\u2019s anti-competitive conduct in adtech,\" said former Ofcom director Claudio Pollack, now a partner in Ad Tech Collective Action.\n\"Google will now have to answer for its practices in a full trial.\"\nHowever, Google's legal director, Oliver Bethell, described the lawsuit as \"speculative and opportunistic.\"\n\"We\u2019ll oppose it vigorously and on the facts,\" he added in a statement.\nThe cases concerns advertising technology, usually shortened to adtech, which decides which online adverts people see, as well as how much they cost to publishers.\nHosting such adverts is a huge source of revenue for many websites - Ad Tech Collective Action says digital advertising spend reached $490 billion in 2021.\nIt is also an extremely valuable industry for Google, because it dominates web search so heavily.\nAt the core of the claim is the allegation that Google is abusing that dominance, reducing the income websites get.\nAd Tech Collective Action says Google has engaged in what is known as \"self-preferencing\" - in other words promoting its own products and services more prominently than that of its rivals.\nIt says that means publishers end up getting less money for the ads they host as well as having to pay \"very high\" fees to Google.\n\"I look forward to working with our legal and economic advisers to deliver compensation for years during which the relevant markets did not provide a competitive outcome for the UK publishing market,\" Mr Pollack said.\nBut it will be a long time before any of this is resolved - it has already taken eighteen months to get to this point, and no court date has been set.\nThe case is what is known as opt-out, meaning all relevant UK publishers are included unless they indicate otherwise.\nIt is being funded by an unknown third-party, and says UK publishers who form part of the claim will not pay costs to participate.\nIt comes as Google faces probes by regulators in the UK, Europe and US into its adtech business, while the firm has already faced fines valued at billions of pounds from the European Commission over what it labelled anticompetitive behaviour.",
    "From animal lovers to laboratory technicians, no-one enjoys subjecting animals to scientific testing.\nIt is instead done to help ensure that drugs and other substances are safe for eventual human use.\nResearchers have long sought non-animal alternatives. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now accelerating this work.\nOne application of AI in this field is simple but said to be proving effective \u2013 using it to trawl through all the existing and available global animal testing results to prevent the need for unnecessary new tests.\nThis is useful because it can be difficult for scientists to sift through decades of data to find and analyse exactly what they are after, says Joseph Manuppello, a senior research analyst at the Physicians Committee of Responsible Medicine, a US non-profit.\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited about the application of AI models like ChatGPT to extract and synthesise all of this available data, and getting the most out of it,\u201d he says.\nThomas Hartung is a toxicology professor at Johns Hopkins University in the US, and also the director of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing. He says: \u201cAI is as good as a human, or better, at extracting information from scientific papers.\u201d\nWhen it comes to current animal testing, Prof Hartung says that the need to check new chemicals is one of the primary reasons. And with more than 1,000 such new compounds entering the market every year there are a lot to be tested.\nProf Hartung says trained AI systems are beginning to be able to determine a new chemical\u2019s toxicity.\n\u201cHaving tools available where we can press a button, and we get a preliminary assessment, which is giving us some flags of \u2018here\u2019s a problem\u2019\u2026 will be enormously helpful.\u201d\nProf Hartung adds that while software systems have long been used in toxicology, AI is providing an \u201cenormous leap forward\u201d in both power and accuracy.\n\u201cThis is suddenly creating opportunities that were not there before,\u201d he says, adding that AI is now involved in every stage of toxicity testing. AI is even being used to create new drugs in the first place.\nAI systems aren\u2019t perfect at determining chemical safety of course. One problem is the phenomenon known as data bias.\nOne example of this is if an AI system and its algorithm have been trained using health data predominantly from one ethnic group.\nThe risk is that its calculations or conclusions may not be entirely suitable for people from another ethnic background.\nBut as Prof Hartung points out, testing human drugs on animals can sometimes be of little use.\nFor example, arthritis medicine Vioxx passed the animal testing stage, only to then go on and ultimately be withdrawn from sale after studies showed that long-term usage by humans led to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\nOn the other hand, some widely used medicines would have failed in animal tests, such as painkiller aspirin, which is toxic to rat embryos.\nProf Hartung concludes that in a number of cases AI is already proving to be more accurate than animal testing.\nOne AI project being built to try to replace the need for future animal testing is called AnimalGAN. Developed by the US Food and Drug Administration, the software aims to be able to accurately determine how rats would react to any given chemical.\nThe AI was trained using data from 6,442 real rats across 1,317 treatment scenarios.\nA similar international project called Virtual Second Species is creating an AI-powered virtual dog, which is being trained using the data from historic dog test results.\nCathy Vickers is head of innovation at the UK\u2019s National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research, which is part of the scheme.\nShe explains that new medicines are currently first tested both on rats and dogs to check for potential toxicity, before human trials potentially start.\nGoing forward the major challenge for AI testing is getting regulatory approval. Dr Vickers acknowledges that \u201cfull acceptance will take time\u201d.\nYet Emma Grange, the director of science and regulatory affairs at pressure group Cruelty Free International, counters that all efforts should be made to ensure the phase-out of animal testing.\n\u201cAt the moment, it is not clear how or if new technologies such as AI could contribute to actually ending testing on animals, rather than just reducing or refining such testing,\" she says.\n\u201cBut we do know that the use of animals as models for the protection of human health and the environment is outdated science, and hope that ultimately AI can play a part in a transition away from using animals in any test or experiment.\u201d\nHowever, Kerstin Kleinschmidt-Dorr, chief veterinary officer at German pharmaceutical company Merck, says that animal testing cannot disappear overnight. Her firm is one of the sponsors of Virtual Second Species.\n\u201cThe use of animals is necessary and for good reasons, mandatory in many aspects,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we believe in a future where we will identify better animal testing free soluti",

And I had to get the Edinburgh Eras Tour poster too.\n\"I\u2019m so excited for the gig, I still can't believe Taylor is actually playing Edinburgh.\"\nCait Bartram, 19, from Seaham, has been a fan of Taylor Swift since she was four and the Fearless album had just been released. \nShe is one of  almost 73,000 fans who will fill the Scottish Rugby home ground each night. \nShe said: \u201cThere are no words, it\u2019s like Christmas, I can\u2019t sleep because I'm so excited.\u201d\nLike many fans, Cait has thought hard about her outfit for the night. After seeing creative designs made by other fans online, she decided to recreate a bodysuit that Taylor wears during her performance.\n\u201cIt does take a lot of patience,\" she said. \"I can\u2019t even fathom the amount of time that I\u2019ve spent painstakingly watching the Eras film, looking for photos on Pinterest, on Google images, zooming in on really fine details, trying to get everything to match perfectly.\n\"I marked out the symmetry, with fabric chalk, it\u2019s a lot of measuring, there\u2019s actually a lot of maths involved which did take a lot of time.\u201d\nCait believes the process has brought her closer to the Taylor Swift community.\n\u201cShe just inspires people to be their most authentic self, and I think with that it\u2019s brought out people\u2019s crafty side in a way.

    "Three rusty water-trucks stand at the edge of Kibbutz Malkiya, on Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon; little bigger than a family car, they look like something out of an old cartoon.\nA collection of industrial leaf-blowers is stacked nearby.\n\u201cThis is all we have,\u201d resident Dean Sweetland explains. \u201cWe have just these - and the leaf-blowers - to blow the fire back onto the dead areas.\u201d\nDean, a Londoner who moved to the kibbutz eight years ago, is one of a dozen residents left to tackle recent bushfires in the area, sparked by Hezbollah rockets from Lebanon.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on our own,\u201d he says. \u201cThe flames can be six metres tall. Sometimes you just can\u2019t get near it.\u201d\nHe gestures to the leaf-blowers standing in the sun.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re fighting it with gardening tools.\u201d\nOver the past few days, footage of the fires has made headlines in Israel.\nThe blazes, triggered when Hezbollah rockets hit dry undergrowth in soaring summer temperatures, have burned through 3,500 acres, according to forest administrators.\nMonday was \u201ca battle day\u201d, said Israel\u2019s Fire and Rescue Commissioner, Eyal Caspi, with 94 fires burning across these northern hills.\nMost are now out, or under control, but rockets fly over homes here several times a day and each one carries the potential to spark a new blaze.\nAnd there are places at the moment where firefighters don\u2019t go.\n\u201cThere is a war here and in a war zone, operations are different,\u201d Mr Caspi told Israel\u2019s Kan News radio station.\n\u201cIn certain areas, where there is no immediate danger to human life... where the army knows that the firefighters can get hurt, it gives us the instruction not to enter. And I back it up.\u201d\nFrom the back terrace of his home - built from shipping containers, a few hundred meters from the Lebanese border - Dean Sweetland points out the plumes of grey smoke rising from the hills nearby, to the sound of distant bombs and fighter jets.\nMost of the other residents of Kibbutz Malkiya were evacuated in the days following the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, when its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon began firing on communities here. Both armed groups are labelled as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US and others.\nBut Dean, who used to serve in the British Army, stayed on. He is part of a group of residents from border communities who race to put out the fires that fire crews are blocked from accessing.\nThe Israeli army, he says, is not a solution.\n\u201cEspecially when we\u2019re in the line of sight for Hezbollah, they\u2019ll see the soldiers and send a rocket,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear the drones when we\u2019re putting the fires out.\u201d\nIn the early days of the war, Dean says, tanks were parked around the kibbutz and attracting a lot of Hezbollah fire.\nThey\u2019ve now left, and in between the bombardments, the kibbutz is peaceful. But Dean and his neighbours feel the emptiness. Families evacuated eight months ago are still living in temporary accommodation further south.\nThe blazes here are a vivid reminder that the Israeli government\u2019s promise to secure these northern areas and get residents back home is still unfulfilled.\n\u201cWe feel like we\u2019re the forgotten people,\u201d Dean says. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about the north.\u201d\nThe attitude among many in the country, he says, is \u201clet it burn\u201d.\n\u201cI think we have to take out Hezbollah for 10km, maybe more,\u201d says Yariv Rozenberg, the deputy commander of Kibbutz Malkiya\u2019s civil defence team.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kill them all, and they won\u2019t leave from here. But we need more army here, and we need to go back to our life \u2013 to bring our families back.\u201d\nAs the months go by, pressure is mounting on Israel\u2019s government to resolve this conflict and get people home.\nIsrael\u2019s far-right security minister this week called for Israel to burn \u201call Hezbollah strongholds: destruction, war!\u201d\nOthers have been more measured. War with Hezbollah would be a much more difficult and dangerous conflict than the one Israel is fighting in Gaza.\nHezbollah\u2019s deputy chief, Sheikh Naim Qassem, told the Al Jazeera television station that the group was not seeking to widen the conflict but that any Israeli expansion of the war would be met \u201cwith devastation\u201d.\nBefore a meeting of the war cabinet to discuss the situation on Tuesday night, the Israeli military\u2019s chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said the country was \u201capproaching the point where a decision will have to be made\u201d.\nThe armed forces, he said, were \u201cprepared and ready to move to an offensive\u201d.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visiting troops and firefighters in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona on Wednesday, said the government was prepared for \u201ca very strong action in the north.\u201d\n\u201cOne way or another we will restore security to the north,\u201d he said.\nMany believe a ceasefire in Gaza would help cool the situation further north.\n\u201cGaza is the key,\u201d Dean says. \u201cIt needs to be dealt with, one way or the other. Then Hezbollah will stop, because they\u2019re doing this in support of Hamas.\u201d\nThe northern conflict is closely linked to the war in Gaza.\nFor the past eight mon",

We will think about it.\"\nHe did not specify which countries Moscow could supply weapons to.\nMr Putin singled out Germany, which recently told Ukraine it was free to hit targets inside Russia with long-range German-made weapons.\n\"When they say that there will be more missiles which will hit targets on Russian territory, this definitively destroys Russian-German relations,\" Mr Putin said.\nUS President Joe Biden has given Ukraine permission to use American-supplied weapons to strike targets in Russia, but only near the Kharkiv region. The White House has said Ukraine cannot use long-range ATACMS missiles on Russian soil.\nUkraine has used US weapons to strike inside Russia in recent days, a US senator and a Western official told the Associated Press on Wednesday.\nFierce fighting has been raging north-east of Kharkiv since a new Russian push across Ukraine's northern border.

If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal.\n\"This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\nMr Putin also dismissed the idea that Russia has plans to attack Nato territory.\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy.

    "Nvidia's market value has surged past $3tn (\u00a32.3tn), lifting the chip giant ahead of Apple to become the second most valuable publicly listed company in the world.\nThe firm's share price rose more than 5% on Wednesday, to more than $1,224. \nIt extended a breathtakingly rapid climb that started last year, powered by bets that the US firm is positioned to be a major winner from a wave of investment in artificial intelligence (AI).\nIts market value now sits just behind Microsoft, another key player in the industry thanks to its investments in Chat GPT-maker OpenAI.\nValued at \"just\" $2tn as recently as February, Nvidia sparked a new wave of share purchases after it announced plans last month for a so-called stock split.\nThe move will increase the number of shares by a factor of 10 and reduce their value accordingly, a change aimed at making shares more affordable to small-time investors.\nSet to happen on Friday, it is expected to generate even more demand for the stock. \nFounded in 1993, Nvidia was originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games.\nLong before the AI revolution, it started adding features to its chips that it says help machine learning - all of which has helped it increase its market share.\nIt is now seen as a key company to watch to see how fast AI-powered tech is spreading across the business world, a shift boss Jensen Huang has declared the dawn of the \"next industrial revolution\".\nHis company has seen explosive growth, reporting sales of $26bn in the three months to 28 April - more than triple the same period in 2023, and up 18% from the previous three month.\nOptimism about AI is one of the forces behind a broader market rally over the last year, which pushed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq in the United States to new records on Wednesday. \nApple had appeared to be losing out earlier this year as sales growth stalled.\nBut in recent weeks, its shares have been buoyed by anticipation over how it plans to incorporate AI into its own strategy.\nShares in the firm rose 0.7%, giving it a market capitalisation of roughly $3tn, which is generally calculated by multiplying the number of shares in a company by its current share price.",
    "Russian hackers are behind the cyber attack on a number of major London hospitals, according to the former chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre. \nCiaran Martin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the criminal group were \"looking for money\" by targeting the pathology services firm Synnovis.\nHospitals declared a critical incident on Tuesday after the ransomware attack, which affected blood transfusions and test results.\nIt also led to operations being cancelled and emergency patients being diverted elsewhere.\nKing\u2019s College Hospital, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 - including the Royal Brompton and the Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital - and primary care services are among those affected.\nMr Martin told the programme: \"We believe it is a Russian group of cyber criminals who call themselves Qilin.\"\nHe said the group, which operates on the dark web, operated \"freely from within Russia\".\nThe cyber security expert explained that the group had previously attacked automotive companies, Australian courts, and the Big Issue in the UK. \nHe said: \"They're simply looking for money,\" but said the British government had a policy of not paying ransoms. \nHe told the BBC that the criminal group were \"unlikely\" to have known they would cause healthcare disruption when they organised the attack.\nHe added: \"There are two types of ransomware attack. One is when they steal a load of data and they try and extort you into paying so that isn't released, but this case is different. \n\"It's the more serious type of ransomware where the system just doesn't work.\"\nMr Martin said the attack was \"one of the more serious that we've seen in this country\".\nWhen asked about patient data, he said: \"It's not really a question of data in this one, it's a question of the services.\n\"The criminals are threatening to publish data, but they always do that.

    "Narendra Modi is set to be India's prime minister for a third time, a day after humbling election results which saw his majority slashed by a resurgent opposition.\nMr Modi was backed to be prime minister again following a meeting with his National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on Wednesday.\nThe 73-year-old had found himself unexpectedly reliant on the NDA's smaller parties to reach a parliamentary majority after his own party fell short of the 272 needed to form the next government.\nHowever, the opposition - which won 232 seats to the NDA's 293 - has yet to formally concede.\nIt was holding its own meeting on Wednesday in the capital, Delhi, to discuss next steps.\nMr Modi is likely to be sworn in for a record-equalling third term later this week.\nMr Modi and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 240 seats following the weeks-long, seven-stage election, making them the largest party in the Lok Sabha, India's lower house.\nBut it is a significantly reduced number for the prime minister: in 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, and Mr Modi had said he was aiming for 370 seats this time round.\nInstead, they have had to rely on NDA partners to secure Mr Modi's third term. \nAccording to an NDA release, he was \"unanimously\" chosen as their leader at the meeting at his Delhi residence, adding they were \"committed to serving the poor, women, youth, farmers and exploited, deprived and oppressed citizens of India\".\nExactly what concessions its partners may have elicited from the BJP remains to be seen. Ahead of the meeting, there was speculation that demands from more powerful groups may have included ministerial positions in return for their support.\nIt is the first time Mr Modi will have governed in coalition without his party having an outright majority, and it is unclear what the next five years will look like.\nNilanajan Mukhopadhyay, who has written a biography of Mr Modi, told AFP news agency it would \"force Modi to take the point of view of others\".\n\"We shall see more democracy and a healthy parliament,\" he added. \n\"He will have to be a leader that he has never been; we will have to see a new Modi.\"\nMeanwhile, the opposition INDIA coalition has been celebrating the results - despite not winning.\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge hailed the \"overwhelming support received by our alliance\" and said voters had sent a message opposing the BJP's \"politics of hate, corruption and deprivation\".\n\"This is a mandate in defence of the Constitution of India and against price rise, unemployment, and crony capitalism and also to save democracy,\" his statement on social media added.\nFollowing the NDA's declaration of victory, the White House congratulated Mr Modi and said the US was hoping to work with India to \"ensure a free and open\" Asia. \nThis year's Indian election was the largest the world has ever seen. More than 600m people took part - or 66% of the country's eligible voters. Nearly a billion people had registered to vote in total \u2013 about one in eight of the global population.\nVoting was staggered over seven rounds between 19 April and 1 June for security and logistical reasons. Much of the election took place in extreme and deadly heat as temperatures in parts of India soared to nearly 50C.",
    "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 not only sparked international outrage. It also triggered a wave of sanctions designed to weaken the Kremlin\u2019s ability to wage war against its neighbour.\nRussia\u2019s assets abroad were frozen, its economy cut off from the global financial system, its energy exports targeted.\nI can remember Western officials and commentators describing the sanctions as \u201ccrippling\u201d, \u201cdebilitating\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d. With adjectives like these filling the airwaves, the situation seemed clear. There was surely no way that Russia\u2019s economy would withstand the pressures.\nFaced with the prospect of economic collapse, the Kremlin would be forced to back down and withdraw its troops. Wouldn\u2019t it?\nTwenty-seven months on, the war rages on. Far from being crippled, Russia\u2019s economy is growing. The International Monetary Fund predicts that Russia will record economic growth of 3.2% this year. Caveats aside, that\u2019s still more than in any of the world\u2019s advanced economies.\n\u201cDebilitating\u201d sanctions have not produced shortages in the shops. Russian supermarket shelves are full. True, rising prices are a problem. And not everything that used to be on sale still is - a string of Western companies exited the Russian market in protest at the invasion of Ukraine.\nListen to Steve read this article on BBC Sounds\nBut many of their products still find their way into Russia through a variety of routes. If you look hard enough, you can still find American cola in Russian stores.\nCEOs from Europe and America may no longer be flocking to Russia\u2019s annual showcase economic event - but the organisers of this year\u2019s St Petersburg International Economic Forum (once referred to as Russia\u2019s Davos) claim that delegates from more than 130 countries and territories are taking part. \nInstead of folding under the weight of Western sanctions, the Russian economy has been developing new markets in the East and the Global South.\nAll of which allows Russian officials to boast that attempts to isolate Russia, politically and economically, have not succeeded.\n\u201cIt looks like the Russian economy managed to adjust to very unfavourable external conditions,\u201d says Yevgeny Nadorshin, senior economist at PF Capital. \u201dWithout any doubt sanctions broke a lot in the mechanism of operation inside the economy. But a lot has been restored. Adaptation is happening.\u201d\nDoes this mean that sanctions have failed?\n\u201cThe big issue was our understanding of what sanctions can and cannot do,\u201d says Elina Ribakova, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like flipping a switch and Russia disappears. What sanctions can do is to throw a country off balance temporarily until it finds the way to work around the sanctions, until it finds alternative ways to get shipments, or sell its oil. We\u2019re exactly in that space where Russia has found a workaround.\u201d\nMoscow has redirected its oil exports from Europe to China and India. In December 2022, G7 and EU leaders introduced a price cap plan aimed at limiting the revenue Russia earns from its oil exports, by trying to keep it below $60 a barrel. But Western experts concede that Russia has been able to circumvent this quite easily.\nThe story of the price cap highlights a dilemma for the US and its partners.\nRecognising that Russia is one of the largest players on the global energy market, they have tried to keep Russian oil flowing to avoid hiking energy prices. The result of that is that Moscow is still making money.\n\u201cIn a way, we refused to properly sanction Russian oil,\u201d Elina Ribakova concludes. \u201cThis price cap is an attempt to have our cake and eat it. The priorities are to allow Russian oil on to the market and to reduce Russia\u2019s revenue. And when these two priorities conflict, unfortunately the first one wins. That allows Russia to raise a lot of revenues and continue with the war.\u201d\nRussia has become China\u2019s biggest supplier of oil. But Beijing\u2019s importance for Moscow extends far beyond energy exports. China has become a lifeline for the Russian economy. Trade between the two countries hit a record $240bn (\u00a3188bn) last year.\nWalk around St Petersburg or Moscow and you don\u2019t need to be an expert in economics to understand how important China has become to a sanctions-hit Russia. Electronics shops here are full of Chinese tablets, gadgets and mobile phones. Chinese car dealers now dominate the local car market.\nNot that the Russian automobile industry is sitting twiddling its thumbs. At a business expo recently in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia\u2019s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin was shown the brand new version of a classic Russian brand, the Volga. There was just one thing - the new Volga is based on a Chinese car, the Changan.\n\u201cWhere was this steering wheel made? Is it Chinese?\u201d enquired the prime minister, apparently irritated by the lack of Russian components.\n\u201cWe want [the wheel] to be Russian,\u201d he said.\nUltimately, however, it is not the automobile industry that is",
    "A local politician has been attacked in the German city of Mannheim, five days after the fatal stabbing of a police officer in its market square.\nThe man, described as a local election candidate for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, was left with cuts in the attack, German press agency DPA reported. \nPolice confirmed the incident took place on Tuesday evening, close to scene of Friday's deadly attack that targeted organisers of a rally against radical Islam and which claimed the life of a 29-year-old officer.\nThey said the politician was taken to hospital for treatment, but had not suffered life-threatening injuries.\nThe local AfD association said its candidate had chased after a man tearing down election posters, who then cut him with a knife. \nSenior AfD politicians identified the victim of Tuesday's attack as Heinrich Koch, 62, a candidate standing in this weekend's municipal election in Mannheim.\nPolice in the south-western state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg said they arrested a 25-year-old suspect, who was then taken to a psychiatric hospital after showing clear signs of mental illness. \nThey stressed there was no concrete evidence that he had been aware that the victim was an AfD politician.\nThe latest incident in Mannheim came after an Afghan asylum seeker was detained on suspicion of repeatedly stabbing a police officer, who later died in hospital. Five other people were wounded in the attack, who had been preparing for a rally by a group opposed to radical Islam.\nThe killing sparked outrage in Germany, prompting the government to say it may allow deportations to Afghanistan.\nThe 25-year-old suspect in Friday's attack is said to have come to Germany as a refugee in 2013 and has since had two children. Deportations to Afghanistan were halted when the Taliban returned to power three years ago.\nThe violence comes as Germans prepare to vote on Sunday in European Parliament elections, as well as municipal elections in seven states including Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\nAll 27 EU countries are taking part in the European Parliament vote. The AfD is challenging the centre-left Social Democrats of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for second place, although the far-right party's top candidates have been hit by a succession of scandals.\n\"We are shocked and dismayed,\" Markus Frohnmaier, a top AfD official in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told German media in response to the latest incident.\nAttacks have also taken place in other areas of Germany ahead of Sunday's European elections, prompting the chancellor to warn last month of a threat to democracy.\nA candidate from Mr Scholz's party, Matthias Ecke, was seriously injured by a group of people as he put up posters in the eastern city of Dresden, and a female Greens politician there was also attacked. \nBerlin senator Franziska Giffey, who is a well-known former minister in Mr Scholz's party, was struck on the head and neck last month by a man as she visited a local library in the capital.\nThe mayor of Mannheim, Christian Specht, denounced the latest attack as abhorrent. \"The hatred and willingness to use violence that is currently erupting in our society is intolerable,\" he said in a statement.",
    "Adult stories in Hollywood movies are \"out of fashion\" according to five-time Oscar nominee Richard Linklater.\nLinklater is the Texas-based filmmaker behind hits including 2003\u2019s School of Rock and 2014\u2019s Boyhood, as well as a trilogy of love stories starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, known as the Before series. \nHe says it was a struggle to get the \"traditional\" film studios interested in his latest project, Hit Man, despite strong critical and audience reaction when the film premiered last year. The movie is being released by Netflix.\nHit Man stars Glen Powell and Adria Arjona in a romantic thriller comedy about a stuck-in-a-rut professor, Gary, who starts moonlighting as Ron, a fake hitman for a city police department and who falls for a woman who tries to enlist his services. \nThe movie has its roots in a true story, of Gary Johnson, a community professor who worked as a fake \u2018assassin\u2019 for Houston police, and whose story Linklater first read about in an article more than 20 years ago. Johnson died in 2022, just before the film was made.\nLinklater says that he and Glen Powell, who co-wrote the script, wanted to make the movie about \"passion\".\n\u201cI said, it\u2019s gonna have sex, it\u2019ll be passionate, it\u2019ll be carnal, the desire that drives everything,\" Linklater tells the BBC.\n\"Glen\u2019s character starts off very dispassionate, but by the end of the movie he\u2019s a different guy, he\u2019s discovered passion, and the movie has this strong chemistry and sexuality.\n\u201cI think what\u2019s out of fashion, people say there\u2019s no sex in movies anymore, but there isn\u2019t \u2018adult\u2019 in movies anymore, as sexuality in movies equals adult,\u201d the filmmaker continues.\n\u201cWhen I was 13 years old and looking at movies, I thought the adult world looked pretty interesting, it looked fun and I thought, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to get there!\u2019 But it wasn\u2019t just the sex, it was the adult situations they showed.\n\u201cBut somewhere along the way Hollywood inverted that. It\u2019s like they said, \u2018we\u2019re going to make films where you can stay 13 forever, you stay that little kid with little kid concerns\u2019, so I guess it drifted away as its complexities weren\u2019t the subject matter of mainstream cinema as it had been before.\u201d\nPowell, who starred recently in Top Gun: Maverick and in romcom Anyone But You with Sydney Sweeney, has previously collaborated with Linklater three times, including first as a teenager in 2006\u2019s Fast Food Nation.\nHe says in his opinion, \u201crelationships don\u2019t really crackle any more in movies\u201d and that he, Linklater and Father of the Bride actor Arjona talked constantly \u201cabout what\u2019s actually sexy\u201d when they were making the film.\nAlthough they worked with an intimacy co-ordinator, the sex scenes in the film were created from their own conversations.\n\u201cWe asked ourselves \u2018what is actually exciting to our audiences?\u2019 What is new?\u2019 And we had so much trust between the three of us, we could actually talk about his kind of stuff,\u201d Powell says.\n\u201cWe knew each other very well at this point. We had very honest conversations that I think made all those scenes in the movie. I really think viewers are emotionally invested in this in a way they haven\u2019t been in a long time.\u201d\nWhile stories centred around couples or even throuples have made a comeback in cinema - Kristen Stewart in bodybuilding thriller Love Lies Bleeding, and Zendaya, starring in tennis drama Challengers - Hollywood has had an anguished start to its mainstream summer blockbuster season. \nFuriosa, George Miller\u2019s lavish sequel to Mad Max: Fury Road underperformed to reach a box office of $144m (\u00a397m). \nThe Fall Guy, a big-budget romcom about a stuntman, starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, was also judged a flop after making $157m (\u00a3122m)\nHopes of success are now pinned on releases such as Marvel\u2019s Deadpool & Wolverine or, later this year, Ridley Scott\u2019s sequel to Gladiator with Paul Mescal.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get fired for doing a sequel or an origin story, something that already exists,\u201d Linklater comments, when asked whether studios fear risk-taking for commercial reasons.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get in trouble for what\u2019s obvious and commercial. What changed is that films got greenlit by the marketing department and then it\u2019s become really safe choices.\n\u201cI think of Hit Man as a movie to have fun with, there should always be room for some sexy couple movies, these are standards in cinema of what people want to see quite often,\u201d he adds.\nYet he says of the movie, which he and Glen Powell started writing during the Covid-19 pandemic, that \u201cthe industry really didn\u2019t want to make the film initially.\u201d\n\u201cIt was done very independently, Glen and I wrote it speculatively and we didn\u2019t get paid anything, we just tried to get the film made. We really felt we were onto something, we felt we had written a film noir, a crime film that\u2019s also a screwball comedy about a couple that you\u2019re rooting to be together, but I think they wanted it to be just one thing.\n\u201cAmong the frustrating conversations we had with studios and people like that was ",
    "Five people who helped launder the proceeds of a \u00a31.2m computer scam have been jailed.\nThe fraud targeted elderly and vulnerable people, tricking them into paying out thousands of pounds each to fix non-existent IT problems.\nBetween May 2015 and November 2019 the gang transferred \u00a31,289,837 to two brothers based in India, who had been posing as representatives of HP, Microsoft Norton and Epson to defraud their victims.\nAmanda Grigg, 66, of Truro, Gena Harrington, 39, of Birmingham, Bindu Devasia, 49, of Kent, Nicholas Alcide, 40, of Birmingham, and Jose Kuriakose, 50, of Kent, were sentenced at Leeds Crown Court on Monday.\nThe court heard victims were told the fictitious problems could be fixed for a fee and were persuaded into allowing remote access to their computers.\nOne man paid a total of \u00a34,427.96 to people who he believed worked for HP to resolve a supposed issue with his computer.\nThe money was then filtered through a series of companies set up by the gang before being transferred to India.\nAn investigation into the money laundering was led by the National Trading Standards eCrime Team, which is based at City of York Council and North Yorkshire Council.\nLord Michael Bichard, Chair of National Trading Standards, said the gang had \u201cno qualms about enriching themselves off the back of vulnerable and elderly victims\u201d.\n\u201cI hope that the sentences handed down today will serve as a powerful reminder to all money launderers that they risk prosecution - regardless of how well-coordinated their operations may seem,\u201d he added.\nThe investigation was  also supported by officers from West Midlands, Staffordshire and Wiltshire police services.\nAmy Hogan-Burney, general manager, cybersecurity policy and  protection at Microsoft said: \"Microsoft welcomes today's verdict and remains committed to working with governments and across industry to combat tech support fraud and hold perpetrators accountable.\"\nGrigg was jailed for three years, Kuriakose was jailed for four years and two months, and Harrington was jailed for two years and six months.

    "Three weeks after Robert Fico was gunned down in central Slovakia, he\u2019s made a full-throated return to political life - on the eve of the European elections.\nIn a Facebook video apparently recorded at home in Bratislava, the Slovak prime minister laid the blame for the attack on Slovakia\u2019s liberal opposition, the \"anti-government media\" and foreign-funded NGOs for creating a climate of hatred and intolerance that made the shooting possible.\nMr Fico, who was critically injured on 15 May after being shot multiple times in the abdomen, said he forgave his attacker - identified by prosecutors as 71-year-old Juraj C \u2013 and bore no hatred towards him.\nHowever, he said his assailant was an \u201cactivist of the Slovak opposition\u201d.\nThe man, who faces a lengthy prison sentence for attempted murder, was a \u201cmessenger of the evil and political hatred\u201d whipped up by Slovakia\u2019s \u201cunsuccessful and frustrated\u201d opposition, Mr Fico said.\nOpposition parties - in particular the liberal Progressive Slovakia, which is neck-and-neck with Mr Fico\u2019s left-populist Smer party ahead of the European Parliament elections  - have condemned the shooting and have categorically rejected all links with the attacker.\nMr Fico, who has served as prime minister for more than 10 of the last 18 years, returned to power last October at the head of a populist-nationalist coalition.\nSlovakia has become increasingly polarised in recent months and the attack has only deepened tensions.\n\nIn a video evidently recorded in the corridor of a police station hours after the attack in the central town of Handlova, the suspect \u2013 described as a poet and author - said he had been motivated by opposition to Mr Fico\u2019s policies, including the abolition of public broadcaster RTVS.\nFootage also emerged showing him at several anti-government demonstrations.\nHowever, older videos showed the man addressing a meeting of a far-right Slovak paramilitary organisation, so there is lingering confusion over his political beliefs.\nMr Fico, appearing well and dressed in a crisp white and blue patterned shirt, said if all went well he would be able to return to work at the end of June.\nHe appealed to the \"anti-government media\" - especially those outlets he said were co-owned by companies linked to US philanthropist George Soros as well as foreign-funded NGOs and the opposition - not to downplay the reasons for the assassination attempt.\nHe had warned for months, he said, that the likelihood of an attack on a government official was \u201capproaching certainty\".\nThe attack had taken place, he said, in an atmosphere where the opposition was exploiting the fact that the collective West was trying to force through a \u201csingle acceptable foreign policy\u201d, notably on Ukraine, and riding roughshod over smaller nations that were trying to embark on a sovereign path of their own.\nMr Fico opposes military aid to Kyiv and says Vladimir Putin has been \"wrongly demonised\" by the West.\nThe opposition\u2019s \u201cviolent or hateful excesses\u201d against a democratically-elected government had been met with silence by international organisations, he said, simply because opposition views were in line with Western policy on Ukraine.\nThis was the atmosphere in which the assassination attempt had taken place, he said.\n\u201cI should be full of anger, hatred and revenge,\u201d Mr Fico said.\n\u201c[But] I would like to express my belief that all the pain I have gone through and am still going through will serve something good.\"",
    "On 6 June 1944 thousands of men from the Allied forces attacked German troops in Normandy, France, as part of the military operation known as D-Day. \nMany of them had prepared for the operation in the south of England, including the US Army's Easy Company, of the 101st Airborne Division. The group of men, better known now as the \"Band of Brothers\" after the TV series of the same name, left a lasting impression on the Wiltshire village where they were based.\nAldbourne is an idyllic village in the Wiltshire countryside, surrounded by chalk hills and full of character.\nThe village green, a pond and old church paint a pretty picture of English country living, but it is also where, over the course of World War Two, British and Canadian forces were based.\nAnd then, in 1943, the Americans also arrived.\nThis included the now famous US paratrooper unit Easy Company - the \"Band of Brothers\" immortalised by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks in the 2001 television series, based on the book by Stephen E Ambrose.\nMany of the officers stayed in the old Rectory or people's homes, with their headquarters at Littlecote House. Other soldiers were housed in Nissen huts on Farm Lane, and overflows in the likes of the stables at Hightown.\nThe village had five pubs. The Blue Boar was the officers' pub, while the others served all soldiers, including The Crown, which remains open to this day and has a discreet blue plaque on the wall.\nSimon Crisp, villager and landlord of The Crown, said the pub's connection to Easy Company attracted people from far and wide - including hundreds of Americans who came on tours each year.\n\"For a very small village, the ties with America are quite big,\" he said.\n\"For me as a villager, and with veterans in my family, it's all about respect.\"\nFor the local people in 1943, the arrival of the \"yanks\" was an exciting prospect.\nThey brought with them sweets, chewing gum and dances.\nIn an oral history recorded in 2006 by the Memorial Hall Trustees, Audrey Barret said: \"They were all so friendly. To young people - and the boys - it was exciting. It was really an event when the Americans came.\"\nMs Barret remembered attending dances with them, adding: \"They would come into our house and write letters and chat and laugh.\"\nRosemary Connor was the daughter of the local barber and spoke to the BBC a decade ago when she was 86.\nShe said: \"We took to them fairly quickly. They could write home and tell their folks they had their hair cut by a lady barber.\"\nArchaeologist Richard Osgood - who is rarely seen without his Indiana Jones-style hat - said that for the Americans, the village was \"like waking up on a film set\", with thatched roofs and roses growing on trellises.\nHowever, with the war, the quiet village became much busier.\n\"It would have been bustling, would have people in jeeps, lots of training going on nearby. Hearing gunshots, maybe bigger things,\" he said.\nIn the village, the Easy Company prepared for the D-Day invasion. \nThe paratroopers flew from Upottery in Devon in the early hours of 6 June 1944, before parachuting into Normandy. \nDropped behind enemy lines, they would go on to fight numerous battles across Europe.\nEvidence of their time in Aldbourne lies just beneath the grass of the village playing field, which 80 years ago was covered in Nissen huts, the crescent-shaped buildings that housed the soldiers.\nFor the past several years, there have been archaeological digs at the site as part of a scheme called Operation Nightingale, led by Mr Osgood. \nVeterans and serving personnel are invited to work on the digs and say they feel a connection to the people whose lives they are finding out about too.\nPatrick Carter was a paratrooper with 101st airborne in the US and took part in a dig in May this year.\n\"With deployments, there's a lot of training beforehand and there's always a lot of boredom,\" he said.\n\"I can imagine sitting in one of these huts, bored, playing cards or playing marbles, like we keep finding.\"\nMeanwhile, UK Army veteran Chris Burdon found Operation Nightingale so beneficial, he has become a professional archaeologist.\nHe said: \"Combat is combat. The experiences are very, very similar. \n\"Even the life in camp - having to wake up early for morning runs, eating terrible food in the cookhouse, it still happens today.\n\"There is that connection there. Politics have changed, but the way soldiers live and what they do hasn't changed at all.\"\nMore than 20 years after the Band of Brothers television series, many of the actors also return to the village, with some also taking part in the digs.\nRick Warden, who played Lieutenant Harry Welsh, Alex Sabga-Brady, who played Corporal Frank Mellet, and Christian Black, who was Walter Hendrix, visited in May.\nMr Sabga-Brady said the actors were given the chance to meet the real veterans before filming.\n\"Seeing what it was all about, what they would do for the man next to them, that's what really struck with me personally,\" he said.\n\"To try and emulate and ca",

This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body.\nThis can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. \nAt the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. \nThis, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Symptoms include:\nIf blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises.\nOur bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 98F (37C) whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave.\nIt is the temperature our bodies have evolved to work at. \nBut as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down.\nIt opens more blood vessels near the skin to lose heat to our surroundings and starts sweating.\nAs the sweat evaporates, it dramatically increases the heat lost from the skin.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has some tips:\nUse thin sheets, cool your socks in the fridge before putting them on and stick to your usual bedtime routine, experts say.\nIf they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious.\nCDC advice says: \nHowever, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heat stroke.\nIt is a medical emergency and you should call 911.\nPeople with heat stroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot. Their temperature could go over 104F (40C) and they might have seizures or lose consciousness. \nOld age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body.\nDiabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. \nChildren and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it.\nPeople who are homeless will also be more exposed to the sun. Those living in top-floor flats will also face higher temperatures.\nYes - but people should keep taking their medication as normal and need to make more effort to stay cool and hydrated.\nDiuretics - sometimes called \"water pills\" - increase the amount of water the body expels. They are taken widely, including for heart failure. In high temperatures, they increase the dangers of dehydration and imbalances in key minerals in the body.\nAntihypertensives - which lower blood pressure - can combine with the blood vessels that are dilating to cope with the heat and cause dangerous drops in blood pressure.\nSome drugs for epilepsy and Parkinson's can block sweating and make it harder for the body to cool itself.\nAnd other drugs such as lithium or statins can become more concentrated and problematic in the blood if there is too much fluid loss. \nMore than 700 people in the US are killed by extreme heat each year, according to the CDC.\nMost of these will be heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable.\nThe higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 77F-79F (25C-26C).\nHowever, the evidence suggests the deaths tend to be caused by higher temperatures in spring or early summer rather than \"peak summer\".\nThis could be because we start to change our day-to-day behaviour as summer progresses and we get more used to dealing with the heat.\nThe evidence from previous heatwaves is the increase in deaths happens very quickly - within the first 24 hours of the heatwave. \nFollow James on Twitter.",
    "Millions of people in the US are expected to experience extreme temperatures this week as a result of a heat dome. \nScientists say many extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense as a result of climate change.\nFor every 1C rise in average temperature, the atmosphere can hold about 7% more moisture.\nThis can result in more droplets and heavier rainfall, sometimes in a shorter space of time and over a smaller area. \nGlobally, heavy rainfall events have become more frequent and intense over most land regions due to human activity, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC. \nIt says this pattern will continue with further warming.\nScientists assess whether individual extreme weather events can be attributed to climate change by considering both natural and human causes.\nIn the case of the intense rainfall which fell in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman in April 2024, it was difficult to conclude exactly how much of a role climate change played. \nHeavy rain in this region is rare, which offers researchers fewer historical comparisons.\nBut these types of events have become 10-40% heavier, and climate change is the most likely explanation, according to the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.  \nIn May 2024, southern Brazil experienced heavy rains which lead to widespread flooding, displacing about 150,000 people.\nThe Rio Grande do Sul region that was hit is particularly vulnerable to heavy rains, as it is the meeting point of tropical and polar air masses. \nBut climate expert Francisco Eliseu Aquino told the AFP news agency that \"these interactions [have] intensified with climate change\".\nScientists believe the heavy rainfall which caused deadly flooding in northern Libya in September 2023 was made up to 50 times more likely by climate change. \nYears of political instability in the region also hampered preparations for such events.\nEven a small increase in average temperatures makes a big difference to heat extremes.\nAs the range of daily temperatures shifts to warmer levels, hotter days are more likely and more intense.\nIn April 2024, temperatures in Mali hit 48.5C during an extreme heatwave across the Sahel region of Africa, which was linked to increased hospitalisations and deaths. \nThis level of heat would not have been possible without human-caused climate change, the WWA found, and will become more common as the world continues to warm. \nIn the UK, temperatures topped 40C for the first time on record in July 2022, causing extensive disruption. This would have been extremely unlikely without climate change, the WWA says.\nHeatwaves are also becoming longer in many places, including the UK.\nThis can happen as a result of heat domes, which are areas of high pressure where hot air is pushed down and trapped, causing temperatures to soar over large areas. \nOne theory suggests that higher temperatures in the Arctic - which has warmed nearly four times faster than the global average - are causing strong winds called the jet stream to slow, increasing the likelihood of heat domes. \nA heat dome is expected to hit the western part of the US later this week - affecting more than 34 million residents across California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona. \nForecasters predict temperatures to be 5.5-11C (10-20F) above normal, potentially posing a risk to human health and the environment from resulting wildfires.\nLinking climate change with specific individual droughts can be difficult. \nThe availability of water depends on more than just temperature and rainfall, with natural weather systems also playing a key role. This was the case with drought in southern Africa in early 2024.\nBut heatwaves fuelled by climate change can worsen droughts by drying out soil. This makes the air above warm up more quickly, leading to more intense heat.\nDuring periods of hot weather, increased demand for water, especially from farmers, puts even more stress on the water supply. \nIn parts of East Africa, there were five failed rainy seasons in a row between 2020 and 2022, as the region suffered its worst drought for 40 years. This displaced 1.2 million people in Somalia alone.\nClimate change has made droughts like this at least 100 times more likely, according to the WWA. \nHuman-caused warming was also the main driver of the Amazon rainforest's worst drought in at least half a century in the second half of 2023.\nFires happen naturally in many parts of the world. It's difficult to know if climate change has caused or worsened a specific wildfire because other factors are also relevant, such as changing land use.\nBut climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, the IPCC says. \nExtreme, long-lasting heat draws more moisture out of soils and vegetation. \nThese tinder-dry conditions provide fuel for fires, which can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong.\nCanada experienced by far its its worst wildfire season on record in 2023.\nClimate change more th",
    "Canada is searching for an international grocer to enter its domestic market, after years of anger from shoppers over high food prices, much of it directed at one of the big players. But would an Aldi or a Lidl solve the problem?\nLate last year, Emily Johnson took to Reddit to share her frustration with how expensive food in Canada has become.\nShe fixated on one grocer in particular: Loblaw, the dominant food retailer in Canada, boasting nearly 2,500 stores.\nHer Reddit group - named LoblawsIsOutofControl - was filled with photos of grocery items for sale at seemingly egregious prices, like C$40 ($29.36; \u00a323.06) for 1.4 kilograms of chicken.\nSoon after, Ms Johnson and others banded together to launch a nation-wide boycott against Loblaw, saying they were fed up with the disparity between rising food prices and record profits.\nThe company, which also operates pharmacy and discount grocery stores, made a profit of C$2.5bn in 2023 - a nearly 10% increase from a year earlier.\nAs anger grew, the grocer\u2019s former president Galen Weston, who has defended the profits, became the de facto face of food inflation in Canada, thanks to his regular appearances in Loblaw commercials and his annual reported salary of C$8.4m.\nSome even began selling T-shirts featuring a spoof \u201cRoblaw$\u201d logo, which were met with copyright infringement complaints from the grocer.\nThe boycott, which began in May and is set to continue indefinitely, has since sparked a national conversation on how groceries in Canada are priced, and why a company like Loblaw continues to be profitable as more Canadians struggle to afford food.\nIt has also ignited political pressure and scrutiny on the grocery practices of not just Loblaw, but other major grocers in the country.\n\u201cGroceries did not used to be such an issue but the prices have skyrocketed this past year so we\u2019re going without anything frivolous,\u201d Terra Suffel, a 49-year-old single mother of two living in Toronto, told the BBC.\nA C$200 shopping spree used to feed Ms Stuffel and her children for the entire week, she said. Now it barely covers lunch ingredients and much-needed pantry items.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really afford much meat and our main protein is now eggs,\u201d she said, adding that she, too, is boycotting Loblaw.\nIn response to frustrated Canadians like her, Canada\u2019s federal innovation minister has since taken several overseas trips to woo an international grocer to set up shop in Canada, in an attempt to increase competition and therefore drive down food prices.\nBut experts say that any foreign grocer looking to enter Canada\u2019s market faces an uphill battle to distinguish itself from existing players, and that the country\u2019s unaffordability crisis may require a more complex fix.\nLoblaw has responded to the boycott by saying they remain committed to be the \u201cretailer of choice\u201d for Canadians.\nIn a statement to the BBC, the company added that it was doing what it could to fight inflation and plans on opening more discount stores to make affordable food more accessible.\nLike many other countries, Canadians saw the cost of living go up after the Covid-19 pandemic thanks to supply-chain issues and labour shortages.\nAlthough food inflation in Canada peaked at a lower mark, 11.4%, than in the UK and US, according to data by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the overall figure does not tell the whole story.\nA price comparison between the three countries of some everyday items suggests Canada is indeed more expensive for some of those regular shopping basket contents.\nCanadians are also grappling with a currency that is plummeting in value compared to the US dollar, which has impacted both the price of food imported from the US, as well as Canadians\u2019 overall purchasing power.\nRising interest rates, coupled with higher rent and home prices, have also pinched the wallets of many in Canada.\n\u201cPeople are feeling (the rising cost of food) because they are also feeling the rise of mortgage payments and other things,\u201d said Jordan LeBel, a marketing professor with expertise in the food industry at Concordia University in Montreal.\n\nAnother issue is the heavily consolidated nature of Canada\u2019s grocery market, said Prof LeBel.\nThe country\u2019s industry is dominated by three large companies: Loblaw (which operates Loblaw's stores), Empire (which operates Sobeys stores) and Metro.\nThey make up nearly 60% of the grocery market share while Walmart and Costco make up much of the rest.\nIn comparison, the US grocery market features more regional players. And while Walmart is by far the most popular chain across the country, there are more than a dozen other grocers meaningfully competing with it.\nSimilarly, the UK\u2019s market is also diverse, with a total of 14 businesses turning over more than \u00a31bn in groceries sales per year.\nProf LeBel said the Loblaw boycott is a signal from Canadians who are fed-up with the lack of choice and the country\u2019s grocery behemoths, who lack an incentive to meaningfully tackle rising",
    "A four-month-old baby died from head injuries after he was violently shaken by a 16-year-old boy his mother was in a relationship with, a court has heard. \nElijah Shemwell was rushed to hospital on 2 January 2022 after he was found \"not breathing very well\" and \u201cpale and limp\u201d at his home in Belper, Derbyshire, when his mother India Shemwell returned from a shop.\nHe died in hospital three days later.\nElijah had been in the care of Carl Alesbrook, now 19, who is standing trial at Derby Crown Court accused of the baby's murder.\nThe court was told the defendant, of Upper Greenhill Gardens, Matlock, also caused rib and limb fractures to Elijah, one to two days prior to his hospital admission.\nElijah had bruises and fractures to his torso, which were indicative of forceful gripping, the court was told.\nProsecutor Vanessa Marshall KC said a doctor who examined Elijah on 4 January, noted 17 surface injuries which, in his view, were \"caused by inflicted trauma\".\nShe said the bruises Elijah - known as Eli - presented with, were ones \"a four-month-old baby should not have\".\nMs Marshall added that \"although a four-month-old baby may just have learnt how to roll over, they are not capable of sitting, crawling or standing.\n\"Nor are they capable of generating enough force with a toy to bruise themselves.\"\nThe prosecutor added Elijah was left in the defendant\u2019s care frequently between mid-November 2021and early January 2022.\nShe said: \u201cRather than protect him, it is the prosecution's case that instead, this defendant shook Elijah on at least two occasions, resulting in symptoms of brain damage or dysfunction and subdural bleeding, prior to a final shake on 2 January, which caused catastrophic head injuries and his premature death a few days later.\"\nThe court heard a post-mortem examination found the cause of death was head injury, and \"as a result of the brain injury, Elijah suffered a period of cardiac arrest causing further brain damage\".\nElijah\u2019s mother India Shemwell started a relationship with the defendant, who was living in a care home at the time of the alleged attacks, in November 2021 but remained emotionally and sexually involved with Elijah's father, the court was told.\nThe prosecution said this \u201cmay well have caused this young defendant, some understandable frustration at the uncertainty of the status of his relationship with the mother of Eli, and may have had some bearing on why the defendant treated Eli in the way the prosecution say he did\u201d.\nThe court heard although Ms Shemwell, who was 21 when her son died, was \"a thoroughly inadequate mother who neglected Elijah, \"it is not the prosecution\u2019s case that she caused any of the injuries\".\nMr Alesbrook is also accused of inflicting grievous bodily harm and causing grievous bodily harm with intent, relating to two previous earlier alleged attacks on Elijah.\nHe denies all three charges.\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Former Post Office chair Alice Perkins was warned about potential faults in the Horizon IT system as early as 2011, an inquiry has heard.\nAt the time, the Post Office had prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters for fraud on the strength of faulty data from Horizon accounting software.\nIt would carry on with these cases until 2015.\nMs Perkins, who was giving evidence at an inquiry into the scandal, said at the time she did not make a link between the two.\nShe was also told that the Post Office had \"driven a very hard bargain\" on the price of Horizon, and in return developer Fujitsu had cut corners on the quality of the software.\nThe inquiry was shown a handwritten note from Ms Perkins about a meeting on 27 September 2011 with Angus Grant, an auditor at Ernst & Young (EY).\nAccording to the note, Mr Grant had flagged concerns about Horizon, describing the program as \"a real risk for us\".\nHe also warned that if Horizon was not accurate, then EY would not be able to sign off Post Office company accounts.\n\"Does it capture data accurately?\" was a concern raised by Mr Grant, according to Ms Perkins' note.\nLead counsel for the inquiry, Jason Beer, said the information given by Mr Grant had been \"very significant\".\nIn 2011, some 11,900 Post Offices branches still used the computer system to process millions of transactions worth billions of pounds per year, he said.\n\"[If it's] a real risk to the independent professional auditors, then it's also a real risk to the Post Office too, isn't it?\" Mr Beer said.\nMs Perkins said her meeting with Mr Grant was one of her first as chair, and she had interpreted his point \"as a point from the perspective of the auditors, and their ability to audit the accounts\".\n\"I don't think - wrongly - that I would have made the connection to the operation of Horizon at the branch level,\" she said.\n\"Doesn't one follow the other?\" Mr Beer replied.\n\"I don't remember that that was the connection I made at the time,\" Ms Perkins said.\n\nAccording to Ms Perkins' note, Mr Grant had gone on to discuss cases of alleged fraud by sub-postmasters at the time, pointing out that \"suspects suggest it's a systems problem\".\nBut again, Ms Perkins said she did not make the connection between potential problems with Horizon and what sub-postmasters were saying in their defence.\nMr Beer asked Ms Perkins whether the note was \"deeply problematic for you, because you did nothing with the information given to you?\" \nBut Ms Perkins said that she did not accept that. At the time she was meeting with \"a great number of people, who were giving me a lot of information about the Post Office\" which she was trying to make sense of and take on board.\nIt \"did not ring alarm bells\", she added.\nAccording to the note, Mr Grant also told Ms Perkins that the Post Office had driven \"a very hard bargain\" on the price of Horizon, but that Fujitsu \"took back on quality/assurance\". \nHe also suggested the Post Office was being \"naive\".\nMs Perkins told the inquiry it was not uncommon for organisations contracting with IT companies \"to be at a disadvantage\" and that she had concerns about the relationship with Fujitsu being unequal.",
    "Republicans in the US House of Representatives have asked the Department of Justice (DoJ) to charge President Joe Biden's son and brother, Hunter and James Biden, with lying to Congress.\nOn Wednesday, while Hunter was in federal court on a separate matter, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability sent criminal referrals to the department, alleging the two lied about making millions through \"influence peddling schemes\".\nThe committee said they were trying \"to shield Joe Biden from the impeachment inquiry\", referring to a slow-going Republican push to remove the president.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve caught President Biden\u2019s son and brother making blatant lies to Congress in what appears to be a concerted effort to hide Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in his family\u2019s schemes,\u201d the committee's chairman, James Comer, said in a new release.\nThe move comes as Hunter is on trial in Wilmington, Delaware for allegedly lying about being a drug user in order to purchase a handgun. There are reports that James could testify for the defence.\n\u201cThese criminal referrals are a reflection of criminal wrongdoing by the Biden family, and the Department of Justice must take steps to hold the Bidens accountable,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan, one of the most vocal supporters of impeachment and of President Biden's election opponent, Donald Trump.\nHunter and James Biden were both ordered to testify to Congress in December 2023. They each met separately with the committee in February, where they allegedly lied.\nRepublicans have made multiple claims that the Biden men used the family name to unfairly enrich themselves, profiting off Joe Biden\u2019s political career.\nThe White House has previously dismissed such claims as \u201cbaseless innuendo\u201d. \nIt is unlikely that the DoJ, which is led by Attorney General Merrick Garland - a  Biden appointee - will pursue the charges requested by Republicans. \nMr Garland appointed a special counsel for the gun case against Hunter Biden in order to preserve the independence of the investigation.\nHowever, if Donald Trump wins the November election, a new attorney general could choose to go ahead with charges. \nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy opened the impeachment inquiry into President Biden last September, and the full House of Representatives voted to formalise it in December. \nConservative Marjorie Taylor Greene has threatened to bring articles of impeachment before the House for a vote, but current Speaker Mike Johnson has said he would like the investigation process to continue.",

    "The Israeli military says it has taken \u201coperational control\u201d over eastern areas of Bureij refugee camp and the town of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, as dozens of Palestinians were reported killed.\nOn Wednesday morning, the military said troops backed by air strikes had begun an operation against \u201cterrorists and terrorist infrastructure above and below ground\".\nResidents reported intense bombardment and the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said at least 70 dead people - the majority women and children - had been brought to a local hospital since Tuesday.\nIt came as US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators meet in Doha and Cairo to discuss how to finalise a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.\nThe US said on Tuesday it was still waiting for a response from Hamas to what it described as an Israeli proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden last week.\nQatar said it had delivered the plan to Hamas representatives and noted that it was also still waiting for a clear position from the Israeli government.\nHamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said on Wednesday the group would deal \"seriously and positively\" with a proposal based on an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\nIsrael's prime minister has insisted he will not agree to a permanent ceasefire before Hamas is defeated and the hostages it is holding are released. And on Wednesday,  Defence Minister Yoav Gallant declared that \"all negotiations with Hamas will be conducted under fire\".\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 36,580 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nBureij is one of the smallest of Gaza\u2019s eight historic refugee camps. It covers an area of 0.5 sq km (0.2 sq miles) and had 46,000 residents registered with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) before the war.\nThe camp is just to the south of the Wadi Gaza riverbed and the IDF\u2019s \u201cCentral Gaza Strip Corridor\u201d - a section of land controlled by Israeli forces which runs east to west from the border with Israel to the Mediterranean Sea, dividing Gaza in two.\nThe Nuseirat and Maghazi refugee camps are also located near Bureij, while the town of Deir al-Balah is about 5km (3 miles) to the south-west.\nThe four areas are currently crowded with people displaced by fighting elsewhere, including many of the more than a million who have fled the southern city of Rafah since the start of an Israeli ground operation there a month ago.\nEarlier this year, IDF troops carried out a ground operation against Hamas fighters in the camps of central Gaza that lasted several weeks.\nOn Wednesday, the IDF said the new \"targeted\" operation in Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah was aimed at dismantling \"terrorist infrastructure located several kilometres away from the border with Israel above and below ground\".\n\u201cThe activity started with a series of aerial strikes on terror targets, including military compounds, weapons storage facilities, and underground infrastructure,\" its statement added. \"During the strikes, several Hamas terrorists were eliminated.\u201d\nLater, the IDF put out a new statement announcing that troops had \u201cgained operational control\u201d of eastern Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah. It added that they had \u201celiminated terrorists\u201d in the areas, destroyed rocket and mortar launchers, and located several tunnel shafts.\nA man from Bureij told BBC Arabic\u2019s Gaza Today programme that his family fled the camp as the Israeli bombardment intensified on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe were stunned that the army was conducting a ground operation again in Bureij,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were struck by shells falling on us from all sides, landing on citizens\u2019 homes, on the streets... which led to the killing of a number of citizens.\u201d\n\u201cThe situation in general is extremely difficult,\u201d he added. \u201cWe left our homes in order to preserve our lives and the lives of our children.\u201d\nA young woman said: \u201cFragments fell into our home and into some of the residential apartments in our building... We survived because we all were on the lower floors.\u201d\n\u201cWe were in a residential building full of approximately 40 people, some of whom were residents of the building itself and others were people who were displaced from the north and the south, in Rafah... Now where should we head to from Bureij?\u201d\nOn Wednesday morning, Palestinian news agency Wafa cited medics and rescue workers as saying at least 11 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on several homes in Maghazi overnight.\nAnother two people were killed in a strike on a home near the entrance to Bureij, while two more were killed by artillery fire in the Abu al-Ajen area, south-east of Deir al-Balah, it said.\nLater, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said its medical team on the ground had described the situation at Deir al-Balah's al-Aqsa hospital - one of t",

    "A German-style pillbox used for Army training in the run-up to D-Day has become home to some of Britain\u2019s most protected bat species.\nDunwich Heath and Beach on the Suffolk coast provided a vital training area for British soldiers during World War Two by mimicking German defences. \nOne of its few surviving pillboxes was modified to provide a suitable bat habitat by the National Trust and brown long-eared and Natterer\u2019s bats have roosted there. \nThe trust's Richard Gilbert said converting the pillbox \"was a fantastic way to honour Dunwich\u2019s lasting heritage\".\nThe heath hosts nine species in all, including three species of pipistrelle bat, the noctule, serotine, Daubenton\u2019s bat and the barbastelle, which is considered one of the UK\u2019s most vulnerable species, the charity said.\nNeither the brown long-eared nor Natterer's bat are currently endangered, according to the Bat Conservation Trust.\nThe area around Westleton Walks and Dunwich Heath was the base for Exercise Kruschen in 1943, one of the first large-scale military exercises designed to help with the planning of D-Day.\nIt was an attempt by the Allied high command to avoid repeating the disastrous 1942 raid on Dieppe in Normandy, which caused heavy casualties.\nDefences were built to closely replicate their real German counterparts, with trenches, minefields, barbed wire and anti-tank measures.\nBats were already roosting in the pillbox when the National Trust was granted permission to turn it into a hibernaculum in 2012 \u2013 an underground chamber that provides a stable temperature and moist humidity for bats to roost in, creating shelter and reducing the risk of interference from other mammals.\nMr Gilbert, Dunwich\u2019s property operations manager, was then an area manager for the trust.\nHe and a team of volunteers sealed up the pillbox's openings, created new access slits and added specially-designed bat bricks.\nVarious surveys since have revealed a number of bat species taking up home in the bunker-like structure. Several brown long-eared bats were in residence in February.\nMr Gilbert said: \"Lots of visitors are surprised by the significant contribution the heath made to the D-Day landings.\n\"By repurposing [the pillbox] into a bat hibernaculum we\u2019ve been able to not only extend its legacy but also encourage nature to thrive and support the wider biodiversity of the heath and woodlands.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Actress Christina Applegate has spoken about her feelings of \"real depression\", following her multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis in 2021.\nThe actress, known for Anchorman, Married With Children and Bad Moms, said she was \"still mad about\" having the disease.\nSpeaking on the latest episode of her Messy podcast, Applegate said: \"I don\u2019t enjoy living. I don\u2019t enjoy it. I don\u2019t enjoy things anymore.\"\nMS is a disease where the body's own immune cells attack the brain and spinal cord, leading to symptoms including muscle stiffness and problems walking and talking.\nApplegate said she currently felt like she was experiencing \"a real, [screw]-it-all depression\".\n\"Like, a real depression, where it\u2019s kind of scaring me too a little bit because it feels really fatalistic, it feels really \u2018end of,'\" she said.\n\"I don\u2019t mean that, but I\u2019m trapped in this darkness right now that I haven\u2019t felt in probably 20-something years.\"\nAs a result of her mental health struggles, Applegate said she had booked an appointment with her therapist, \"which was a big thing for me to do\".\nApplegate said she had previously avoided therapy because she was \"afraid to start crying... and I'm not going to be able to end crying\".\nShe added she was dealing with her medical diagnosis with self-deprecation to \"make people feel more comfortable about it\".\nThe actress has been praised for speaking openly about the condition in recent years, and making public appearances on red carpets with her walking stick.\nApplegate won an Emmy Award for playing Rachel's sister Amy in Friends, and was also nominated for her performance in comedy-drama series Dead To Me.\nOn the podcast, Applegate revealed she had turned down an opportunity to star in The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills around 10 years ago. \nMultiple Sclerosis is a disease that affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord.\nThe nerves in these areas are surrounded by a protein called myelin, which helps signals from the brain get to the rest of the body.\nThe myelin becomes damaged in people with MS because the immune system mistakes it for something that shouldn't be there and attacks it.\nThis means signals from the brain struggle to get through properly.\nMS affects the body in different ways and has many symptoms, but people with MS won't normally experience them all.\nSome of the most common symptoms include: feeling very tired during the day; bladder problems; problems with balance and co-ordination - for example when walking.\nProblems seeing - like blurring and loss of vision are also common, as is muscle stiffness and uncontrolled movements, or spasms.",
    "An architect said he has taken inspiration from an open courtyard found in traditional Korean homes for this year's summer pavilion at the Serpentine Galleries in central London.\nArchipelagic Void is the 23rd iteration of the Serpentine Pavilion in London\u2019s Kensington Gardens and opens on 7 June.\nIt will host a soundscape, library and a series of performances and talks.\nSouth Korean architect Minsuk Cho said he was \"honoured and grateful\" to unveil the pavilion.\nThe new structure is comprised of five \u201cislands\u201d, each unique in size and form.\nEach island will host a different area including the gallery, library, an auditorium, a tea house and a play tower.\nThe islands leave a void at the centre inspired by an open courtyard, known as a madang, in traditional Korean houses.\nCho said: \"To realise the pavilion, we began by asking what can be uncovered and added to the Serpentine site, which has already featured over 20 historical iterations at the centre of the lawn, from a roster of great architects and artists.\n\u201cTo approach this new chapter differently, instead of viewing it as a carte blanche, we embraced the challenge of considering the many existing peripheral elements while exploring the centre as a void.\"\nThe gallery will be host to a six-channel sound installation created by musician and composer Jang Young-Gyu.\nThe music incorporates sounds from nature and human activities recorded in Kensington Gardens with traditional Korean vocal music and instruments.\nThe Library Of Unread Books has been created by artist Heman Chong and archivist Renee Staal.\nThe tea house is a nod to the history of the Serpentine South building, which originally served as a tea house until the early 1960s.\nThe pavilion also features a play tower with a bright orange net for visitors to climb.\nThe largest structure of the islands is the auditorium with benches built into its inner walls, providing an area for performances and talks.\nCho told BBC News the growing international interest in South Korean culture in recent years had given him more opportunities to be involved in global projects.\nBut he said South Korea was still \u201cjust starting to be known\u201d as he often found himself explaining the economic and cultural context of the country for a significant time when presenting his work.\nHe said: \u201cAmerican architects, for example, don\u2019t have to go through the whole history of America when they explain their work. \n\"I\u2019m grateful that people are curious, but one has the privilege of being a little more known than the other side. \n\"I don\u2019t think the world is completely flat, there's a bit of a slope.\"\nHis Seoul-based company Mass Studies has several major cultural projects on its way.\nIt is in the process of converting an old thermoelectric power station from the 1930s into a cultural complex, which Cho describes as a \u201cbudget Tate Modern project\u201d by the Han River.\nAnother is a vertical stack of cinemas for the new \u201cSeoul Cinematheque\u201d in the historic Chungmuro film industry centre in Seoul, which he says will create space for archive films and encourage the next generation of independent filmmakers.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Kanye West says he will counter-sue his former assistant, after she filed court documents accusing him of sexual harassment and breach of contract.\nIn her lawsuit, Lauren Pisciotta alleged the star sent her vulgar texts and performed sex acts while on the phone with her.\nWest's legal representative has now called those accusations \u201cbaseless\u201d and accused Pisciotta of engaging in \u201cblackmail and extortion\u201d after the star rejected her sexual advances.\n\"In response to these baseless allegations, Ye will be filing a lawsuit against Ms. Pisciotta,\" they added, using the rapper's current preferred name.\nPisciotta is believed to have worked for West from 2021 to 2022, initially on his fashion line before becoming his personal assistant on a salary of $1m (\u00a3780,000) per year.\nShe has alleged that, during her employment, the star bombarded her with explicit text, some of which included pornographic videos.\nPisciotta also claimed that he masturbated while talking to her on the phone and that, on one occasion, pleasured himself in front of her after \"trapping\" her in a private room on his plane.\nIn her lawsuit, the former OnlyFans model said she was abruptly fired in 2022, and never received her promised severance package.\nWest's lawyer challenged the story, saying that Pisciotta \"was terminated for being unqualified\" and \"demanding unreasonable sums of money\",  including an annual salary of $4m (\u00a33.13m).\nThey also accused Pisciotta of \"lascivious, unhinged conduct\", claiming that she \"consistently used sexual coercion\" to demand money and material items, including  designer handbags and a Lamborghini car.\nThe statement further alleged that, after West rejected her advances, Pisciotta attempted to blackmail him for $60m (\u00a347m).\nThe BBC contacted Ms Pisciotta to request a response, but she did not immediately respond.\nOn Tuesday, she posted a message to her Instagram story that read: \"Your soul becomes aligned with freedom when you allow others the liberty to dislike you, judge you and disagree with you.\"",
    "It\u2019s impossible not to be swept away by the warmth and energy in the stone-clad villages up and down the Normandy coastline this 80th anniversary of D-Day.\nBritish, US and Canadian flags flutter from garden gates and lampposts as far as the eye can see. Music from the 1940s drifts through village squares, while country lanes roar with column-upon-column of World War Two-era military jeeps.\nDriving them are laughing, waving men and women from all over Europe. Germans, Dutch, Belgians and Brits from all walks of life, who this week have chosen to don Second World War Allied military uniforms, to honour the 150,000 soldiers who landed here in Nazi-occupied France on 6 June 1944 - changing the course of 20th-Century Europe as they did so.\nHow different things look now. After decades of Europeans pledging \u201cnever again\u201d, war is back on this continent on a scale not seen since World War Two, with Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nEighty years ago, Germany was the enemy. Russia, a key ally. Its pyrrhic victory on the eastern front was fundamental, like the western front Allied assault that followed D-Day, in bringing Nazi Germany to its knees.\nYet this Thursday, at the official international D-Day ceremony, Germany\u2019s Chancellor Olaf Scholz will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron, US President Joe Biden and the heir to the British throne, Prince William.\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky has been invited too. Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin most pointedly has not.\nPresident Macron\u2019s office insists the World War Two sacrifice of the Soviet people and their contribution to victory will be honoured this year as always. But it says \u201cit will be remembered that the Eastern front was not just Russia, but also the Ukrainians, the Belarusians and all the other countries that were part of the USSR.\u201d\nThe pain and humiliation of occupation, the deprivation of freedom facing or threatening millions in Ukraine, is something the Normands understand all too well. They make sure younger generations appreciate what Allied soldiers risked - and lost - to liberate them.\nThe star attraction in Normandy this week is certainly not world leaders. It\u2019s the surviving D-Day veterans, the youngest of whom are now in their 90s. Wherever they travel along the coast, they\u2019re feted, photographed and fawned over, especially by the locals.\nI met young mum Vanessa Foulon, queuing with her six-year-old son to get a D-Day commemorative cap signed by an American veteran. Why is this so important to them, I asked? \n\u201cLibert\u00e9\u201d she said simply. \u201cThey gave us our freedom.\u201d And she burst into tears.\n\u201cPeople here are nice,\u201d 99-year-old US veteran Donald Cobb told me. \u201cWe enjoy coming back.\u201d\nHe\u2019d been taking part in a veterans\u2019 march in picturesque Sainte-Marie-du-Mont. The streets here are festooned with banners claiming to be \u201cthe first liberated village\u201d.\nDonald remembers landing on nearby Omaha beach at 05:30 on 6 June 1944. The water was choppy, the wind biting, he says.\nAt 19, he must have been petrified. \n\u201cHonestly,\u201d he said, \u201cI would rather have been anywhere else.\u201d \nYet his modesty was humbling. \n\u201cWe did what we had to do,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like a hero, I\u2019m glad we were able to help. I feel good about that.\u201d\nFrance feels conflicted about its own wartime history. The country was split after it signed an armistice agreement with Nazi Germany in 1940. The Germans occupied northern France and all along the Atlantic coast, to the Spanish border. The south was managed by France\u2019s Vichy government, which collaborated with the Nazis.\nYet D-Day events marking the contribution of French men and women who worked for the French Resistance seem somewhat muted, compared to the boisterous array of events commemorating Allied soldiers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t forget them. Please don\u2019t forget them,\u201d urged Catherine Nivromont, looking at me intently with her clear blue eyes.\nCatherine\u2019s brother, Pierre, was just 17 in 1944. He worked with other Resistance members, gathering intelligence on German positions along the Normandy coast, to help Allied forces plan their June assault.\nPierre was in touch with locals who did German soldiers\u2019 laundry. Their clothing was marked with battalion details, revealing the quantity and location of troops.\n\u201cEach person played their small part,\" Catherine said. \"Under occupation, you had to resist silently, secretly. You never knew who you could trust.\u201d\nBoth her brother, Pierre, and her father - who was also in the Resistance - were eventually betrayed by a Frenchman they had relied on to help make fake passports for Allied airmen stuck behind enemy lines.\nBoth men were sent to Nazi concentration camps, initially to Auschwitz, and were separated afterwards.\n\u201cI think his homeland was more important to him than family,\u201d Catherine observed a little sadly. \u201cThe risks he took were huge.\u201d\nBut you\u2019re proud of him, I asked? \n\u201cOh, yes. So proud. That is why I see it as my job to still visit schools and universities. To",
    "Tens of thousands of Israelis, many from nationalist groups, have taken part in the annual Jerusalem Day flag march to mark the capture of the east of the city in the 1967 war.\nCrowds waving Israeli flags and shouting anti-Arab slogans gathered outside the Old City\u2019s Damascus Gate before marching to the Western Wall through the Muslim Quarter - an act seen by Palestinians as a provocation.\nPalestinian shops along the procession route closed, amid a heavy Israeli police presence, with 3,000 officers deployed.\nPolice later said that 18 people were arrested, including five for attacking journalists.\nIsrael\u2019s Haaretz newspaper - whose journalist Nir Hasson was among those assaulted - reported that hundreds of young men rampaged through the Muslim Quarter before the event began, chanting \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d and attacking Palestinians and other people. \nThe flag march is always tense, but fears of violence were higher this year because of the war in Gaza.\nIsrael\u2019s far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, took part in the march and said at the start that it was sending a message to Hamas that \u201cJerusalem is ours\u201d.\n\u201cWith the help of God, the full victory is ours,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a special meeting in honour of Jerusalem Day that Israel was \"surrounded by enemies\" as it had been 57 year ago.\n\"They thought to strangle us, to wipe us off the map. But we are an ancient people, a people of brave fighters. We stood up as one and we defended ourselves,\" he said. \"We are also doing so today against Hamas in the south, Hezbollah in the north and Iran in the east.\u201d\nHamas\u2019s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, condemned what he called the \u201crampage of settlers\u201d in Jerusalem.\n\u201cOur people will not rest until the occupation ends,\u201d he vowed.\nJerusalem, with its major Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites, is at the heart of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nIsrael - which occupied the formerly Jordanian-held east of the city in 1967, and effectively annexed it in 1980 in a move not recognised by most countries - regards the whole of Jerusalem as its capital.\nPalestinian leaders want East Jerusalem - which is home to about 350,000 Palestinians and 230,000 Israeli settlers - to be the capital of a future independent Palestinian state.\nOn the day of the Israeli flag march in 2021, Hamas fired rockets at Jerusalem, triggering a war in Gaza that lasted 11 days.\nThe current war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages.\nAt least 36,580 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.",
    "The UK is at risk of \"uncontrolled chemicals\" which could harm people and the environment, say experts.\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) has called for the establishment of a Chemicals Agency to take charge of the regulation of chemicals in the UK.\nIt said the rise in the use of pollutants often referred to as \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 is an example of where regulation is \u201cfalling through the cracks\u201d.\nThe government has been approached for comment.\nRSC said they decided to make a public intervention after waiting for more than four years for clarity on how chemicals should be regulated following the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.\nPrior to 2020, the UK and the 27 current EU countries worked in tandem to research and monitor chemicals, and set rules around their use. \nFollowing Brexit, the UK has undertaken sole responsibility for chemical regulation domestically, but there have been delays establishing a new system.\n\u201cThe current regulatory regime for chemicals in the UK is not fit-for-purpose, failing to support innovation or to adequately protect our waterways, soil, air and built environment,\u201d said Professor Gillian Reid, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry.\nLast month the government announced it was consulting on a new chemicals\u2019 registration process \u2013 intended to be the key mechanism by which the UK will track which chemicals are being imported into the country.\nThe process was intended to be in place from the day the UK officially left the EU, four years ago, in 2020. The RSC said the delay is impacting dozens of industries which operate across the UK and EU market - from cosmetics, to food manufacturing, to agriculture.\nStephanie Metzger, policy advisor at the RSC and co-author of the report, said: \u201cBusinesses are in this 'limbo' phase. This makes it really difficult for them to plan financially what they are going to invest in, and decide what research they might want to do.\u201d\nThe Chemical Industries Association (CIA), the trade body for businesses working with chemicals, agreed that its members needed clarity, but said it was \u201cpremature\u201d to call for a Chemicals Agency, claiming it would merely delay the government process further.\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry maintains that a centralised Chemicals Agency will also help to coordinate scientific studies.  \nAt the moment, the RSC claims research into different chemicals can take place across more than five government agencies, leading to \u201cfragmentation, duplication of efforts and a lack of clarity\u201d, according to Prof Reid.\n\u201cIn addition, the civil service is under-resourced and struggling to recruit and train skilled staff, making it difficult for government to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in chemicals and testing,\u201d she said.\nIn the last few years there has been growing evidence of the presence of potentially toxic chemicals like PFAS - or Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances - building up in UK soil and waterways.\nHigh doses of these pollutants, also known as \u2018forever chemicals\u2019, have been linked to serious health concerns, including cancer and fertility issues.\nLast week, researchers at the University of Cardiff found traces of a forever chemical which had never been manufactured in the UK present in an otter population in northeast England.\nDr Elizabeth Chadwick, from Cardiff University, who co-authored the research paper, said a ban on forever chemicals is challenging because they are widely used and there are more than 15,000 types in circulation.\n\u201cI think we need to do some work to really understand how the different groups of PFAS may have slightly different toxic effects, to help inform the regulation,\" she said. \n\"Which ones do we really need to focus on first?\"\nThe EU is currently researching a possible ban on forever chemicals by 2026. \nLast year, the UK government also announced it would develop a strategy for PFAS, but no paper has been published as yet.",

I hope they have performances. \n\"Work experience would be cool - it's not like a job for me, it\u2019s doing something I love.\"\nAlex Bellamy, 18, is an engineering student. \n\"I\u2019m just really interested in the whole idea of it,\" he said. \"You know, the fact we\u2019ve created something to provide thrills for people is really good and all the engineering behind it [is something] I find really interesting.\"\nJason Glennie, an 18-year-old stage management and technical theatre student, already sees similarities between the equipment at his college and what the park could provide.  \n\"To have that on a large scale would really give people the opportunity to see a part of the industry that is in the shadows around Bedford,\" he said.\n\"We're always looking for work to have that huge opportunity for jobs - and to meet people would be perfect for what we want to start doing.\"\nToni Clack, an electronics engineering student, said: \"The software engineering and building the electronics are all skills that are interchangeable. \n\"As soon as you learn the basics of electronic software then you can take it anywhere you want.\"\nSteve Croft, an engineering lecturer, said the college had at least 100 young engineers each year looking for jobs. \n\"The theme park is a great opportunity because these students are learning automation, they\u2019re learning general engineering skills, like maths and science, so we\u2019re making them into well-rounded general engineers, and they're looking for job opportunities,\" he said.\n\"A theme park is going to be massive [and] there's going to be lots of work in the design and the construction of it but also the running of it as well. It's going to put Bedford on the map and that going to bring on lots of other businesses.\"\nNigel Clauzel, head of performing arts, said: \"You go to other theme parks where they\u2019ve got people performing, dressing up, entertaining the kids, so the opportunities for us are really widespread.\n\"We\u2019ve got technicians who can work in events management, so it\u2019s quite an amazing opportunity for them.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The world's fossil fuel industries should be banned from advertising to help save the world from climate change, the head of the United Nations said on Wednesday.\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called coal, oil and gas corporations the \u201cgodfathers of climate chaos\u201d who had distorted the truth and deceived the public for decades. \nJust as tobacco advertising was banned because of the threat to health, the same should now apply to fossil fuels, he said.\nHis remarks were his most damning condemnation yet of the industries responsible for the bulk of global warming. They came as new studies showed the rate of warming is increasing and that global heat records have continued to tumble.\nData from the EU's climate service confirms that each of the past 12 months set a new global temperature record for the time of year. The high temperatures were driven by human-caused climate change, although they were also given a small  boost by the El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon.\nWhile a fading El Ni\u00f1o should soon bring a pause to the record-breaking sequence of months, temperatures will continue to rise in the long-term due to emissions of planet-warming gases from human activities.\nLast year was the hottest on record and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Wednesday that the record could fall again as soon as this year.\nA group of around 50 leading scientists separately reported that the rate of global warming caused by humans has continued to increase.\nThey found that ongoing high emissions of warming gases mean the world is moving closer to breaching the symbolic 1.5C warming mark on a longer-term basis.\nTo try to avert this outcome, the UN Secretary General has called for more rapid political action on climate change, and a \u201cclampdown\u201d on the fossil fuel industry.\n\u201cWe must directly confront those in the fossil fuel industry who have shown relentless zeal for obstructing progress \u2013 over decades.\u201d\nHe said many in the oil, gas and coal industries had \u201cshamelessly greenwashed\u201d with lobbying, legal action and massive advertising campaigns.\n\u201cI urge every country to ban advertising from fossil fuel companies,\u201d he told an audience in New York.\n\u201cAnd I urge news media and tech companies to stop taking fossil fuel advertising.\u201d\nIn response, representatives of fossil fuel groups said they were committed to reducing their emissions.\n\u201cOur industry is focused on continuing to produce affordable, reliable energy while tackling the climate challenge, and any allegations to the contrary are false,\u201d said Megan Bloomgren, Senior Vice President of Communications at the American Petroleum Foundation.\nThe UK Advertising Standards Authority has previously pledged to clamp down on misleading environmental claims, while the European Union recently announced a new law to tackle the problem. \nMr Guterres' call for an outright ban on all fossil fuel advertising goes further - but it has no legal standing, and the UN has no means of enforcing the idea.\nHowever, it will be seen as a boost for campaigners who have fought against sponsorship and advertising from coal, oil and gas companies.\nBoth the Hay and Edinburgh book festivals have recently suspended sponsorship from investment company Baillie Gifford following controversy over links to fossil fuel firms. \nSport is one of the biggest areas of fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship, with football having a long association with oil and gas producers.\nConcerns over human health have seen alcohol and tobacco sponsorship banned in football in the past, and green campaigners will be hoping that the support of Mr Guterres will see fossil fuels go the same way.\nIn his address, Mr Guterres stressed that time was of the essence, with the impacts of rising temperatures already being felt - such as the recent deadly heatwaves in Asia or the floods in South America.\nThe record-breaking global heat means that average temperatures over the past 12 months have been 1.63C above \"pre-industrial levels\" of the late 1800s, according to Copernicus data. \n\"We are living in unprecedented times,\" says Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus.\nThis does not constitute a breach of the Paris climate agreement, in which nearly 200 countries pledged to try to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, in order to try to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.\nThat is because the Paris agreement is generally understood to mean a 20-year average - to smooth out natural variability. Taken as a whole, the past decade was about 1.2C warmer than pre-industrial levels.\nBut a new study released today by a group of leading climate scientists highlighted how close the world is getting to a long-term breach of the 1.5C mark.\nThey estimate that from the start of 2024 the world could only emit around 200 billion more tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) for a 50/50 chance of keeping warming to 1.5C - down from 500 billion tonnes at the beginning of 2020.\nAt current rates of emissions, this \"carbon budget\" could be exhausted b",
    "In a Delaware courtroom, at the outset of a trial involving the son of President Joe Biden, the extent of America\u2019s drug addiction epidemic was laid bare.\nJury selection in Hunter Biden\u2019s trial on federal gun charges began on Monday, with the court working through a pool of 65 randomly selected people who appeared individually to answer a key question - could they remain impartial during such a high-profile, politically-charged trial?\nAlmost immediately, the issue of drug addiction and its consequences in the US emerged as a common theme among the group. More than two dozen potential jurors said they knew someone who had suffered from substance abuse or addiction. Stories of daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers struggling with addiction unravelled over the course of the day.\nThe subject will play a central role in the trial, as prosecutors delve into the younger Biden\u2019s history of crack cocaine use as they seek to prove he knowingly lied about his drug habits when purchasing a gun in 2018. The defence, meanwhile, say the 54-year-old was in recovery at the time so was truthful when he said he was not a drug user.\nGiven the relevance of addiction to the trial, time and time again the court heard personal accounts from potential jurors about the toll the issue had taken on them.\n\u201cMy childhood best friend passed away from an overdose,\u201d one juror said. Another explained how their brother had struggled with opioid addiction and was now in rehab. Someone else\u2019s brother and brother-in-law had both been addicted to alcohol and had now died.\nOne person detailed how their nephew got a football scholarship to college, but slipped into drug addiction following a shoulder injury. \u201cThey kept giving him [oxycontin], and then he quit their football program, he was a mess,\u201d they told the courtroom. \u201cHe got in trouble, he burglarised the bar [and] restaurant that he was working at, and he was addicted to drugs at the time.\u201d\nThe sometimes emotional first-hand accounts could be replicated across the US, with the sheer number of stories emerging from the pool of 65 highlighting just how widespread the problem is. \nOne man broke down crying explaining that both their nephew and brother-in-law had struggled with drug addiction. \u201cI can tell that\u2019s a very emotional thing for you,\u201d the judge said, \u201cI know it\u2019s hard and I\u2019m very sorry\u201d.\nAnother potential juror told how their sister had been jailed for credit card fraud and drug charges. She had been struggling with addiction but was currently clean. One person\u2019s brother was \u201cdoing better\u201d now they were in rehab for opioid addiction.\nThe flurry of personal stories is a trend that\u2019s mirrored nationally. A study published in May 2024 by Johns Hopkins University found that one in three Americans know someone who has died of a drug overdose. For 20% of those who took part in that survey, it was a family member or a close friend who had died.\nMatthew Eisenberg, the Director for Mental Health and Addiction Policy at Johns Hopkins University, said the jury pool\u2019s experience was reflective of the overall US population.\n\u201cNearly one in three people at any given time have a substance use or mental health disorder in the US,\" he told BBC News. \u201cAround 16-17% of folks have said they have an addiction problem over the past year.\"\nMany of the potential jurors spoke of their loved ones struggling with opioids or heroin, but there were other addictions mentioned as well. And while the opioid epidemic gets a lot of attention due to its scale, Dr Eisenberg said, it is important to note there are other serious issues too.\n\u201c10% of adults in the US have an alcohol use disorder,\u201d he said, \u201c[and] 3% of folks have a simultaneous alcohol and drug use disorder.\u201d\nHunter Biden has been open about his struggle with addiction, writing at length about his crack cocaine habit in his 2021 memoir, Beautiful Things, and mentioning it in interviews.\n\u201cLook, everybody faces pain,\u201d he told the New Yorker in 2019. \u201cThere\u2019s addiction in every family. I was in that darkness. I was in that tunnel - it\u2019s a never-ending tunnel. You don\u2019t get rid of it. You figure out how to deal with it.\u201d\nAnd his father has spoken of the issue and his support for his son, too. \u201cMy son, like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem,\u201d Mr Biden said in the first presidential debate in 2020 \u201cHe\u2019s overtaken it, he\u2019s fixed it, he\u2019s worked on it, and I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d\nThe importance of the support of family members was also a sentiment expressed in the courtroom earlier this week.\n\u201cI have a daughter that's a recovering addict,\u201d a member of the jury pool told the court. \u201cAnd I think after everybody is recovering, they need a second chance. My daughter has been given a second chance, everybody needs a second chance.\u201d\nThe scene in the courtroom in Delaware showed how the issue has affected families from all walks of life in the US - including those who occupy the White House. Few have escaped unscathed.\n\u201cAddic",
    "One of Doctor Who's four original cast members, William Russell, has died aged 99.\nHis death was confirmed and announced on Tuesday by the Guardian newspaper.\nRussell played schoolteacher Ian Chesterton in the first two series of the BBC's sci-fi show and was the Doctor's first companion.\nHe left the show in 1965, but in 2022 he reprised his role and made a cameo in Jodie Whittaker's final episode, The Power of The Doctor.\nThe actor broke a Guinness World Record for the longest gap between TV appearances. \nIn the first ever episode, An Unearthly Child, which aired in 1963, Russell's character meets the Doctor, played by William Hartnell. \nRussell's character mistakenly calls him Doctor Foreman, before Hartnell then replies \"Doctor Who?\"\nRussell left the show in 1965 but later went on to narrate a number of the audiobooks in the 1990s. \nHis other TV appearances included the title role of ITV's 1956 drama, The Adventures of Sir Lancelot and as Ted Sullivan in Coronation Street.\nHe appeared in films such as The Man Who Never Was in 1956, war classic The Great Escape in 1963 and  1978's Superman.\nSharing a tribute on Instagram, Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies said it was a \"sad loss\" and said Russell was a \"fine, nimble, witty, heartfelt actor who absolutely sold the truth of those early years\". \nActor and writer Nicholas Pegg wrote on X: \"Raising a glass to William Russell, who has left us just a few months shy of his 100th birthday.\"\nHe added that Russell was a \"fine actor and a lovely man\". \nDoctor Who actress Nicola Bryant, who played the Doctor's companion, Peri Brown from 1984 to 1986 also shared a tribute on X. \n\"What a wonderful man with a delightful family an extraordinary life & career.

    "The rape and murder of a vulnerable woman could have been prevented without police understaffing and high probation case loads, a coroner has said. \n\"Happy and bubbly\" Elizabeth McCann was strangled by sex offender Simon Goold on 25 August, 2022 at his flat in Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside. \nA Prevention of Future Deaths report said it was \"probable\" that if information had been shared on Goold's escalating risk, the 26-year-old would not have died. \nGreater Manchester Police (GMP) said its sex offender management unit had doubled in size since the murder while the Probation Service said it had made changes.\nAlison Mutch, senior coroner for South Manchester, wrote in the report that GMP had known about low staffing levels in its sex offender unit for \"many years\" but had decided to manage with numbers \"far below\" what was needed.  \nGoold, 52, had been on life licence having been released from prison in 2019 after serving a sentence for rape, sexual assault and wounding. \nAn inquest into Ms McCann's death in April heard that Goold was known to pose an increased risk in circumstances involving \"alcohol use, lone females, intimacy and rejection\". \nMs McCann met her killer while they were both enrolled at the Health and Wellbeing College, run by Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, which catered for people with mental health difficulties. \nThe college had agreed to take some referrals from the Probation Service - but both parties failed to set up a system for how risk would be managed. \nMs Mutch noted how in July 2022 Goold had drunkenly touched and tried to kiss another woman from the college at a pub in Ashton. \nThe woman reported the incident to the college, but a senior manager failed to recognise Goold's risk and \"spoke to him informally\".\nThe trust apologised to Ms McCann's family and its medical director Dr Simon Sandhu told the BBC an independent review of the college is underway. \nIn April 2022, Goold had told his probation officer that a woman he wanted a relationship with had turned him down, but nothing was done with that information and no \"professional curiosity\" was shown by police or probation staff. \nMs Mutch wrote: \"It is possible that this lack of action by Greater Manchester Police and probation contributed to Elizabeth\u2019s death.\n\"It is probable that had there not been a failure to share the July 2022 incident which was caused by the previous failures Elizabeth McCann would not have died on the day she did.\"\nIn a statement, GMP said a \"full review\" had taken place.\nThe Probation Service said it had apologised to Ms McCann's family and had since stopped referring offenders to outside services such as the college without sign-off from a senior manager. \nThe inquest was told a \"significant number\" of police forces were struggling to adequately staff their sexual offender management units, \"posing a risk to communities\".\nThe Home Office said it had \"strengthened the regime\" for managing registered sex offenders.  \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Alba Party leader Alex Salmond has confirmed he will not stand in the upcoming general election. \nInstead he plans to stand for election to the Scottish Parliament in 2026 in the Banff and Buchan Coastal seat, which is currently held by SNP MSP Karen Adam.\nThere had been speculation he could potentially stand as an MP following the surprise planned return to Westminster politics of Nigel Farage.\nFor the general election, Mr Salmond said Alba was aiming to stand in 20 seats in Scotland and will support independent Angus Brendan MacNeil in Na h-Eileanan an lar, who was a former SNP MP.\nNo other leaders of the main Scottish parties plan to stand in the UK-wide general election.\nCandidate nominations close on Friday and a full list of those standing in the election will be available on the BBC website.\nThis will be the Alba party's first time contesting a general election after it was formed three years ago.\nUntil the general election was called, it had two MPs - but both were elected under the SNP banner. \nSpeaking to journalists in London, Mr Salmond confirmed his party would launch its general election campaign on Friday and the manifesto will be published during the week beginning 24 June.\nCandidates will include former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill and former Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny, who is now the Alba party's general secretary.\nWhen asked if Alba would split the independence vote and help Labour in Scottish seats, he said that would not be the case and the party would \"mobilise\" independence voters.\nHe said a vote for Alba would be an \"unambiguous\" vote for independence.\nBut Mr Salmond said he did not relish predictions the SNP could lose seats at the election.\n\"Each and every election should be used as a ballot box test for Scottish independence, looking for a majority of the votes at each and every national electoral test,\" he said.\n\"We don't believe that the SNP strategy of asking the incoming prime minister Sir Keir Starmer to hold a Scottish independence referendum is entirely credible - in fact, we think it's incredible.\"\nFirst minister and SNP leader John Swinney stressed his belief in independence at the SNP's general election campaign launch on Sunday.\nAny rumours that Alex Salmond might stand in this election as a candidate for his party Alba have been well and truly squashed, writes Rajdeep Sandhu, Political Correspondent.\nI had been told beforehand that he'd been thinking about it. Now he says he\u2019s not interested in Westminster - been there, done that. \nFor him it's all about Holyrood in 2026 for the Alba party. \nHe'll be standing as a candidate in that election in Banffshire and Buchan Coast and says he has high hopes of having 20 MSP and getting into an independence coalition.\nThose are very high hopes indeed, given that at the moment they only have one in Ash Regan who defected from the SNP.\nMr Salmond told reporters about his ambitions to secure 15% of the vote and 20 seats at the Holyrood election in 2026.\nHe said the Scottish Parliament elections were his \"priority\" and criticised the first TV debate of the general election for failing to mention Scotland.\n\"The fact that this is the case when the SNP currently is the third biggest party in the Westminster parliament is quite extraordinary and I'm afraid it's a signpost to that party's failure to impose Scotland onto the Westminster political debate,\" he said.\nHe said the Alba Party believed in granting new oil and gas licences in the North Sea, an issue that Scottish party leaders clashed on during a TV debate on Monday night.\nUnder Alba Party proposals, carbon capture would be a condition of obtaining such licences.\nMr Salmond said the tax rate on oil and gas licences should not be increased and jobs would be saved by not cutting investment allowances.\nThe party would also push for a public share of at least 15% in every major offshore windfarm.\nMr Salmond said an independent Scotland under the Alba Party would apply for immediate entry into the European Free Trade Association with an aim to eventually re-enter the European Union.\nAnd he said Alba would protect the rights of women and girls \"in the face of moves to enforce gender self-identification which involves a sacrifice of women's protected spaces.\"",
    "Grammy-nominated singer Halsey says she's \"lucky to be alive\" after struggling with her health.\nAlthough the 29-year-old did not identify her conditions, she hinted in an Instagram post she'd been diagnosed with lupus and leukaemia.\nIn a series of photos and videos, she's seen in hospital and saying she feels \"like an old lady\".\n\"Long story short, I\u2019m lucky to be alive,\" she wrote in the caption, where she also announced her new album.\nHalsey shared the health update while announcing her fifth studio album and releasing its lead single, The End.\nIn it, she sings about how \"every couple of years now, the doctor says I'm sick\".\nThe US singer-songwriter, whose real name is Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, is known for her track Closer with The Chainsmokers and her debut album, Badlands, which went platinum in the US. \n\"I told myself I\u2019m giving myself two more years to be sick,\" she says in the Instagram video.\n\"When I'm 30, I\u2019m having a rebirth and I\u2019m not going to be sick.\n\"I\u2019m going to look super hot and have lots of energy and get to redo my 20s in my 30s.\"\nHalsey has spoken previously about her poor health, saying: \"I've kind of been sick most of my adult life\".\nBut in 2022 she revealed her health became worse when she was pregnant with her son, Ender, the year before.\nShe's said she's been treated for conditions including endometriosis, Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, Sjogren's syndrome and mast cell activation syndrome.\nShe hinted she was now also being treated for lupus and leukaemia by tagging the Lupus Research Alliance as well as the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Society in her latest post.\nOne of the videos shared by Halsey show her receiving treatment in a hospital, and in her new song, she sings about \"poison\" in her blood and starting treatment.\nThere are multiple types of leukaemia, which is a type of cancer that affects white blood cells.\nThe NHS says it's not known what causes leukaemia and the disease can leave patients more susceptible to infections and feeling run down. \nIt's normally treated with chemotherapy.\nThe other condition she hinted at, lupus, is complicated and poorly understood, according to the NHS, which says it affects many different parts of the body and can be life-threatening.\nSelena Gomez has previously spoken about her lupus diagnosis, which she says she needed a kidney transplant for in 2017.\nThere are some types of lupus that just affect skin, but the term is usually used to describe a more severe form of the condition - lupus erythematosus (SLE).\nThat affects many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs.\nLots of people can have the condition for a long time without knowing before they get a sudden flare-up.\nThe symptoms include extreme tiredness, rashes (especially on the face, wrists and hands) and joint pain and swelling.\nEven mild cases can be distressing and have a big impact on quality of life.\nBut the symptoms can be similar to more common conditions so it's often hard to diagnose.\nAfter sharing her story online on Tuesday, fans were quick to offer Halsey support. \nHer post was liked more than a million times and attracted thousands of comments.\nIf you've been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "ITV has agreed to add a British Sign Language version of an election debate programme to its on-demand platform, after pressure from a deaf campaigner.\nThe debate between Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, aired on Tuesday evening, included subtitles but not a live translation.\nKatherine Rowley told BBC News she \"felt very disappointed\" that she could not follow the debate live. \nIn response to a letter from Ms Rowley's lawyer, ITV said signing on live broadcasts \"involves a considerable degree of planning and additional resource\".\nThe Communications Act 2003 says at least 5% of broadcasters' content must be translated into sign language.\nThe Act says most content should include subtitles. \nBut many who use BSL as their first language struggle with English subtitles because, studies suggest, deaf people's reading ability is lower than average.\nResearch suggests this is because reading is based on spoken language, which many deaf children struggle to acquire.\nMiss Rowley's lawyer, Chris Fry, told BBC News that equality laws should be updated to close the 5% target \"loophole\" to make sure key content in the public interest is available in accessible formats.   \n\"My kids tune into Horrible Histories sometimes, and they\u2019ve got BSL on there,\" he says.\n\"If you\u2019re going to provide it on kids\u2019 broadcasts, great - but what makes broadcasts on the elections less important than that?\u201d\nHe said there are additional accessibility issues around elections, such as visually impaired people receiving leaflets through the post.\nOn 30 May, Mr Fry sent a pre-action legal letter to ITV, to pressure it into including live signing in its debate on 4 June.\nITV's response, sent on 31 May, said it recognised Miss Rowley would be \"disappointed\" sign language could not be provided for the live broadcast, but that she had \"no basis to bring a claim\" of discrimination.\nA spokesperson said a BSL version of Tuesday's programme - and of next week's multi-party debate - would be available on its on-demand platform within 24 hours of broadcast. \nAnd all ITV election content would carry subtitles.\nITV also said in its letter that accessibility and inclusion were \"extremely important\" and \"we strive continuously to improve the level of accessibility across our channels and platforms\".\nMiss Rowley said on Wednesday: \"I felt very disappointed that I couldn\u2019t follow last night's debate.

    "\"Most of the explosive charges on that beach were real, so when they went off the beach shook.\"\nIn 1997, the usually peaceful Curracloe Beach in County Wexford was transformed into a scene of bloodshed and horror as Steven Spielberg recreated D-Day in Ireland.\nSaving Private Ryan was released to critical and veterans' acclaim for how it depicted the American assault on Omaha Beach.\nThe story followed the mission of Cpt John Miller, played by Tom Hanks, who was tasked with locating James Francis Ryan, a private whose three brothers had been killed in action. \nNorthern Ireland filmmaker Mark Huffam was Saving Private Ryan\u2019s unit production manager and associate producer. \nHe said the sights and sound of that iconic beach scene, more than 20 minutes in length, were \"terrifying\" to witness.\n\"The brief from the get-go was: 'We want to make this look real',\" Huffam told BBC News NI.\n\"We\u2019re not out to glamorise war, we want it to look like what those soldiers and men really went through when they hit that beach.\"\nThis meant only three special effects were used in the sequence, with real explosions and fire.\nSome eight cameras were rolling at once, capturing the emotions of Hanks\u2019 character as he watched the deaths of comrades unfold in a barrage of machine gun bullets, shells and sniper fire.\nNormandy was considered as a filming location but quickly ruled out, Huffam explained, due to post-war development along the coast.\nInstead, after an extensive search, Curracloe was chosen as its beach gradient allowed the landing craft to come ashore.\nHuffam said much of the planning for the film, which took less than 60 days to shoot, was in Spielberg\u2019s mind.\nMeeting him for the first time on board a minibus, he said the crew was \u201calways running to keep up with him\u201d.\n\"We used to every night fax him about 150 questions and you\u2019d come in the next morning and there would be a succinct answer to every single one of them,\" he explained.\n\"All the departments would collate the questions they needed answers on: how many soldiers were we going to have in this scene, are they going to be Airborne Division or are they going to be paratroopers, how many Germans are there going to be?\"\nD-Day was the first day of the invasion of Normandy - the beginning of a huge campaign by the Allies of World War Two in north-west Europe, which was occupied by Nazi Germany.\nAlong with campaigns elsewhere - including the Eastern Front and the Italian campaign - it would eventually lead to Germany's defeat.\nThe \"D\" in \"D-Day\" simply means \"day\" - it is a military term used to mark the start of an operation. The hour of attack was known as H-Hour.\nAllied troops - mainly from the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States but also other countries - landed on five beaches in Normandy on 6 June.\nThe Allies suffered about 10,000 casualties - including an estimated 4,000 deaths - but the operation was a success.\nSuch was the attention to detail that Irish army reservists, drafted in as extras, had to be signed off as competent swimmers, while ex-Royal Marines piloted the landing craft.\nThese were sourced from Palm Springs in the US, Southampton and two closer to home, from County Donegal.\nHanks and other stars were also made to attend a boot camp to \"be trained into soldiers in two weeks\".\nThis involved \"with no exceptions\", learning how to fire a machine gun, sleeping under canvas and eating rations.\n\"They occasionally did try and slip out up to the production office and see if they could scrounge some cooked chicken rather than having to cook it themselves,\" Huffam revealed. \nHe added hundreds of gallons of food dye was used to turn Curracloe\u2019s water blood red, while about 600 crew members stood ready, from stunt teams to fire safety.\nThis helped to set the tone for recreating Omaha, which witnessed more than 2,000 casualties on D-Day. \nDuring his research Spielberg had spoken to US veterans about their experiences.\nHuffam has gone on to work on other major productions such as Game of Thrones, Napoleon and The Martian.\nWhen speaking to BBC News NI he brought along a clapper board, dog tag and Ranger Battalion jacket he kept from the set of Saving Private Ryan.\nAt one stage he owned one of the landing craft.\nHe reflected that Spielberg\u2019s standard was \u201cit has to be accurate\u201d, even if it is difficult to fully depict what the real-life experience must have been.\n\"How do you get off that landing craft and into a hail of machine gun fire and shells landing all around you?\" Huffam questioned.\n\"How are you brave enough to do that?\u201d\n\u201cI think it is terrifying, even when you know you\u2019re doing it purely for a film.\"\nThe feeling after each day on set, he added, was: \"Oh my God, we pulled that off.\"\nHe added: \u201cThe first time I saw it on a big screen I thought:  'Wow\u2019.\u201d\nThe wartime epic won five Academy Awards, including best director.\nSpecial commemorations are being held to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day this month.",
    "A father-to-be who died on the day of his daughter's birth may have lived if a heart defect had not been missed, a coroner has found.\nThomas Gibson, 40, died from a sudden cardiac arrest on 7 June 2023 after a hospital doctor \"misinterpreted\" a scan 11 days earlier, an inquest at Stockport Coroner's Court heard.\nThe inquest was told that had medics at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester given Mr Gibson a pacemaker he would still be alive.\nCoroner Christopher Morris concluded Mr Gibson died as a consequence of sudden cardiac death due to myocardial fibrosis.\nOn the day Mr Gibson was due to become a father, his partner Rebecca Moss tried to rouse him as she prepared to go to hospital for an elective Caesarean.\n\"Wake up, it's baby day,\" she told him but found him \"stiff and cold\" and attempted emergency first aid until an ambulance arrived at their home in Stretford, Greater Manchester.\nHe was declared dead and she gave birth to their daughter, Harper, the same day.\nAt the end of the two-day inquest hearing, Mr Morris said: \"I can't even begin to fathom what that must have been like for her, particularly in the context of what should have been the happiest day for both of them.\"\nHe added: \"When the clinical team assessed him they did not appreciate the ECG showed him to be experiencing complete heart block.\n\"Had this been appreciated Mr Gibson would have been admitted under the care of cardiologists, a series of investigations undertaken, which would probably have culminated in an implantable device, such as a pacemaker being fitted.\n\"It is likely these measures would have avoided his death.\"\nSpeaking outside the court, Mr Gibson's partner Rebecca Moss said: \"The expertise which could have saved Tom's life was just one phone call away - I sincerely hope that there will be learnings from Tom's avoidable death.\n\"I am told that inquests aren't about blame but I have every right to be angry and to seek answers for Tom, Harper and our family.\"\nDr Mark Ainsley, clinical director of cardiology for the hospital trust, said if Mr Gibson's heart problem had been spotted on the ECG scan he would possibly have been monitored and treated there and then and fitted with a pacemaker, a procedure that takes \"less than an hour\", he said.\nThe coroner asked: \"Do you think that sequence of events would likely have avoided his death?\"\nDr Ainsley replied: \"I think the short duration between the ECG and his heart giving way, I think it's more than likely he would have avoided his death.\"\nThe inquest heard that Mr Gibson worked in a timber yard and was physically fit but had been suffering from a stomach bug, including cramps and diarrhoea, for about three weeks before his death.\nIt culminated in him attending the A&E at Wythenshawe Hospital on May 27 last year.\nHe was seen by Dr Oliver Handley, who recognised his ECG trace showed signs of an abnormality and referred it to a more senior medic, Dr Thomas Bull, the medical registrar, for a second opinion.\nDr Bull said the ECG scan was likely to represent an abnormality he described as an intraventricular block, which is \"not an uncommon finding\" and not clinically \"significant\" without other heart-related symptoms.\nAs there were no other heart-related symptoms he was discharged.\nBut later analysis concluded the ECG identified a complete heart block, also known as a third-degree heart block, the most serious kind.\nDr Matthew Thornber, a consultant at the hospital, said the two ECGs taken were not \"textbook\" examples of looking like a heart block condition and such diagnosis requires nuance and experience.\n\"This is not a barn door easy miss,\" he said.\nThe coroner said he would be writing a prevention of future deaths report, addressed to the chief executive of the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence concerning clinical practice, around the interpretation of ECG scans.\nIn a statement, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We wish again to extend our condolences and sincere sympathies to Mr Gibson's family at this very difficult time.\n\"The trust has undertaken a thorough investigation to examine the circumstances following Mr Gibson's very sad death, and we apologise for where our care has fallen short of the high standards to which we aspire.\n\"We will be reviewing the coroner's conclusion carefully.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A professional rock climber convicted of sexually assaulting a woman three times during her visit to Yosemite National Park has been sentenced to life in prison.\nCharles Barrett, 40, was sentenced on Tuesday for two counts of aggravated sexual abuse and one count of abusive sexual contact, according to federal prosecutors. \nBarrett's \"abusive sexual contact\" happened in August 2016 while the victim was on a weekend hiking trip in California, court documents and evidence showed. \nAt the time, Barrett, a star climber and guidebook writer, was living and working for a private business in the park. \nUS prosecutor Phillip Talbert said in a statement after the sentencing: \"Barrett\u2019s long history of sexual violence supports the imposition of a life sentence. \n\u201cHe used his status as a prominent climber to assault women in the rock-climbing community, and when his victims began to tell, Barrett responded by lashing out publicly with threats and intimidation.\" \nDuring the trial, prosecutors told the court Barrett lured the victim into an isolated area by inviting her to watch a meteor shower and then raped her, local news reported. \nHe also assaulted her while swimming in the Tuolumne River and raped her again in a communal shower, according to court documents. \nThree other women testified during trial that Barrett had sexually assaulted them, beginning in 2008. \nProsecutors did not pursue charges for those women because the alleged incidents occurred outside of federal jurisdiction.\nOn the day of the sentencing, local news described the four women in court in tears, at times tightly holding hands. \nTimothy Hennessy, Barrett's lawyer, told the judge a life sentence was inappropriate because Barrett suffers from a mental illness.\nHe also says the women conspired against him to \"ruin his life\", prosecutors said.\nBarrett's lawyers said he plans to appeal against the conviction.\nAccording to federal prosecutors, Barrett had a long history of abuse and harassment.\nHe showed up to a rock-climbing gym frequented by one of the victims who testified at a trial in 2017, years after he had allegedly attacked her, prosecutors said.\nShe told the gym owner about her experience - hoping to protect other women - and was harassed and threatened by Barrett for years afterwards, prosecutors said. He was convicted of criminal threats in August 2022. \n",

    "The American Boeing company has launched its Starliner capsule towards the International Space Station (ISS) with two Nasa astronauts aboard.\nIt's the first time the vehicle has been entrusted to carry people after coming through a long and tortuous development programme.\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be testing the capsule on a mission that's expected to last just over a week.\nStarliner is scheduled to dock with the space station on Thursday.\nThe capsule went up from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, riding a United Launch Alliance Atlas rocket.\nThe 12-minute powered ascent looked flawless.\nMoments before lift-off, Commander Wilmore called out to thank all those who had worked to make the mission possible. Alluding to past difficulties, he said: \"When the going gets tough - and it often does - the tough get going, and you have.\"\nStarliner's pilot Suni Williams chimed in: \"Go 'Calypso'! (the name of the capsule). Take us to space and back.\" \nStarliner now has to raise itself to the orbit of the ISS, which circles the Earth at an altitude of roughly 400km (250 miles).\nIn the 24 hours this will take, Wilmore and Williams plan to put the vehicle through its paces, including taking manual control of the flight systems.\nThis mission is a critical venture for manufacturer Boeing, which has been under pressure after a series of safety incidents on its aeroplanes.\nStarliner, likewise, has encountered numerous technical issues that have delayed its planned crewed debut by almost a decade.\nThe most dramatic of these problems occurred on the capsule's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 when software errors forced the vehicle to abort its trip to the ISS. Nasa requested a second dummy run be conducted in 2022 to be sure the errors had been corrected.\nRecent days have once again focussed on Starliner's readiness with the discovery of a small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system.\nDetailed analysis eventually led Boeing and Nasa to conclude the leak was not serious enough to hold up the launch.\nStarliner was developed in response to Nasa's request for commercial options to get its astronauts into space.\nFollowing the retirement of the famous shuttles in 2011, the agency wanted to move away from owning and operating vehicles to an arrangement where it could simply purchase the service - just like a company might outsource its IT needs or payroll.\nThe new approach was designed to save Nasa money it could then spend on ambitious plans to return people to the Moon.\nThe agency gave contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to help bring their capsules into service and then pay them for six operational missions. But whereas SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in 2020 and then complete six operational missions by March this year, Boeing is still at the stage of the initial crew flight test.\nIf Starliner can prove itself over the coming days, it will join SpaceX's Dragon capsule in the routine transport of astronauts, potentially as early as the beginning of next year.\n\"Right now, we have one provider giving us that access to the space station,\" top Nasa official Jim Free explained. \"This will give us a second provider, which means if we have a problem with either, we have ways to get our crews to and from station, which helps keep the tempo that we've had for 23 years of having humans in low Earth orbit,\" the associate administrator said.\nFor Mark Nappi, the Boeing vice president who leads the company's commercial crew programme, it was a relief to finally see the mission get away.\n\"My boss was here today. My boss's boss was here today and my boss's boss's boss is here today. So obviously, it means a tonne to us,\" he told reporters.\nStarliner is heading up to the space station with about 340kg (760lbs) of cargo.\nA key supply item is a replacement pump for the system on the ISS that purifies urine back to drinking water.\nMuch of the cargo, however, is simply Boeing merchandise that will become memorabilia for this important test flight.\nThis includes mission patches, coins, silver Snoopy pens, American flags and a hard drive with about 3,500 pieces of artwork from children across the world.\nIf all goes to plan, Wilmore and Williams will return to Earth late next week.\nThe Starliner is designed to come back to land, using airbags to soften contact with the ground.\nThere are a number of places in the US southwest where the touchdown could be performed, but mission managers will wait to see local weather forecasts before making a final choice.\nThe earliest opportunity would be 14 June at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. \n\"There's nothing magic about that date.

He was my friend, he took care of me and consoled me for the loss of my friend (Meredith). I'm sorry I wasn't able to resist the pressure and that he suffered.\"\nMr Lumumba was arrested in connection with the 2007 murder and spent two weeks behind bars, but was released without charge after a customer gave him an alibi.\nDespite this, his lawyers said the case has affected his reputation, and that he \u201cbecame known everywhere as the monster of Perugia\u201d.\nHis lawyer told reporters outside the courthouse before the hearing: \"He lost his job, had his bar seized for months, and had to return to Poland, because his wife was Polish.\u201d\nMr Lumumba was not in court.\nThe hearing was held behind closed doors, and audio and video recording was prohibited.\nKnox was famously tried, convicted and later acquitted for the murder of 21-year-old student Ms Kercher, originally from south London.\nKnox and Ms Kercher were both language exchange students sharing a house in the university town of Perugia in 2007.\nMs Kercher, 21, was found dead in their house. Her throat had been cut and she had been sexually assaulted.\nThe trial was the subject of global media interest because prosecutors argued that Ms Kercher was the victim of a drug-fuelled sex game gone wrong.\nKnox, her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, and a third person called Rudy Guede were convicted of murder and sexual violence in December 2009 and jailed. Knox was convicted of slandering Mr Lumumba in 2011.\nBut the same year, a jury freed Knox and Mr Sollecito on appeal after doubts emerged over forensic evidence used against them, and Knox returned to the US after spending four years in prison.\nThe duo's guilty verdicts were reinstated in 2014 then ultimately overturned in 2015.\nKnox is now married with two young children, and is a campaigner for criminal justice reform. She returned to Italy five years ago to address a conference on wrongful conviction, where she spoke of the pain of being tried by the media.\nThe trial was also the subject of a Netflix documentary in 2016, and Knox also published a memoir about her time in prison.\nMr Sollecito has kept a low-profile since his release. In 2017, he told the BBC that  the case had left him in debt.\nGuede - a Perugian resident originally from the Ivory Coast - was linked to the scene by DNA evidence and is the only person whose conviction for Ms Kercher's murder was upheld. He was released early in 2021.",
    "The first communique from Normandy on 6 June 1944 made the front pages by close of day.\nHours after the historic landings had begun, a late edition of the Belfast Telegraph declared it was \"Europe's greatest day\".\nThat morning listeners to the BBC Home Service were informed of a statement from the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF).\nIt told them that Allied armies had landed in northern France.\n\"In this brief manner the United Nations, their enemies, and the peoples of neutral nations, were told that 'The Day' had arrived,\" the Belfast Telegraph reported.\nEighty years later, D-Day is still being remembered for its significance in world history and as a turning point in the allies' fightback against Nazi Germany.\nOn 6 June 2024, some of the few remaining veterans will stand in commemoration with the leaders of a world they helped to shape.\nThe day after D-Day, 7 June, more information was being relayed to anxious families in towns and villages across Ireland.\nThe Northern Whig, no longer in circulation, carried the headline 'invasion is going well' in its 05:00 war special issue. \nBeside the image of SHAEF head Dwight D Eisenhower, the one penny paper reported forces had been successful in their initial landings.\nThis had come from communique No.2.\nEisenhower had been a familiar sight in Northern Ireland during the preceding months, rallying troops ahead of their deployment.\nFighting by 7 June, The Irish News detailed, was continuing 10 miles inland at Caen but there were \"losses less than anticipated\".\nIt also reflected the Soviet advance on Germany to the east.\nUnder the section 'news flashed round world', the Irish News commented that D-Day was \"the biggest news day the world has seen since the war began\".\nThe Belfast News Letter, the day after the invasion, carried a message from the speakers of the Northern Ireland House of Commons and Senate which conveyed to General Eisenhower their \"heartfelt wishes for the speedy success of the immense and vital operations in which you are at present engaged\".\nIt also featured Northern Ireland's prime minister, Sir Basil Brooke, appealing to workers that they redouble their efforts \"to supply all the munitions and equipment that will be needed until the day of triumph dawns\".\nFor many people in Northern Ireland, the newspaper dispatches offered a glimpse of what their loved ones were living through and why their work on the home front mattered.\nAfter years of war this would have felt like progress.\nIt was also common that news about the war was surrounded by advertisements for firms such as Ulster Creameries and Gallaher's tobacco, with tradespeople offering their services and shows promoted at the Grand Opera House.\nThe News Letter's front page was adorned with adverts, such was its format at the time, with Normandy coverage only appearing inside.\nIt was page three of The Derry Journal where readers learned the 'invasion of Europe begins'.\nIt also referenced developments in Rome which had just been liberated.\nVatican Radio, it highlighted, reported the largest crowd in living memory in St Peter's Square \"clamouring for the Pope\", who made a speech that \"Rome had been saved the horrors of war by both belligerents\".\nItaly, north Africa, and other fields of war involving Northern Ireland service personnel remained under the spotlight despite the breaking news from France.\nOn D-Day, for instance, the News Letter reported that the family of Flying Officer WA Lawrence Colhoun, a former Methodist College rugby captain, had been officially informed of his death.\nHe had been reported missing three months earlier after a raid over the German city Nuremberg.\nSuch memories of bombing raids would have remained raw in Northern Ireland after the Blitz.\nA reminder of this can be seen in the top masthead of the Belfast Telegraph which informed readers of the black-out times to abide by.\nThe Irish Times' 7 June edition reported on the world reaction a day into the invasion, sharing a Reuters report that speeches by Winston Churchill and Eisenhower had been carried in full on Moscow radio.\nThe Dublin-based newspaper also showed maps of the English channel and a detailed guide to Normandy where landings were happening \"constantly\".\n\"In neutral capitals excited crowds bought up special editions of newspapers,\" it reported.\nReflecting on those headlines today reveals a moment of great excitement but also uncertainty about a war which was far from over.",
    "Asda\u2019s fuel has become the priciest among supermarket groups - after years of being among the cheapest - despite its pledge to offer the best value, research suggests.\nAccording to the RAC, average petrol and diesel prices were higher at Asda at the end of May than at Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s.\nAsda disputed the findings, saying they covered its whole estate, including convenience shops, and that it still had the best prices at supermarket forecourts.\nGlobal fuel prices are falling, but the RAC said supermarket chains were not passing the savings on to customers.\nThe RAC analyed data submitted by the biggest supermarkets to the Competition and Markets Authority and found that Asda was selling petrol at 146.34p per litre and diesel at 151.71p. \nBy contrast Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsburys were charging 144.45p and 149.61p per litre - some 1.9p and 2.1p less.\nRAC senior policy officer Rod Dennis said it was the first time since the motoring group began tracking supermarket fuel prices that Asda had come out as priciest.\nHe added that the chain had for years been the market leader on fuel prices, encouraging its rivals to drop their prices after it did, but that it had now lost its \u201ccrown\u201d.\nMr Dennis added that with fuel prices falling, Asda was unlikely to regain its position any time soon, as rivals were likely to lower their prices just as quickly to maintain their lead.\nAsda disputed the findings, saying that prices at its supermarket forecourts specifically remained market leading.\nAccording to its numbers, it sold fuel at its forecourts for 147.78p per litre in May, cheaper than its rivals.\nExplaining the higher prices at smaller shops, Asda said that its rates were in line with local market competition.\n\u201cAsda was the price leader in the supermarket fuel sector in May and we remain focused on providing our customers with the best value at the pumps as we grow in the convenience sector,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nAverage fuel prices in the UK have been climbing again due to rising global oil prices, although they are expected to fall slightly in the coming weeks.  \nThe RAC said wholesale fuel prices were already coming down but that this was not being reflected at the pumps.\n\"With only a few exceptions, there doesn\u2019t appear to be much in the way of price competition taking place.\"\n",

    "Teachers' unions have dismissed a pay offer from Scottish local authorities which they say falls well below their expectations.\nCouncils offered them a 2% rise in August and a further 1% rise next May.\nUnions say there is now only a short window of opportunity to reach a deal.\nCouncil body Cosla said they were \"disappointed\" the offer has been rejected, and further industrial action could mean job losses and service cuts.\nThe pay deal which settled last year's teachers strike meant a rise was due this August.\nTeachers pay is negotiated by a committee which brings together the teachers' unions, councils as the employers of teachers  and the Scottish government.\nThe unions received the pay offer yesterday from the council body Cosla.\n\nDes Morris, the joint chair of the teachers\u2019 side on the committee said: \u201cThe pay offer, made by Cosla to the teachers\u2019 panel of the SNCT (Scottish Negotiating Commitee for Teachers) yesterday, simply does not begin to address the significant decline in the value of Scottish teachers\u2019 pay since 2008.\n\"Worse than this, had this offer been accepted, the reality is that teachers\u2019 pay would have been eroded further.\u201d\n\u201cThe unanimous rejection of this unsatisfactory offer, by the SNCT teachers\u2019 panel, sends a clear message to both Cosla and the Scottish government that commitment and effort will be required to ensure that a pay settlement can be agreed by the August 1st implementation date previously agreed by all parties.\nThe SNCT teachers\u2019 panel remains committed to swift negotiations, however, it is imperative that any settlement agreed must mark a step forward in restoring the pay of teachers across Scotland.\u201d\nA Scottish government spokesperson said it valued the hard work \"that our teaching workforce put in for our learners and we remain absolutely committed to ensuring they receive a fair pay deal\".\n\"Teacher pay is a matter for the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) and talks will continue with unions with a view to reaching an agreement which ensures a sustainable deal for all involved,\" the spokesperson added. \nA Cosla spokesperson said councils remained committed to reaching an outcome that was best for the entire workforce.\nThe spokesperson said Cosla was disappointed the unions had rejected the offer which was in line with the Scottish government\u2019s public sector pay policy.\n\u201cWhilst we understand our trade unions role in seeking the best deal possible for their members, this year\u2019s local government settlement from Scottish government means that our hands are tied and going any further will mean job losses and service cuts,\" the spokesperson said. \n\"Councils have no flexibility in terms of teacher numbers, which further restricts any offers that can be made.\u201d\nPay is likely to be a theme at the annual conference of the biggest teachers union the EIS which begins on Thursday.\nEIS members - along with teachers in other unions - took part in a three-month programme of pay strikes over the winter of 2022-23.\nThe dispute was resolved after the Scottish government gave councils money to finance an improved pay offer.\nMeanwhile a pay strike by college lecturers in the EIS is continuing.\nThe EIS Further Education Lecturers Association is holding strikes at most colleges this week and over the next three weeks.",

    "The British weatherman who persuaded the supreme allied commander to postpone the D-Day landings could be in line for a posthumous award - nearly 50 years after his death.\nGp Capt James Stagg, who died in Seaford in 1975, was a senior British meteorologist during World War Two.\nHis weather predictions have been credited with convincing General Dwight D Eisenhower the invasion should be pushed back 24 hours to avoid a storm and potential catastrophe.\nHis son, Peter Stagg, 82, is set to begin talks with the French authorities over whether his father could be considered for the Legion d'Honneur - France's highest honour.\nMr Stagg, who lives near Angouleme in south-west France, said he believed the commemorations for D-Day this year will be the last \"big\" ones. \n\"There are hardly any soldiers still alive that went through the Second World War.\n\"I think now is the time to take the plunge with the French government.\"\nHe described \"frustration\" in his father's latter years and said he thought \"not getting any real recognition\" might have been part of that.\nThe Normandy landings - the largest seaborne invasion in history - paved the way for the allied victory.\nThey were originally planned for 5 June but relied on calm weather to safely land tens of thousands of troops.\nThe fear was that low cloud would mean no air cover and rough seas could sink landing craft.\nGp Capt Stagg was appointed chief meteorologist to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in November 1943.\nHe predicted a significant storm on 5 June but believed there would be a sufficient break in the weather to allow it to go ahead the following day.\nMr Stagg said: \"It was an enormous decision to have to take. The British climate is notorious.\"\nHe said his father had to play a \"delicate political role\" keeping the Americans on board while getting his view across to General Eisenhower \"as a priority\". \nMr Stagg said his father's meetings with \"top people\" including General Eisenhower, \"must have been pretty nerve wracking\".\nHowever, Gp Capt Stagg was able to convince allied command that his predictions were accurate and allowed for a small window for the landings to take place.\nMr Stagg said it must have taken \"colossal nerve\".\n\"He must have had sleepless nights. It's hard to imagine the weight of responsibility on his shoulders,\" he said.\nBut he said his father was a \"man of his convictions\" who would \"stick up\" for what he thought was right.\nHis advice - and General Eisenhower's decision to accept it - were to prove correct.\nThe weather cleared sufficiently for the D-Day operation to begin and paved the way for the defeat of the Nazis.\nMr Stagg said: \"If that had been wrong, heaven knows what might have happened. \n\"If the Germans had time to regroup and repel the invasion, who knows where it might have led.\n\"It must have saved an enormous number of lives.\"\nGp Capt Stagg died in Seaford in East Sussex in 1975, aged 74.\nDespite his pivotal role in ensuring the success of D-Day, he received little formal recognition for his wartime work during his life.\nThere is a plaque honouring him in Seaford as well as one in his home town Dalkeith, unveiled in 2019.\nPeter Stagg has also written to Richmond Council in London, where his father lived during the war, to see if it too could consider a commemorative plaque.\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Veterans involved in one of World War Two's most decisive battles have been remembering their roles to mark the event's 80th anniversary.\nOperation Overlord, also known as D-Day, began on 6 June 1944, and paved the way for the Allied forces' victory over Nazi Germany.\nThe naval, air and land assault on Normandy involved about 160,000 troops and saw the allies gain a foothold in France.\nBBC South East has spoken to surviving veterans about the parts they played.\nGeoffrey Weaving, from Horsham in West Sussex, was a 20-year-old sailor on HMS Astral, accompanying Canadian soldiers in the landing on Juno beach in Normandy.\n\"The ramp dropped and they all had to run onto the sand,\" he said.\n\"I could see them being shot. I could see them drop in the water. There was blood in the water.\n\"Some were wounded and they drowned.\n\"Others, the landing craft had put the ramp down too soon, but it was too deep, so a lot of those people died.\n\"The water was full of bodies.\"\nJohn Roberts, who celebrated his 100th birthday at his home in Whitstable, Kent in April, had a 40-year career in the Royal Navy, retiring in 1978 as a rear admiral.\nBack in 1944, he was a 20-year-old officer on a destroyer, protecting minesweepers through the English Channel, then bombarding German positions that were radioed to the ship by an army officer on the beach.\nHe said: \"It was exciting being part of it. \n\"As I said in a letter to my mother - it was fun. It\u2019s awful to think of a war being fun, but I wouldn\u2019t have missed it for anything.\" \nHe recalled the moment another ship was sunk.\n\"Suddenly, there was an explosion. It was one of the other destroyers that had been torpedoed by a German patrol craft. \n\"It was manned by Norwegian sailors and about 50 died.\"\nSitting three miles offshore, he soon began to see the results of the battle.\n\"One or two small boats began to come to us with casualties. \n\"The army officer, who had been talking to us from ashore about targets, was badly wounded and died on board. \n\"That brought it home to us how serious things were.\"\nAt just 17 years-old, Violet Clarke left her civilian job and volunteered for the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS), where she helped prepare vehicles to be used in the invasion.\nShe said: \"They came straight from the factory and we had to equip them ready to go to the front line. \n\"They were covered with tarpaulins and hidden under the trees at Merstham because of the bombers.\"\nIt meant she met the late Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, who was an ATS driver.\nMs Clarke, who now lives at the Royal British Legion Village in Aylesford, Kent, said: \"She was an ordinary person. You never thought of her as royalty. \n\"I remember when the war was over and I went up to the Palace and I saw her.\n\"I thought it seemed so strange, she\u2019d been one of us and here she was up on the balcony. She was a nice lady.\"\nGerman speaker Patricia Owtram was recruited to monitor enemy naval communications and was stationed on the coast between Dover and Folkestone.\nAt the time of D-Day, she had an encounter with two important figures.\nShe said: \"I was reading my book on top of our cliff and I noticed a party coming up the path. \n\"I thought \u2018that\u2019s Winston Churchill\u2019, and beside him General Montgomery.\n\"I did the only thing I could and said \u2018good morning everybody\u2019. And they all said \u2018good morning\u2019, and they went on to the cliff and looked across at Cap Gris-Nez and talked and then they went away.\n\"Later, I learned it was a deceit, that Churchill wanted the Germans to think we were going to land up the east end of the Channel, not in Normandy. \n\"That got reported to the German press and it worked. \"\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Changes to bin collections will bring a council in line with others across the country, a spokesman has said.\nMiddlesbrough Council said it will begin fortnightly refuse collections from August.\nThe move is the latest in a string of changes to bin collections introduced by the council recently.\nLast month, it had to spend an additional \u00a3376,000 on 12,000 bins to ensure that the roll out of its new garden waste scheme could progress, after significantly underestimating demand.\nHouseholds of three or more now have the opportunity to apply for a free larger black bin to replace existing 140-litre ones ahead of the fortnightly collections.\nSmaller households have the option of paying for the extra bin, if needed.\nThe council said it will take weeks to remove old bins and deliver the new ones, with the process starting on 11 June.\nA spokesman said all who request new bins before 21 June will receive them on time.\nDelays to collections, disruption to deliveries, broken bin wagons and the impact of  \"confusing\" communication have previously hampered the council's attempts to smoothly implement changes to its refuse collection.\nIn May, changes to its garden waste scheme, to a subscription-only model, were hindered by a significant shortfall in bins.\nThe council had to approve the purchase of thousands more bins to ensure the scheme could be rolled out after more than 19,000 people signed up to it - more than twice the 9,000 estimated.\nA spokesman then said demand for the subscription scheme \"vastly surpassed expectations\", adding that the council was delivering hundreds of bins a day and removing old ones at the same time.\nResidents were also left confused when they received emailed instructions telling them when to put out their old bins for collection - only to be later told that the date given was an example due to be used on a leaflet.\nThe spokesman said the issues were being \"quickly rectified\". \nDuring the same month, there were delays to rubbish collections due to eight bin wagons being off the road due to various faults.\nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Across the UK and France, two days of events are taking place to mark the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings.\nThe landings were the largest seaborne invasion in history with troops from the UK, the USA, Canada, and France attacking German forces on the beaches at Normandy in northern France on 6 June, 1944.\nJersey-raised Billy Reynolds, who lived until he was 100, escaped death many times during the war.\nIn an interview with the BBC before his death in 2023, he said he would never forgot the devastation he saw.\nAs soon as he was of military age, Billy joined the army with his brothers as a driver towing heavy guns and ammunition with the Royal Army Service Corps.\nRecognising his skills behind the wheel, the army trained him to drive all kinds of vehicles - from motorbikes to DUKWs.\nHe was testing one of these in the Solent when an aircraft accidentally dropped a torpedo right above them and it missed by inches.\nAs D-Day approached, he was one of thousands of men held in reserve to reinforce the early landings.\nHe was responsible for training his unit to waterproof their vehicle ready to land; in the event, his was the only one to founder as it came in to Gold beach towards the end of June 1944 before they made their way inland.\nBilly said: \"As we came in I remember there was this destroyer with its bows just poking out of the water.\n\"All around its bows were the dead bodies of the sailors... it was terribly nerve-wracking actually.\n\"The noise was terrific.\"\nOn one occasion Billy was in a farmyard when an enemy shell hit the ground next to him, span through the wet bank and flew off and exploded.\nHe said: \"We went to a farmhouse that was all smashed up and got a couple of doors, there was a German slit trench. \n\"We put the doors over the slit trench and put the ground on top, we'd no sooner finished that then the bombers came in. \n\"I heard the scream of the bombs and I knew by the scream that those bombs were for me... but not one went off.\"\nBilly said six of them did not detonate.\n\"I had one bomb about two feet from me, and another about four feet away, we couldn't get out of our trenches because all the trucks around the orchard were on fire.\"\nAfter weeks of fighting, the German line collapsed and Caen was taken. \nBilly said he never forgot the devastation he saw.\nAfterwards he was in the Allied spearhead pushing the Germans into the chaos of the Falaise Gap.\nHe said: \"There was horrific, horrific shelling and bombing, the destruction of the German army was terrible, dead German soldiers everywhere. \n\"It was upsetting, really.\"\nBilly was always proud of his service and was one of the earliest members of Jersey's Normandy Veterans Association - making regular trips back to the battlefields.\nHe was awarded the Legion d'Honneur by France and wore his medals in honour of the men he served with but did not survive.\nFollow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "The Metropolitan Police is heading for its lowest staffing levels in a decade by March next year, commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has warned.\nBritain's biggest police force has seen a shortfall partly due to inadequate funding and low recruitment, according to Sir Mark.\nPlans to reform the force will have to slow down as the Met faces a budget hole of \u00a3400m in 2025-26, a document submitted to the London Policing Board said.\nAccording to the Home Office, the Met will receive up to \u00a33.5bn in 2024-25, an increase of up to \u00a3125.8m on the previous year.\nThe document said frontline teams were being placed under \"high operational strain\" by having to deal with large-scale protests in London, which cost \u00a370m last year, and there was increased demand for dealing with violence against women and girls.\nAn application for \u00a370m from the Home Office to release about 1,000 officers from desk jobs was refused, the report said.\nSir Mark wrote: \"By March 2025, there will be 310 police officers per 100,000 Londoners. \n\"In March 2012, this was at 350 police officers. This position is projected to worsen and trend towards our lowest point of the last decade.\n\"This is being driven in part by inadequate funding and by low recruitment over recent years due to the rising cost of living in London relative to other parts of the UK, and other challenges.\"\nFigures in the report show a drop since March 2023 - going from 342 officers per 100,000 Londoners that year, to 330 in March this year and 310 in March 2025.\nThe Met was already 1,400 officers below a staffing target set by the Home Office at the end of 2023-24, and this is expected to drop a further 1,250 by the end of 2024-25.\nForce bosses already have plans to move 300 officers out of back office roles in a bid to help plug the gap.\nThe Home Office said the \u00a33.5bn the Met will receive in 2024-25 includes \u00a3185.3m in recognition of the increased demand the Met faces from policing the capital city.\nZo\u00eb Garbett, Green member of the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, said: \u201cThe long-promised, long-awaited culture reform of the Metropolitan Police cannot wait another day. \n\"It\u2019s inexcusable that this government refuses to provide the Met with the resources needed to move forward with this urgent work. \n\"The quicker the Met can reform, and the quicker the Met can recruit new officers, the quicker the Met can work on community priorities.\"\nGareth Roberts, Lib Dem member of the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, said: \"Following the Casey review, it's clear that until the Met can fix its culture and recruit the force it needs, it is failing Londoners, especially women and girls given conviction rates for sexual offences are so low. \n\"The government and Mayor of London have time and again failed to negotiate a properly funded service for London, despite it playing a key role in protecting the whole country. This must change immediately, whoever is in power.\"\nSusan Hall, Conservative member at the London Assembly,  said London Mayor Sadiq Khan - who has overall responsibility for the force - did not meet government targets for recruiting officers.\nShe added the mayor, for Labour, had instead increased the number of \"pen-pushing bureaucrats in his Police and Crime office\".\nLabour declined to comment.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The first integrated Irish language primary school in east Belfast is planning a move to the site of Van Morrison's former school Orangefield High.\nNa\u00edscoil na Seolta first opened as a pre-school in 2021, and is planning to admit its first Primary One pupils in September 2025.\nHowever, it has initially identified a proposed temporary site on Montgomery Road in the Castlereagh area, according to documents lodged with the planning service.\nThe school has received money from the Shared Island Fund to rent land in east Belfast and pay for a mobile classroom.\nIt also said it had seen an increased \"number of expressions of interest\" from the families of prospective pupils.\nIrish language activist Linda Ervine, who helped set up the pre-school and sits on the school committee, said the site at Montgomery Road was a temporary plan.\nShe said those involved with the school have had a number of conversations with the Education Authority and the Department of Education about Orangefield High as a long-term site as \u201cwe visualise growth and development\u201d.\n\u201cOur long-term goal is to move to Orangefield because this is just a starter site,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe Department of Education has been doing a scoping exercise on the Orangefield site.\n\u201cWe will not be starting to take P1s until September 2025.\n\u201cWe hope to be in the Montgomery Road site for September 2024, but that might be a little optimistic.\"\nOrangefield High closed as a school in 2014 and the land has remained vacant since.\nMorrison returned to the school, which he had attended as a pupil, just after it closed for a series of concerts.\nMs Ervine said numbers for new school had risen \u201cquite dramatically in terms of expressions of interest from the local community\u201d.\nShe said that almost 40 children would be ready for P1 in September 2025.\nThe proposed temporary site for the school is on vacant land close to Lisnasharragh Leisure Centre - formerly the Robinson Centre - and Lisnasharragh Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) station.\nIt has room for a mobile classroom and a soft play area.\nIn the planning documents, Na\u00edscoil na Seolta said the plan for the temporary site on Montgomery Road was for five years so would not affect the long-term development of the area.\nThe Education Authority (EA) said it is aware of the plan for Na\u00edscoil na Seolta to locate on a site on Montgomery Road in east Belfast - which is not in the ownership of EA.\nIt added the Orangefield redevelopment is \"key to the successful future delivery of special educational needs provision for Greater Belfast in the long term\".",
    "First Minister Vaughan Gething looks set to lose a vote of no confidence in his leadership later, after one of his members said that two Labour colleagues are off sick.\nThe Conservatives called the Senedd vote after months of rows over donations to Mr Gething\u2019s leadership campaign from a company owned by a man previously convicted of environmental offences.\nVikki Howells, the chair of the Labour group of Members of the Senedd (MSs), told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that two members are currently unwell.\nShe said Vaughan Gething would not stand down if he lost, saying it was a \u201cgimmick\u201d and it was up to the \u201cvoting public to decide who is in the Senedd\u201d.\nMr Gething would not have to resign if he loses, Ms Howells said.\nPlaid Cymru accused Mr Gething of treating the Senedd with contempt.\nIt is believed that the two MSs off sick are Hannah Blythyn, who was sacked from the Welsh government by Vaughan Gething, and Lee Waters, the former transport minister.\nMr Waters had previously called for the donations to be returned.\nNeither were in the Senedd chamber on Tuesday, and it is unclear whether the two MSs would be able to vote remotely. \nNeither have proxy votes, granted for long term absence.\nWith Labour holding exactly half the seats in the 60 seat Welsh Parliament, it needs every backbencher to support the first minister.\nThe Conservatives have refused to agree to a pairing arrangement where some of their members would not vote to cover for Labour absences.\nTheir motion could be successful if at least one Labour Senedd member either rebels, abstains or does not take part.\nAll opposition parties, including Plaid Cymru and Welsh Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds, are expected to back the Tory motion.\nCynon Valley MS Vikki Howells said: \"This vote that will be being held this afternoon is just a gimmick by the Tories who are desperate to deflect from their disastrous 14 years in government.\n\"This is a party that will do anything to shift the focus elsewhere when we should be focusing on a general election.\"\nShe said Labour has always \"paired with the Tories\" to cancel out the impact of any members who are absent.\n\"We do have two Labour members who are currently unwell. The Tories knew that before they tabled this motion which as of yesterday, we have been told that they are refusing to pair with us.\"\nShe added: \"This is not a binding vote. The binding votes are the votes that are cast at the ballot box in a Senedd election.\"\nAsked if Mr Gething would have to quit if he lost the vote, she said: \"He wouldn't have to resign because he has just won a democratic vote to be leader of Welsh Labour.\"\nMr Gething has been first minister for 77 days, since he won the Welsh Labour leadership contest in March.\nVaughan Gething won the Welsh Labour leadership election in March after a campaign dominated by the donation of \u00a3200,000 from Dauson Environmental Group.\nThe company is owned by David John Neal, a man given suspended sentences in 2013 for the illegal dumping of waste, and in 2017 of not cleaning it up.\nIt emerged during the leadership contest that Mr Gething had lobbied on behalf of one of Mr Neal's companies, prior to his first leadership run in 2018.\nPublic reaction from Labour politicians was largely muted during the campaign itself, but Mr Gething has failed to prevent private anger from rising to the surface.\nThere were calls from within Labour for the party not to take any remaining money from Dauson, as it normally would with left over funds from campaign contests. \nThroughout the first minister has said that he has followed all the rules for political donations.\nIn a separate row, Mr Gething found himself having to defend a message he sent during the pandemic, where the then-health minister told colleagues he was deleting texts from a ministerial group chat.\nHe later sacked Hannah Blythyn, alleging she was the source of the leak to the  Nation.Cymru news site. She denied it, and has not spoken in the Senedd since.\nOpposition parties have demanded evidence, which Mr Gething has declined to provide.\nAll three issues - the donation, the message and the sacking, have been cited by the Tories for why it has brought the motion.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Andrew RT Davies said: \"One there's a question of judgement, two there's a question around transparency and three there's an issue around honesty.\"\nHe said it was \"exceptionally unlikely in any parliamentary democracy on a confidence issue that a pairing system would kick in\".\nMr Davies said the pairing system was there for \"more mundane votes\".\nPlaid Cymru's leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, told the same programme that the vote was \"up to Labour\".\n\"Are there Labour members who are wrestling with their conscience. Absolutely, we know there are.\"\nA Plaid Cymru spokesman said: \"Vaughan Gething was not voted in as first minister by the people of Wales but by Labour members in the Senedd. \n\"By denying the legitimacy of a vote of no confidence in the first minister, Labour ar",
    "A woman told police she was being stalked by a man who was later accused of murdering her and another woman, a jury has heard.\nCarl Cooper, 66, from Hither Green in south-east London, denies murdering Naomi Hunte, 41, and 48-year-old Fiona Holm.\nMs Hunte made a number of domestic callouts to police to her Woolwich home in 2020 and 2021 and told them that Mr Cooper was \"obsessed\" with her, Woolwich Crown Court has heard.\nThe prosecution described Mr Cooper as an \"obvious suspect\" in the killing of Ms Hunte, who was found stabbed to death on her blood-soaked sofa on Valentine's Day in 2022. Ms Holm, whose body has never been found, is believed to have died on 20 June 2023.\nIn a callout by police on 24 November 2020, Ms Hunte told officers: \"I think he is obsessed with me. He told me he really likes me. I told him, I just want to be friends. He was angered at that.\"\nMs Hunte said she was \"really scared\" and reported that Mr Cooper had warned her he was \"going to wait out here until the morning, I'm going to watch where you go and who you go and see\".\nShe said they had slept together but were not in a relationship and had separated some days earlier.\nIn a callout to her home on 29 June 2021, Ms Hunte told officers that Mr Cooper \"stalks me and I'm really scared now\".\nThe court heard that when police had visited her flat on 6 November 2020, she told them she did not want to take her allegations any further, saying she had been drunk and could not remember making a complaint.\nShe was asked if she was afraid of what the person she was complaining about might do to her or someone else, if the abuse was happening more often and if there had been any threats that had made her scared. \nMs Hunte replied \"no\" to all the questions.\nThe court has heard that inquiries showed that the last person to visit her was Mr Cooper. Her blood was later found on three different areas of his jacket, the court heard.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Narita Bahra KC, defending, told the jury they were judges of fact in what was a \"very unusual case\".\nMs Bahra said: \"Are we even sure that Fiona Holm is dead? And if you are sure, then you will have to go on to consider who is responsible for the killing.\"\nShe added that \"the obvious suspect is a dangerous starting point\" and the prosecution was relying on circumstantial evidence.\nShe said: \"You should take great care not to jump to conclusions, keep an open mind - bias and preconceptions need to be put to one side - and if you are not sure about any of the evidence, then the benefit must go to Mr Cooper.\n\"You need to decide who killed Naomi Hunte or whether Fiona Holm is dead.\"\nMs Holm, of Catford, south-east London, was alcohol dependent, autistic and had ADHD and, like Ms Hunte, had also made complaints about Mr Cooper to the police, the court has heard.\nHe lit fires in the days after Ms Holm went missing and carried out a \"wholesale redecoration\" of his living room, which included stripping off wallpaper, cutting out net curtains and removing a rug, prosecutor Joel Smith KC previously told the jury.\nHe described the defendant as a \"callous bully\" with a \"predilection to control women\" and who was \"prone to violence when challenged\".\nThe trial continues.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The UK telecommunications giant Openreach has been fined \u00a31.34m after one of its engineers was swept away by a flooded river.\nAlun Owen died in October 2020 after being sent to work on a customer's telephone line in the village of Abergwyngregyn near Bangor.\nThe village had been flooded in the days before his death, after the River Aber burst its banks.\nOpenreach pleaded guilty at Llandudno Magistrates Court to breaching health and safety laws for staff working near water.\nLlandudno Magistrates Court heard how the 32-year-old father-of-two was called out to a customer's home in the village after a fault was identified on lines crossing the river.\nMr Owen attempted to wade into the river to throw a new line to the other bank, with water up to his calves.\nBut the court heard he slipped and was swept away.\nA huge search operation was launched, and the body of Mr Owen was found that evening, about 270 metres (0.16 miles) downstream.\nAn adjourned inquest heard Mr Owen, who was from Bethesda, Gwynedd had died from drowning.\nThe court was told that while Openreach had policies in place for working near water, they were not followed in this case.\nNathan Cook, for the Health and Safety Executive, said no engineer should have been working alone near water, and specific safety procedures should have been agreed with managers.\nThe court heard Mr Owen had also not taken an online training course about working on water.\nMr Owen's wife Ceri told the court that her husband's death was a \"huge loss for everyone\".\n\"The loss of Al had a huge impact on the whole family. It was very traumatic,\" she said.\nShe said her health had suffered, with panic attacks and weight loss.\nShe said her two daughters had separation anxiety, and wanted to know where she was.\n\"They get very worried that something might happen to me as happened to their father,\" she said.\n\"Our family will never be the same.\"\nA statement on behalf of Mr Owen's mother Cathy was read out by his sister, Lowri Owen.\n\"Losing Al has changed me as a person. I think of him every single moment of every single day,\" she said.\n\"I am and always will be heartbroken.\"\nDominic Kay KC, for Openreach, said the company wanted to express its \"genuine and sincere remorse for what happened\".\nHe also said that apology came from the chief executive of Openreach, Clive Selley.\nIn a statement, Mr Selley also apologised for failings after the death of Mr Owen, including withdrawing a staff discount for the family's broadband services, because Mr Owen no longer worked for Openreach.\nIn another incident, the company used a wedding picture of Mr Owen as part of a case study in new health and safety training, without seeking permission from the family.\n\"I am deeply saddened that Openreach added to the grief and suffering,\" said Mr Selley.\nDistrict Judge Gwyn Jones said the level of fine needed to have a real economic impact on the company, so health and safety was not seen as an optional add on.\nHe said he recognised that there were mitigating factors, including a guilty plea, and remorse shown by the company.\nHe ordered Openreach to pay a fine of \u00a31.34m and costs of \u00a315,858.\nHe added: \"The punishment will not take away the pain or trauma suffered by the family of Alun Owen.\"\nSpeaking after the court hearing, Mr Owen's family said no financial penalty will give them \"any sense of justice\".\n\"The fine imposed is inconsequential and does not diminish the pain, nor does it lessen the void that has been left since Al was taken away from us,\" they said in a statement read outside the court.\n\"There was never any doubt that Openreach were entirely culpable for causing Al's death - a death that was preventable and a death that resulted in the loss of a precious and cherished member of the family, who was also dearly treasured by his wide circle of friends.\"\nThe family said is felt the company had displayed \"a lethargic approach\" to training and equipment for those working near water.\n\"We recognise that Openreach have now been forced to address some of their health and safety inadequacies, hopefully ensuring that no other family endures the pain and distress that has been caused by Al's death,\" they added.\nOpenreach said admitted it \"could have done more\" to make sure engineers had the right guidance, processes and training when working on, or near water.",
    "On the day troops from Britain, the US and Canada were landing on beaches in northern France during World War Two, a secret military unit somehow managed to escape with their lives during a self-inflicted rocket onslaught - in Essex.\nEighty years on from Paul Roberson's \"incredibly lucky escape\" in Shoeburyness on 6 June 1944 - otherwise known as D-Day - James Roberson, 70, has been telling the story of the bizarre incident in which an accidental discharge somehow failed to cause serious injury.\nIn 1942 his father Paul, who lived in Barnes in south-west London but grew up north of the River Thames in Edgware and Kilburn, had joined the Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development - a part of the Royal Navy known colloquially as the \"wheezers and dodgers\". \nMuch of the unit's work was detailed in Paul Roberson's PhD thesis, which was kept secret for years - although the wheezers and dodgers were later written about by the author Gerald Pawle.\nOne account describes Roberson's team working on kites and \u201cmagic\u201d balloons, radar, fast aerial mines, bombs to blow holes in the Atlantic Wall, radio-controlled boats and other extraordinary inventions.\nA success was the development of a pigeon parachute to help deliver homing pigeons behind enemy lines. (About 30 pigeons would go on to be awarded the Dickin Medal - often described as the Victoria Cross for animals.)\nOne member of the secret unit, Prof Jim Jeffes, told the BBC in 2004 that they were not \"a gang of crazy scientists\".\nHe said: \"It was a hardworking, productive collection of people who were extremely well-motivated.\"\nIn 1944, Roberson and his colleagues were based at a military establishment in Southend-on-Sea in Essex.\nOne of their projects was known as Hajile (Elijah spelt backwards), which they were working on while the largest military operation on sea, air and land ever attempted was taking place.\nSpeaking to BBC London a stone's throw from Admiralty Arch, near Trafalgar Square, James Roberson said of Hajile: \"It was a mechanism to drop jeeps or light tanks or other, relatively heavy, objects out of a plane but with a small parachute on the top so that it dropped accurately and didn't drift.\n\"Then 15ft (4.5m) above the ground, there was a mechanism where rockets would fire and the object would come gently to the ground in a cloud of smoke, and that was the plan.\n\"It didn't quite work out that way.\"\nMr Roberson said: \"My dad was standing in a circle of these rockets just fiddling around, trying to get the connections right, and in a block house not far away there was another technician and he obviously thought, 'Oh, I wonder if this circuit works?'\n\"He clicked a switch and, at that point, he fired all the rockets and the rockets fired around my dad, half drilling him down into the ground, and this enormous apparatus shot up 40ft (12m) into the air and flew around.\n\"Everybody was blinded by dust. They were wandering around and then the rockets finished and they crashed back to earth.\n\"Incredibly, none of them were killed or injured. It's a miracle that nobody was hurt.\n\"My dad nearly died on D-Day - but in Shoeburyness, not on the beaches of Normandy.\"\nMr Roberson, who spent many years working for BBC's East Midlands today, said he wanted to tell the story \"because I'm 70 now... I'm not sure I'll be around in another 10 years\".\nHe added: \"It seems to be a completely forgotten branch of the navy and of the British armed forces.\"\nThe former journalist remains baffled as to why so little is still known by the wider public about a unit he says \"had a tremendous amount of success and did amazing work\".\nHe added: \"There just doesn't seem to have been the sort of appetite for it. \n\"Maybe they were just very modest.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

He told local media in Rochester that his friend did not die alone.\n\"The doctor was with him... he was at peace and he was comfortable,\" he said, according to ABC news agency affiliate, WHAM-TV. \n\"She put his favourite singer, Frank Sinatra, on her phone and he peacefully left us.\"\n\nThe pair served in Iwo Jima together, a Japanese island the US captured from the country's imperial army in 1945.\nMr Persichitti's friend of 46 years, Pastor William Leone, told WHAM-TV \"he had a real zest for living\" and would visit children in local schools to talk to about his experiences.\nThe veteran was also a former teacher. In April, students at a local school helped organise a birthday celebration in his honour.\nIn 2020, he was named an honouree of New York State Senate's Veteran Hall of Fame by the then Senator Rich Funke. \nHis local chapter of Honor Flight in Rochester said they will miss him.",
    "A Somerset quarry that has been closed for 40 years will resume operations in 2025.\nLocated near the A361 between Frome and Shepton Mallet, the re-opening of Westdown Quarry was approved by Somerset Council on 6 June.\nMore than 1,100 people sent letters to the council objecting to the proposals.

    "I\u2019ve just spent the past few days with the latest gadget billed as being able to take on the smartphone: the Rabbit R1.\nI wanted to see if I could imagine this portable, artificial intelligence (AI) digital assistant one day becoming what my phone is now - something I can\u2019t live without.\nYou can see the thinking behind it: millions of people have played with AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini.\nGiven that success with software, it seems the Next Big Thing for the tech giants is to do the same with hardware, and find ways to physically embed AI tools.\nMicrosoft is doing it with laptops, while Apple is rumoured to be following suit with the next iPhone.\nBut there are also people trying to come up with an entirely new category of gadget too - which is where the R1 comes in.\nRabbit says its new device is \"an intuitive companion\" that can \"handle everyday digital tasks\".\nA portable AI-driven assistant that can help you as you go about your day, get you off your phone and back into the real world... you can see how that would potentially be a useful gadget.\nThe problem though is there have already been a couple of similar products launched - and the reality has fallen well short of the hype.\nTake the Humane pin - a brooch-like, AI-driven device.\nUS tech reviewer Marques Brownlee, who has 18 million followers on YouTube, captured the mood when he described it as the worst product he\u2019d ever reviewed\nThe R1 is now available in the UK and Europe. Does it fare any better? I'll tell you his - and my - verdicts later on.\nBut, first, let's take a closer look.\nSo let\u2019s start with what\u2019s good about it. \nThe Rabbit R1 is a fun bit of hardware, in an era where nothing is tactile any more, a luminous orange square with a big screen that you definitely won\u2019t lose in your handbag.\nIt\u2019s got a button, a scroll wheel, and a camera which you can see move from front-to-back, making a satisfying noise as it does.\nAnd it\u2019s affordable, priced at \u00a3159, with no subscription required.\nBut what are you supposed to do with it? \nWell, basically, you can ask it stuff. It\u2019s pretty limited in terms of anything else at the moment. \nThere\u2019s no social media, messaging, shopping, health or banking - at least for now. You can sign in to Spotify or Apple Music accounts, but you\u2019d want a bigger speaker than the in-built one. \nAnd, randomly, you can also use Midjourney, the AI image generator. That\u2019s about it.\nThe Rabbit R1 successfully told me the time, the weather forecast, gave me the right directions to my son\u2019s school (after I told it my location), and swiftly translated some conversation from English into German.\nIt listed the top 20 chess players of 2024 when my partner asked it who was the best, taking the answer from a list on chess.com. But it did better than the Amazon Echo in this department - Alexa plumped for Garry Kasparov, who retired from regular competitive chess in 2005.\nWe asked it about a few well-known conspiracy theories and it did not engage with them, and when I asked it who would win the next UK general election its response came from the YouGov poll of that day.\nSo yes \u2013 it\u2019s good at getting stuff off the web. But so am I.\nIt gave me photos of where I work \u2013 the BBC Scotland building in Glasgow \u2013 but it really struggled to tell me where to go for coffee. \nThe first time I asked it said \u201cgive me a moment\u201d and then shut down after 112 seconds of silence.\nI tried again and this time it delivered fairly quickly, but of the five options it listed, two of the coffee shops were 2.5 miles away, one had closed down and one I couldn\u2019t find at all on Google.\nThe closest it came up with was 1.3 miles away - in reality, the building is flanked by many options, with two big coffee chains minutes away by foot.\nIt can use the camera to describe its surroundings \u2013 sometimes - but it hallucinated a lot.\nIt told me a vase of white peonies in my bedroom contained yellow chrysanthemums, and confidently misidentified a plate of poppadoms as tortilla chips.\nWhen I pointed the camera at myself it described me as an \u201colder woman\u201d (deep breaths), and when my son pulled his most dramatic, angry face, it described him as a boy with \u201ca friendly expression\u201d (more deep breaths).\nIn the first hour we used up more than 20% of the battery life. \nMeanwhile, all your activity is stored on an account in the cloud which is called your Rabbithole, and you can\u2019t access this on the device itself.\nThe Rabbit R1 has also faced accusations that it is essentially a glorified Android app, and tech journalist Mishaal Rahman from Android Authority even reported managing to install the tech behind it onto a Google phone.\nBut the firm strongly denies this, saying that while there are some \u201cunofficial emulators\u201d around, its system is \u201cvery bespoke\u201d.\nThere\u2019s also a rather weird shadow hanging over the company behind the Rabbit R1, with allegations online that it is a former NFT company which rebranded without honouring commitments to previous investors.\nOn this",
    "More than a million Palestinians - almost half of the total population of Gaza - have been displaced from the south of the territory over the past month, sharply worsening the already dire humanitarian situation, according to the UN.\nThe Israeli military began a ground operation in the southern city of Rafah on 6 May following seven months of war which saw many Palestinians flee to Rafah to escape fighting and bombardment elsewhere.\nIsrael says taking control of Rafah and eliminating the Hamas battalions there is crucial to achieving its war aims. \nIt told Palestinians in Rafah to move to sandy coastal areas or the city of Khan Younis, which is largely in ruins.\nNow the UN is warning that the movement of such a large number of people in such a short timeframe alongside a sharp fall in aid deliveries is having deadly consequences.\n\"People are dying every single day... the vast majority according to reports are women and children. \nMany of them are dying unnecessarily due to lack of medical care. Children are dying due to malnutrition and dehydration,\" Juliette Touma, spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees Unrwa, told BBC Arabic.\nOn 6 May Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee instructed Palestinians in eastern Rafah to evacuate to an \u201cexpanded humanitarian zone\u201d that stretches from the nearby al-Mawasi area to the central town of Deir al-Balah and said they would find field hospitals, tents, food and other supplies.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) then took control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, which lies to the south-east of Rafah city, as it began what it described as a \u201cprecise counterterrorism operation\u201d against Hamas operatives and infrastructure in eastern Rafah. The US had said it opposed a \"major ground operation\" in Rafah.\nWhile the IDF instructed people in eastern Rafah to evacuate, central and western parts of the city were not covered by the evacuation orders.\nBut Palestinians in these parts of Rafah have also fled their temporary structures as deadly bombardment in different areas around the city continued and troops advanced into central neighbourhoods.\nOne Israeli missile strike on 26 May set fire to a camp for displaced Palestinians near Tal al-Sultan to the north-west of Rafah, killing 45 people including many children, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry.\nThe strike caused global outrage. The IDF later said it had not expected such a fire to break out. \nRecent satellite imagery of western and central Rafah analysed by BBC Arabic showed thousands of tents sheltering displaced people have disappeared in recent weeks.\nAerial pictures of western Rafah from 1 June show areas that were densely populated have become deserted.\nSimilar images of Tal al-Sultan to the north-west of Rafah, where a major urban refugee camp is located, show areas of land have been cleared of tents.\nOn Thursday the head of Unrwa Philippe Lazzarini said all of his agency's 36 shelters in Rafah were empty of people. \nIn recent weeks, Israeli troops have been gradually pushing into built-up neighbourhoods of Rafah from the east and south.\nAn armoured vehicle and troops were seen on 28 May in a video posted on social media at the central al-Awda roundabout.\nSatellite images from 1 June also show several armoured vehicles positioned near Rafah.\nThe satellite image taken on 1 June shows the destruction of al-Abrar mosque as well as severe damage to nearby market buildings in central Rafah.\nThe IDF has also declared control of much of the strategically important buffer zone along the Gaza-Egypt border known as the Philadelphi Corridor.\nThe UN and other aid agencies have been warning the assault on the city is having catastrophic consequences.\nMr Lazzarini said Unrwa had to stop health and other services in Rafah and said his agency had only been able to pick up 450 trucks of supplies entering Gaza over the past three weeks\n\"This is nothing in the face of the needs,\" he said.\nWorld Health Organization chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said fighting had \"severely crippled\" healthcare provision in Rafah where he said tens of thousands of vulnerable people were still present.\nHe said the UAE field hospital in Rafah city was the \"only facility in the area providing health services\" but was \"increasingly difficult to reach due to hostilities\".\nThere was also only one fully functional field hospital in the al-Mawasi area, he said.\nHe called for the Rafah crossing to be reopened saying its closure was making it harder to get supplies and staff into Gaza.\nThe Rafah crossing in southern Gaza, which had been the main entry point of aid entering via Egypt, has been closed after Israel took control of the Palestinian side of the crossing in early May. \nThe Hamas-run health ministry also said the continued closure of the Rafah crossing meant severely wounded Palestinians could not be evacuated for potentially lifesaving treatment abroad. Some 25,000 wounded Palestinians needed treatment abroa",
    "A controversy over a waterfall has cascaded into a social media storm in China, even prompting an explanation from the water body itself. \nA hiker posted a video that showed the flow of water from Yuntai Mountain Waterfall - billed as China's tallest uninterrupted waterfall - was coming from a pipe built high into the rock face.\nThe clip has been liked more than 70,000 times since it was first posted on Monday. \nOperators of the Yuntai tourism park said that they made the \"small enhancement\" during the dry season so visitors would feel that their trip had been worthwhile.\n\"The one about how I went through all the hardship to the source of Yuntai Waterfall only to see a pipe,\" the caption of the video posted by user \"Farisvov\" reads.\nThe topic \"the origin of Yuntai Waterfall is just some pipes\" began trending all over social media. \nIt received more than 14 million views on Weibo and nearly 10 million views on Douyin - causing such an uproar that local government officials were sent to the park to investigate. \nThey asked the operators to learn a lesson from the incident and explain the enhancements to tourists ahead of time, according to state broadcaster CCTV.\n\n\n\nThe park later posted on behalf of the waterfall saying, \"I didn't expect to meet everyone this way\".\n\"As a seasonal scenery I can't guarantee that I will be in my most beautiful form everytime you come to see me,\" it adds. \n\"I made a small enhancement during the dry season only so I would look my best to meet my friends.\"\nLocated in central Henan province, the 312-metre Yuntai falls is located inside the Yuntai Mountain Geopark, a UNESCO Global Geopark.\nMillions of visitors travel there every year, drawn by geological formations that date back more than a billion years.\nPark officials told CCTV that the water they used to pump water into the falls was spring water, adding that it would not damage the natural landscape.\nMany social media users appeared to be understanding of the situation.\n\"Yuntai park: Does this person not have better things to do?\" a comment liked nearly 40,000 times on Douyin reads.\n\"I think it's a good thing to do. Otherwise people would be disappointed if they end up seeing nothing there,\" a user on Weibo said.\nBut there is also criticism.\n\"It's not respecting the natural order, and not respecting the tourists,\" a Weibo user wrote.\n\"How could it be called the No.1 waterfall anymore,\" another user commented on Douyin.\nThis is not the first time artificial measures have been used to \"help\" famous waterfalls in China. \nHuangguoshu Waterfall, a famous tourist destination in the southwestern Guizhou province, has been helped by a water diversion project from a nearby dam since 2006 to maintain its  flow during the dry season.",

Now, there is an even greater demand for interacting with artificial intelligence.\u201d\nIt's just one of many ways that generative AI is being used by the adult entertainment business.\nAnalysis by SplitMetrics revealed that AI companion apps reached 225 million downloads in the Google Play Store.\n\u201cI would expect more app developers to take note of this trend and look at ways this category can be further innovative and monetised,\u201d said SplitMetrics general manager Thomas Kriebernegg.\nAI companions can be lucrative, says Misha Rykov, privacy researcher with Mozilla\u2019s Privacy Not Included guide.\n\u201cGiven that most of the chatbots are charging fees, and the core technology has been developed elsewhere [such as Open AI], it looks like a high-margin business. Also, these apps collect personal data and often share it with third parties like advertisers - a tried and true business model.\u201d\nBut the merger of AI and the adult entertainment business has set off alarm bells.\nOne problem lies in the bias inherent in generative AI, which produces new content based on the data on which it has been trained.\nThere is a risk that retrograde gender stereotypes about sex and pleasure get encoded into sex chatbots, says Dr Kerry McInerney, senior research fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, at the University of Cambridge.\n\u201cIt's crucial that we understand what kinds of data sets are used to train sex chatbots, otherwise we risk replicating ideas about sex that demean female pleasure and ignore sex that exists outside of heterosexual intercourse.\u201d\nThere is also the risk of addiction says Mr Rykov, who says that AI chatbots target lonely people, notably men.\n\u201cMost of the AI chatbots we reviewed have high addictive potential and several potential harms, especially to users with mental health challenges.\u201d\nMozilla has added content warnings to several AI chatbots \u201cas we found themes of abuse, violence, and underage relationships,\u201d says Mr Rykov.\nHe also raised the issue of privacy. Partnership chatbots are designed to collect \u201can unprecedented amount of personal data\u201d.\nMr Rykov adds that that 90% of apps reviewed by Mozilla \u201cmay share or sell personal data\u201d, while more than half of the apps won\u2019t let users delete personal data.\nOthers warn about the possible danger such AI could have on real-world relationships.\nTamara Hoyton, senior practice consultant at the counselling service Relate, points out: \u201cSome difficulties may come about if real encounters are profoundly disappointing because they don't match up to the strictly defined requirements that users experience in AI porn.\u201d\nMs Hoyton adds that, in some cases, AI porn could take users into dangerous areas.\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with a bit of fantasy, and many people get aroused by thoughts that they have absolutely no intention of acting on; AI porn might be seen like this.\n\u201cIf it's crossed over into an assumption of consent for example, a sense of entitlement, or that everyone will be what turns you on, based on the user\u2019s experience of the compliance of the AI object, then it's an issue.\u201d\nCompanies using AI within the adult entertainment industry acknowledge that there is a need for caution, but maintain that AI has an important role to play.\nPhilipp Hamburger, head of AI at Lovehoney, says the company is aiming \u201cto enhance the sexual experience of its customers, rather than replace it, which is an important line to draw\".\nOthers believe AI will have a positive effect on the sector. Ruben Cruz is the co-founder of Barcelona-based The Clueless Agency, which created one of the first AI influencers, Aitana Lopez.\nHe points out that the sex industry will always exist, and AI can help mitigate ethical concerns by ensuring that the content is not created using real people.\n\u201cThis shift aims to ensure that no person, male or female, has to be explicitly sexualized in the future.\u201d",
    "Police in New York are seeking to revoke former President Donald Trump's gun licence following his recent criminal conviction, US media reports.\nUnnamed officials within the New York City Police Department told CNN, the New York Times and ABC News that it was currently completing an investigation that would likely lead to the former president being banned from owning a gun.\nBoth state law in New York and wider federal law prohibits individuals with felony convictions from possessing a firearm. \nThe NYPD has not publicly confirmed the move in the case of Mr Trump. The BBC has approached it for comment.\nMr Trump became the first president in US history to be criminally convicted last week.\nA Manhattan jury found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to allegedly conceal a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. \nThe former president was accused of buying the silence of Ms Daniels over an alleged sexual encounter between the two.\nMr Trump has consistently denied sexual contact with Ms Daniels, and of having broken the law.\nThe 77-year-old has called the verdict a \"disgrace\" and indicated he intends to appeal against the conviction.\nMr Trump is due to be sentenced on 11 July - four days before he is officially declared the Republican party's nominee for the presidential election this November.\nPolice sources told the New York Times that the former president turned two guns over after he was charged in the criminal case in April last year and his licence was suspended.\nA third firearm was reportedly transferred to Florida, though it remains unclear whether it is still in his possession. \nMr Trump has been an ardent advocate of gun owners' rights.

They say they feel isolated and unsafe - with one describing the African country as an \u201copen prison\u201d.\nWith political parties divided over the government\u2019s controversial plan to send asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda, the BBC has travelled to the African state to speak to four of the migrants already there - albeit under a separate agreement - about their experience in the country.\nThe small group arrived from Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean. They say their complex medical needs, in some cases as the result of past rape and torture, are not being met in Rwanda. \nEach of them receives the equivalent of $50 (\u00a339) a week for food and other essentials, but under the terms of their stay - agreed by the UK and Rwandan governments - they are not permitted to work.\nAll four say they have faced harassment and unwanted sexual advances on the street. They say they are, in effect, \u201cself-imprisoned\u201d - too scared to go out - while they wait for the UK to find somewhere permanent for them to live.\nThe group - all Sri Lankan Tamils - were transferred to Rwanda for urgent medical care after suicide attempts. They are now out of military hospital and living in two flats on the outskirts of the capital, Kigali, paid for by British authorities.\nTheir legal status in Rwanda is not the same as it would be for asylum seekers flown there from the UK - but a lawyer representing two of the four says their \u201cnegative experiences do raise serious concerns\u201d about Rwanda\u2019s ability to offer a safe haven for \u201cvery vulnerable refugees\u201d.\nA senior Rwandan official told the BBC she had \u201ccomplete faith\u201d in her country\u2019s medical system and the migrants\u2019 concerns about personal safety were not shared by others. \u201cWe  have a thriving foreign population here,\u201d she added.\nTo protect their identities, migrants\u2019 names have been changed\nNone of the four tried to enter the UK - instead they filed asylum claims on Diego Garcia, which is used as a secretive UK-US military base.\nThey were among dozens of people to arrive on the island in October 2021 - previously reported by the BBC. They said they had been fleeing persecution and trying to sail to Canada to claim asylum. \nThe four we met in Rwanda said they had been victims of torture and sexual violence in their home countries - some because of past links with the Tamil Tiger rebels, who were defeated in Sri Lanka\u2019s civil war 15 years ago.\nDown a quiet road, in a two-bedroom apartment, Azhagu says he has been diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress disorder, and uncertainty about his future and the isolation are making things worse.\n\u201cWe are not getting proper medical treatment. We have mental health issues,\u201d says the 23-year-old. \u201cWhenever we go and tell the doctors about our problems they can't help us.\u201d\nRwandan medical staff have shouted at him, he alleges, and on one occasion after self-harming, he says he was threatened with arrest and told to return to Diego Garcia.\nMayur, 26, who shares the apartment, says he has given up on counselling. He says he doesn't get proper medicine and doesn\u2019t get to have \u201ca good conversation\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to go to the hospital,\u201d he adds.\nLawyer Tom Short, from UK firm Leigh Day, says an independent expert assessment found \u201ceach of our clients has complex medical needs which are not being met in Rwanda\u201d.\nWe approached the military hospital where all the Tamils have been receiving treatment, but we were referred to the Rwandan government.\nThe top Rwandan official in charge of the deal to transfer asylum seekers from the UK, Doris Uwicyeza Picard, defended her country\u2019s medical system - adding the migrants were being treated \u201cto the best of our ability\u201d.\nThree of the migrants - the two young men and a woman, Lakshani - have had their claims for international protection approved by British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot) administration, which runs Diego Garcia. The United Nations and lawyers representing the group say this, in effect, gives them refugee status. The fourth in the group - Lakshani\u2019s father, Khartik - has been permitted to accompany his daughter.\nIt means the group cannot be returned to Sri Lanka, but the UK has said it will not take them in. The Conservative government told the BBC last year that Biot \u201ccannot be a backdoor to the UK\u201d.\nWhile Biot falls under British sovereignty, it is described as \u201cconstitutionally distinct\u201d.\nThe group in Rwanda showed us legal documents, WhatsApp messages, emails and letters they had written over the past year to British officials, including Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, asking to be moved.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many more years we will have to live as stateless prisoners of the British government without freedom,\u201d one message said.\nThe four also told us that harassment had left them frightened to leave their homes.\nIn Lakshani\u2019s apartment, a grey curtain is pulled across the barred windows ",
    "A body has been found in the search for a two-year-old boy who fell into a river in Leicester.\nXielo Maruziva entered the water while with his family on 18 February, prompting a major search operation involving specialist teams.\nLeicestershire Police said a body was found on Thursday morning after workers had been in the area of Aylestone Meadows, near the River Soar. \nThe body was recovered and formal identification will now take place, the force said. \nMore than 200 police officers were said to have been involved with the search for Xielo, with specialist teams of divers and other organisations involved. \nDespite their efforts the two-year-old was not found and the operation was scaled down about one month later.\nAssistant Chief Constable Michaela Kerr said: \u201cThis is devastating news and our thoughts are with Xielo\u2019s family.\n\"We are so sorry to bring them this news which we were all dreading and our full support is being provided to them at this most difficult time.\"\nThe force said it had informed the coroner and asked for privacy for Xielo's family. \nSupport is also being provided to the workers involved in the find, ACC Kerr added.\nIn a previous statement, Xielo's mother described him as a \"cheeky, funny, friendly, smart, caring and independent little boy\".\nXielo's father, who said his son \"loved cuddles, playing with his toys and going to the park\", had entered the water the day he went missing in an attempt to rescue him. \nThe search for the two-year-old boy was made \"challenging\" by poor weather conditions, police said at the time.\nSpecialist Group International (SGI), a private diving company that helped to look for Nicola Bulley who disappeared in Lancashire in 2023, joined police in the search as it entered its second week, following \"liaison with his family\".\nThe search area was also widened across the River Soar in Leicester over concerns Xielo could have travelled outside of the Aylestone Meadows area. \nNumerous witnesses who had been in the area in the moments after the two-year-old disappeared said the river had a \"powerful\" current.\nOfficers urged the public to avoid entering the water or attempt to carry out their own searches. \n\nCity councillors for Aylestone, Nigel Porter and Scott Kennedy-Lount, shared their sadness at the news in a joint statement.\nIt read: \"We know that for Xielo's parents and family this will be the most devastating news and it is a heartbreaking outcome.\n\"Local residents in Aylestone have been deeply affected by this tragedy and it has touched us all.\"\nThe councillors added that the community would \"undoubtedly\" offer support to Xielo's family. \n\"Our thoughts are with Xielo's family and we offer our deepest sympathies,\" they said. \nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Scientists have devised a low-cost, energy-efficient method of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the air, new research suggests.\nThe team at the University of Cambridge used a method similar to charging a battery to charge activated charcoal, which is often used in household water filters to remove contaminants.\nThe capture and storage of CO2 has been used as a way of reducing emissions that contribute to global warming.\nDr Alexander Forse, who led the study, said capturing from the atmosphere was a \"last resort\", but added: \"Given the scale of the climate emergency, it's something we need to investigate.\"\nThe charged charcoal sponge required lower temperatures to remove the captured CO2 so it could be stored, making it potentially more energy-efficient than current methods, researchers found.\nDr Forse, of the Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, said: \"The first and most urgent thing we've got to do is reduce carbon emissions worldwide.\n\"But greenhouse gas removal is also thought to be necessary to achieve net zero emissions and limit the worst effects of climate change.\n\"Realistically, we've got to do everything we can.\"\nDr Forse said this method was a \"kind of crazy idea\" the team came up with during Covid-19 lockdowns.\n\"This approach opens a door to making all kinds of materials for different applications, in a way that's simple and energy-efficient,\" he added.\nIn most materials currently used for CO2 capture from air, the materials need to be heated to temperatures as high as 900C (1,652F).\nBut the charged charcoal sponges only required heating to 90 to100C, temperatures that could be achieved using renewable electricity.\nThe materials were heated from the inside out, making the process faster and less energy-intensive.\nHowever, the materials did have limitations and researchers were working on how to increase the quantity of carbon dioxide that could be captured.\nThe research, published in the journal Nature, was supported by the Leverhulme Trust, the Royal Society, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Cambridge Centre for Climate Repair.\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A diary from an army officer involved in D-Day described the World War Two Normandy landings as the \"biggest day since 1066\".\nJack Parham, who grew up on a farm in rural Wiltshire, kept a meticulous, tiny pocket diary, along with sketches of his involvement in the conflict.\nHe landed on the afternoon of D-Day, in 1944, co-ordinating and leading troops.\nHis diary is new kept by the Wiltshire & Swindon History Centre. Ruth Butler, from the centre, called him an \"artist, an inventor, also a consummate soldier\".\nJack Parham was a brigadier at the time of D-Day after starting in the army in World War One. He was promoted in the interwar years and by the end of the Second World War, had become a Major General.\nHe loved to record things, even if the diary was \"very small, it's a pocket diary, he's cramming a lot of information in.\"\nMs Butler explained to BBC Wiltshire that the entries are \"very, very real\".\n\"The fact you see this small pocket diary...its well-worn, its well scribbled in and he's got all sorts of information in the front covers,\" she added.\nBrig Parham wrote everything down, even going back and adding annotations where he felt something needed adding.\nHe also sketched - with captions.\nThat includes the caravan he stayed in to go and meet troops and lots of planes.\nBrig Parham was a huge fan of airplanes, including aerial photography, which he pushed as a way to help the military.\n\"He basically sketched every plane built from 1911 onwards\" said Ms Butler.\n\"Here's a young teenager thinking aerial photography is going to be really useful - he's persuading pilots to take him up.\"\nShe explained that he also learned to fly and sail himself, revolutionising the way artillery works, using aerial observation to carry out barrages and map terrain.\n\"He was an incredible individual.\" \nMs Butler said pictures of him \"always looks open and approachable\".\nHe eventually retired to Suffolk.\n\"When he died, the obituaries were very warm, he was a well-respected and well-liked officer and just got stuck in,\" she added. \nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The Nepalese army says it has removed eleven tonnes of rubbish, four corpses and one skeleton from Mount Everest and two other Himalayan peaks this year.\nIt took troops 55 days to recover the rubbish and bodies from Everest, Nuptse and Lhotse mountains. \nIt is estimated that more than fifty tonnes of waste and more than 200 bodies cover Everest. \nThe army began conducting an annual clean-up of the mountain, which is often described as the world\u2019s highest garbage dump, in 2019 during concerns about overcrowding and climbers queueing in dangerous conditions to reach the summit. \nThe five clean-ups have collected 119 tonnes of rubbish, 14 human corpses and some skeletons, the army says. \nThis year, authorities aimed to reduce rubbish and improve rescues by making climbers wear tracking devices and bring back their own poo. \nIn the future, the government plans to create a mountain rangers team to monitor rubbish and put more money toward its collection, Nepal's Department of Tourism director of mountaineering Rakesh Gurung told the BBC.\nFor the spring climbing season that ended in May, the government issued permits to 421 climbers, down from a record-breaking 478 last year. Those numbers do not include Nepalese guides. In total, an estimated 600 people climbed the mountain this year.\nThis year, eight climbers died or went missing, compared to 19 last year. \nA Brit, Daniel Paterson, and his Nepalese guide, Pastenji Sherpa, are among those missing after being hit by falling ice on 21 May. \nMr Paterson\u2019s family started a fundraiser to hire a search team to find them, but said in an update on 4 June that recovery \u201cis not possible at this time\u201d because of the location and danger of the operation. \nMr Gurung said the number of permits was lower this year because of the global economic situation, China also issuing permits and the national election in India which reduced the number of climbers from that country. \nThe number of permits will likely drop more after Nepal\u2019s Supreme Court ordered the government in May to limit permits. The preliminary order didn't set a maximum number. \nMr Gurung says he welcomes the order and the government is thinking about reforms such as staggering climbers to reduce traffic jams at the summit. \nThe government will work with experts to determine a safe number of climbers, Mr Gurung said. \n\"Without the scientific study, it can\u2019t be said what will be the perfect number for Mount Everest,\" he said.

    "World leaders including King Charles and US President Joe Biden joined D-Day veterans to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings on 6 June. \nThe King, Queen and Prince of Wales joined veterans in Portsmouth on Wednesday to mark the anniversary.\nTroops from the UK, the US, Canada, and France attacked German forces on the coast of northern France, on 6 June 1944.\nD-Day was the largest military seaborne operation ever attempted, and marked the start of the campaign to liberate Nazi-occupied north-west Europe. \nIt involved the simultaneous landing of tens of thousands of troops on five separate beaches in Normandy.\nMore than a year in the planning, D-Day was originally set to start on 5 June, judged to be the most likely date to combine calm seas, a full moon and low water at first light. However, storms meant it was delayed by 24 hours to 6 June.\nThe \"D\" simply stands for \"day\". D-Day is a military term for the first day of an operation\nAirborne troops were dropped behind enemy lines in the early hours, while thousands of ships gathered off the Normandy coast for the main seaborne attack.\nThough they were expecting an invasion, German military leaders believed the initial attacks were only a diversionary tactic. \nA deception plan in the weeks ahead of the attack had led them to expect the main invasion further along the coast.\nThe surprise element helped British troops establish a foothold on a beach codenamed Gold.\nIn addition, Canadian forces established themselves on another beach - Juno - and the British got on to Sword beach.\nAmerican soldiers also managed to land on the westernmost beach - Utah - without major casualties.\nBut at nearby Omaha beach, the US force suffered serious losses. The naval barrage and bombing raids on the German defences were ineffective and the Americans encountered a crack division of German troops.\nShortly after midnight, three US and British airborne divisions, more than 23,000 men, took off to secure the flanks of the beaches. Myriad naval vessels and landing craft gathered at a location in the Channel dubbed \"Piccadilly Circus\".\nFrom 06:30, the first five assault divisions were delivered to their beaches under cover of a naval bombardment. \nThroughout the day troops landed on the beaches. By midnight, the Allies had secured their beachheads and pushed further inland from Gold, Juno, Sword and Utah. \nUp to 7,000 ships and landing craft were involved, delivering a total of 156,000 men and 10,000 vehicles to the five beaches along the carefully selected stretch of the Normandy coast. \nThe landings would not have been possible without the support of massive air and naval forces, which were much stronger than those of the Germans.\nBut on D-Day alone, as many as 4,400 troops died from the combined allied forces. Some 9,000 were wounded or missing. \nTotal German casualties on the day are not known, but are estimated as being between 4,000 and 9,000 men. \nThousands of French civilians also perished, mainly as a result of bombing raids carried out by allied forces.\nAlthough they had got a foothold in France by the end of D-Day, allied forces were for a while at risk of being pushed back into the sea. \nThey had to keep building up their forces faster than the Germans could reinforce theirs.\nProgress through the narrow lanes and staunchly defended towns of Normandy was slow.\nBut now outnumbering their enemy and supported by their air superiority, they were able to overcome the considerable resistance - though at a heavy price.\nBy the time they liberated Paris, in late August 1944, about 10% of the two million allied troops who had by then reached France were dead, wounded or missing.\nIt is not clear how many D-Day veterans are still alive. All are now in their 90s or 100s.\nIt is thought there are just over 100 surviving British veterans. \nThe BBC's Royal Correspondent Sean Coughlan says 23 were taking part in the commemorations in Normandy, and a further 21 attended a memorial event at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.\nTwo dozen US veterans were also expected to make the trip to France, according to the American Battle Monuments Commission, which oversees US cemeteries and monuments abroad.\nHave you recently discovered your loved one was a D-Day veteran?

    "Forecasters are expecting temperatures to challenge records as millions of Americans across the southwest face what could be the hottest day yet of a sweltering heat wave. \nTemperatures were predicted on Thursday to reach 114F (45.5C) in Phoenix, Arizona, 111F in Las Vegas, Nevada, 111F in Palm Springs and 121F Death Valley, California. \nTwo weeks before summer even officially starts, excessive heat warnings were in effect across parts of California, Nevada, Arizona and Texas.  The heat warnings are expected to run until the end of Friday.  \nThe National Weather Service (NWS) expects temperature records to be \"tied or broken\" Thursday with \"little to no overnight relief from the heat\".\nThe mercury is soaring as a result of a heat dome, an area of high pressure where hot air is pushed down and trapped, causing temperatures to soar over large areas.\nTemperatures will be 20-30 degrees Fahrenheit above average for this time of year, according to the NWS. \nFirefighters are on standby to submerge heat-stroke victims in ice and some popular hiking trails have closed in Arizona amid the triple-digit temperatures.\nIn Phoenix, the hottest big city in the US, firefighters placed at least one heat-stroke victim inside human-sized immersion bags filled with ice cubes to lower the patient's body temperature on the way to hospital.\nWith 645 heat-related deaths last year in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, all of the city's fire department vehicles are being equipped with the bags. \nOn Thursday, police officers at Dream City Church in Phoenix said the fire service had also treated at least five people suffering from heat exhaustion at an event where former president Donald Trump was expected to speak.\nArizona is considered a swing state, and hundreds of people braved the dangerous temperatures in hopes of seeing one of Trump's first campaign events since he was found guilty of falsifying business records.\nTo contend with the heat, the city is also opening two overnight cooling stations this week for the first time. \nThe NWS advised that hikers at the Grand Canyon use extra caution when outdoors for an extended period of time at lower elevations, where 111F heat can be oppressive.  \nThe excessive heat also led to Arizona officials closing popular trails at Camelback Mountain and Piestewa Peak.\nThe triple-digit heat is a particular danger for homeless people, advocates said, which has led to a growing demand for temperature-controlled shelter. \nCentral Arizona Shelter Services (CASS) has the capacity to take in 600 people when temperatures reach these levels, its chief executive, Phillip Scharf, told BBC News on Wednesday. \nAnd that need is noticeable at the moment, he said.\n\"We have an increase in people looking for services and a change in the behaviour because it\u2019s oppressively hot outside,\u201d Mr Scarf said.\nNot only are people looking for a place to sleep but they are also looking for a place to stay during the day as the heat reaches record temperatures, he said.\nCASS, the largest single shelter in the state of Arizona, offers Phoenix-area residents shelter, water, food and more.\nIt's a service that is much-needed, as homeless and low-income residents make up the largest population of heat-related deaths in Maricopa County - where Phoenix is located.\nExtreme heat is also plaguing areas of Texas this week. In Brownsville, located in the southern part of the state near the Mexican border, the local NWS office recorded a never-before-reached daily temperature of 100F on Wednesday. \nThe extreme temperatures are forecast to spread north by the weekend to the Pacific north-west.

    "Researchers from the University of Michigan are using artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand what a dog's bark conveys about whether it is feeling playful or angry.\nThey are also digging into whether AI could correctly identify a dog's age, gender and breed based on what it woofs.\nThe scientists were able to make progress towards decoding canine communication by repurposing existing computer models trained on human speech.\n\"Advances in AI can be used to revolutionize our understanding of animal communication,\" said University of Michigan AI Laboratory head Rada Mihalcea.\n\"Our research opens a new window into how we can leverage what we built so far in speech processing to start understanding the nuances of dog barks.\"\nAI has enabled great strides to be made in understanding the subtleties of speech.\nAI-powered systems are used to distinguish nuances in tone, pitch and accent, which in turn enables technologies such as voice-recognition software.\nThey have reached that level of sophistication by being trained on a huge number of real human voices.\nHowever, no comparable database exists for dogs.\n\u201cAnimal vocalizations are logistically much harder to solicit and record,\u201d pointed out Artem Abzaliev, the study's lead author.\nHis team set out to discover whether scientists could get round that lack of data by piggy-backing on research carried out on humans.\nSo his team gathered the barks, growls and whimpers of 74 dogs of varying breeds, ages and sexes, in a variety of contexts.\nThey the fed them into a machine-learning model - a type of algorithm that identifies patterns in large data sets - which had been designed to analyse human speech.\nAnd they found it also did a good job at cocking at ear at what dogs were communicating too.\nOn average, the  researchers found their model was 70% accurate across various tests.\n\"This is the first time that techniques optimized for human speech have been built upon to help with the decoding of animal communication,\u201d said Ms Mihalcea. \n\u201cOur results show that the sounds and patterns derived from human speech can serve as a foundation for analyzing and understanding the acoustic patterns of other sounds, such as animal vocalizations.\u201d\nThe researchers say their findings could have \"important implications\" for animal welfare.\nThey suggest better understanding the nuances of the various noises animals make could improve how humans interpret and respond to their emotional and physical needs.\nThe results were presented at the Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation.\nMexico\u2019s National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics Institute also worked with the University of Michigan on the project.

    "After pushing borrowing costs sharply higher in recent years to try to quell soaring prices, countries around the world are shifting gear.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday announced its first interest rate cut in five years, dropping its main lending rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%.\nIt came a day after Canada took a similar step and followed a flurry of similar moves in recent months from countries including Sweden, Switzerland, Brazil and Mexico.\nOfficials in the UK and US, where borrowing costs now stand at the highest rate in years, are expected to hold off on any cuts at their meetings this month.\nBut many analysts are eyeing later in the summer or early autumn for action, maintaining it is only a matter of time.\nIt's a sign that the global battle against inflation sparked by the pandemic is entering a new phase, as hope builds in some of the biggest and most severely affected economies that price inflation is finally coming under control.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important move,\u201d said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into another stage.\u201d\nJust a few years ago, central banks around the world were hiking interest rates aggressively, hoping that higher borrowing costs would weigh on the economy and ease the pressures pushing up prices.\nThe moves were unusually synchronised, responding to global supply chain issues and shocks to food and energy markets that had sent prices leaping around the world.\nThat coordination has faded over the past year, and become more variable. \nIn the eurozone, the UK and US \u2013 economies that had not experienced inflation issues for decades \u2013 officials have been in a holding pattern, keeping rates at decades-high levels.\nThe decision from the ECB is a declaration of confidence that trends are moving in the right direction, said Emma Wall, head of investment research and analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown. \n\"What the central bank is saying today is, although it might not be coming down in a straight line, they are confident they can get inflation back down to the 2% target level,\" she said.\nIn the eurozone, inflation now stands at 2.6%, while in the UK, inflation has fallen to 2.3%, a long way down from a peak of over 11% in late 2022.\nIn the US, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures index, has dropped to 2.7%. \nStill the Fed, which was at the fore of the move to higher rates, has moved cautiously, reflecting concerns that progress on the issue might have stalled and that stronger-than-expected growth and major government spending might make it trickier to resolve.\n\"The eurozone economy is in a different place than the US,\" said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG.\nFor now, many forecasters are predicting at least one if not more rate cuts in the US, the eurozone and the UK this year, with more to follow in 2025.\n\nSuch moves would bring relief to businesses and households looking to borrow.\nBut analysts say that the path down for rates is likely to be slower and more halting than the climb up. \nIf central bankers cut rates too quickly, they risk unleashing a wave of economic activity that sends prices bubbling up again.\nMove too slowly, and the weight of higher borrowing costs could bring on a more severe economic downturn.\nIn announcing its rate cut on Thursday, the ECB was careful to stay away from promising future action, noted Mark Wall, chief economist at Deutsche Bank.\n\"The statement arguably gave less guidance than might have been expected on what comes next,\" he said. \"This is not a central bank in a rush to ease policy.\u201d\nIn the eurozone, the forces that kept rates low before the pandemic, including slower growth and an ageing population, are likely to re-emerge, ultimately sending them back closer to zero, said Joseph Gagnon, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \nBut he said the US is unlikely to see a return to the ultra-low borrowing costs that prevailed in the decade after the financial crisis, pointing in part to big budget deficits that are likely to keep upward pressure on rates. \n\"We will be a little slower than Europe to cut, but I think we're  also going to end up at a higher interest rate when this is all over,\" he said.

    "A former medical charity trustee has said he \"felt bullied\" by the organisation\u2019s chief executive.\nDr Alan Sagar, who volunteered for LIVES for 33 years, contacted the BBC after 26 staff and volunteers - both former and current - raised concerns about how the charity is run, with some describing the workplace culture as \"toxic\".\nFounded more than 50 years ago, LIVES sends emergency responders to medical incidents across Lincolnshire.\nIt said Dr Sagar's claim was \"false\" and \"at considerable variance\" from the recollection of its staff.\nIn April, the BBC spoke to former and current staff and volunteers from LIVES, who claimed there was a culture of bullying and belittling staff at the charity.\nThree of them said they had considered taking their own lives.\nLIVES trustees previously told the BBC those allegations were \"completely without foundation\" and they were \"satisfied the charity is well run and robustly managed\".\nThe BBC has since been contacted by a further nine of the charity's former and current staff and volunteers, including retired anaesthetist Dr Sagar.\nHe was a volunteer medical responder for LIVES between 1987 and 2020 and a trustee of the charity for more than 30 years, including periods as chair of trustees.\nDr Sagar said he had raised concerns about the charity's chief executive, Nikki Cooke, after an incident at a small event in Sleaford in October 2019.\nHe said the chief executive \"tore strips off\" him for making a speech in which he praised the work of LIVES\u2019 fire service volunteer responders, without asking for her permission first.\nHe said: \"Afterwards, she rushed over to me and I was told off like a schoolboy.\n\"I was having strips torn off me for having dared to say anything at that meeting.\"\nDr Sagar said he was \"very upset\" by the incident and \"felt bullied by her\", concerns he raised with the chair of trustees at the time. He resigned six months later. \nMs Cooke did not comment on the allegations, but the charity's trustees said the allegations were \"false\" and \"Dr Sagar\u2019s recollection of events and those of LIVES staff who attended is at considerable variance\".\nThe trustees said LIVES staff had told them Dr Sagar \"interrupted proceedings\", they thought he was critical of the charity, and said his \u201cactions were inappropriate\".\nThey said the \"chief executive and other members of the LIVES staff felt it prudent to steer him away from the stage\".\nTwo other people, who attended the event, told the BBC the chief executive had taken Dr Sagar to one side afterwards and \"gave him a dressing down\".\nLIVES has seen a fall in its number of volunteer responders, from 762 in 2018 to 241 in 2023. LIVES previously told the BBC this was down to a migration of the volunteers' database which removed \"outdated information\".\nAmong the volunteers who have left is Pete Lovett, who volunteered as a first responder for five years in Essex before joining LIVES in 2020. \nHe said there were many reasons why he had stopped in 2022 and other volunteers \"were just rolling out of the door\".\nMr Lovett said LIVES had blocked his request to give a free talk on bystander CPR and defibrillators at his local social club.\nHe said: \"I contacted LIVES and they said 'no you can\u2019t do that, we have a team that go out and do the training, or the awareness courses, and they charge a fee'.\n\"I was offering to do it free of charge and I was so appalled I resigned, but then the next day I got a phone call from one of the trustees saying 'we will allow you to do it, please come back'.\"\nLIVES said it \"delivers bystander CPR and defibrillator training\" in Lincolnshire at \"no cost\", by \"volunteers who are trained to do so\".\nIt said its records show the club had previously purchased a certificated training course from LIVES and the charity understood it was looking to renew it, which required certified training and a charge.\nMr Lovett said he had felt less supported than during his time volunteering for East of England Ambulance Service and after he had attended a call-out to a suicide, there was no contact from LIVES to check on his own mental health and wellbeing.\nLIVES said it had \"no record of this\". It said it had \"recently\" implemented a system in which \"certain jobs trigger a welfare response\", or responders could request welfare support themselves. It said its Employee Assistance Programme was available to all staff and volunteers.\nMr Lovett said, for him, \"the final straw\" had been the introduction of a contract for community first responders, which required volunteers to attend a minimum of two fundraising events a year.\n\"I know a lot of people weren\u2019t keen on that. Like me, they signed up to be a responder, not a fundraiser,\" he said.\nLIVES said without fundraising, it \"can\u2019t recruit and train responders\". It said many charities expect their volunteers to take part in fundraising and it had \"no evidence of a large number of volunteers leaving due to this\".\nSince January, an online petition calling for the charity's CEO to res",

Having just shaken Elijah? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\nMs Marshall added: \u201cOn the defendant\u2019s own account in interview, whilst Elijah was in his company alone, he went from being a crying and responsive baby to one that was barely breathing by the time India came home and saw Elijah.\u201d\nThe court was told the injury that led to the death of Elijah - known as Eli - would have happened immediately prior to his collapse.\nThe jury was told Mr Alesbrook, now 19, had previously shaken Elijah.\nOne shaking was likely to have taken place on 1 January, and caused limb and rib fractures, the court heard.\nThe court was also told Ms Shemwell, who was 21 when Elijah died, wanted to call 111 on 1 January because she was concerned about her baby's breathing and how he seemed pale.\nBut Mr Alesbrook stopped her, and told her Elijah \"would be fine\". \nThe prosecution told the court \"the defendant lost his patience with Elijah for the last time\" on 2 January.\nMs Marshall said: \"No doubt [he was] irritable with pain from his toothache, at the end of his tether with a baby who was likely repeatedly crying, no doubt because of the pain from those broken bones that this defendant caused the night before and maybe he was frustrated because he was... distrusting of where his \u2018shared\u2019 girlfriend had gone to at this time of night.\"\nMr Alesbrook, who the court heard would take cannabis around Elijah, is also accused of inflicting grievous bodily harm and causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\nHe denies all charges.\nThe trial continues. \nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Government officials weighed up sacking Paula Vennells as the Post Office's chief executive in 2014 some five years before she resigned, an inquiry has heard.   \nAccording to internal government documents revealed at the long-running inquiry into the Horizon scandal, they had concerns about whether she was the right person to lead the group. \nOne issue was the perception that she was \"unable to work with personalities that provide robust challenge to her\".   \nAlice Perkins, who chaired the Post Office at the time and faced a second day of questioning by lawyers on Thursday,  denied that Ms Vennells had surrounded herself with \"yes-men and yes-women\".\nBut she admitted that she herself started to have doubts in 2014 about Ms Vennells' ability to lead the Post Office, which is owned by the government.\nMs Vennells continued as chief executive until 2019 during which time she received bonuses. She was subsequently awarded a CBE \"for services to the Post Office and to charity\". \nShe handed the CBE back earlier this year before being formally stripped of the honour.\nThe officials wrote in February 2014 that \"advice from the recent annual review suggested that the [Post Office] team give careful consideration to the continued suitability of Paula Vennells as chief executive\".\n\"There is a general consensus that Paula is no longer the right person to lead [the Post Office], but justification is anecdotal,\" they wrote.\nThe documents revealed that officials had a number of concerns about Ms Vennells, including that she had not managed to grow Post Office revenue in line with a 2010 plan.\nMs Perkins said it was not her view that Ms Vennells was averse to being challenged, but added that there had been \u201csome tension\u201d between Ms Vennells and Susan Barton, who was the Post Office's strategy director at the time.\nLead counsel for the inquiry, Jason Beer KC, asked whether Ms Vennells \u201cpreferred to have yes-men and yes-women around her, surrounding herself with a coterie of trusted lieutenants: [such as executives] Mark Davies, Angela van den Bogerd, [and] Lesley Sewell?\u201d\nMs Perkins replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be a fair characterisation.\"\nCommenting on the internal government documents discussing Ms Vennells' future, Ms Perkins told the inquiry that they were \"complete news\" to her.\nBut she said: \u201cIn this period in 2014, I did start, and I wasn\u2019t alone in this, to have reservations about Paula\u2019s ability to lead the Post Office in the circumstances which it found itself in.\u201d\nThis included Ms Vennells\u2019 grip on issues including the Horizon IT system.\nFrom 1999 to 2015 hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted for offences such as fraud and false accounting on the strength of faulty Horizon data.\nMs Perkins said she had concerns a decade ago that Ms Vennells was \u201crelying too much\u201d on her executive colleagues for both IT and legal knowledge and there was \u201ctoo much passing on of other people\u2019s views\u201d when she talked to the board.\n\u201cWhat she was relying on were words that other people had written for her, rather than her own words,\u201d Ms Perkins said.\nThe Post Office operates as a private company, but is wholly owned by the government.",

    "The Duke of Sussex will be able to appeal against a High Court ruling which dismissed his challenge over a decision to downgrade his level of personal security when he visits the UK.\nPrince Harry first took legal action against the Home Office in 2020 over a decision that he should receive a different degree of taxpayer-funded protection after he and wife Meghan stepped back from life as working royals.\nIn February, the High Court ruled that decision was lawful and dismissed Harry's case, before in April refusing him permission to challenge that ruling in a higher court. \nBut the Court of Appeal has now said it will hear his challenge following a direct application from Harry's lawyers.\nThe decision to downgrade his security in February 2020 was taken by the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (Ravec) \u2013 which has delegated responsibility from the Home Office over the provision of security arrangements for members of the Royal Family.\nIn a judgment this February, retired High Court judge Sir Peter Lane rejected the duke's case and concluded Ravec's approach was not irrational nor procedurally unfair.\nIn his 52-page ruling, he noted that Ravec's decision was \u201clegally sound\u201d.\nAfter the ruling, a legal spokesman for the prince said he intended to appeal, adding: \u201cThe duke is not asking for preferential treatment, but for a fair and lawful application of Ravec\u2019s own rules, ensuring that he receives the same consideration as others in accordance with Ravec\u2019s own written policy.\u201d\nPrince Harry now has the green light to challenge Sir Peter's dismissal at the Court of Appeal, according to an order by Lord Justice Bean dated May 23.\nLike other senior royals, Prince Harry and Meghan had received publicly-funded security protection before they stepped back from royal duties and moved to the US state of California.\nHis case against the government is one of a series of legal challenges the prince has brought to the court, including high-profile lawsuits against parts of the British press.",

    "A US federal judge has ordered Donald Trump's former strategist Steve Bannon to report to prison by 1 July to serve a four-month sentence. \nThe order on Thursday comes after years of legal wrangling, with an appeals court last month upholding Bannon's 2022 criminal conviction for contempt of Congress. \nThe right-wing podcaster was found to have illegally refused to testify before the committee investigating the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot.\nBannon, 70, has denied any criminal wrongdoing and his lawyer called the ruling a \"horrible decision\".\nAfter Thursday's decision, Bannon said he and his lawyers would \"go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to\".\n\"There's not a prison built or a jail built that will ever shut me up,\" he defiantly told reporters outside the courthouse in Washington DC. \nHe called the legal challenges against him a plan for \"shutting down the Maga movement\" - a reference to former President Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan.\nBannon has said he was following legal advice in refusing to testify before the House committee investigating 6 January, when rioters ransacked the US Capitol with the goal of stopping the certification of Joe Biden's election win. \nBannon's lawyer David Schoen, who has called the case against his client politically motivated, also vowed to appeal to a higher court.\nMr Schoen said his client would have been violating Trump's invocation of executive privilege - a legal concept that allows presidents to keep some communications private - had he testified before Congress.\nBut a three-member panel from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected that argument when it upheld his conviction in May, saying his claim \"runs headlong into settled law\".\n\"This exact 'advice of counsel' defense is no defense at all,\" Justice Bradley Garcia wrote in that decision. \nA full appeals court could delay Thursday's sentencing order if it took up the case and issued its own ruling stopping its enforcement. \nBannon was a key player in Trump's 2016 rise to the Oval Office and later became chief strategist at the White House.\nHe left the administration after a violent far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, but remains a top ally of the former president. \nAnother senior Trump aide, Peter Navarro, reported to prison in March after his own contempt of Congress conviction.",
    "Scientists have traced a gene which can increase the risk of certain types of cancer back to a family living in 18th century Shetland.\nGeneticists believe the gene was introduced by a family living on the island of Whalsay before 1750.\nThe island is situated to the east of the Shetland mainland, and is home to around 1,000 people.\nTesting can be requested by people with at least one Whalsay grandparent and who have been affected by breast, ovarian or prostate cancer, or seen a close relative affected.\nChristine Glaser from Lerwick is one of those who has been affected by the gene.\nLast July she learned she was carrying a BRCA 2 gene variant that increased her risk of breast and ovarian cancer. \nThe news came as a shock, in part because the result came from a test Christine, 66,  had taken almost a decade earlier.\nShe had been a participant in Viking Genes, a research project that looked at the genetic make up of people from the Orkney and Shetland Islands.\nSince those tests were taken, the understanding of the significance of certain genes has improved and last year geneticists sought special permissions to go back to those who took part in the study to ask if they wanted to know their results. \nChristine was one of them. \nAlthough she had lost a sister to ovarian cancer, the family was unaware many of them carried a BRCA 2 gene variant that increased the risk of the disease, as well as breast and prostate cancer.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think,\" said Christine. \"I got offered preventative measures so I could get my ovaries removed and I could get a mastectomy.  So that\u2019s what I did. \n\"When I got my ovaries removed, they checked them and there was no cancer but then I had a mammogram and they found cancer.\u201d\nChristine\u2019s cancer was caught early and successfully treated.\nMeanwhile researchers had begun to establish a pattern of where they believed the gene may have originated from.  \nUsing the genetic data gathered in the genes study, and cross-referenced with geneticists believe they have been able to trace the gene back hundreds of years to a family living on the island of Whalsay.\nWhalsay is situated to the east of the Shetland mainland, and is home to around 1,000 people.marriage, birth and death records, \nProf Jim Wilson of the University of Edinburgh led the study.\nHe said: \u201cThis BRCA 2 variant in Whalsay I think arose prior to 1750.  This is why these things become so common in given places because many people descend from a couple quite far back in the past and if they have a cancer variant, then a significant number of people today - five or even 10 - generations later will have it. \n\"This is true everywhere in Scotland, its just magnified in these small places.\u201d\nIt is estimated this particular variant, known as c.517-2A>G,  is present in one in 43 people from Whalsay, a figure that is five-fold higher than in a general sample of Shetlanders where the carrier frequency is one in 234.\nChristine\u2019s paternal grandmother was from Whalsay. Of her five siblings, three have the gene, as does her cousin Ryan Leith, 52, which puts him at increased risk of developing prostate cancer.\n\u201cAt least you can make lifestyle choices to reduce the risk,\" he said. \"You take an annual blood test at the doctor and that shows if there is anything abnormal showing up in the blood work. You can review your options and see if early treatment is available\u201d\nThis is not the first BRCA gene variant the study has found. \nIn March last year, geneticists travelled to the Orkney island of Westray.  \nTheir study suggested one in 100 people with grandparents from Orkney had a specific mutation of the BRCA 1 gene and that most of those with the gene could trace their ancestry back to the island of Westray.  A pilot testing programme was launched, funded by the community.\nWith the Whalsay variant, genetic testing is available to relatives of people with the known BRCA2 variant as standard NHS care.\nTesting can also be requested by people with at least one Whalsay grandparent and who have themselves, or a close relative, been affected by breast, ovarian or prostate cancer.  Prof Wilson hopes testing will one day be offered more widely, as is the case with other groups with known BRCA risks.\nHe said: \u201cThe Ashkenazi Jewish community have BRCA1 and BRCA 2 variants that also have a frequency of about one in 40.

    "Dormice have been released at a secret woodland location in a bid to boost Bedfordshire's only population of the mammals.\nKnown for their big eyes, and for being famously sleepy, the hazel dormouse species has declined nationally by 70% since 2000.\nOnce widespread, the animals have disappeared from 20 English counties in the past century, but the Bedfordshire population, which dates from 2001, is said to be \"thriving\". \nThe latest reintroduction, led by wildlife charity People\u2019s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES), builds on the previous release in the same woodland cared for by Forestry England.\nOngoing efforts to restore their populations have seen more than 1,000 hazel dormice reintroduced into 25 woodland habitats in 13 English counties since 1993.\nThe 10 dormice released earlier this week were provided by the Common Dormouse Captive Breeders Group, which includes Wildwood Trust.\nPrior the their release, they were quarantined for eight weeks and given health checks by vets at Paignton Zoo and the Zoological Society of London's Disease Risk Analysis and Health Surveillance (DRAHS) team.  \nThis was to ensure that only fit and healthy dormice were released into the wild and there was no risk of them transferring diseases or non-native parasites to either the existing dormouse population, or other local wildlife.\nThey were taken to their new woodland home and left to acclimatise to their new surroundings from the safety of their nest boxes, which were placed within larger mesh cages filled with foliage, buds, berries, nuts and water.\nBefore the full release, the dormice were given a final health check.\nIn time they will start to breed and disperse into new woodland and hedge areas, and the mesh cages will be removed.\nIan White, dormouse and training officer at the People\u2019s Trust for Endangered Species, said: \"Our annual reintroductions, alongside habitat management, landscape projects and monitoring, are paramount to the species\u2019 long-term survival. \n\"To date we\u2019ve released 1,112 dormice into 25 different woodlands in 13 counties - including six English counties where they had previously been lost. \n\"It\u2019s extremely encouraging that descendants of Bedfordshire\u2019s original population are still flourishing, and by introducing more dormice this summer we hope that they go from strength-to-strength, which is much-needed good news for a species on the brink.\u201d\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Taylor Swift has come out in support of Lady Gaga, who posted a video denying pregnancy rumours, by calling comments about it \"invasive and irresponsible\". \nThe two US superstar singers responded after online speculation that Grammy and Oscar-winning singer Lady Gaga was pregnant. \nPeople began to comment after photographs emerged of the star with boyfriend Michael Polansky as they celebrated her sister Natali Germanotta's wedding in the US. \nGaga posted a video on TikTok, referencing the song Down Bad, from Swift's new album, saying: \"Not pregnant - just down bad cryin at the gym.\"\nSwift posted under the video: \"Can we all agree that it's invasive and irresponsible to comment on a woman's body.\n\"Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation and neither does any woman.\"\n\nGaga also urged followers to register to vote, and smiled as she lipsynched to an audio clip, saying: \"I don't have to find an aesthetic; I am the aesthetic.\n\"I mean, I'm sure there's somebody out here right now who is going into Pinterest trying to type up all these adjectives to describe me.\"\nSwift's comments prompted a flood of responses underneath, such as \"Gaga and Taylor OMG\" and hopeful suggestions that the two might do a musical collaboration.\nThis isn't  the first time there has been online speculation over whether a celebrity is pregnant.\nIn March, High School Musical actress and singer Vanessa Hudgens responded to such comments.\nUS Weekly reported that she told the She Pivots podcast: \u201cI was like: \u2018That is so rude. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t wear Spanx every day, and, like, am a real woman and have a real body\u2019.\u201d \nIn January, Little Mermaid star Halle Bailey defended her decision to keep her pregnancy private, despite people saying online saying she had \"lied\" about it. \n\u201cI never lied or even said anything about it honey, making a joke about my nose was the farthest I went,\" she said. \n\"I\u2019ll never understand why you are mad I protected my own peace, wouldn\u2019t you do the same?\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna share my pics now if I want to because my son is here safely, if u don\u2019t wanna see it just keep scrolling baby lol God bless you.\u201d\n\n\nReality star Kourtney Kardashian hit back in 2020 after an Instagram user suggested she looked pregnant in bikini photos. \nA fan had asked her how she protected her mental health from cyber-bullying, and according to People, she replied: \n\"I commented back and said: \u2018This is the shape of my body. I definitely gained a few pounds over this quarantine time and I love my body and I'm proud of my shape and I'm obviously posting it...\n\"'I don't think I look pregnant at all. We're all shaped differently, and that's my body, and I'm proud of it so that's how I respond to the negative comments'.\"\nActress Jennifer Garner, whose films include The Adam Project and Dallas Buyers Club, also sparked rumours in the same year on Instagram.\nShe had posted an image of her holding a Hallowe'en pumpkin with a carved-out centre, which contained a mini-pumpkin.\nThis prompted some of her followers to ask if she was expecting, and she responded: \"STILL NOT HAVING MORE BABIES. Good grief, I didn\u2019t even see it, I just saw matching smiles.\"\nAnother post of her wearing overalls also resulted in more pregnancy questions, to which she responded: \"I am 48, have three healthy kids and am not - and never will be - pregnant.\"\nIn 2019, model Karlie Kloss also denied being pregnant, after sharing her wedding photos. \nElle magazine's Olivia Blair wrote: \"Stop asking women if they are pregnant. Please.\"\nShe pointed out that it was still happening, despite Friends star Jennifer Aniston writing in a 2016 article: \"For the record, I am not pregnant. \n\"What I am is fed up. I\u2019m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment' and 'celebrity news'.\"\nThree years later model Chrissie Tiegen also hit back at speculation she was pregnant, saying: \"I know you didn\u2019t mean it to be rude, but think twice about asking this. \n\"There are people who have trouble conceiving and it hurts every time. I\u2019m not pregnant but would be happy if I were. But I\u2019m also happy not to be! \u201d\n",
    "The upcoming general election is taking place at peak holiday travel time for Northern Ireland voters.\nPolling date is 4 July, making it the first election during the NI school holidays in almost 80 years.\nAlmost 300,000 passengers are expected to travel in and out of NI that week.\nUnlike England and Wales, school holidays begin in Northern Ireland and Scotland at the end of June, meaning more people are likely to be away on polling day. \nIn the UK there are 650 electoral areas - constituencies - in which voters choose a single member of Parliament (MP) to represent them at Westminster.\nIn Northern Ireland there are 18 constituencies, each with a seat in the House of Commons up for grabs.\nThe last general election in the summer holidays was on 5 July 1945.\nBelfast\u2019s two airports expect around 270,000 passengers flying to and from the city in the week of the election \u2013 making it one of the busiest travel weeks of the year.\nThere will be 68 flights in and out of the City of Derry Airport that week, while around 20,000 passengers are due to depart Belfast via Stena Line ferries.\nJas Hogg told BBC News NI she probably wouldn't vote if she was heading on holiday.\n\"With it being July and the kids being off school, everyone's wanting to go on holiday straight away,\" she said.\n\"It's not very convenient being on 4 July. It probably could have been timed a bit better.\"\nJas said she hasn't seen \"a lot of information\" about how to vote when on holiday.\n\"I probably wouldn't vote if I wasn't here because I haven't seen enough information about it.\n\"That's probably the last thing you're thinking about. That's why you're going away from here, to get away from it all, realistically.\"\nPatricia Brown said the summer date shouldn't matter.\n\"No it won't make a difference. If I was on holiday I'd just get a postal vote.\n\"I think that if you're interested in politics and want to vote you'll just do it.\"\nChantel Berger, from Texas, said she would \"absolutely not\" see a 4 July election in the USA.\n\"For me it's quite bizarre. In the US it's a national holiday and a big celebration,\" she said. \"It seems pretty odd to have it on 4 July.\n\"If it's in the school holidays, maybe it gets the kids involved in voting? And understanding the importance of voting.\"\nBut she added that she will be spending 4 July celebrating with family and enjoying a barbecue by the swimming pool.\nBelfast International Airport told BBC News NI it is expecting more than 200,000 passengers in the first week of July, including people arriving and departing.\nBelfast City Airport has said it expects \"up to 10,000 passengers a day\" at peak holiday times.\nCity of Derry Airport said \"34 inbound services and 34 outbound services\" would operate to European and UK destinations in election week.\nAnd a spokesperson for ferry company Stena Line said: \u201cThe first week of July is traditionally one of our busiest travel weeks, with somewhere in the region of 20,000 passengers departing Belfast on our Belfast-Cairnryan and Belfast-Liverpool routes each year.\u201d\nNot all of those passengers will be holidaymakers, however; for business travellers election week will just be business as usual.\nYou can apply for what is known as an absent vote. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nThere are two types of absent vote - a postal vote and a proxy vote.\nPolling stations are open between 07:00 and 22:00 on polling day.\nIf you will not be able to turn up in person during those times - and you have already registered for the general election - you can apply for a postal vote.\nIt does not matter whether you will be on holiday, working or simply find mailing your vote more convenient.\nYou will need to prove your identity when applying.\nA ballot is posted to you in advance of the election, to be completed and posted back to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland.\nThe deadline to apply for a postal vote in Northern Ireland is 17:00 on Friday 14 June 2024.\nA proxy vote means appointing someone you trust to attend the allocated polling station to vote on your behalf.\nThe rules for voting by proxy have changed. If you applied for a proxy vote before 31 October 2023, this has expired and you need to apply again.\nThe deadline to apply for a proxy vote in Northern Ireland is 17:00 on Friday 14 June 2024.\nYou can apply for a permanent or a temporary absent vote for postal and proxy votes, but an explanation must be given.\nA temporary absent vote can be applied for if, for example, you are going on holiday or are sick.",

    "\nMoscow says it has detained a French citizen accused of gathering information about Russia's military activities and failing to register as a \"foreign agent\".\n\"Such information, if obtained by foreign sources, may be used against the security of the state,\" said Russia's Investigative Committee (SK).\nIt also posted footage purportedly showing the arrest of the unnamed male suspect in a Moscow cafe. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said the man was not working for France. \nA Switzerland-based NGO later said its adviser Laurent Vinatier was held in the Russian capital.\n\"We are aware that Laurent Vinatier, an adviser at the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), has been detained in Russia,\" a spokesman for the non-government organisation told the AFP news agency. \n\"We are working to get more details of the circumstances and to secure Laurent's release,\" he added.\nThe NGO states its main activity is \"to prevent and resolve armed conflicts around the world through mediation and discreet diplomacy\".\nLater on Thursday, President Macron said the detained man was  \"in no way someone who was working for France\".\nRelations between Paris and Moscow are strained over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the SK said a criminal case had been opened, and the suspect would be charged in the \"nearest future\". \nThe Frenchman, it said, had repeatedly visited Russia for several years, holding meetings with Russian nationals.\nThe 19-second video released by the SK shows a man, whose face is blurred, being detained by Russian law enforcement officers, before being led away to an SK van.\nThe Frenchman is also accused of failing to submit documents needed for \"inclusion in the register of foreign agents\".\nRussia requires anyone who gets foreign support or is under influence from abroad to declare themselves such an agent. It has used the 2012 law to squash any opposition inside the country to President Vladimir Putin, and also as a pretext to detain people, including foreigners.\nLast year, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was arrested on a similar charge.\nThe charge carries a jail term of up to five years.",
    "As Europeans head to the polls in four days of voting across 27 countries to elect a new European Parliament, millions of young people will be casting their ballot for the first time.\nIn some countries, the voting age has been lowered to 16 \u2013 so minors in Belgium, Germany, Austria, Greece and Malta will be able to cast their vote in these elections.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big opportunity for us, because it gives us a voice we never had before,\u201d says Mare Verlinde, a 17-year-old student from Belgium.\n\u201cI think Europe needs to step up and be stronger \u2013 we can\u2019t always rely on Nato,\u201d her friend Auguste Duchene says, earnestly.\nFor this group of friends \u2013 and for many of their peers \u2013 these European elections are hugely significant when it comes to security. They grew up being told Europe was safe \u2013 but in the last two years, that conviction has disappeared.\n17-year-old Lore Sleeckx is worried about war in Europe.\n\u201cMy history teachers are saying they wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a world war happened in the future,\u201d she says \u2013 and all her friends nod in agreement. \u201cThat really scares me.\u201d\nIn the 2019 European elections, young people turned out in record numbers - their votes going overwhelmingly to green parties that championed strong climate policies. At the time, it was heralded as a \u201cGreen wave.\u201d\nBut five years is a long time in politics.\nIf the polls are right, an unprecedented number of young voters are considering casting their votes for parties on the right and far right, many of which are broadly Eurosceptic.\n\u201cWe want to do away with the status quo, and that\u2019s why many of my friends are voting for the right,\u201d Bence Szab\u00f3 tells me, while attending an anti-EU farmers protest in Brussels.

But this is a generation that grew up during the Covid pandemic, and now feels worried on multiple fronts: war in Europe, climate change, an uncertain job market and a lack of affordable housing.\n\u201cWe are not extremists. We are just angry,\u201d explains Lazar Potrebic, a 25-year-old from a Hungarian minority in Serbia who is entitled to vote.\nHe - and many of his peers - are worried about the future, and feel that the more traditional parties are not listening to their concerns.\n\u201cWe feel like our needs are not being met.

We're getting our first jobs, thinking about starting a family\u2026but if you look around Europe, rent prices are going through the roof - and it\u2019s hard to get work.\u201d\nOf course the feeling of not being listened to when you\u2019re young, of not being part of the equation, is nothing new. But many of the parties on the far right are actively courting the young vote, says Dave Sinardet, a professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels.\n\u201cThe radical right channels anti-establishment feelings,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThey have a bit of a rebellious vibe - especially when it comes to their anti-woke agenda - and that appeals to young people.\u201d\nFor the leader of Spain\u2019s Vox party, Santiago Abascal, the hot-button issues are transgender rights and abortion.\nMigration is another question driving young voters to the right.

He will be voting for Giorgia Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy - arguably the far right\u2019s biggest success story in Europe.\nHe thinks the EU should have a migration policy more similar to that of Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, which have all challenged the EU\u2019s new migration pact which gives dissenting countries the right to pay rather than receive new arrivals.\n\u201cThey were mercilessly criticised when they built fences; but the reality is that what the EU is doing is not working,\" says Giorgio. \"We have no idea who is coming in: people are falling through the cracks, and they could have a criminal record - meaning that Europe is less secure.\u201d\nFar-right politicians are also doing a better job at grabbing the youth\u2019s attention online: their social media strategy is unmatched.\nThe perfect example is French politician Jordan Bardella - the charismatic 28-year-old leader of the National Rally who heads its list for the European elections.

    "An abandoned Myanmar military camp sits atop a wooded hill, overlooking a picturesque lake which is well known in these parts because of its unique heart-like shape. \nLandmine canisters and spent bullets litter the ground. Yellow wildflowers have sprouted through piles of corrugated tin sheets strewn about where soldiers\u2019 barracks used to be. Hastily dug trenches line one part of the camp.\nWarning: You may find some of the details in this piece disturbing\nUnder the overcast sky, a flag flutters in the wind - red, white and blue horizontal stripes with the picture of a hornbill at the centre \u2013 the flag of the Chin National Army (CNA), an ethnic armed group fighting against Myanmar\u2019s military junta in the western Chin state.\nSeven months ago the CNA, along with local armed civilian groups, pushed Myanmar\u2019s army out of this camp at Rihkhawdar \u2013 a border trade town with India \u2013 and from other areas in the Chin state. It\u2019s an unprecedented advance for Chin insurgents fighting against Myanmar\u2019s military dictatorship which crushed the country\u2019s fragile democracy in a coup in 2021.\nIt is the first time that the military has lost control of these areas, and the BBC has had rare access to see these rebel advances in the west of the country.\nThe win at Rihkhawdar was not straightforward. It came after multiple offensives were launched for more than a year. And for some families it came at an excruciating cost.\nSeventeen-year-old Lalnunpuii loved dancing. Her social media feed was full of her imitating trending viral videos.\n\u201cShe used to sassily dance around all the time. But she was not into dressing up. She used to idolise soldiers and would listen to songs all day that talked about soldiers who dedicated their lives for the country. She was brave and strong, and not scared of anything,\u201d says Lalthantluangi, Lalnunpuii\u2019s mother.\nAfter the coup, the teenager convinced her parents to allow her to join the armed civilian movement in their village Haimual.

Most of the bombs were made by me as I was the main welder for my unit,\u201d says Lalzidinga, Lalnunpuii\u2019s father. A truck driver before the coup, he became one of the organisers of the People\u2019s Defence Forces in Haimual.\nThey were unsuccessful in taking the camp during this attempt, but there were casualties on both sides.\n\nOn 14 August 2022, in an apparent retaliation for the attack, the Myanmar army stormed into Haimual village. Residents tell us they torched nearly a dozen homes. We saw the remains of many such houses. There are accusations against the Myanmar army of burning tens of thousands of civilian homes in the north and west of the country, in a bid to suppress the resistance.\nIn Haimual, Lalnunpuii and her fifteen-year-old brother Lalruatmawia were among 17 people taken hostage by the army. All except the siblings were released. Their family believes the army was taking revenge against their father.\nTwo days later, their bodies were found by villagers in a shallow grave in a forest outside Haimual.\nBoth had been brutally tortured and bludgeoned to death with the butt of a gun. Lalnunpuii had been raped. Her brother\u2019s chest, arms and genitals bore burn marks from boiling water. The BBC has seen detailed photographs of the bodies and the post-mortem reports.\nMyanmar\u2019s military is yet to respond to the BBC\u2019s questions about these allegations.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the courage to think of what happened to my children,\u201d says Lalzidinga, pausing for a moment, struggling to find words. \u201cMy children were martyrs.

It\u2019s not just about us. The coming generations too need freedom. Living in such a state where you don\u2019t have any rights, where you\u2019re at the mercy of the military, that is not correct.

I am so proud of my children,\u201d she says.\nThrough our time in Myanmar we meet people dressed in military fatigues, some carrying assault rifles and other guns \u2013 not professional soldiers, but farmers, students, ordinary people displaying remarkable resolve in the face of a savage conflict.\nCommander Vala of the People\u2019s Defence Forces points to the lush green valley below Haimual and tells us with a ",
    "An Israeli air strike on a UN school packed with displaced Palestinians in central Gaza has reportedly killed at least 35 people.\nLocal journalists told the BBC that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp. Videos showed the destruction and a number of bodies.\nIsrael\u2019s military said it had \u201cconducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound\u201d in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside.\nGaza\u2019s Hamas-run Government Media Office denied the claim and accused Israel of carrying out a \u201chorrific massacre\u201d.\nThe US has called on Israel to be \"fully transparent\" in making information about the strike public.\nThe head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), which runs the school, described the incident as \"horrific\" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was \"shocking\" but could not be confirmed.\nDead and wounded people were rushed to the al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Hospital, in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which has been overwhelmed since the Israeli military began a new ground operation against Hamas in central Gaza this week.\nThe BBC is working to verify the reports about the strike in Nuseirat camp.\nLocal journalists and residents said it took place in the early hours of Thursday at al-Sardi school, which is in a south-eastern area of the densely-populated, decades-old camp, where Unrwa provides services.\nUnrwa said 6,000 displaced people were sheltering in the school complex at the time. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months.\nVideos shared on social media showed the destruction of several classrooms in one of the school's buildings, as well as bodies wrapped in white shrouds and blankets.\n\u201cI was asleep when the incident occurred. Suddenly, we heard a loud explosion and shattered glass and debris from the building fell on us,\u201d Udai Abu Elias, a man who was living at the school, told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme.\n\u201cSmoke filled the air, and I couldn't see anything. I didn't expect to make it out alive. I heard someone calling for survivors to come out from under the rubble. I struggled to see as I stumbled over the bodies of the martyrs.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe situation has become extremely difficult, especially for children and the elderly. Everyone is a target. The blood of the martyrs has not yet dried; it stains the stairs, walls, and bedding.\"\nAnother man, Jabr, said he \u201cwoke up to the sight of bodies and [human] remains everywhere\u201d, while a third who asked not to be named said the casualties included \"elderly people, young individuals, and children\".\nResidents initially said that more than 20 people were killed in the attack.\nLater, an official at al-Aqsa hospital told a freelance journalist working for the BBC that it had received 40 bodies from the school.\nGaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said 40 people were killed, including 14 children and nine women, and 74 others were injured. The same death toll was given by the director of the Hamas-run Government Media Office, Ismail al-Thawabta.\nUnwa's commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that at least 35 people were killed and many more injured. The agency\u2019s director of communications, Juliette Touma, told the BBC that \"the figures are coming from our own Unrwa colleagues on the ground\".\nThe BBC has been reviewing videos and has not yet seen conclusive evidence of civilian casualties at the scene of the strike. However, there is footage showing child casualties at al-Aqsa hospital.\nUS State Department spokesperson Matt Miller urged Israel to be transparent over the strike. \n\"\"The government of Israel has said that they are going to release more information about this strike, including the names of those who died in it. We expect them to be fully transparent in making that information public,\" he said. \nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said jets had conducted a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside\" the school. An annotated aerial photograph highlighted classrooms on two upper floors of the building, which the IDF said were the \u201clocations of the terrorists\u201d.\nThe IDF said members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who took part in the 7 October attack on southern Israel, when around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage, had been operating in the building.\n\u201cBefore the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\u201d it added.\nLater, IDF spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner told reporters that between 20 and 30 fighters had been using the school to plan and carry out attacks, and that many of them were killed in the strike. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd b",
    "Dutch voters have begun four days of voting across the European Union, with exit polls suggesting a tight race between a left-green alliance and the party of anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.\nRight-wing and far-right parties are widely expected to make big gains in many of the EU's 27 member states, and that appears to have been borne out in the Netherlands, to an extent.\nAlthough the Green-Labour alliance is set to take more seats in the European Parliament according to the exit poll, Mr Wilders' Freedom Party is on course for big gains. \nBut he has not repeated the runaway victory of last November's general election.\nUnder European law final results are not released until every country has voted, late on Sunday evening. Some 373 million Europeans are eligible to vote in the world's second biggest democratic election after India.\nThe next European Parliament will have 720 seats, with each country having seats proportionate to their population. Germany will have 96, France 81 and Italy 76, while the Netherlands has 31.\nThe Dutch exit poll will be closely watched across Europe for potential trends that will emerge elsewhere on the continent, even though many voters tend to vote on national issues at least as much as on European policy. \nIreland and the Czech Republic vote on Friday, and the rest of the EU votes over the weekend. \nA shift to the right has been widely expected in this election, with far-right parties eyeing victory in France, Belgium, Austria and Italy. \nTheir opponents are likely to take some satisfaction from Thursday night's exit poll, because of the Green/Labour alliance's performance. Geert Wilders' party came first in Dutch national elections last November, and has secured a cabinet deal with three other parties, even though he will not be prime minister.\nAny substantial shift to the right in the make-up of the European Parliament could affect EU policies on climate change, agriculture and potentially defence.\nAccording to the Ipsos I&O poll of 20-30,000 Dutch voters at 35 polling stations, the Dutch centre-left alliance under former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans is on course to win eight seats, one more than Mr Wilders' Freedom Party. \nHowever, the margin of error is such that the race is too close to call. Turnout was estimated at almost 47%, a five-point rise on five years ago. Before the vote there had been talk of voter fatigue after months of wrangling over the formation of a new government.\nMr Wilders said he was delighted with the \"nice result\". It was only an exit poll but it was clear that the Freedom Party was the big winner, he said, as his party had only one seat in the outgoing European Parliament. Another far-right party, which has been on the slide for months, is on course to lose all four of its seats.\nThe exit poll is an indication of just how polarised the Dutch vote has become, with a pro-European party in favour of climate change policies in the lead, closely followed by Mr Wilders, who wants less Europe and promises a government with \"the strongest asylum policy ever\u201d. \nHowever, commentators pointed out that an estimated two-thirds of votes had been picked up by pro-EU parties, many of them centrist or liberal.\nMigration and asylum was the most important factor for Dutch voters, according to Ipsos, and that is likely to reflected in much of the rest of Europe. \nVoters the BBC spoke to at a variety of polling stations in The Hague on Thursday talked about security as well as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. Many said a stronger EU was essential in the face of global insecurity.\nWhile a quarter of Dutch voters said they were motivated by European politics, 21% said it was domestic politics, and 48% said it was a combination of the two.",
    "A New York architect who is already charged with four murders has now been charged with two more deaths.\nRex Heuermann, 60, appeared in court accused of killing Jessica Taylor in 2003 and Sandra Costilla in 1993.\nProsecutors cited DNA evidence and a \u201cblueprint\u201d of the suspected serial killer's alleged crimes found on a computer.\nSince 2010, police have been investigating a string of at least 10 deaths on Gilgo Beach, Long Island.\nOn Thursday, Mr Heuermann pleaded not guilty to the latest charges. \nSuffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney told a news conference that officials had found a document they believe the suspect used to \"methodically\" plan the crimes in \"excruciating detail\".\nWarning: Some readers may find details in this report upsetting\nIt included columns labelled \"problems\" and \"supplies\". Under the \"problems\" column, \"DNA\", \"tire marks\" and \"blood stains\" were among items listed. \nTerms like \"booties\" and \"police scanner\" were under the \"supplies\" column, according to court documents. \nPolice believe two other columns in the file labelled \"DS\" and \"TRG\" stood for \"dump site\" and \"targets\". \nMr Tierney said investigators had discovered the Microsoft Word document, which was created in 2000, on a laptop.\nIt broke down sections into \u201cpre-prep\u201d, \u201cprep\u201d and \u201cpost-event\u201d, which prosecutors believe to be a guide to planning the murders.\n\u201cPost-event\u201d included a checklist with items like \u201cchange tires\u201d, \u201cburn gloves\u201d and \u201chave story set\u201d.\nA section labelled \u201cRECON\u201d detailed steps to package a body for transport and listed items to dispose of after a murder.\nOne list labelled \u201cbody prep\u201d noted to \u201cremove head and hands\u201d.\nPolice discovered Ms Taylor in 2003 decapitated and with her hands and arms severed below the elbows. A tattoo on her body had been obliterated by a sharp object. \nThe body of Ms Costilla was found on 20 November 1993 by two hunters in a wooded area of Southampton, New York, the prosecutor said.\nShe had 25 \u201csharp-force\u201d injuries, which were believed to have been inflicted \u201cpost-mortem\u201d, including to her face, torso, breast and genitals, he added.\nAccording to court documents, Mr Heuermann appeared to make to-do lists for himself. \nLists of reminders on his planning file included \"get sleep before hunt\u201d and instructions on how to attack victims quickly and quietly.\nAnother reminder instructed Mr Heuermann to \u201cuse push pins to hang drop clothes from ceiling \u2013 not tape\u201d.\nThe document highlighted lessons from past murders and the best killing methods that Mr Heuermann had researched.\nHe has been held without bail since he was arrested last July outside his Manhattan architecture office.\nHe was initially charged with the murders of three women: Melissa Barthelemy, 24, Megan Waterman, 22, and Amber Costello, 27. \nInvestigators filed new charges against him in January for the murder of a fourth woman: Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25. \nThe remains of the four, believed to be sex workers, were discovered near Gilgo Beach in 2010. \nInvestigators seized hundreds of electronic devices from Mr Heuermann's home that they believe he used to communicate with the women. \nThese included computers, laptops, cameras, hard drives, mobile phones and GPS devices.  \nAn analysis of those devices found Mr Heuermann had a large collection of violent, bondage and torture pornography and \"that material was very similar to the condition that the two latest victims were left in\", said Mr Tierney.\nInvestigators also found nearly 300 guns in his home. \nOfficials said recent DNA tests on male hairs that were found under the body of Ms Taylor and on Ms Costilla's shirt indicate they came from Mr Heuermann.\nInvestigators believe Mr Heuermann's wife and children were out of the state during five of the murders, according to the most recent indictment.\nThis left the suspect with \"unfettered\" time to plot his alleged crimes from the family home in the Massapequa Park neighbourhood of Long Island.\nInvestigators initially accused a carpenter from Manorville, New York, of Ms Costilla's death, but have since cleared him.\nThat suspect, however, was convicted of killing two other women.",
    "The US has reversed its ban on products sold by Juul, one of the country's top e-cigarette companies. \nThe ban was put in place in 2022 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the country saw a rapid rise in vaping use by teenagers. \nThe FDA said the change didn't amount to authorising the products for sale and that a full review of Juul's products is pending. \nThe firm's products have remained on shelves while it appealed the FDA's initial decision and they will continue to be available. \nIn a statement on Thursday, the company said it appreciated the FDA decision and will work with the agency to pursue a marketing authorisation for its products. \nAll e-cigarette products are required to have FDA authorisation to be legally marketed. \nOn Thursday, the FDA said the action is \" being taken, in part, as a result of the new case law, as well as the FDA\u2019s review of information provided by the applicant\".\nJuul, which was founded in California in 2015 by a pair of smokers, has marketed itself as a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes. \nBut the products, which contain high concentrations of nicotine, drew criticism as use among teenagers exploded over the last few years. \nCritics blamed the rise on the colourful packaging, a variety of flavours and the use of young models in marketing campaigns.\nLast year, about one in every 10 high school students reported that they'd used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days. \nThat number was one in every 22 middle school students, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn 2022 - when the FDA banned the products - the agency said the company's applications didn't include \"sufficient evidence\" to show the marketing of the products met public health standards required by law.  \nIt specifically noted potentially harmful chemicals leaching from e-liquid pods. \nThat same year, the company settled more than 5,000 US vaping lawsuits after it was accused of targeting teenagers and separately, agreed to pay hundreds of millions to end a review of its advertising practices.

He was also told to pay legal costs of \u00a3650 plus a victim surcharge of \u00a3114.\nMr Keane was headbutted through some doors as he and fellow pundit Micah Richards were making their way to broadcast their full-time match analysis.\nLaw, whose seat was beneath the Sky Sports studio, claimed there had been \u201cbanter\u201d between him and Mr Keane throughout the game.\nHe said it had \u201cturned more aggressive\u201d and when he went to use the toilet he was approached by Mr Keane.\nDefence barrister Charles Sherrard KC alleged that \u201cthe red mist descended\u201d on the former footballer after a VAR decision went against Manchester United towards the end of the match and he was taunted by home supporters.\nHe claimed Mr Keane swore at Law and said \"say it to my face\".\nMr Keane replied to the barrister: \u201cI said that when I was at work?

    "Colombia's government and a group of left-wing rebels have said they will begin formal peace talks later this month. \nThe group, which calls itself Second Marquetalia, split off from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) after the latter signed a peace deal in 2016.\nThe talks are part of President Gustavo Petro's plan to bring \"total peace\" to Colombia.\nWhile negotiations with other rebel groups have proved rocky, President Petro has insisted that they are the only way to ensure peace in the conflict-wracked Andean country. \nThe Second Marquetalia is one of the main dissident groups to emerge after most of the Farc rebels had laid down their arms in 2016.\nThought to be made up of around 1,000 fighters, the group engages in cocaine smuggling and kidnapping for ransom, and is known for attacking Colombia's security forces. \nLast month, the Colombian military dismantled a clandestine \"factory\" where it said members of the Second Marquetalia loaded drones with explosives they planned to detonate above police stations and military bases. \nWhile it is most active on Colombia's border with Venezuela, it also has units operating in other parts of the country. \nIts leader, whose nom de guerre is Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, was one of the main negotiators of the 2016 peace agreement between the Colombian government and the Farc. \nBut, three years after the agreement was signed, he appeared in a video with other former Farc leaders calling on his followers to take up arms again.\nHe accused the Colombian state of \"betraying\" the peace agreement, saying that it was \"indifferent\" to the hundreds of social leaders and former rebels killed in the years after the peace deal was signed. \nThe leadership of the group itself has been decimated since it was founded in 2019.\nIn 2021, Jes\u00fas Santrich, Henry Castellanos Garz\u00f3n - who is better known under his alias of Roma\u00f1a - and Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo Vel\u00e1squez, nicknamed El Paisa, were all killed.\nLast year, rumours circulated that Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez had also been killed.\nBut he reappeared last month in another video released by the rebel group, which the Colombian defence ministry later confirmed was real.\nMr M\u00e1rquez's signature also appears on the document enshrining the agreement between the government and the Second Marquetalia to meet in Venezuela's capital Caracas beginning on 24 June for talks scheduled to begin the following day.\nThe main negotiator for the dissident rebels however is not Mr M\u00e1rquez but a man known as Walter Mendoza, who joined the Farc in the 1970s.\nHe is infamous for creating an elite corp of rebels who specialised in complex operations.\nArmando Novoa will lead the government's side.\nCuba, Norway and Venezuela will act as guarantors.",
    "In a classroom-turned-bedroom at a UN school in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, Palestinian children clamber through rubble and blood-stained mattresses.\nJust hours earlier, at least 35 people were killed and many more wounded at the site in an Israeli military strike early in the morning, according to the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.\n\u201cI saw pieces of iron flying and everything falling down. What happened to us is unimaginable,\u201d said Naim al-Dadah from Gaza City, one of hundreds of displaced people sheltering there.\nIsrael\u2019s military says it carried out a \u201cprecision, intelligence-based strike\u201d to target between 20 to 30 Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters who were using the school as a staging ground to plan and launch attacks.\nHowever, 14 children and nine women were among those killed, the Hamas-run government media office says. Earlier, medics reported similar numbers to a local journalist working with the BBC.\nDuring the war, Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of hiding its operatives in schools, hospitals, and other buildings, using civilians as human shields \u2013 charges the armed group denies.\n\u201cAll of the red lines have been crossed,\u201d said Mr al-Dadah, suggesting that being in a UN institution had given his family no protection. He added: \u201cThe world treats us with double standards. Israel has violated all international laws.\u201d\nIsrael has faced growing diplomatic isolation over its conduct of the war, with cases against it before two international courts, but insists it has acted within the laws of armed conflict as it tries to counter what it sees as an existential threat from Hamas.\nOn a call with journalists, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner said that some of the Palestinian armed fighters based in the Nuseirat school had been involved in the 7 October attacks, which killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and triggered the war in Gaza. No evidence was immediately given.\nCol Lerner suggested that Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives would have \u201cfelt relatively safe\u201d at the building, because it belonged to the UN.\nThe IDF published a photo of the school with classrooms on the first and second floors marked to show the locations it said were targeted by warplanes.\nTo an unusual extent in this case, the Israeli military has stressed that it took steps to reduce the risk of harming civilians. \u201cWe actually called off the strike twice,\u201d Lt Col Lerner said.\nThe overnight attack was the latest case of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find safety as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip.  \nSome of those staying at the UN school said that they came from northern Gaza \u2013 but had heeded Israeli military evacuation orders and headed south in the early stages of the war \u2013 only to be displaced in the past month from Rafah, on the Egyptian border.\nThis week, the IDF announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, targeting what it said were Hamas fighters who had regrouped there. Its forces have repeatedly returned to parts of the Palestinian territory which they previously withdrew from.\nIn a courtyard of the UN school, more than 20 corpses were lined up in body bags and blankets. A journalist working with the BBC filmed several women cradling the heads and hands of their dead sons.\n\u201cIt was a very harsh night,\u201d says Ibrahim Lulu, a teenager who said his cousin, Mohammed was killed. \n\u201cMy brothers, friends and I were sitting together when suddenly there was an explosion. The mattress protected me because I was sitting against the wall.  All the bodies were dismembered and torn.\u201d\nResidents said the part of the school targeted was being used as a shelter for men and boys, with women and girls sleeping in a separate section. Part of the school had previously been targeted by an Israeli strike in mid-May with the IDF then saying it was being used as a \u201cHamas war room\u201d.\nOvernight, casualties were rushed from Nuseirat to the al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah. In recent days it has been struggling to treat hundreds of wounded people following intense Israeli bombardment and shelling in the surrounded area.\nThe hospital had earlier reported an electrical generator failure saying that this would make it harder to treat patients.\nOn Wednesday, Medics from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) which is supporting the hospital described chaotic scenes there. It said that in the previous 24 hours, at least 70 dead people had been brought in, and more than 300 wounded, mostly women and children.",
    "Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross is to stand in the general election.\nMr Ross's surprise announcement came after the party effectively de-selected David Duguid as the Conservative candidate in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East.\nMr Duguid, who is unwell, was the MP for Banff and Buchan since 2017.\nMr Ross was supposed to be standing down from Westminster at this election to concentrate on his job as an MSP ahead of the 2026 Holyrood election campaign.\nHe described Mr Duguid as a \u201cfriend and colleague\u201d and said it was with \"regret\" the party management board decided he could not proceed as the party's candidate. \nMr Ross told a hastily arranged press conference to announce his intention to stand in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East: \u201cThis constituency will be very competitive, a hard fought, close contest between the Scottish Conservatives and the SNP.\n\u201cI have decided I need to lead from the front.\u201d\nHe said he would apply for his party\u2019s nomination on Thursday evening \u2013 a matter of hours before the deadline for potential candidates closes at 16:00 on Friday.\nThe decision to effectively de-select Mr Duguid means he will miss out on a near \u00a315,000 redundancy payment.\nMPs who lose their seat or unsuccessfully stand for another seat are given twice the statutory redundancy entitlement as a loss of office payment. Those who do not contest a seat do not receive the payment.\nMr Duguid would have received \u00a314,700 for his seven years as an MP but will no longer be entitled to it.\nMr Ross distanced himself from the decision not to select Mr Duguid, but said the party had made the decision \u201cto prioritise his recovery\u201d.\nThe Scottish Tory leader had been an MP since unexpectedly defeating SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson in the 2017 general election.\nShortly after becoming Scottish Conservative leader in August 2020, he said he would step down as an MP at the next general election.\nHe has been an MSP for the Highlands and Islands since 2021.\nMr Ross, who is also a football assistant referee, has been branded \"three jobs\" by his opponents. \nHe donates his MSP salary of \u00a372,195 to charity, while the Holyrood register of interests shows he has received more than \u00a36,500 this year from the Scottish Football Association for his role as an assistant referee.\nMr Ross's former Moray constituency has been abolished under boundary changes at this year\u2019s election. He had opposed the \"carve up\" of his seat.\nMr Duguid's former seat, Banff and Buchan, is being expanded to include parts of Moray and renamed Aberdeenshire North and Moray East.\nMr Duguid said on Wednesday he had been \"looking forward\" to campaigning but had not been selected to stand in the new Aberdeenshire North and Moray East constituency.\nHe had recently spent four weeks in the intensive care unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary due to an illness affecting his spine. It is understood he is still in hospital. \nA spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said the decision had been made on health grounds.\nThe old Moray constituency is to be cut in two, with Keith and Buckie swallowed up by Aberdeenshire North and Moray East, while Elgin joins a new Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey seat.\nSo why has Douglas Ross U-turned on his pledge to not run again for Westminster?\nThe Scottish Conservative leader currently has two political jobs, as an MP and an MSP, but has spent some time saying he wouldn\u2019t try to stay an MP at the next election.\nHis current Westminster seat will cease to exist under new boundaries.\nHe\u2019ll argue these are exceptional circumstances, and with David Duguid no longer a candidate, it makes sense for him to step up to be the candidate in a winnable seat for the Scottish Tories in the north east of Scotland.\nHowever, Mr Ross may also be thinking about the long game.\nHe currently leads the largest opposition party at Holyrood but polls are suggesting a Labour revival.\nWhen the Scottish Parliament has elections in 2026, the Conservatives may well slip to third place. That could even lead to a change of leadership.\nMr Ross may well have considered that hanging on in Westminster keeps more political options open to him in the coming years.\nSNP campaign chief Stewart Hosie said the way Mr Duguid had been treated by the Scottish Tories was \"indefensible\".\n\"This is a day of shame for the Tories, with three-jobs Douglas Ross taking a seat from David Duguid to keep his third salary at Westminster,\" he said after Mr Ross's statement.\nHe added: \"The nasty party just got nastier.\"\nScottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie accused the Tory leader of a \u201cscreeching u-turn\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cDouglas Ross is treating his constituents with contempt by refusing to give up one of his three jobs and his shoddy treatment of his own colleague shows how morally bankrupt the Tories are.\u201d\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton described Mr Duguid as a \"capable parliamentarian\" who has respect across the aisles.\n\"As for Douglas's decision, that's really a matter f",
    "A newly qualified probation manager has told an inquest he accepts he should have assessed the killer of Zara Aleena as high risk to cause serious harm, instead of medium.\nJordan McSweeney, a sexual predator with 28 previous convictions, murdered the 35-year-old law graduate in Ilford, east London, on 26 June 2022.\nHe had been released from prison on licence nine days before.\nProbation officer Austin Uwaifo told East London Coroner\u2019s Court that McSweeney had \u201cpainted a false narrative\u201d to him about his behaviour in custody.\nThe jury heard Mr Uwaifo had been asked to provide a risk assessment for the housing team on 10 June, and although he had referred to McSweeney as being a high risk in his report, he had gone on to record him as being a medium risk to the public.\nAsked by the coroner to explain this, he said: \u201cIt may have been an oversight. I had not fully reviewed the risk.\u201d\nMr Uwaifo said a high-risk assessment may have resulted in restrictions being placed on McSweeney, including a possible curfew.\nAt an earlier hearing, coroner Nadia Persaud said there had been 15 or 16 intelligence reports about McSweeney between March and October 2021, including a record of him allegedly assaulting others with improvised weapons and taking drugs, while on one occasion he was described as \u201ctoo high to walk.\u201d\nBut Mr Uwaifo told the jury that when he spoke to McSweeney, \u201che told me things were fine\u201d during a video call from prison in February 2022.\nHe said he had not taken McSweeney\u2019s account at face value, and had contacted his prison offender manager for more information, but admitted: \u201cI should have followed that up, which I didn\u2019t.\"\nIn a second video call meeting, on 7 June of that year, McSweeney told him he had abstained from drink and drugs in custody.\nMr Uwaifo said he did not check with the prison whether this was true.\nOn 17 June, McSweeney was released from prison on licence, but did not attend his initial probation appointment.\nThe inquest heard his mother had said he was passed out drunk.\nBut when asked if he had reviewed the risk assessment, Mr Uwaifo replied: \u201cNot at the time, no.\u201d\nOn 20 June, McSweeney failed to attend a second appointment, and his mother said she had not seen him since the day of his release.\nThe coroner suggested to Mr Uwaifo that, given the circumstances, \u201che should have been assessed as high risk of serious harm?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d, replied Mr Uwaifo.\nHe said that if this had happened, McSweeney\u2019s recall to prison would have been initiated that day.\nInstead, he did not speak to a senior manager until two days later, and it was not until 24 June that the paperwork was signed off.\nMcSweeney was still at large on 26 June, when he murdered Zara Aleena.\nThe inquest continues.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

God love you.\"\nMr Biden thanked the forces who \"did their duty\" on D-Day - and asked the audience whether we would do the same in our \"hour of trial\".\nHe ended by saying modern nations must be \"worthy of their sacrifice\" in order to honour those who fought and died.\nHundreds of people attended a service at the American D-Day memorial in Victoria Gardens, on the Isle of Portland, in Dorset.\nJohn Gillespie (centre left), 104, and Simeon Mayou (centre right) were two of the Normandy veterans at the annual service at the National Memorial Arboretum, in Stafford.\n",

    "A former Derbyshire allotment site set up by World War One veterans has had its protected status affirmed by a judge.\nThe site in Starkholmes, near Matlock, was designated an \"asset of community value\" by Derbyshire Dales District Council, a move that puts planning conditions on its sale.\nBrian Newton, the owner of the site, challenged this designation at a tribunal, but it was dismissed.\nThe allotments had previously been cleared and Christmas trees put in its place, but this will remain unless the land is put up for sale or a compulsory purchase order made.\nIn response to the ruling, a Derbyshire Dales District Council spokesperson said: \u201cWe defended the designation of Starkholmes allotments as an asset of community value and our work has been vindicated at tribunal.\n\u201cWe have always recognised the importance of the allotments in the Starkholmes community and we will continue to work with key stakeholders to seek a positive outcome for the community.\u201d\nNow, if the developer decides to sell the land then local community groups will be given priority to buy it, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nThe only other way the land would become allotments again is if there was a compulsory purchase order.\nThe allotments were set up for returning service personnel from World War One, as a method of rest and rehabilitation and were used by people in the village for more than 100 years.\nResponding to the ruling, a legal representative for Mr Newton said he had offered to meet the costs of transferring the allotments to suitable council-owned land available nearby, but that proposal was rejected.\nThey said there would be no future community use of the land which has been used for the past 12 months and the foreseeable future for the farming of Christmas trees.\nThey added a number of local residents had commented favourably to Mr Newton on the much-improved appearance of the land since its use as allotments ceased.\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The role played by Irish Catholics during the D-Day landings in France needs to be remembered, the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland has said.\nArchbishop Eamon Martin spoke to BBC News NI at Cambes-en-Plaine war cemetery, where a number of Royal Ulster Rifles soldiers who served in the Normandy campaign are buried.\nTens of thousands of soldiers from Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State fought alongside each other in the battle against Nazi Germany.\nHowever, Archbishop Martin said it was sad that many Catholic families do not talk about the role of family members who served in the Allied forces. \nHe added \u201ceveryone owes them a great deal of gratitude\u201d.\n\u201cI hope that by being here myself that there are many families who feel that in some way we\u2019re open and recognising the contribution of people from every county on the island.\u201d\nChurch of Ireland Archbishop John McDowell has also travelled at the invitation of the Royal Irish Regiment to be part of the 80th anniversary commemorations of D-Day.\nHe said he wanted to hold up the stories of the soldiers and Army chaplains \u201cso people don\u2019t forget\u201d and they are remembered as individuals.\nDuring World War Two, about 130,000 people from the island of Ireland signed up to fight in the British Army. \nHalf of them were from the Irish Free State, which had declared itself to be neutral.\nIn Northern Ireland, such was the political division between unionists and nationalists, it was made exempt from conscription.\nHowever, this did not stop many nationalists from joining up.\nThe 80th anniversary was marked by events in the UK, Ireland and France on Thursday.\nDr Laura Patrick, a heritage officer for the Royal Irish Regiment, said it was difficult to tell the background of those who took part. \n\"It's not like the census, there's no tick-box to say exactly where they were coming from,\" she explained.\n\"People can be republican, but still want to fight that bigger fight.\n\"It\u2019s one of the unifying stories of our last 100 years because people saw this as a much greater issue than a north/south issue and a political issue.\n\"It affected everybody across the world and it was about citizenship of the world, not just of a north/south narrative.\"\nShe said for those from a nationalist background \"signing up to the Allied Forces sounds much better\".\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to create those very tight barriers and narratives sometimes.

He was shot dead by a British soldier during the Troubles.\n\"When you talk about our complicated history and what goes on here, think about that,\" she said.\n\"I\u2019m proud of the family I come from.\"\nThe Royal Ulster Rifles Museum in Belfast has the medals of a County Roscommon-born soldier who was recognised for his role during the war by the Irish government.\nCpl Michael O\u2019Beirne, 44, who was a tenor with the Royal Carl Rosa Opera Company, served with 2nd Bn Royal Ulster Rifles and was killed on 9 July 1944. \nHis display contains both his British medals and an Emergency Service medal from Ireland.\nDublin-based historian Diarmaid Ferriter said nationalist soldiers from across the island may have joined for the spirit of adventure, or for economic reasons.\n\"We know that a private in the Irish Army at the start of the Second World War was being paid 14 shillings a week,\" he explained.\n\"If you went into the British Army you were being paid over nine shillings a day.\n\"There was also those in the Irish Army who did not want to spend the war, given that they were soldiers, not being involved in combat.\"\nMany soldiers in the Irish Free State were co-opted into civil projects, he added, such as turf cutting at Phoenix Park in Dublin.\n\u201cMany of them didn\u2019t see that as soldiering.\u201d\nIn February 1939, then Taoiseach (Irish PM) \u00c9amon de Valera, announced the Irish Free State would be neutral if war was to break out.\nIn a speech, he said: \"With our history, with our experience of the last war and with a part of our country still unjustly severed from us we felt that no other decision and no other policy was possible.\"\nA decade ago, some 6,000 soldiers who deserted the Irish A",
    "The number of empty teaching posts in England has more than doubled in the past three years, the latest official figures reveal.\nThe number of teachers has risen - but so has the number leaving. And the number of vacancies per 1,000 teachers has risen from two to six.\nThe government has missed its target for recruiting teacher trainees for nine of the past 10 years.\nAt the start of this school year, the current, Conservative, government raised teachers\u2019 starting salaries to \u00a330,000 to try to encourage new trainees. Labour has promised to recruit 6,500 more teachers if it wins the general election, next month. The Liberal Democrats have also said they would invest in schools and teachers.\nGiving teachers an early finish on a Friday or a day off every other week are among the ideas schools are considering to encourage teachers to stay.\nTyra Packer, 29, a primary-school teacher in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, for seven years, left the profession last summer, to protect her physical and mental health.\nShe had been feeling anxious, at home, often in the middle of the night, and then at school, despite the support of her colleagues.\nAs a classroom teacher but also phonics and PE lead, Miss Packer felt unable to properly fulfil any of her roles - often working well into the evening.\n\u201cYou're tired - you're also mentally drained,\" she says. \"But yet you're coming home and making sure those reports are done, you've sent those emails, you've organised that school trip - always feeling like you\u2019re running on empty.\u201d \nShe started relying on toast and ready meals instead of \u201cmaking a decent dinner\u201d - and it became \u201creally difficult\u201d to find time to look after herself. \nMiss Packer had \u201cmixed emotions\u201d when she quit her job but has since seen marked improvements to her health.\nShe now runs a small baking business, making \"chunky cookies\" and celebration cakes and hosting children's workshops.\n\u201cMy anxiety has probably completely faded since leaving school, something I noticed instantly,\" she says.\n\u201cI definitely sleep like a baby now.\u201d\nThe annual figures, released by the Department for Education on Thursday, cover the academic year 2023-24.\nOn top of rising vacancy rates, they also reveal the proportion of state-school teachers leaving the sector is at its highest since 2010 - 39,971 (8.8%) left in 2022-23, not including those who died or retired.\nIn a report in May, MPs on the Education Select Committee said teacher recruitment and retention had been a \u201cpersistent challenge for over a decade\u201d and \u201cwhile there have been welcome increases in absolute teacher numbers, these have not kept pace with pupil numbers\u201d.\nAt Springwest Academy, in west London, school finishes early on a Friday - to prioritise teacher wellbeing.\nPrincipal and maths teacher Simon Hart, 44, says this is key to providing the best outcomes for his pupils - many of whom are from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nAbout five years ago, the school timetable was rejigged so lessons run from 09:00-16:00 Monday to Thursday, with twice-weekly staff meetings before they begin.\nAnd these longer days allows school to end at 13:40 every Friday.\nStudents and staff \u201clove it\u201d, Mr Hart says.\nAnd he wants schools to \u201ccatch up\u201d with private-sector jobs that have better salaries and more flexible working.\n\"There are teachers at Springwest, making a difference, who could earn triple the salary and work from home,\u201d Mr Hart says.\nHe hopes the next government will help schools make teaching more attractive, supports other schools trialling a nine-day fortnight and wants teachers to be able to enjoy a three-day weekend \u201cby the time I retire\u201d.\nSpringwest is fully staffed - but this year, filling some roles in specialist subjects - such as religious education, history and geography - has been \u201cdifficult\u201d, Mr Hart says.\nEnglish teacher Hafsa Yusuf says early Friday finishes help everyone's mental health.\n\"It leaves students and staff refreshed and ready to come in on that Monday knowing that they've got a little bit of elongated weekend ahead of them,\" she tells BBC News.\nThe school's culture of kindness also protects her mental health.\nShe had found lesson planning \"really daunting\" - but sharing plans, and a rigorous behaviour policy run by senior leaders, have kept down her workload.\nNext year, her second in the profession, Ms Yusuf, 22, will become deputy head of English - and she now plans to stay in education for the \"foreseeable future\".\n\u201cOne of the things that makes me want to stay in the profession is seeing the impact first hand I\u2019m having on the students,\u201d she adds.\nMiss Packer, however, is unconvinced early Friday finishes would be enough to keep people in the profession.\n\u201cThat would definitely help,\" she says.\n\"But it would be naive of senior-leadership teams to think that that is going to completely solve the issue of teacher stress and wellbeing.\u201d\nNational Foundation for Educational Research lead economist Jack Worth said the number of empty teaching posts, and those being filled",

    "Investment firm Baillie Gifford has ended its sponsorship of Stratford Literary Festival after 10 years.\nFestival organisers said they were \"saddened\" the company had decided not to continue sponsoring the event, which took place last month.\nIt comes after similar announcements from a range of other festivals, including Edinburgh Book Festival and the Hay Festival, both of which recently ended their deals with the firm.\nStratford's festival director Annie Ashworth, said they were \"enormously grateful\" for the firm's support, but were \"determined to continue\".\n\"We will survive, we just need to regroup and also start looking for other sponsorships,\" she told the BBC. \nBaillie Gifford, based in Edinburgh, has been a major sponsor of UK arts events but has come under scrutiny over claims by campaign group Fossil Free Books that it has links to fossil fuel firms and Israel.\nThe group has encouraged authors to boycott festivals and to divest the company's sponsorship, with Wigtown Book Festival also confirming the firm had withdrawn from its partnership earlier this week.\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, a spokesperson for Fossil Free Books said following its campaign, Baillie Gifford had \"announced that it is ending sponsorship of all UK book festivals.\"\nA spokesperson for Baillie Gifford said it had nothing to add when contacted by the BBC about withdrawing its Stratford festival sponsorship.\nMs Ashworth said the loss of the firm's sponsorship will \"inevitably impact\" on operations, and it may result in \"increased ticket prices\" and affect its ability to deliver \"important literacy outreach work.\"\n\"We all fear climate change and deplore conflict, but the withdrawal of sponsorship from book festivals is not the solution,\" she said.\n\"However, we completely respect the company\u2019s reasons for withdrawing sponsorship going forward.\"\nThe festival, which takes place in Shakespeare's home town, took place in early May and will next run over the weekend of 25 to 27 October.\nMs Ashworth praised the \"enormous amount of support\" from organisations and companies that sponsor the event, which attracts thousands of people each year.\nShe said the festival was a \"wonderful thing\" for companies to support and an \"amazing, open, democratic platform\".\n\"We are so proud of all we do,\" she added.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",
    "The general election on 4 July will be the first contested under a new electoral map in Scotland and across the UK. Scotland will return two fewer MPs to the House of Commons as a result of the changes.\nWhy is this happening, and how could this new political geography affect the election? \nConstituency boundaries are reviewed across the UK on a fairly regular basis.\nThis is because the population grows at different rates in different parts of the country, and all MPs are meant to represent roughly the same number of constituents - within a 5% margin of 73,393, which is literally just the UK population divided by the number of constituencies.\nThe south east of England is now home to a larger proportion of the UK population, so it needs seven extra MPs.\nWales meanwhile accounts for a notably smaller share of the populace than it did, and is losing eight MPs. Scotland is losing two, going from 59 seats to 57.\nAll of this is based on simple arithmetic, and an independent commission in each part of the UK has drawn up the specific proposals for the new seats - so no, this is not part of some kind of gerrymandering conspiracy.\nThe changes within Scotland are widespread. Only ten constituencies will be unaffected - and for two of them in Orkney and Shetland and the western isles, it's because they are protected by law.\nIn some areas the changes are small; Edinburgh South West is gaining a single building, for the sake of matching up to local authority ward boundaries.\nBut in some places the alterations cover great swathes of land and indeed voters. The Highland seat of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross now covers just shy of 12,000 square kilometers, having swallowed up Dingwall and Ullapool in a bid to reach the quota of voters.\nThe Highlands is also the former home of one of the \"disappearing\" seats - part of big changes made across Inverness, Moray and western Aberdeenshire \nThe other is coming out of Glasgow, with the old Glasgow Central constituency being broken up and parcelled out among the surrounding city seats.\nThe Scottish boundary commissioners ran through a series of consultations to try to carve up the map into suitably-sized chunks, while remaining sensitive to existing communities.\nTo illustrate the kind of issues facing them, the old Falkirk seat had grown far too large, with 86,183 voters. But proposals to chop off neighbouring Denny to bring the numbers down towards the quota target proved unpopular.\nWhat we have ended up with is Grangemouth and Stenhousemuir being shunted off into a strangely-shaped seat with Alloa, across the other side of the River Forth - but without a bridge in between.\nSome of the solutions may seem unusual, but they reflect the highly complicated task which confronted the commissioners.\nHow does this change the context for the 2024 election?\nTalking of complicated...\nBecause the makeup of the electoral map is different, we need to think slightly differently about the coming general election.\nTo start with, the numbers would look weird if we were comparing an election for 57 seats to one with 59. And then there's the \"movement\" of voters - whole communities of them - into different constituencies.\nSo the baseline for this contest in terms of gains and losses is not the 2019 result, but the \"notional\" result using the new boundaries.\nBoffins have used ward-level data to work out how the results would have looked that year, if it had been fought on the current map of 57 seats.\nIn many places this doesn't make a big difference. Bits of SNP-held seats have joined bits of other SNP-held seats, so at the end of the day we still think of them as seats the SNP is defending. But it's not always so simple.\nTake North East Fife, which the Lib Dems narrowly took from the SNP in 2019.\nNew boundaries have added in the village of Kennoway to the south - and the extra wards are enough to tip the overall result for the seat over to the SNP.\nHad these boundaries been used in 2019, the data says the SNP would have won, so for the purposes of this campaign they are treated as the incumbents.\nThis will feel quite strange on election night. If the MP who held the seat when parliament was dissolved - Wendy Chamberlain - returns there, it will go down as a Lib Dem gain. And if the SNP retake the seat, it will officially be a \"hold\".\nA more complicated example is Gordon and Buchan. The SNP retook the old Gordon seat from the Tories in 2019.\nBut the new seat has lost some more SNP-friendly wards to the south, and gained some more Conservative-leaning ones to the north, and when you add up the totals it means the new seat is actually considered a Tory one.\nDespite the changes, other shifts which have taken place in the interim are not reflected in the baseline for 2024.\nThe Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election, which was won by Labour's Michael Shanks last year, will have an impact in terms of momentum and the political narrative.\nBut the Rutherglen seat he is now contesting will officially ",
    "A Labour politician has said she does not know if Vaughan Gething can carry on as first minister after he lost a confidence vote.\nJenny Rathbone, MS for Cardiff Central, said it was a \"very uncertain environment and we'll have to wait and see\".\nHer comments came ahead of a meeting of the Welsh Parliament's group of Labour politicians, which BBC Wales has been told will take place virtually on Friday.\nIt is not clear why the meeting has been called but there has been some disquiet within the group after Mr Gething lost the vote on Wednesday, when two of his MSs were absent through illness.\nThe group normally meets on a Tuesday morning in the Senedd.\nThe last time it met on a Friday was following the fall out from Plaid Cymru pulling out of the cooperation agreement with the Labour-run Welsh government.\nDespite calls to quit from the opposition, Mr Gething has refused to resign.\nThe vote followed months of rows caused by the donation to Mr Gething's leadership campaign of \u00a3200,000 from Dauson Environmental Group, owned by a man previously convicted of illegally dumping waste.\nMs Rathbone told BBC Radio Wales Drive that the \"reputation of the Senedd is at risk\" and that accepting money from people convicted of environmental offences \"is a problem\".\nShe said the issue had been raised on the doorstep during the general election campaign.\nAsked if Mr Gething could brush off the defeat and carry on as before, she said: \"I don't know. It's a very uncertain environment. We'll have to wait and see.\"\n\"It is uncomfortable because we've all been dragged into this,\" she said.\nPressed on whether the first minister had the confidence of the Senedd, Ms Rathbone added: \"Well, he lost the vote. That's on the public record. I think you'd have to address your remarks to him.\"\nMs Rathbone had offered to lend Mr Gething money so he could repay the controversial donations made to his campaign.\nMr Gething has declined to repay the cash.\nIn an earlier interview she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is wise to be taking money from a convicted criminal, and therefore I think it\u2019s important that we enable this money to be repaid if that is what Vaughan Gething wishes to do.\"\nA party colleague, Vikki Howells, said on Thursday it would have been a breach of the ministerial code for Mr Gething to have taken such a loan.",

    "The union for senior civil servants has told the High Court its members could be made to break the law, under the government\u2019s plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.\nLaunching an unprecedented challenge, the FDA urged the court to clarify whether ministers could tell staff to ignore a European Court of Human Rights order to stop a flight.\nThe union says Civil Service rules mean they must abide by all laws, including orders from the Strasbourg-based court.\nThe outcome of the case could raise complex questions about the powers of ministers, with significant constitutional implications.\nEarlier this week, the government confirmed to the High Court there would be no Rwanda flight before 24 July. This case must be settled before then.\nLabour says it will abolish the scheme if it wins the general election on 4 July.\nIn June 2022, the government\u2019s first planned Rwanda flight was aborted, after a European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) interim order said the asylum seekers on board should not be taken to the African nation until British judges had ruled on whether they would be humanely treated.\nThat judgement came last November, when the UK Supreme Court ruled Rwanda was not safe for asylum seekers.\nAnd UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak then introduced an alternative plan, which tells judges to ignore those concerns - and says ministers could ignore a future flight-stopping ECtHR order.\nTom Hickman KC, for the union, told the High Court senior civil servants did not oppose the Rwanda scheme, as their duty was to serve the government of the day.\nBut the new version of the plan had left them in an unclear and potentially unlawful position.\nThe Civil Service code required officials to abide by domestic laws - those passed by Parliament - and international laws the UK had joined, including the European Convention on Human Rights, which the ECtHR oversees.\nThe government could have rewritten the Civil Service code to tell officials to ignore interim  ECtHR rulings but had not done so.\n\u201cInternational law is no less important than domestic law,\u201d Mr Hickman said.\n\u201cThe UK is a fully subscribed member of the international-law club - and international law is fundamental to the stability of the international community.\n\u201cThey [ministers] want to refuse to implement an interim measure [of the European Court of Human Rights] while wanting to maintain the appearance that international law is being complied with.\u201d \nBut the government says the union is wrong.\nIn written submissions, its top barrister Sir James Eadie KC said if the FDA won the case, it would mean civil servants could override ministers' decisions.\n\u201cThat is constitutionally untenable,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt would frustrate and undermine the intention of Parliament [in passing the Rwanda plan].\u201d\nMr Justice Chamberlain said he would give his decision at a later date.",
    "Sir Keir Starmer \"absolutely\" has confidence in Vaughan Gething, despite the first minister losing a no-confidence vote, a Labour general election candidate has said.\nStephen Kinnock, the candidate for Aberafan Maesteg, said Mr Gething had \"done nothing wrong\" and \"absolutely must carry on\" as Labour\u2019s leader in Wales.\nHowever, the vote was non-binding and opposition parties had a majority because two Labour members - one who criticised his \u00a3200,000 donation and another who was sacked by him - were off sick. \nThe first minister vowed to \"carry on\" after losing the Tory-tabled no-confidence vote in the Senedd on Wednesday.\nThe vote followed weeks of criticism after Mr Gething accepted \u00a3200,000 from a company run by businessman David Neal, who was twice convicted for environmental offences.\nOpposition parties had been considering whether to submit a motion of no confidence in the whole Welsh government, as the parliament's rules do not require Mr Gething to quit despite losing the vote.\nBut BBC Wales understands they are unlikely to do so as things stand.\nLabour's Ed Milliband also backed Vaughan Gething, describing him as a friend and \"somebody I'll be very happy to campaign with\".\nDuring a general election campaign in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero said: \"Vaughan is a man of great integrity and leadership, a great first minister.\n\"I think what we saw yesterday, frankly, wasn't even a proper vote of confidence, it was a gimmick from the Conservatives that has nothing to say to defend its record, nothing to say about the future,\"\nAsked on BBC Wales Live on Wednesday if Sir Keir had full confidence in the Welsh Labour leader, Mr Kinnock said: \"Absolutely he does.\"\n\"Vaughan is a man of honour and integrity and what we\u2019ve seen today is just a cheap political stunt by the opposition, led by the Conservatives, aided and abetted by Plaid Cymru,\" he added.\nTory Welsh Secretary David TC Davies told the programme that it was not \"about Vaughan\u2019s integrity so much as about his judgement\".\nHe said whether the Conservatives would push for a vote of no confidence in the entire Welsh government was a matter for the Tory leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies.\n\"The reality is this is making us look foolish in Wales,\" he said.\nPlaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts said: \"This is a really sad event for Welsh democracy and it has been brought about by Vaughan Gething.\n\u201cYes there are rules, but there is also judgement.\"\nPlaid leader Rhun ap Iorwerth described it as a \"serious and solemn day\" and called on Mr Gething to resign.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he denied the vote was \"playing politics\" and said Mr Gething had shown \u201cno contrition whatsoever\u201d over the donation controversy.\nOne Labour candidate, who did not wish to be named, said they wanted to \"distance\" themselves from Mr Gething. \n\"We don\u2019t want him out on the doorstep with us,\" they said, adding that the issue was coming up in doorstep conversations.\nAnother candidate also said the first minister\u2019s troubles were coming up on doorsteps but \"not impacting people\u2019s vote\".\nIn Grange Gardens - Mr Gething\u2019s Cardiff South and Penarth Senedd constituency - voters were keenly aware of the controversy, although few indicated it would sway their vote on 4 July.\n\"I\u2019ve taken into account the donation, it\u2019s a bit of a scandal really,\" said Ben Sullivan, 24, who is leaning towards voting Labour.\n\"But it won\u2019t affect how I\u2019m voting in Westminster because it\u2019s time to get the Conservatives out,\" he added.\n\"Stuff that happens in Wales won\u2019t affect how I vote for the UK overall.\"\nHera Siddiq, 28, said she believes the row is something that could \"possibly\" affect how she votes.\nHowever, she added that she has \"heard really good things\" about Mr Gething and knows \"he\u2019s done a lot for the community\".\nMore broadly she explained that she had \"lost faith\" in the main political parties and is thinking of vote for the Green Party or independents.\nSarah Johnston said that, while she thinks the donation row is \"not a good look\", she\u2019ll still be voting Labour in the general election.\n\"I don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good at all.

    "A former doughnut decorator was awarded over \u00a330,000 after a tribunal found a male colleague had \"touched her bottom\" while at work.\nHolly Merriman was 17 at the time of the incident, which happened while she was working at Project D in Derby.\nThe company was ordered to pay Ms Merriman a sum of \u00a331,410 after a tribunal, which concluded on 23 May, found she was subjected to \"unlawful discrimination\".\nThe colleague, Oliver Horn, also \"bear-hugged\" Ms Merriman and \"backed her into a corner\", a tribunal report said.\nThis initial incident occurred on a date either in the latter half of December 2020 or in early January 2021.\nThe tribunal report said that, following this, Ms Merriman's previously \"friendly\" working relationship with Mr Horn \"soured\".\nThe panel accepted that following the incident, Mr Horn called Ms Merriman a \"potwasher\", as well as making comments about her wages being less than his and that her \"breath smelled\".\n\"We are therefore satisfied that souring of the relationship and the treatment of the Claimant by Mr Horn after the Incident was because she had rejected his sexual advances towards her,\" the report said.\nIt added that on 28 March 2021, Mr Horn had \"belittled\" and \"shouted at\" Ms Merriman.\nAn investigation meeting took place on the same day, but it was found by the tribunal that Project D \"failed to deal with the incident\".\nMs Merriman was then informed via a letter on 28 April 2021 that her services were \"no longer required because there was insufficient work\", which the panel did not accept.\nIt said this was due to \"a number of reasons\" including a press report in May 2021 that suggested Project D was expanding and its products were \"very much in demand\".\nThe report said: \"These were serious matters which included [Ms Merriman] being dismissed for having reported the fact that she had been the victim of sexual harassment and having that complaint swept under the rug without any action being taken in respect of it.\"\nAccording to the report, Ms Merriman had experienced mental health issues as a result of her experience, finding herself \"introverted\" and \"constantly in tears\".\nHowever, it said since setting up her own business, she said she had \"begun to feel more positive and more like her old self\".\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Merseyside Police has apologised for historical \"ill treatment\" of the LGBTQ+ community. \nChief Constable Serena Kennedy issued the statement in response to a letter sent last year by the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell. \nShe offered her \"sincere apology and deepest regret\" for \"historical prejudice\" to older members of the community. \nMr Tatchell had urged all police forces in the UK to apologise for \"decades long victimisation\" of LGBT+ people, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s.\nMs Kennedy said the force's response followed a period of \"extensive consultation\" with representatives from the local LGBTQ+ community. \nShe wrote: \"With this apology I acknowledge the harm, unique impact, and the erosion of trust and confidence that resulted for them. \n\"Our mistreatment had the ripple effect across the whole LGBTQ+ community and the impact on their relationship with Merseyside Police.\"\nMerseyside Police became the 18th UK force to recognise homophobic victimisation after Mr Tatchell's campaign, including the Met, Dorset and North Yorkshire.\nOn receipt of the letter, Ms Kennedy said she had \"immediately recognised the need to address past injustices and acknowledge the harm caused by over-zealous policing and behaviour, policies and processes that enabled homophobia to thrive at that time\".\nThe force said it acknowledged that the \"homophobic application\" of legislation in place at the time was wrongly used to target, in particular, gay and bi-sexual men. \nIt said the impact ruined lives and prevented LGBTQ+ people from living openly for fear of prison. \nMs Kennedy said she was \"extremely grateful\" to people who shared their \"traumatic experiences\" with Merseyside Police over the last 12 months.\nShe added she was committed to \"ongoing consultation\" to further understand the impact and to ensure \"we continue to learn from our mistakes\".  \nThe force said it now worked closely with LGBTQ+ representatives on both recruitment of officers and promoting the reporting and prevention of hate crimes.  \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Teachers are being given extra support to help them feel more confident supporting children with dyslexia, thanks to an intervention project and workshops.\nBath Spa University and Gloucestershire Dyslexia Association collaborated to create activity-led workshops for 60 staff at six schools.\nIt included a more in-depth project with two schools, using different techniques.\nSenior lecturer in Dyslexia and Inclusion Dr Georgia Niolaki, who is dyslexic herself, said the findings of the research are \"promising\".\nAccording to Dr Niolaki, the project came about \"as there is research evidence that to support students with dyslexia, teachers need a sound knowledge of it first\".\n\"The workshops tried to provide as much practical experience and support in an active learning environment as possible in three hours,\" she added.\nDr Niolaki said: \"We supported the teachers in putting themselves in the students' situation, and, and this was achieved through the case studies simulation activities.\"\nSurveys were conducted before and after the workshops, with staff highlighting the areas they felt they required improvement in, and feeding back after it had concluded.\nThe pilot focused on improving not only literacy skills in dyslexic learners, but their confidence and self-esteem.\n\"The support we did with teachers last year recognised the needs of learners who might not have a diagnosis of dyslexia so we provided case studies to help them understand the traits these individuals present in relation to literacy and emotional needs,\" said Dr Niolaki.\n\"The findings are truly promising, demonstrating improvements not only in literacy scores but also in intellectual development and students' self-esteem and school status. \n\"The next step is to seek further funding to extend this knowledge to more schools.\"\nWendy Hawkins, a trustee of Gloucestershire Dyslexia Association, works as a specialist learning support teacher.\n\"We have two teaching assistants working with dyslexic children at Rednock and as professionals, they felt more empowered and more knowledgeable,\" Ms Hawkins said. \nShe added that children liked the \"multi-sensory teaching\" they received following the project, in addition to \"overlearning\", going over content again and again to make sure they fully understand it.\nMs Hawkins added she hopes to put together schemes of work together to support teachers at Rednock using the techniques developed during the pilot.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A man has been left \"anxious and fearful around dogs\" after a suspected XL bully mauled his hand in a west London park.\nGualberto Ramirez, who lives in White City, was attacked by a dog in Wormwood Scrubs, on 9 May and required surgery to his hand.\nThe dog, which the 49-year-old strongly suspects was an XL bully, was not muzzled or on a lead as required by recent new laws.\nThe Met Police confirmed it was investigating the incident.\nWARNING: This article contains an image of a dog bite injury some may find upsetting.\nFrom 1 February, it became an offence in England and Wales to own an XL bully without an exemption certificate.\nAnyone who owns one of the dogs must have the animal neutered and microchipped, and keep it muzzled and on a lead in public, among other restrictions.\nMr Ramirez told BBC London he was walking through the park to get home after a trip to the cinema. \nHe said he decided to make his way to a bench, which is where he spotted a man and woman and their two dogs.\n\"As soon as the XL bully dog noticed me, he came charging towards me,\" he said. \"I thought he was charging towards me to greet me. He didn't bark or anything.\"\n\"As soon as it got close enough to me, I kind of leaned a bit forward to welcome it. \n\"And I recall even greeting it, like, 'Hey, how are you?' But then it just takes a bite from my right hand.\"\nHe said once he was bitten he went into \"defence mode\" and grabbed the dog by the \"fat of his neck\" - a technique he says he learned from Mexican-American TV dog trainer Cesar Millan. \nThe couple approached him after the bite and the man managed to get the dog on the lead. \n\"The female owner was apologising, saying that I came out of nowhere so she didn't have time to put the muzzle on the dog,\" Mr Ramirez said.\nWhile on the lead but without a muzzle, the dog then took a lunge at Mr Ramirez and bit his ring finger.\nThe woman asked Mr Ramirez if he wanted to walk to a hospital about 10 minutes away but he said he could not due to shock and feeling dizzy. \nThe woman offered to call an ambulance but left the scene without doing so, leaving him to seek medical help on his own.\n\"At that point, I'm like, 'OK, I guess I'm alone in this' and I just assumed they didn't call an ambulance,\" Mr Ramirez said.\nInstead he walked to the nearby hospital for treatment.\n\"My right hand got the majority of it. I have two large bites which needed stitches, and there's still numbness in my index finger and thumb,\" he said.\nMr Ramirez said the recovery time could be about six months and it was possible the numbness would remain permanently.\nHe added: \"It took a toll on me mentally from not being able to do things and feeling low and down about the whole situation.\"\nThe Metropolitan Police investigation into the incident was \"flawed from the beginning\", Mr Ramirez said.\nWhile they did take a statement, he was told \"there wasn't anything they could do\" as there was no CCTV evidence.\n\"About a week later, after I did some outreach to the local media, they got in touch again to say the case wasn't handled as best as it should have been the first time around and they wanted to reinvestigate,\" he said.\nThe Metropolitan Police confirmed it had received a report of an incident where a man was bitten by a dog.\nOfficers said the man reported the dog bite on 10 May and an appointment was made to take a statement.\nThe man believed the dog to be an XL Bully, the force continued.\nInquiries into the incident are ongoing.",

    "Two Labour MSs who were absent for a vote on Vaughan Gething's leadership would have backed him had they taken part, a supporter of the Welsh first minister has said.\nHannah Blythyn and Lee Waters were said to be sick on Wednesday as Mr Gething lost a confidence vote by two votes.\nVikki Howells, who chairs the Welsh Labour group, said she was \"confident\" they would have backed Mr Gething had they been able to attend.\nBoth Ms Blythyn and Mr Waters have clashed with the first minister in the recent past.\nMs Blythyn, who represents the Delyn constituency, has not been seen in the Senedd since she was sacked as a minister by Mr Gething for allegedly leaking text messages \u2013 something she strongly denies.\nMeanwhile Mr Waters, who represents Llanelli, has been a high-profile critic of Mr Gething's decision to take \u00a3200,000 from a company owned by a man convicted of illegally dumping waste in 2013.\nMr Waters had been transport minister until March, and had been the figurehead for the controversial 20mph speed limit policy.\nNeither have publicly commented on Wednesday's vote.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Howells said that even when Mr Waters spoke on donations \"he underlined the fact that he has complete confidence in the first minister\".\n\"I am confident that both of those members would have voted to show their confidence in the first minister, to show their confidence, if they had been paired.\"\nShe said Vaughan Gething is the \"democratically elected leader of Welsh Labour\".\nMs Howells said Mr Gething had not broken any rules in accepting the donation and that he had apologised \"for any distress that this has called\".\nJenny Rathbone, the MS for Cardiff Central, revealed this week that she had offered Mr Gething a loan to pay back the \u00a3200,000 donation. \nMs Howells dismissed the idea of Mr Gething taking the money, saying it was \"for the birds\".\n\"It would be a breach of the ministerial code for him to take a loan from another politician in that respect.\"\nBy Gareth Lewis, BBC Wales News political editor\nTwo Labour figures - Ken Skates and Vikki Howells - say the absentees, Lee Waters and Hannah Blythyn, would have voted with Labour if they'd been there.\nThat implies they'd do the same if another vote of no confidence were called.  Bear in mind too for any Labour MS it would also be an enormous step to vote in favour of bringing their own government down.\nI wonder too if the opposition parties are not quite so confident that they would be united if the stakes were higher.\nSenedd members do not need to be in the chamber to take part in votes.\nThey have used an online voting system specifically built for the Senedd since the pandemic, which is used in the Welsh Parliament debating chamber itself as well as elsewhere.\nAdvice to members says they should not be travelling while they take part, and they should be visible to the presiding officer via the Senedd's Zoom connection.\nMembers are expected to be joining the meeting in \"good time\" ahead of votes - they are asked not to use a mobile device.\nShould the system breakdown, the guidance says the presiding officer could use their judgement to decide whether an oral vote should be given instead.\nSenedd members with long-term illness, bereavement, caring responsibilities or on parental leave can also vote by proxy.\nSuch requests are approved by the presiding officer.

    "Cost of living pressures remain a struggle for many small business owners and their customers, as both groups look to the general election in the hope for change. \nPrice rises have slowed considerably from their peak in 2022, but the cost of food is much higher now than it was three years ago.\nThe average cost of sugar has risen by nearly three quarters since April 2021 and prices for potatoes and milk are up by nearly 50%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nHigher food and energy prices, as well as an increase in the National Living wage, has left Amarjit Kaur Kingra having to pass the additional costs on to her customers at her fish and chip shop in the village of Ystradgynlais, Powys.\n\"People always comment that prices have gone up, but the community here are understanding,\" said Mrs Kingra, who is known to her customers as Ams.\n\"We explain wages have gone up or prices have gone up, but they are aware of that even before we\u2019ve had to say things.\"\nYstradgynlais is in the closely fought constituency of Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe which the Conservatives are defending against challenges from both the Liberal Democrats and Labour.\nAlong with the NHS, which is the responsibility of the Welsh Labour government, the cost of living is one of the big issues that will influence the vote of Becky who was shopping in the local garden centre with her teenage daughter Grace.\nBecky said that despite being relatively comfortable, her family\u2019s budget is not stretching as far as she would like.\n\"I\u2019m still not sure who to vote for, but I think it\u2019s really important to use that vote, and for voices to be heard, because things need to change,\" she said.\nThe price of food has rocketed in the last three years, much of it driven by international factors like the war in Ukraine.\nAnd though inflation, which measures the rates at which prices rise, has recently fallen back to close to the Bank of England target of 2%, average prices remain high compared with three years ago.\nHairdresser Cheryl has recently diversified her business Cutting Corner after more than 20 years.\nShe now shares the premises with beauticians offering manicures and teeth whitening.\nDespite price rises slowing down she doesn\u2019t think things are getting any better.\n\"The pressures are still there,\" she said.\nShe\u2019s also had to increase prices for customers.\n\"We feel bad about it, because our customers are like our friends, but we\u2019ve got to put the extra on in order to stay afloat.\"\n\"It\u2019s been really difficult\" said Nicola Ridd-Davies who teaches dressmaking skills at The Little Stitchery.\nWhen her contract with her energy supplier ended she faced a \"crippling\" increase in charges, which she has managed to absorb.\n\"I didn\u2019t pass on those charges to customers, but I\u2019ve really felt the pinch when it comes to utilities,\" she said\nMs Ridd-Davies believes cost pressures are \"a key issue\" for voters in the general election campaign.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said it would maintain the cap on household energy bills and the UK economy was growing at the fastest rate in the G7.\nIt said its Conservative-led UK government was \"supporting hardworking people\" with cuts to National Insurance which put \"\u00a3700 back into the pocket of the average worker in Wales\", as well as increasing the National Living Wage to \u00a311.44 an hour.\nLabour said it would provide economic stability to \"grow our economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible\".\nIt added it would deliver a new deal for working people with \"a genuine living wage\", and set up a publicly owned energy company to cut bills and boost energy security.\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said it wanted \"to ensure taxes are finally fair by lifting the burdens that have been placed on low earners\" and \"repair the broken safety net by reversing Conservative cuts to the welfare system\", as well as imposing \"a proper one-off windfall tax\" on oil and gas companies.\nPlaid Cymru said it had a \"pledge to end the two-child benefit cap which is keeping thousands of families in poverty\" and increase it by \u00a320 a week, as well as growing the economy in Wales by \"pushing for the UK to rejoin the EU\u2019s single market and customs union, to begin to reverse the economic harm caused by the Tories' botched Brexit.\"\nThe candidates in Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe are:\nConservative - Fay Jones\nLabour - Matthew Dorrance\nLiberal Democrat - David Chadwick\nPlaid Cymru - Emily Durrant-Munro\nReform - Adam Hill\nGreen Party - Amerjit Kaur-dhaliwal",
    "Schools in North Yorkshire face a maintenance backlog of at least \u00a322.3m, while funding continues to decline, according to a report.\nA North Yorkshire Council report said government funding for repairs to 186 schools had fallen to \u00a35.88m for the coming year.\nThis was down from \u00a37.33m two years ago, partly due to council-run schools becoming academies.\nThe authority estimated that a further \u00a373.3m would be needed to address the condition of classrooms within five years.\nSpecific repairs and replacements were not detailed in the report but it said a \"large number\" of council school buildings contained asbestos.\nIn addition to the grant, the Department for Education (DfE) awarded \u00a31.2m directly to schools in the area.\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service said these schools had agreed to \"contribute\" this funding to the council, so they could be included in its maintenance programme.\nThe report stated: \u201cIn some cases, this means that schools will be asked to fully fund maintenance projects that have been identified through condition surveys as a high priority rather than other projects.\u201d\nThe council's executive is set to meet on Tuesday to approve the Schools Condition Capital Programme for 2024/25.\nAsked why schools had such a significant maintenance backlog, Conservative Councillor Annabel Wilkinson said the DfE funding had not met the maintenance and improvement needs of schools for many years.\nShe added: \u201cThis is not unique to North Yorkshire and is part of a wider national issue of school conditions.\n\"We have raised these issues with the DfE previously and will continue to do so.\u201d\nThe council\u2019s Labour group leader, Councillor Steve Shaw-Wright, recently highlighted a Selby primary school appealing to the community to donate materials and carry out maintenance and improvement works.\nHe said the council needed \u201cto pull its finger out\u201d and press the government for more money.\n\u201cThe council needs to be lobbying their government which is cutting the budget, which is irresponsible,\u201d Mr Shaw-Wright added.\nThe DFE has been approached for comment.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "A primary school built to serve a new housing development will be allowed to expand after 73 children were left without places.\nWaverley Junior Academy in Rotherham is to get a two-storey extension only four years after it opened.\nThe plans were approved by Rotherham Council on Thursday despite objections from people living nearby, who claimed the school's expansion would cause extra traffic and could devalue their homes.\nThe school opened in 2020 as part of the regeneration of the former Orgreave Colliery and Coking Works site.\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, parents said 27 children did not get a place at the school in 2022 and 46 new starters had been turned away for the next academic year.\nThe scheme will include three new classrooms on each floor.\nA separate extension\u00a0on the east of the building will include a new nursery room, staff office and a larger entrance, while the\u00a0current nursery will be used as a reception classroom.\nOnce the project is complete, the school will be able to accommodate 675 pupils \u2013 175 more than its current capacity - with a further 14 staff.\nCouncil planning officer Robert\u00a0Morrell said that without the extension, Waverley families were having to travel to schools further away.\nThe parish council said its members supported the expansion, but asked for improvements to roads around the school.\nResidents also submitted concerns about parking, noise and pollution.\nOne member of the public said that the extension would \"obstruct the picturesque views\" from their home, and another said it would \"devalue their property\".\nLetters of support were also sent to the council, stating that the extra places were \"much needed\".\nPlanning officers added that the school had an active travel plan in place to reduce the reliance on cars for staff and pupils.\nThey also clarified that the roads around the school were unadopted and not within the council\u2019s responsibility, so it had no power to enforce parking restrictions.\nThe plans were approved unanimously by the planning board.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "An Australian astronomer who appeared on the BBC's Stargazing Live alongside Professor Brian Cox, has died aged 62.\nGreg Quicke from Broome, 2,000km (1,240 miles) north of Perth, was also known as \"Space Gandalf\" for his distinctive white beard.\nIn the 2017 Stargazing Live Australia series he played the practical astronomer to Professor Cox\u2019s theoretical particle physicist.\nThe series featured a report from Mr Quicke on why the night sky looks different in Australia compared to the UK. \nHis media career also included a 10-part series on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) called A Stargazers Guide to the Cosmos and books including Is The Moon Upside Down? and Earth Turning Consciousness.\nMr Quicke was also a renowned tour guide, running \"astro tours\" in his home town.\nHe estimated that across 28 years there had been around 100,000 participants \"including a BBC producer... who plucked me from the bush and onto the world stage\".\nProf Cox said that he was \"very sad\" to learn of his former colleague's death.\nWriting on X, he said: \"I love what he wrote on seeing the solar eclipse in 2023. 'My body spent, my heart full, I crash into a deep eclipse fuelled communion with the other worlds'. \n\"I hope that\u2019s where he is now.\"\nMr Quicke had been diagnosed with cancer in 2023.\nA post on his website, published before his death, says: \"Due to some cosmic, physical and other worldly challenges our 2024 stargazing season is unavailable, closed, shut, not happening and not happening.\"\nSeveral people who attended his tours have paid tribute on social media, including Chris Ross of Sydney, who described it as \"a cherished memory\".\nWestern Australian journalist Sam Tomlin wrote on X that Mr Quicke was \"one of the great scientific communicators of the modern era\".\nHe was a \"rare breed of nothing but good vibes\" who had \"made Broome a better place to be\", added tourism organisation Destination Broome on Facebook. \nThe self-taught astronomer often told of his love of helping people get a greater understanding of the night sky.\nSpeaking to the ABC in 2017, he said: \"You think about astronomy and often it's presented as stuff that's out there.\n\"But my take on it is that we're on a planet.

    "Microsoft is making changes to a controversial feature announced for its new range of PCs powered by artificial intelligence after it was flagged as a potential \"privacy nightmare\".\nThe company billed the \"Recall\" feature for Copilot+ as a way to make users' lives easier by capturing and storing screenshots of their desktop activity.\nBut after people claimed hackers might be able to misuse the tool and its saved screenshots, Microsoft is making the feature opt-in instead.\nThe Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's data watchdog, had told the BBC it was \"making enquiries\" with Microsoft about the tool after concerns were raised.\n\"We have heard a clear signal that we can make it easier for people to choose to enable Recall on their Copilot+ PC and improve privacy and security safeguards,\" said Pavan Davuluri, corporate vice president of Windows and devices, on Friday.\nMr Davuluri shared the update in a blog post.\nThe \"Recall\" tool featured prominently during the unveiling of Microsoft's new PCs at its developer conference in May. The company is counting on artificial intelligence (AI) to drive demand for its devices. \nExecutive vice president Yusuf Medhi said during the event's keynote speech that the feature used AI \"to make it possible to access virtually anything you have ever seen on your PC\" and likened it to having photographic memory.\nThe feature can search through a users' past activity, including their files, photos, emails and browsing history.\nWhile this is something lots of other devices do, the tool would also take screenshots every few seconds and search these too.\nMicrosoft said it \"built privacy into Recall\u2019s design\" from the outset and users would have control over what was captured - such as by opting out of capturing certain websites or not capturing private browsing on Microsoft's browser, Edge.\nIt said changes to the feature would give people a \"clearer choice\" to opt in to saving screenshots during set-up of the PCs, and would otherwise be turned off by default.\nUsers will also be required to use Windows' \"Hello\" authentication process to enable the tool, and their \"proof of presence\" will be required if they want to view their timeline of saved activity or search through it in Recall.\nThe updates will be implemented before Copilot+ PCs launch on 18 June.

    "A new book has delved into the history behind the \"breath-taking\" discovery of an ancient burial ground at an RAF base.\nThe initial finds at RAF Lakenheath were made during the 1950s while work was being carried out on Lakenheath Hospital, before a professional dig was established between 1997 and 2008.\nThe Anglo-Saxon Cemeteries at RAF Lakenheath, Eriswell, Suffolk volume explores the excavations of human remains, which resulted in the discovery of four separate, but linked, burial grounds dating from the 5th to the 8th Century.\nOne of the skeletons belonged to the so-called Lakenheath Warrior, who was found fully armed alongside a horse adorned with a highly ornate bridle.\nArchaeologists uncovered 427 graves, including six men buried with swords and horses, three minstrels, and one man with a quiver of arrows.\nExperts also found eight cremation burials, which included horse remains, 96 female or juvenile graves with brooches, and 2,500 glass beads.\nThe extent of the discovery is explored in the new book, part of the East Anglian Archaeology series, designed to give a detailed picture of life on the Suffolk Fen-edge in the Early Saxon period.\nAuthors Jo Caruth and John Hines said: \"The excavations at RAF Lakenheath have delivered a wealth of archaeological data.\n\"In compiling this book, we were able to build upon highly professional recording and recovery in the process of excavation with a range of cutting-edge post-excavation studies, reflecting complementary expertise in the study of human remains, artefacts and features.\"\nFunded by the Ministry of Defence, it has been produced across two volumes and published by Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service (SCCAS) and Cotswold Archaeology.\nPhilip Faircloth-Mutton, Suffolk County Council\u2019s cabinet member for environment, communities and equality, added: \"Suffolk is home to an incredibly influential past.\n\"The volume of history that has been uncovered, and now expertly documented from RAF Lakenheath, is quite breath-taking.\n\"I\u2019ve no doubt this book will be a fundamental reference point for serious and informed study.\"\nThe Lakenheath Warrior, his horse and some of the objects from the cemeteries are on loan to Mildenhall Museum where they can be viewed by the public.\nThe excavation finds archive will be held by Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service to allow it to be made freely available to future researchers.\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A grandfather-of-three says he has spent almost 14 years sleeping in a hammock in his garden.  \nDavid Priestley, 68, discovered outdoor sleeping helped soothe chronic back pain and keep his sinuses clear.\nThe former RAF armourer, from Lincoln, thinks conventional indoor sleeping is \"overrated\", adding: \"We're all animals and we've become indoctrinated to sleeping indoors\". \nMr Priestley, who has turned his bedroom into a workshop, said he \"doesn't care what the neighbours think\" because he is \"happy and healthy\".\nMr Priestley told how he first encountered the benefits of hammock sleeping while on a 2010 camping trip.\n\"I had three prolapsed discs,\" he said. \"But when I came back from this camping trip, which involved sleeping in a hammock, I felt so much better. So I strung one up in the garden.\"\nMr Priestley had been due to undergo surgery but this was cancelled as his symptoms improved.\nMr Priestley believes bedrooms are \"full of dust\".\n\"Before, I was waking up with my nostrils full of gunk,\" he said.\nHe estimates he has spent fewer than five weeks indoors over the past 14 years.\n\"I had to sleep indoors when I dislocated my shoulder while skiing,\" he said. \"I couldn't get in my hammock.\"\nMr Priestley said he takes a hammock with him when visiting friends.\n\"I'll look on Google Earth to identify a forest area,\" he said.\nEven a lack of trees does not stop him getting his al fresco sleep.\n\"I've been known to string out a hammock between a lamp post and the roof rack on my van,\" he said.\nMr Priestley, who is currently going through a divorce, said his wife used to occasionally enjoy the odd camping trip but preferred to sleep indoors in a bed at home.\n\"When I moved out of the family home a few weeks ago, I thought to myself, 'David - it's time to grow up', so I bought myself a bed. I lasted four nights.\n\"I was then back down at the hardware store buying some wood to build a frame for the hammock.\n\"I sleep so much better outdoors.\"\nWhen it comes to staying warm, Mr Priestley said less is often more.\n\"Usually I'm just in my boxers and a t-shirt,\" he said. \"People, when they're sleeping outdoors, think they have to wear lots of clothes. They don't. You keep warm by ensuring there are air pockets, not crushing the fabric.\"\nMr Priestley said people often ask why he \"bothers with a house\". \n\"I just don't sleep in a house,\" he said. \"I've turned my bedroom into a workshop. My living room, kitchen and bathroom are like any other.\" \nMr Priestley said sleeping outdoors had opened up the world of nature to him.\n\"I've even woken up to find a badger searching for worms and slugs under the hammock,\" he said.\nDr Lindsay Browning, who holds a doctorate in insomnia from the University of Oxford, said sleeping outdoors was not \"scientifically recommended\", citing temperature, lighting and \"intrusive animal noises\".\nShe added: \"Most people would find the unhelpful aspects outweigh the helpful aspects.\n\"But if it works for David, then absolutely brilliant.\"\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Ever since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has been engaged in nuclear sabre-rattling, dropping a series of not-so-subtle hints that trying to defeat a nuclear power like Russia could have disastrous consequences for those who try.\nToday President Putin claimed that Russia wouldn\u2019t need to use a nuclear weapon to achieve victory in Ukraine.\nHe was being interviewed at a panel discussion at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum: the annual event often described as \u2018Russia\u2019s Davos\u2019.\nThere are few occasions when Mr Putin looks dovish compared to the person asking him the questions.\nBut when the person asking the questions is Sergei Karaganov it would be hard not to. Mr Karaganov is a hawkish Russian foreign policy expert. Last year he called for a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Today he suggested holding a \u201cnuclear pistol\u201d to the temple of the West over Ukraine.\nPresident Putin wasn\u2019t so extreme in his language.\nBut he is no dove.\nThe Kremlin leader said he did not rule out changes to Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine: the document which sets out the conditions under which Russia would use nuclear weapons.\n\u201cThis doctrine is a living tool and we are carefully watching what is happening in the world around us and do not exclude making changes to this doctrine. This is also related to the testing of nuclear weapons.\u201d\nAnd he delivered a warning to those European countries who\u2019ve been supporting Ukraine: Russia has \u201cmany more [tactical nuclear weapons] than there are on the European continent, even if the United States brings theirs over.\u201d\n\u201cEurope does not have a developed [early warning system],\u201d he added. \u201cIn this sense they are more or less defenceless.\u201d\nTactical nuclear weapons are smaller warheads designed to destroy targets without widespread radioactive fallout.\nThis has been a surreal week in St Petersburg. On the one hand, a huge international economic forum has been taking place , sending the message that Russia is ready for cooperation and that, despite everything, it\u2019s business as usual.\nClearly, though, it is not business as usual.  Russia is waging war in Ukraine, a war which is now in its third year; as a result, Russia is the most heavily sanctioned country in the world.\nAnd, right now, tensions are soaring between Russia and the West.\nEarlier this week, at a meeting with international news agency chiefs in St Petersburg, President Putin suggested that Russia might supply advanced conventional long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets. \nThis was his response to Nato allies allowing Ukraine to strike Russian territory with Western-supplied weapons.\nHe repeated the idea again today.\n\u201cWe are not supplying those weapons yet, but we reserve the right to do so to those states or legal entities which are under certain pressure, including military pressure, from the countries that supply weapons to Ukraine and encourage their use on Russian territory.\u201d\nThere were no details. No names.\nSo, to which parts of the world might Russia deploy its missiles?\n\u201cWherever we think it is necessary, we\u2019re definitely going to put them. As President Putin made clear, we\u2019ll investigate this question,\u201d Vladimir Solovyov, one of Russian state TV\u2019s most prominent hosts, tells me.\n\u201cIf you are trying to harm us you have to be pretty sure we have enough opportunities and chances to harm you.\u201d\n\u201cIn the West some will say we\u2019ve heard this sabre-rattling before,\u201d I respond, \u201cand that it\u2019s a bluff.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a bluff. Until the time when it is not,\u201d Mr Solovyov replies. \u201cYou can keep thinking that Russia is bluffing and then, one day, there is no more Great Britain to laugh at. Don\u2019t you ever try to push the Russian bear thinking that \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a kitten, we can play with it.\u201d\nCEOs from Europe and America used to flock to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Not any more. Instead I saw delegations from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. Russia has been using this year\u2019s event to try to show that, despite Western sanctions, there are plenty of countries in the world who are ready to do business with Russia.\nAnd what have we learnt in St Petersburg about Vladimir Putin?\nThat he sounds increasingly confident and determined not to back down. He seems to believe that in the current standoff between Russia and the West, it is the West that will blink first.",

    "Time for a look at the papers - where the fallout from Rishi Sunak's decision to miss part of the D-Day Commemorations gets widespread coverage.\nThe Guardian says the prime minister \"provoked fury\" from the Conservative grassroots after he was forced to apologise for leaving France early.  The paper calls it \"the biggest mis-step yet of an already faltering election campaign\". The Guardian reports Tory officials as saying internal WhatsApp groups were full of horrified responses to Mr Sunak leaving Normandy and recording a TV interview. One grassroots member is quoted as saying the move was \"gobsmacking\".\nIt was an \"absolute catastrophe\" according to an unnamed Conservative official in the FT Weekend. He goes on to accuse Mr Sunak of \"handing a gift\" to the Reform UK Party of Nigel Farage. The FT says some Tories fear that Reform could overtake the Tories in the opinion polls in what it calls a \"crossover moment\".\n\"Tories in Despair\" is the headline in the i. It describes a backlash on what it calls the \"D-Day gaffe\" - with Conservative insiders fearing it puts the \"nail in the coffin\" of election success. The Daily Mirror strikes a similar tone, saying Mr Sunak's election campaign is \"in tatters\". Its front page headline is a quote from one of Mr Sunak's own ministers:  \"It's Over\".\nThe Daily Express declares that a \"contrite\" Mr Sunak is \"Truly Sorry\" for letting down the \"nation's heroes\", adding that he admitted leaving the D-Day event early was a mistake and had addressed the backlash head-on. The paper's columnist, Leo McKinstry, writes that the 80th anniversary of the invasion of Northern France has turned into \"Rishi Sunak's Darkest Day\" and sent his election campaign \"into meltdown\".\nThere's a change of emphasis in the Daily Telegraph, which headlines the Conservatives' plans to axe stamp duty for first time buyers on houses worth up to \u00a3425,000. The paper says the publication of the Tory manifesto will be one of the last moments left to change the dynamics of an election that has seen Labour stay far ahead in the polls. It discusses Mr Sunak's D-Day gaffe further down the article - describing the Conservative campaign as having been \"plunged into chaos\".\nThere's no mention of the D-Day row on the front pages of the Daily Mail, and the Sun. Both lead on the disappearance in Greece of the broadcaster and Mail columnist Michael Mosley - and they carry the same picture of the 67-year-old health and diet expert carrying an umbrella.  It's taken from CCTV of his last confirmed sighting on the island of Symi. The Mail reports that Greek police fear he may have come to harm while walking back to the house where he was staying.  Its headline asks: \"Did a wrong turn lead to disaster?\"\nAnd for a final word on Rishi Sunak and D-day - the Daily Star has mocked up a picture of the Prime Minister as Private Pike from Dad's Army, alongside Captain Mainwaring.

    "A coalition of more than 80 nature conservation groups is launching a legal bid to force whichever party is in power next month to improve government targets on tackling wildlife decline in England.\nOne in six UK species are currently at risk of extinction and a legally-binding target was set by the Conservative government to stop nature loss by 2030.\nOrganisations including the National Trust, the RSPB and the Wildlife Trusts have also joined forces to urge politicians from all parties to pledge to do more to boost biodiversity.\nThe main political parties have committed to halt species decline by 2030.\nOn Friday, Labour launched a new \"countryside protection plan\" that it says will boost species recovery while the Conservatives said they also had clear policies to protect the countryside.\nThe Liberal Democrats say they will double the amount of land protected for nature by 2050.\nWildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of 83 environmental groups, wants a judicial review of what it claims is a government failure to review and improve existing targets for England, as set out in the Environmental Improvement Plan (EIP).\nIn January, the independent watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP), said the government was \u201clargely off track\u201d on meeting its environmental aims, with only four of 40 targets for England likely to be achieved.\nRichard Benwell, chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said it was \u201ctime for the culture of non-compliance with environmental law to end\u201d.\nHe told the BBC: \u201cThere\u2019s been a long-term decline in wildlife and we\u2019ve seen no sign that the policies in place right now are going to be able to halt and reverse that decline.\n\u201cWe need whoever forms the next government to step up and make the investment, the legal changes and take the action necessary to really start to turn things around.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was unable to comment.\nBut the secretary of state is not legally required to complete a review of the EIP until the end of January 2028.\nThe setting of environmental targets on halting the decline of species abundance is a devolved issue.\nAll four of the nations\u2019 administrations have committed to protecting 30% of land and sea for nature by 2030.\nBut the heads of some of the UK\u2019s largest conservation groups have come together to urge UK general election candidates from all parties to do more.\nHilary McGrady, the National Trust\u2019s director general, said of the 2030 target to halt nature loss: \u201cSix years from that deadline, the UK is still one of the most nature-depleted countries on earth.\u201d\nBut, she added, if the next government acted \u201cpromptly and energetically\u201d the decline could be reversed.\n\u201cWe feel passionately that the nature crisis is of such an extent that none of the political parties as it stands at the moment are taking the challenge seriously and so we are here to really ask them to think about that and show us their response,\u201d she told the BBC.\nCraig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said they had been frustrated by \u201clacklustre efforts\u201d to meet the legal targets set.\nBeccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB, said: \u201cWe need all political parties to tackle the nature and climate crisis as one.\u201d\nOn Friday, the Conservatives and Labour unveiled their plans to protect nature.\nA spokesperson for the Conservatives said they had a \u201cclear plan to protect our countryside\u201d.\n\u201cWe will protect 30 per cent of UK's land by 2030, and build on our record of creating of 100 Marine Protected Areas, new habitats the size of Dorset, and requiring new developments to have at least 10 per cent more biodiversity,\u201d he said.\nHe pointed to the 25 Year Environment Plan's aim to create 500,000 more hectares of wildlife habitat, plant 40 million trees and restore 35,000 hectares of peatland in England through the \u00a3640m Nature for Climate Fund.\nLabour launched its new countryside protection plan, which includes a range of policies which it says will tackle nature decline.\nThe party says it will create more \"nature-rich habitats\", including wetlands and peat bogs, as well as finding private finance to establish three new national forests in England. It also intends to set up a tree-planting taskforce to grow millions more trees across the UK.\nIt will also introduce a new Community Right to Buy to help groups transform derelict land into new green spaces.\n\nTemporary approval for banned neonicotinoids that harm bees will also be stopped, it says.\nLabour\u2019s shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, said: \"The next Labour government will protect and restore nature, safeguarding our beautiful countryside for future generations to experience and enjoy.\u201d\nThe Liberal Democrats said they had \u201ccredible policies\u201d to double the amount of land that is protected and managed for nature by 2050.\nTim Farron, the party's spokesperson for the environment, said: \u201cWe need to double the amount of land that is protected and",
    "George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four was published 75 years ago on Saturday.\nIt is the story of Winston Smith, an obedient citizen in an oppressive future state who slowly rebels against the system. \nThe book is a powerful study of totalitarianism and its effect on the individual.\nIt takes place in a future world of war, poverty, rationing and absolute state control.\nEvery action, word and even thought is monitored and controlled by the leader, 'Big Brother', and 'The Party'. \nIt was written in a world ripped apart by fascism and against the backdrop of the early days of the Cold War and the spread of communism. \nThe novel is set in a part of Britain re-imagined as Airstrip One, in a state called Oceania. It is a rainy, filthy place, crumbling and battered, and almost entirely devoid of colour, warmth or comfort.\nBut it was written in an isolated and beautiful corner of the Isle of Jura as the author, afflicted by the tuberculosis which would soon kill him, sought to escape the noise, smog and damp of London, and get his warning to the world completed before he ran out of time.\nRichard Blair turned 80 in May. A retired businessman, he has spent the past few decades minding the legacy of his father, Eric Arthur Blair - known to readers the world over as George Orwell.\nRichard was adopted by Orwell and his first wife Eileen O'Shaughnessy just weeks after he was born in 1944. \nHis new mother died little less than a year later, leaving father and infant son alone together.\nIn the years following the end of the war in 1945, Orwell - finally well-off from the success of his novel Animal Farm after years of poverty - looked after Richard with the help of his family and a housekeeper.\nBut after a visit to Jura in September 1945, he began planning to move there. \nHe returned to the island repeatedly over the coming two years, bringing with him his extended family including his sister Avril and her partner. \nHe finally fulfilled his wish to decamp to the island full time in April 1947.\nThe house they rented, Barnhill, sits in the north of the island. It was barely habitable. Shabby, damp, cold and alone at the end of more than four miles of single track path. \nYet Richard has nothing but happy memories of his time there. His father was pleased with the move, too.\n\"It was a nice house. A bit rough and ready, but for him it was a lovely place to go to. Remote, certainly. It was, as he described it to friends, a 'most un-get-at-able place,'\" he says.\nRichard credits his aunt with making the place habitable.\n\"Without her it would have been very difficult for my father to have survived properly. She was very practical and a good home-maker. So she got the house comfortable. As warm as one could expect it to be made.\"\nMuch has been made of the often harsh Hebridean climate and whether Jura was the best place for a man suffering from tuberculosis.\nIt has even been suggested that living there in such spartan circumstances may have contributed to the grim tone of Nineteen Eighty-Four.\nJournalist Alex Massie, who is a regular visitor to the island, is sceptical.\n\"Orwell's decision to live in the Hebrides - a long, long way away from London at a time when he was suffering from poor health - has created this vision of the sort of doomed novelist writing himself to death at the end of the world,\" he says.\n\"That is a very romantic vision obviously, but it's not one that bears very much scrutiny. In certain respects Jura was a healthier place to live than London. And so it was not some sort of mad or suicidal sojourn. \n\"It happened to be Jura that he went to, but almost anywhere that was isolated and rural would have sufficed because what he wanted was peace.\"\nThat certainly corresponds with Richard's memories. \n\"I loved it. It's a wonderful island and for a kid it was just total freedom. Unlike London, on Jura you could just open the back door and off you went. There were thousands of acres of land you could walk over,\" he says.\nWhile the young Richard was enjoying the scenery and freedom, his writer father was avoiding the typewriter by working the land.\n\"He had by this time managed to try to get the garden dug over and planted. So that gave him a break from writing Nineteen Eighty-Four, which he had just started.\n\"Once he had established the garden, so he was growing vegetables, that was obviously of paramount importance for food. Because obviously it was the days of rationing and getting food was really difficult.\n\"We actually had a very good lifestyle. We had access to fish, to lobsters, to crabs. We had access to meat in the form of rabbits and lumps of venison that came from the estate from time to time.\n\"From that point of view we lived extremely well, if simply,\" he says.\nOrwell continued writing, though his health was deteriorating. At the end of 1947 he was hospitalised at the sanatorium in Hairmyres Hospital, then in the countryside outside Glasgow, but now in the new town East Kilbride.\nWhen he returned to Jura in the ",
    "A man who remembers being sent to numerous concentration camps during World War Two has celebrated his 100th birthday. \nLeszek Kopec told BBC Radio Derby he served as a Polish Scout at the start of the war before being captured by Nazi soldiers and sent to different concentration camps throughout the conflict.\nMr Kopec, who turned 100 on Thursday, fled to England in 1949 and has called Derby his home ever since. \nHis son, Jarek, said: \"I think it's quite incredible given what he has been through.\"\nMr Kopec, who worked at the Celanese production facility in Spondon, celebrated his landmark birthday with friends and family at the Polish Catholic Church in Derby.\nMr Kopec told the BBC in addition to Auschwitz he was held at six other concentration camps during the war, including Dachau, Gross-Rosen and Hersbruck.\n\"It was a very hard life in the camps,\" he said.\n\"Especially in the beginning, when you had been arrested because there was so many different people from so many places.\n\"Many of my friends were hanged or shot. I was in Auschwitz when 19 people I was friends with died.\"\nMr Kopec said he weighed 5st 5lb when the US Army liberated the camp he was staying at.\nHe said: \"I was actually unconscious when America liberated the camp because I was sent to hospital, I only weighed 36kg.\n\"After so many years and so many camps it was difficult, not many polish people live to 100 years.\"\nReflecting on his father's long life, Jarek Kopec said his father had never really told his family what had happened to him during the war.\n\"I think it's quite incredible given what he has been through. I\u2019m sure he will continue for a few years longer\", he told the BBC.\n\"We never really knew about his stories. It\u2019s only fairly recently that it's been relayed to us. \n\"On various journeys and holidays in Poland we visited various places where he had been kept. Bit-by-bit we started to piece things together.\"\nAsked if it was hard to hear what happened to his father, he said: \"It's very difficult being brought up with people who were in the war. \n\"You have to be proud of what they\u2019ve been through and what they have created after that.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A childminder has admitted shaking and killing a nine-month-old baby she was supposed to be looking after.\nKaren Foster, 62, claimed Harlow Collinge had fallen over and banged his head and that she shook him \"out of frustration\". \nThe boy was taken to hospital from the address in Hapton, near Burnley, Lancashire, on 1 March, 2022, but died four days later.  \nFoster was due to stand trial at Preston Crown Court for Harlow's murder but the prosecution accepted a plea of manslaughter. \nThe basis of her plea was that her \"forceful shaking\" caused Harlow's death after he fell out of his high-chair and began crying, the court heard. \nFoster, a registered childminder with nine years experience, called 999 to say he was not breathing, and told a paramedic he had \"suddenly collapsed\". \nIn legal arguments, the court heard a CT scan of Harlow's head showed significant injuries to the brain, with bleeding on both sides and swelling.\nHe had been described as a \"healthy and happy boy\" beforehand.\nFoster had also been charged with assaulting a two-year-old girl in her care in 2019, which she denied. \nThat count was ordered to lie on the file. \nHarlow's mother, sitting in the public gallery, sobbed when the guilty plea was entered. \nJudge Mr Justice Cotter told Foster, who appeared in the dock leaning on crutches: \"I am sure you have been advised that the likely sentence is one of a substantial period in custody and you should be well aware of that.\"\nShe is due to be sentenced on Thursday. \nSince his death Harlow's family said they had been campaigning for cameras to be installed on premises where childminders work.\nIn a tribute posted on a crowdfunding page, they said: \"He was a funny, playful baby who loved Peter Rabbit, milkshakes and pink wafer biscuits. \n\"He loved it when his sister sang songs to him, he loved his doggies and running around in his baby walker. \n\"He loved his family, his mummy and daddy, brother and sisters, and his grandparents so much.\n\"He has left a Harlow shaped hole no one can fill\"",
    "Pat Sajak, the longtime host of Wheel of Fortune, has signed off to viewers after four decades of asking contestants if they \"would like to buy a vowel\" on the quiz show. \nIn a video, Mr Sajak called it \"an incredible privilege to be invited into millions of homes, night after night, year after year, decade after decade\u201d. His final episode aired Friday.\nMr Sajak, 77, has recorded more than 8,000 episodes of Wheel of Fortune and has been a constant presence in American media since taking over the host role in 1981. \nIn 2018, he became the longest-running host of a game show, surpassing The Price Is Right's Bob Barker.\nIn 1983, co-host Vanna White joined him for the version of the show familiar to viewers today.\nIn his sign-off video, Mr Sajak said: \u201cI always felt that the privilege came with the responsibility to keep this daily half-hour a safe place for family fun. No social issues. No politics. \n\"Nothing embarrassing, I hope. Just a game.\"\n\"But gradually it became more than that \u2014 a place where kids learn their letters, where people from other countries honed their English skills, where families came together, along with friends and neighbors and entire generations.\u201d\n\u201cWhat an honor to play even a small part in all of that,\" he said, adding: \"Thank you for allowing me into your lives.\u201d\nIn the clip, his co-host Vanna White also paid tribute to her longtime colleague, saying: \u201cYou\u2019re like a brother to me and I consider you a true lifelong friend who I will always adore.\u201d\nThe primetime staple still attracts 26 million viewers weekly, Sony said last year when Sajak announced his plans to retire.

    "Narendra Modi, leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is set to take oath as India's prime minister for a record-equalling third term on Sunday.\nA senior party leader said that the ceremony would take place at 6pm local time (12.30 GMT).\nOn Tuesday, a BJP-led coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), won the general election with 293 seats.\nThe results were unexpected as the BJP did not win an outright majority as several exit polls had predicted.\nThis led to a couple of days of uncertainty over whether alliance partners would back Mr Modi and the BJP or negotiate with an opposition bloc to try and form the government.\nBut on Friday, NDA leaders unanimously backed Mr Modi as the leader of the coalition and their prime ministerial candidate.\nAt the meeting in capital Delhi, Mr Modi thanked his allies and said that the NDA would make every effort to govern the country well and take it forward.\n\"NDA has completed around three decades [as an alliance], this is no ordinary thing. I can say that this is the most successful alliance,\" he added.\nThe BJP won 240 seats in the election, several seats short of the 272 required to get a majority in India's 543 member parliament.\nHowever, two key BJP allies, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the Janata Dal (United) (JD(U)), won 16 and 12 seats each in their respective states, pushing the NDA comfortably over the half-way mark.\nMedia reports had earlier speculated that the opposition alliance, which won 234 seats, might approach the TDP and JD(U) to support the bloc and stake claim to form the government.\nFriday's announcement by the BJP has put that speculation to rest.\nIn the coming days, the coalition will announce the names of ministers and assign key portfolios.\nThere will also be interest in what concessions - such as key ministries or financial benefits to their states - might be granted to regional parties to keep them within the alliance.\nMedia reports suggest that TDP leader, Chandrababu Naidu, might ask for his state, Andhra Pradesh, to be given special status in exchange for his support.\nThis status grants a state certain financial benefits for its development.\nIn 2018, Mr Naidu had left the NDA due to disagreements over this very demand. He re-joined the alliance months before this year's general election.\nThere has been no official statement by his party about such a demand.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Modi submitted his resignation to President Droupadi Murmu, and the parliament was dissolved, a formal step before a new prime minister and MPs are sworn in.

    "What an extraordinary own goal.\nLike so many of the clearest, most stark stories, two pictures do almost all of the talking.\nFor days, the leaders' teams for the Conservatives and Labour had been telling me things would be different on Wednesday and Thursday of this week.\nPolitics would take a backseat, the focus would be on the D-Day commemorations.\nIt did, and it was. \nUntil that is, it wasn\u2019t.\nRishi Sunak\u2019s decision to leave the most photographed, remarked upon and most poignant event in Europe early was always likely to be spotted.\nAnd so it was, with the bloke who did his job eight years ago, Lord Cameron, playing 'I\u2019m not a leader' gooseberry in a photo with three actual leaders - the presidents of the United States, and France and the Chancellor of Germany.\nRishi Sunak was instead hurtling back to the UK to get stuck back into campaigning - recording a lengthy interview with ITV.\nWe know that because ITV released an extract of it last night, in which the prime minister insisted he hadn\u2019t lied about Labour\u2019s tax plans.\nYes, that\u2019s right - the prime minister left D-Day events early in order not to apologise for misleading claims about his opponents, only to apologise for leaving early in the first place.\nLabour, inevitably, are leaping on this, and pointing out Sir Keir Starmer stayed until the end.\nAnd the details matter here because Rishi Sunak was involved in the vast majority of the commemorations.\nAlongside the King and Sir Keir, Mr Sunak was at the British event at Ver Sur Mer.\nBut he wasn\u2019t at the event later at Omaha Beach.\nThat is where Sir Keir was pictured with the Ukrainian President Zelensky.\nA Labour source told me: \"What does it say about his judgement that he got this one so badly wrong? It should have been blatantly obvious there was only one place to be yesterday,\" adding: \"It\u2019s just more desperate stuff. Shows the chaos they\u2019re in.\"\nOf course, they would say that wouldn\u2019t they?\nBut about-turns and unequivocal apologies like this are very rare - particularly in election campaigns.\nThere are many questions about exactly how the situation - which the Conservatives now accept was a cock-up - actually happened.\nWhose idea was it that the prime minister would leave early?\nHere are a few things I have managed to piece together.\nAt the end of May, the French government told the BBC that \"Rishi Sunak's presence is not guaranteed at the international ceremony, as the British ceremony will be held beforehand.\"\nIt is the international ceremony that Mr Sunak missed.\nI understand from British sources that the itinerary for Thursday was arranged six to seven weeks ago - before the election was called, although at a time when clearly the prime minister must have been thinking about it.\nIn other words, the plan all along was to miss that final event - and so, the claim goes, the decision to come back early wasn\u2019t driven by doing the interview with ITV Mr Sunak recorded when he got back.\nWhatever the motivation, they now admit it was a cock-up - and one that feels like quite a moment in this election campaign.\nSign up for our Election Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments in the general election campaign.

    "Hundreds of people have taken part in a run in Leeds in memory of rugby league star Rob Burrow.\nThe former Leeds Rhinos player, who had lived with motor neurone disease (MND) since being diagnosed in late 2019, died on Sunday, aged 41.\nThe route of the run on Friday, organised by the Leeds Rhinos Foundation, was seven miles long, in recognition of Burrow's shirt number when playing for the club.\nA foundation spokesperson said the event took place to \"celebrate the life of a true rugby league legend and inspiration\".\nThe route, which started at Roundhay Park, was also mapped out to resemble a rhino.\nJohn McLaughlin, who came up with the route, said the shape had first come to him after he signed up for the inaugural Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon last year.\n\"I thought, well, what can I do to support Rob, Kev [Sinfield], the Leeds Rhinos Foundation and all the runners taking part? I wondered if I could draw a rhino on a map,\" he said.\n\"People thought I was a bit mad, but actually you can,\" he added.\nMr McLaughlin said an extra mile was added to Friday evening's route to make the distance seven miles to reflect the number seven shirt Burrow wore during his  career.\n\"It's seven miles, it's a fun route and it's there for everybody to be used anytime,\" he said.\nLeeds' two-time boxing world champion Josh Warrington was one of those taking  part in the tribute, wearing blue and amber Leeds Rhinos colours.\nBob Bowman, from the Leeds Rhinos Foundation, also took part. \n\"We've all been hit massively by the sad loss of Rob and it only felt right to do something this week to be impactful, visual and important,\" he said.\n\"The link between running and rugby league has been enshrined over the last few years with Rob and Kevin and the challenges.\"\nMr Bowman said given Burrow's shirt number, the run's start time also \"just felt right\".\n\"Seventh of June at 7pm, we run seven miles in that first seven days of Rob's sad passing -  and it's proved to be pretty popular,\" he said.\nAnother runner, Emma, told BBC Look North that after completing a marathon and a half-marathon to raise funds for MND she had promised herself her running days had ended.\n\"I really struggled and I promised myself I'd never do another, but I felt I had to do it tonight for Rob,\" she said.\n\"I was devastated with his passing, so I thought I'd come down and show my support with everybody else.\"\nSpeaking about the turnout for the run, Emma said: \"It's been phenomenal and I think Rob's whole journey has been for everybody, not just in West Yorkshire but all over the world really.\n\"He made such an impact and it's only right that we all pay our respects.\"\nParkrun events in tribute to Rob Burrow were held across West Yorkshire on Saturday, including in Leeds, Bradford and Wakefield.\nRunners were encouraged to wear Rhinos colours, or any clothing related to Burrow or his fundraising work.\nLaura Greaves, 42, a teacher from Doncaster, took part in the Potternewton Parkrun  in Leeds, with a party of 12 family and friends.\n\"We travelled to this one today for Rob Burrow,\" Ms Greaves said.\n\"Everybody just loved him and felt for him and his family.\n\"It's nice to pay tribute to someone who has been so strong and became such a national icon.\"\nMeanwhile, Rhinos fan Fred Jewitt, 28, from Chapel Allerton said he took part in the Potternewton tribute because Burrow was \"a special man who fought really hard in his career and was such an inspiration\".\nMr Jewitt said Burrow was an \"amazing and quick player\" who who fought for his teammates and was \"probably the best ever player among the Rhinos' golden generation\".\nA tribute to the Leeds Rhinos star was also set to be held during Saturday's Challenge Cup final.\nFans were urged to chant \"there\u2019s only one Rob Burrow\" in the seventh minute of the game, which was due to kick off at 15:07 BST.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

Foreign Minister Israel Katz said it would \"have consequences for Israel's relations with the UN\".\nA spokesman for the Palestinian president told the Reuters news agency the decision was a step closer to holding Israel accountable for what he called its crimes.\nThousands of children have been killed in Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza, and thousands more are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. \nThe annual list by the secretary general covers the killing of children in conflict and denial of access to aid and targeting of schools and hospitals. It will be included in a report to be presented to the UN Security Council next week.\nIt was not immediately clear which violations the Israeli army is accused of committing.\nHamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad will also be included in the list, reports said.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the UN had added itself to the \"blacklist of history\" and that the Israeli military was the \"most moral army in the world\".\nIsrael launched its offensive after Hamas attacked communities near Gaza on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people including 38 children and taking 252 hostages including 42 children, according to Israel's National Council for the Child.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 36,731 people have since been killed by Israeli bombardment and ground attacks.\nLast month, the UN said at least 7,797 children had been killed during the war based on data relating to identified bodies provided by the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. \nAlso last month, the UN revised down the proportion of reported fatalities that were women and children from 69% to 52% of the total number of deaths. \nIsrael said the reduction showed the UN had relied on false data from Hamas. The UN says it is now relying on figures from the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza rather than from the Hamas-run Government Media Office (GMO). The GMO meanwhile says Israeli attacks have killed more than 15,000 children.\nOn Friday, the Associated Press news agency said its analysis of Gaza's health ministry data found that the proportion of Palestinian women and children being killed in the Israel-Hamas war appeared to have declined sharply.\nIt quoted an expert at the US non-profit research group CNA as saying this was linked to reduced intensity of Israeli air strikes.\nHowever Israeli air strikes on Gaza have continued. On Thursday morning an air strike reportedly killed at least 35 people at a central Gaza school packed with displaced people. The US said it had seen reports that 14 children were killed in the strike. Israel has named 17 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members it says the strike killed. \nIn the strike's aftermath, medics from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) which is supporting the nearby al-Aqsa Martyrs' hospital described chaotic scenes there. The organisation said that in the previous 24 hours, at least 70 dead people had been brought in, and more than 300 wounded, mostly women and children.\nLast month an Israeli missile last month set fire to a camp for displaced Palestinians near the southern city of Rafah, reportedly killing 45 people including many children and sparking global outrage. The Israeli military said it had not expected such a fire to break out.\nIsrael has also been accused of delaying the entry of much-needed aid into Gaza, depriving those living on the Palestinian territory of clean water, food, medicines as well as fuel. It denies the accusation and accuses UN bodies and humanitarian organisations of failing to distribute aid that is allowed in.\nThe US-based famine early warning system network Fews Net says it is \"possible, if not likely\" that famine was happening in northern Gaza in April and an Israeli military operation in Rafah in southern Gaza was worsening food insecurity there.\nThat operation has displaced more than a million Palestinians from Rafah, where they had sought refuge from fighting elsewhere in Gaza, and to sandy coastal areas or the city of Khan Younis, which is largely in ruins.\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees Unrwa says the movement of such a large number of people in such a short timeframe alongside a sharp fall in aid deliveries is having deadly consequences.\n\"Children are dying due to malnutrition and dehydration,\" Unrwa spokeswoman Juliette Touma said.",
    "Former footballer Joey Barton faces a new criminal trial over an allegation he assaulted his wife, judges at the High Court have ruled.\nBarton was accused of assaulting Georgia Barton in a drunken row outside their home in Kew, south-west London, in June 2021, which he denied.\nHe was due to face trial at a magistrates' court in 2022 however the case was adjourned after Mrs Barton retracted her allegations.\nIn a judgment on Friday, two senior judges said Barton should face a trial over the allegations in front of a different judge.\nAfter the case was adjourned, a judge ordered that proceedings be paused over concerns a trial would be unfair to Barton as prosecutors said they did not plan to ask Mrs Barton to give evidence in court.\nThe Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Stephen Parkinson, appealed against the decision at the High Court in London, with barristers claiming at a hearing last month that a fair trial could go ahead.\nOn Friday two senior judges ruled in the DPP's favour.\nIn a 20-page ruling, Dame Victoria Sharp said the previous judge's decision \"was wrong in principle\".\nBarton, who was Bristol Rovers' manager at the time of the alleged incident, was accused of grabbing his wife by the throat and kicking her in the head during a row outside their home, where they had been with two other couples.\nHe denied a charge of assault by beating after he was arrested by police at his home.\nMrs Barton was said to have been left with a golf ball-sized bruise on her forehead and a bleeding nose.\nBut Wimbledon Magistrates' Court heard in March 2022 that Mrs Barton wrote to prosecutors a month before the scheduled trial to claim she was injured accidentally when friends intervened in an argument between the pair, having both drunk \"four or five bottles of wine\".\nMrs Barton did not support the prosecution and was not due to be called as a prosecution witness during the trial over fears she would give an untruthful account.\nLawyers for Barton said this would leave him at a disadvantage as it meant she could not be questioned over inconsistencies in her evidence.\nHowever, Dame Victoria said the prosecution was only obliged to call witnesses who had provided witness statements they planned to rely on and it was not \"an abuse of process\" to not call Mrs Barton.\nThe judge, sitting with Mr Justice Saini, added that Mrs Barton had never provided a witness statement and had also \"expressed an unwillingness from the outset to give evidence against her husband\".\nDame Victoria concluded: \"No prejudice could conceivably have been caused to Mr Barton if Mrs Barton had been called by the defence, or by the court for that matter.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Coventry's modernist architecture, much of which is at risk, is being celebrated in a new exhibition.\nPaul Catherall's linocut prints showing landmarks such as the Bull Yard and railway station form part of the show at Coventry Cathedral. \nEach building featured, apart from the cathedral,  is set to be \"redeveloped, closed, uncertain or under threat,\" he said.\nThe city has undergone a lot of redevelopment in recent years. About 1,500 homes are set to be built as part of a \u00a3450m scheme affecting City Arcade, Market Way, Shelton Square and Hertford Street.  \nSome public art, such as the listed Three Tuns mural, will be moved and new pieces created, said developers Shearer Property Regen. \n\u201cWe understand the importance of preserving public art and heritage features for the enjoyment of future generations,\" it added. \nIn November 1940, German bombers destroyed much of Coventry's city centre. It was rebuilt in what was then thought of as a bold, modern style.\nRedevelopment of those buildings has meant some have been lost or left empty. \n\"I'm not a slave to thinking everything had to be kept,\" Mr Catherall said.\n\"But it's definitely turned into a tribute to what could be completely lost.\" \nHis prints showed the buildings \"in their best life,\" he added, \"to give them a bit of their original glamour\". \nOne print shows the city's Grade II listed sports and leisure centre building which closed four years ago and remains empty. \n\"It was a real groundbreaking piece of architecture, it got glowing reviews when it was built and for it to be left is just really sad,\" said the print maker. \nCoventry City Council said it was still working to secure an occupier for the site and was spending about \u00a3400,000 a year to maintain and secure it.\nFor his prints to be shown in the cathedral was \"amazing,\" said Mr Catherall who grew up in the city. \n\"I honestly did not walk around aged 13 or 14 admiring the brutalist architecture, but your surroundings seep into you,\" he added.\nThe London-based artist has previously been commissioned by Transport for London, The Royal Shakespeare Company and Penguin Books. \nSent From Coventry is on display at Coventry Cathedral until 7 July. \nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A controversial solar farm will be built on a large piece of farm land following a successful appeal.\nElgin Energy applied in December 2021 to build a new solar farm north of Tropiquaria Zoo on the A39, near the village of Washford, on land owned by the Wyndham Estate.\nSomerset Council\u2019s planning committee west threw out the plans in July 2023, citing the damage to protected landscapes and the loss of high-quality agricultural land, with the planning inspectorate overturning the move.\nThe solar farm will span\u00a0several fields north of the Washford transmitting station, running from the B3190 Washford Hill to the Mineral Line active travel route, which connects Washford to the nearby town of Watchet.\nElgin Energy (which first consulted on the proposals back in May 2018) said the solar farm would provide enough energy to provide power for 7,500 households.\nA battery energy storage site will also be created near the site, allowing Elgin Energy to store surplus energy and sell it back to the National Grid at peak times.\nIn addition to opposition from local residents, the solar farm was also strongly criticised by CPRE Somerset, the Exmoor National Park and the Quantock Hills National Landscape organisation.\nCouncillors threw out plans last year, citing the damage to protected landscapes and the loss of high-quality agricultural land, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nPlanning inspector\u00a0Cullum Parker visited the site on 30 April and published his detailed ruling on 28 May.\nMr Parker said that neither the Exmoor National Park or the Quantock Hills National Landscape would \u201cbe adversely affected\u201d by the solar farm, due to its distance from the boundaries of both protected areas.\nHe said concerns about the impact on the natural landscape were undermined by \u201cman-made features\u201d in the local area, including\u00a0the radio transmission towers near Tropiquaria Zoo and the Hinkley Point C complex.\nMr Parker added the solar farm was sufficiently far from the main roads to not be overly visible to passing motorists, with the existing hedgerows along the A39 and the B3190 providing ample screening.\nHe also ruled there would be no adverse impact on the Mineral Line active travel route due to the high levels of vegetation screening the route from the solar farm site.\nReports commissioned by CPRE Somerset and the local tenant farmers stated the land was \u201csome of the better quality arable land in this area of west Somerset.\u201d\nBut\u00a0Mr Parker was dismissive of these reports, arguing they \u201coffered no detailed analysis\u201d of the key issues and were \u201cbased on little more than a walk over of the fields and high-level maps from the 1980s\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cSoil samples from the site indicate\u00a0that the site comprises entirely lower quality agricultural land\u2019.\nMr Parker did agree with\u00a0Historic England that the proposals would result in a \u201cmarked change\u201d to the landscape and harm the setting of local heritage assets, such as the grade one listed St. Decuman\u2019s Church in Watchet.\nHowever, he decided this harm would be of \u201cless than substantial in magnitude\u201d and could\u00a0be mitigated through high-quality landscaping.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders, who snapped one of the most famous photographs taken in outer space, has died in a plane crash at the age of 90.\nOfficials say a small aircraft he was flying crashed into the sea off Washington state.\nAnders' son Greg confirmed that his father's body was recovered on Friday afternoon.\n\"The family is devastated. He was a great pilot. He will be missed,\" a statement from the family reads.\nAnders - who was a lunar module pilot on the Apollo 8 mission - took the iconic Earthrise photograph, one of the most memorable and inspirational images of Earth from space.  \nTaken on Christmas Eve during the 1968 mission, the first crewed space flight to leave Earth and reach the Moon, the picture shows the planet rising above the horizon from the barren lunar surface.  \nAnders later described it as his most significant contribution to the space programme.\nThe image is widely credited with motivating the global environmental movement and leading to the creation of Earth Day, an annual event to promote activism and awareness of caring for the planet.\nSpeaking of the moment, Anders said: \"We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing that we discovered was the Earth.\"\nOfficials said that Anders' plane crashed at around 11:40PDT (19:40BST).\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said the 90-year-old was flying a Beechcraft A A 45 - also known as a T-34. The agency said that the plane crashed about 80ft (25m) from the coast of Jones Island.\nWitness Philip Person told King-TV in Seattle that he saw the crash.\nThe plane began doing what appeared to be a loop and became inverted, he told the network. \n\"I could not believe what I was seeing in front of my eyes,\" Person told the local news station. \"It looked like something right out of a movie or special effects. With the large explosion and flames and everything.\"\nFootage that allegedly captured the plane crash appears to show an effort to pull up at the last second, before it hits the surface of the water and becomes a fiery wreck.\nBBC News has not verified the video. \nAnders also served as the backup pilot to the Apollo 11 mission, that led to the first Moon landing on July 20, 1969. \nFollowing Anders' retirement from the space programme in 1969, the former astronaut largely worked in the aerospace industry for several decades. He also served as US Ambassador to Norway for a year in the 1970s.\nBut he is best remembered for the Apollo 8 mission and the iconic photograph he took from space.\n\"In 1968, during Apollo 8, Bill Anders offered to humanity among the deepest of gifts an astronaut can give. He travelled to the threshold of the Moon and helped all of us see something else: ourselves,\" Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement.\nIn a previous interview, Anders described taking the picture after being given \"a little bit of photography training\".\nHe said: \"We were in lunar orbit, upside down and going backwards so for the first several revolutions we did not see the Earth and then we twisted the spacecraft so it was going forward and suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw this colour - it was shocking.\n\"So I just took a shot, moved it took a shot, moved it.\"\nBuzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the Moon, was among others to pay tribute to Anders, calling him \"an inspiration\". \nMark Kelly, a former astronaut who now serves as a US Senator for the state of Arizona, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that Anders \"inspired me and generations of astronauts and explorers. My thoughts are with his family and friends\".",
    "Inside the bodies of humpback whales are clues about how climate change is transforming Antarctica. Our BBC science team crossed the Southern Ocean, with the researchers, on a mission to follow and study the giant whales of this remote, frozen wilderness. \nAt 03:00 in the morning there is an almighty crash. Every drawer in our cabin is flung open and contents hurled against the wall. We hit a 12-metre wave.\nI\u2019m not a seafarer; this is alarming, but apparently not unusual on the Drake Passage - the stretch of the notoriously rough Southern Ocean we are on. We\u2019re aboard a 200-passenger tourist ship, with a team of wildlife scientists, on our way to the Antarctic Peninsula.\nOne of the researchers, Dr Natalia Botero-Acosta has an arresting piece of equipment in her hand luggage - a custom-made crossbow. \u201cIt\u2019s not a weapon,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a scientific tool we use to collect whale skin and blubber samples.\u201d\nUsing the crossbow and a drone, the researchers will carry out up-close health checks on every humpback whale they can find, to work out if these massive mammals are getting enough to eat.\nIt is an important question - not just for mighty, 40-tonne humpbacks that travel thousands of kilometres to gorge themselves in the cold seas - but for the health of the ocean and our planet.\nIn the rich, freezing seas off the peninsula, penguins, seals and many whales feed on Antarctic krill. \nThese diminutive, almost unimaginably numerous, shrimp-like creatures thrive under sea ice. As the climate warms up, scientists are racing to understand what that means for this ice-dependent food supply.\nEarly on our first Antarctic morning, in mercifully calm coastal waters, we set out on a small, inflatable boat called a zodiac.\nCloud is descending and it is starting to snow. Leading our Antarctic whale research mission is Chris Johnson, who is the wildlife charity WWF\u2019s global expert on whale conservation.\nIn conditions like this,\u201d says Chris, \u201cthe best way to find whales is to listen - we\u2019ll switch off the zodiac engine and close our eyes.\u201d\nThe silence is transformational. Multiple, overlapping blows of whale exhalations echo off mountains that rise vertically out of glassy water. Gigantic, hungry humpbacks are feeding in this bay. All around our small boat, animals are breathing, then diving - opening their cavernous mouths to let krill-laden seawater rush in.\nWe head slowly in the direction of the nearest blows and Natalia reaches for her crossbow.\nThe giant mammals build up chemical clues about their environment in their blubber - clues that Natalia plans to collect.\nShe picks up one of the crossbow bolts. On the business end, there is a 3cm metal tip that plucks a piece of skin and blubber from the whale\u2019s body. A rubber stopper prevents the bolt from penetrating further: It grabs a sample, then bounces off the animal and floats in the water.\n\u201cIt\u2019s 3cm from an animal that\u2019s 14m long - so it\u2019s like a mosquito bite,\u201d says Natalia. Sure enough, when her bolt takes a nick out of the body of a huge, female whale, the animal doesn\u2019t flinch.\nIt\u2019s a mother, side-by-side with her calf. She seems intrigued - circling our boat slowly, then gliding directly underneath. Her giant head and white pectoral fins - fringed with barnacles - are visible as she slowly floats beneath us.\n\u201cHold on in case she comes up,\u201d says Chris. But mother whale glides on, surfacing on the other side of us with a blow.\nThe calf is even more curious, raising its head out of the water. The young marine mammal seems to examine us; we\u2019re a strange group of tiny, terrestrial mammals in a small, rubber boat. I can\u2019t stop myself greeting the calf: \u201cHello, beautiful.\u201d\nBaby humpbacks spend a year\u00a0nursing on their mothers\u2019 rich milk. With a hungry, one-tonne newborn, calories are important.\n\u201cWe need to find the most critical feeding habitats for whales, so we can protect them,\u201d explains Chris.\nThe health of whales, he explains, shines a light on the health of the whole Antarctic ecosystem. And whales are physically necessary for a healthy ocean: Humpbacks eat krill, and krill eat microscopic plants that live in sea ice - plants that absorb planet-warming carbon as they grow. Whales then poop (in vast quantities) and fertilise the marine plants.\nIt\u2019s a virtuous, productive cycle that climate change is disrupting. \u201cThese are natural processes we rely on for fresh air, food and clean water,\u201d says Chris. \u201cPlaces like this are important for all of us.\u201d\nThere is a group of humpbacks in this bay and Natalia sets up to take another biopsy. She seems in sync with the whale. When it arches its back above the surface, that\u2019s the moment - and the ideal, blubber-rich area - for her to aim for. There\u2019s a gentle \u201cthunk\u201d as the bolt bounces off the whale, taking its nugget of tissue.\nBack in her lab at the University of California Santa Cruz, Natalia will be able to tell if this whale was hungry, stressed or pregnant from chemical signals, or hormones, that build up in its blubber",
    "Thousands of well-wishers gathered in Chester for the wedding of the Duke of Westminster, where the Prince of Wales acted as an usher.\nHugh Grosvenor, the godson of King Charles III, married Olivia Henson at the city's cathedral earlier.\nThe 33-year-old duke is godfather to Prince George, but the 10-year-old could not join his father at the ceremony due to it falling on a school day.\nTwo women were removed from the crowd by police after an orange plume was deployed from a fire extinguisher-type device as the couple left the cathedral.\nCampaign group Just Stop Oil said two of its supporters had used the device to project powder paint near the cathedral entrance as the newlyweds made their way to a car.\nCheshire Police said two women, a 69-year-old from Manchester and 73-year-old from Suffolk, had been arrested on suspicion of public order offences and remained in custody.\nThe duke is regarded as one of the richest people in the UK, with a fortune of about \u00a310bn, while his bride has worked in the sustainable food and drinks industry.\nAlong with being a godparent for Prince George, he is also reported to be godfather to the Duke of Sussex's son, Prince Archie. \nPrince Harry, who was an usher with his brother at the wedding of the duke\u2019s sister Lady Tamara Grosvenor in 2004, is understood not to have attended the service by mutual agreement.\nThe King and Queen Camilla did not attend the service, after travelling to Normandy for the D-Day commemorations on Thursday.\nThe Princess of Wales, who is receiving treatment for cancer, also did not attend.\nThe bride wore a dress and veil designed by Emma Victoria Payne, embroidered with floral motifs and edgings from Ms Henson's great-great-grandmother's veil from about 1880.\nThe 31-year-old also wore a vintage tiara, incorporating a myrtle leaf design, which was made by the prestigious Russian jewellery craftmakers Faberg\u00e9 for Grosvenor brides and has been worn on their wedding days since 1906.\nHer bouquet was made of flowers picked from the gardens of Eaton Hall, the duke's country house.\nMembers of the public began arriving outside the cathedral from early in the morning, bringing camping chairs and picnics.\nBy the time of the service, thousands were gathered outside the cathedral and in the surrounding streets and many of them witnessed the protest as the couple re-emerged.\nBarbara Williams, 81, from Cheshire, who was standing next to the protesters in the crowd, said she felt \"a bit shaken after it\".\nShe said she and her friend Andrea Machin, 56, had been \"standing next to them all day\".\n\"They were already here when we arrived at 07:00 [and] they had shopping trolleys with them,\" Ms Machin said.\n\"Everyone was watching the bride and groom and then we just saw orange and they had what looked like a fire extinguisher with them.\n\"The police realised quite quickly what was happening and pulled them out. \n\"It happened just as William was coming out of the door.\"\nIn a statement issued by Just Stop Oil, the protesters said weddings were \"a time of coming together in celebration to make a commitment to the future\", but for \"countless millions around the world there is no future unless we come together to stop oil and gas\".\nA representative for the duke and Ms Henson said it meant \"a lot\" for them to marry in Chester, due to the Grosvenor family's \"long and close personal connection to both the cathedral and the city\".\nThey said the couple had \"made a conscious effort to involve local and regional suppliers in several aspects of the day\".\n\"The couple have also been moved by the messages of support they have received from around the region and are hugely grateful that people want to share in their happiness,\" they added.\nThe city\u2019s annual Summer Flowers project has been funded by the couple, with 100,000 flowers planted as part of the wedding celebrations and they have also paid for free ice cream and sorbet from three local independent businesses to be given to visitors to Chester city centre through the day.\nPoppy, a student at the University of Chester, was one of those indulging in a free ice cream.\nShe said it was \"great to see the people and the businesses together\".\n\"It\u2019s really fun to get the students out in the city and involved,\" she added.\nThe duke inherited his title and control of the Grosvenor Estate at the age of 25, following his father's death in 2016, and the couple announced their engagement in April 2023 after being together for two years.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "A marginal seat is the kind of place where the political majority is tight and some voters are willing to switch sides. The constituency of Wimbledon in south-west London, is one such place.\nKnocking on doors in Malden Manor, I joined the Conservative candidate hoping to replace the former Tory MP Stephen Hammond, who has stepped down.\nSporting a Team GB jacket, Danielle Dunfield-Prayero, who is a former British triathlete, tells me she is campaigning on local issues such as step-free access at local railway stations.\nShe brushed off speculation about the Conservatives' prospects here, saying: \u201cI love a challenge in a competition and we\u2019re having lots of fun speaking to residents, finding out what\u2019s important to them.\u201d\nChatting to people on the High Street, I hear about some of the issues important to voters here. Concern about the economic outlook is among them. \nOne man tells me: \u201cI\u2019d like to see more strong leadership, guidance towards how we\u2019re going to solve our problems and [the] need for economic growth.\u201d He added that he didn\u2019t see political parties \u201cshowing much initiative or imagination\u201d on the issue.\nConcern about crime is also on the minds of some voters. A woman told me she was concerned about \u201csafety, police on the street\u201d.\nThe Conservatives have held this seat since 2005 when they took it from Labour, but at the 2019 General Election, voters in Wimbledon came close to electing a Liberal Democrat MP. \nThe Conservatives held on by just 628 votes, as Mr Hammond was re-elected with 38.4% of the vote. \nThe Liberal Democrats were hot on their heels in second place, buoyed by an anti-Brexit vote in an area where the majority of people voted to remain in the European Union. Labour was pushed into third place with 23.7% of the vote.\nFast forward to 2024 and the political picture for the Conservatives here looks precarious.\nThe Tories lost council seats in the Wimbledon area to the Liberal Democrats in the local elections of 2022.\nAnd boundary changes - aimed at ensuring all parliamentary seats have roughly the same population size - have made the political landscape tougher for the Tories, by bringing in areas that have been less traditionally Conservative-leaning.\nIn addition, the Tories will not have the potential advantage of fielding an incumbent because Mr Hammond decided to quit Parliament after nearly 20 years.\nPipped at the post in 2019, the Liberal Democrat candidate Paul Kohler is back for a second go. He says policing is one of his top priorities, following his own experience of crime. \nMr Kohler was the victim of a brutal attack in a burglary at his home in 2014 that left him with severe facial injuries. He later became a councillor on Merton Council.\nMeeting me outside Wimbledon police station - which he helped save from closure in 2018 after he took the Greater London Authority to court over plans to shut it - he told me he was still campaigning to secure the long-term future of the police station.\nMr Kohler said voters were \"very worried about the total failure of community policing\" in Wimbledon. He explained it was \"particularly important\u201d to him \u201cbecause that\u2019s what got me into politics in the first place, when officers from this police station saved my life 10 years ago when I was attacked in my own home.\"\nLabour, which came third here last time but won the seat in the general elections of 1997 and 2001, has deputy leader of Merton Council Eleanor Stringer as its candidate.\nIn what\u2019s been dubbed by some locally as the \"battle of the bar charts\", Labour recently surprised the Liberal Democrats and some local people when it moved its campaign headquarters into the disused pharmacy building next door to the Lib Dem campaign office. Bar charts in the windows conflict with those presented by the Liberal Democrats, who have accused Labour of \u201cplaying political games\u201d with the move.\nMs Stringer, who told me she was campaigning on the economy and the state of \u201ccrumbling\u201d public services, laughed off suggestions that her campaign office had moved in next door to the Lib Dems in order to spy on the competition.\nShe said: \u201cWe know that other parties have been putting out information that\u2019s half a decade old, so we wanted to really clearly present some information from more recently which shows the level of swing from the Conservative vote [that] is coming over to Labour.\u201d\nAcross the road from the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the home of the Wimbledon tennis championships, I heard about another issue concerning many living in this constituency. \nPlans by the All England Club to build new facilities on Wimbledon Park have proved hugely controversial. The proposals have been referred to the Greater London Authority (GLA) after Merton Council granted planning permission but Wandsworth Council refused it.\nShowing me a map of the plans, Christopher Coombe, from the Save Wimbledon Park campaign, said he wanted the next MP to try to block the proposal. \nHe explained: \u201cThis is probably the",
    "Members of the Sikh community have been recalling what their families endured during one of the most brutal periods in the history of their faith.\nIt is 40 years since Indian armed forces stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar in Punjab, to remove Sikh separatists who were demanding an independent homeland, called Khalistan.\nAbout 400 people, including 87 soldiers, were killed during Operation Blue Star, which was ordered by then prime minister, Indira Gandhi. But Sikh groups dispute this figure, claiming thousands died.\nSikhs across the world accused troops of desecrating the faith's holiest shrine, and tensions led to an armed insurgency lasting more than a decade.\nHere, Sikhs in Bedfordshire recount how the events of June 1984 have left lasting scars.\nRasal Singh is a volunteer in the Sikh temple in Luton, and runs a business in Bedfordshire.\nHis father, Nirmal Singh Chola Sahib, was killed in November 1990.\nHe said: \"My father was arrested and taken to the local police station where he was tortured severely... It was tragic, he was brutally tortured.\"\nThe father of three said his family \"still suffer today\".\n\"The pain is still so raw, the absence of my father has left a void that never truly heals he was tortured and killed, it\u2019s left a huge hole in my heart,\" he said.\n\"After my dad was killed, my family became homeless, moving from place to place. Even after 40 years, my family is still hurting, and no justice has been served.\n\"I channel my pain into being a better parent, hoping to give them the sense of completeness that I missed. \n\"Every hug, every word of encouragement, every moment spent with them is a step towards healing.\"\nGurjit Singh, from Luton, said his uncle, Paramjit Singh, was a police officer in Punjab before he was killed in the 1990s. \nHe said: \"Innocent people were often tortured and targeted simply for wearing turbans or having beards. \n\"The police frequently harassed women under false pretences.\"\nHe said his uncle became a target for harassment himself while trying to protect a group of women from his colleagues. \n\"They even targeted his family, including my father, who was also a police officer,\" he said.\n\"My uncle had to flee the village, but eventually, they found him, tortured him in jail for 10 days, and then killed him in the fields, staging his death as an escape attempt.\"\nHe said that his uncle fled, the whole family was arrested, including children and grandparents.\nOne family member was nine months' pregnant and was denied medical care, suffering a stillbirth.\n\u201cToday after 40 years of fighting for justice, we still don\u2019t have it,\" Mr Singh said. \n\"Even political parties did not intervene. \n\"Punjab was in a state of lawlessness and danger. Our family has been shattered, and three generations have been unable to live a normal life.\"\nHarjinder Singh, from Bedford is a Sikh Activist for Sovereign Roots.\nThe campaign group provides education toolkits on the Sikh religion and political history of Punjab from the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\nHe said: \"As we mark 40 years since the tragic attack on Sri Darbar Sahib in Amritsar, we remember the thousands of lives lost, including men, women, and children. \n\"An entire generation has been killed, leaving families and the global Sikh community in enduring pain. \n\"Today, we find ourselves with no refuge or voice to hear our pleas for justice. The memories of our lost loved ones demand that we seek an independent country, free from the oppression we have faced in India.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The topic of immigration fuelled an often bad tempered clash at the the latest televised debate ahead of the general election. \nThe seven parties taking part in the BBC debate were the Conservatives, Greens, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Reform UK and the SNP.\nOpening the debate on immigration, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said all the other parties think questioning migration is \u201cwrong\u201d.\nHe said immigration was creating a \u201cpopulation crisis\u201d, diminishing the quality of people\u2019s lives, and this should therefore be an \u201cimmigration election\u201d.\nPlaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said the tone of the debate on immigration had to be changed.\nHe said \"too much of it is framed around the bigotry of people like Nigel Farage\".\nHe said Plaid Cymru would \u201cstand up to Nigel Farage\u201d, adding that \u201cwe need immigration for the health system, the care system and the economy\u201d.\nChallenging the claim of bigotry, Mr Farage sarcastically replied: \"Open the doors. Let everyone come. Benefits for everybody.\"\nFor the SNP, Stephen Flynn said migration was \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d for public services, businesses and the economy.\nHe said we need to \"end the demonisation\" of migration.\n\u201cThis race to the bottom on migration, driven by Nigel Farage, followed by the Conservative party and hotly chased by the Labour Party does not serve Scotland\u2019s interests,\" he said.\nPenny Mordaunt, for the Conservatives, said immigration was too high, adding that her party would have \u201can annual cap\u201d on numbers.\n\u201cWhat that will do is take into account the economic needs of the workforce but also the pressures that immigration puts on communities,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt will be Parliament which decides because the numbers are too high, over the next few years you can see it will come down.\"\nLabour\u2019s Angela Rayner said problems with housing, roads and health were nothing to do with immigration but to do with \u201cthe decimation that the Tories have done to our public services\u201d.\nShe said Labour would scrap the Conservative government's Rwanda scheme and put the money into a new Border Security Command, which she said \"would smash the gangs\" trafficking people into the UK.\nLiberal Democrat Daisy Cooper said the Conservatives had made \u201ca complete mess both of the migration system but also of the asylum system\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cWe have people who are desperate and are fleeing war and persecution arriving on small boats... at the same time we have our NHS, social care, hospitality and engineering, can recruit the staff to boost our economy\u201d.\nFor the Greens, Carla Denyer said: \u201cIf you were to meet a migrant in the NHS, they are more likely to be treating you than being ahead of you in the queue.\"\nShe said migrants had been a \u201cgood thing\u201d for the UK \u2013 the Greens did not want \u201ccaps\u201d on migration, they wanted a system which was \u201cfairer and more humane\u201d.\nThe General Election will be held on 4 July.",
    "A man who hailed a white supremacist who killed 51 people at two mosques as a \"hero\" has been sentenced.\nEdward Griffiths sent footage to people of the 2019 Christchurch terrorist attacks in New Zealand and said he would \"like\" to go on a killing spree.\nThe 44-year-old, of Hermitage Road in Whitwick, Leicestershire, was found guilty of encouraging terrorism and two counts of dissemination of a terrorist publication in May.\nAt Birmingham Crown Court he was jailed for four and a half years.\nThe court heard Griffiths had posted an image of the Christchurch attacker, Brenton Tarrant, as a Christian saint and called him a \"hero\".\nHe had also repeatedly expressed violent opinions about ethnic and immigrant communities on social media.\nAfter committing the offences between November 2021 and June 2022, counter-terrorism officers arrested Griffiths during a raid of his home.\nJudge Paul Farrer noted Griffiths was a \"sad and lonely\" man with a drugs problem at the time of the offences.\nHe said: \"The material you disseminated and published glorified the murders committed by Brenton Tarrant and implied others should emulate that behaviour.\n\"There is no evidence anyone actually did so and I conclude therefore that your behaviour provided non-specific content encouraging support for terrorist activity endangering life.\"\nHe added: \"[Your defence] has argued on your behalf the extreme  views you expressed were motivated by a desire to fit in with others and do not represent your true beliefs.\n\"Having heard the evidence in this case, including your evidence, I reject that submission.\n\"You were undoubtedly a supporter of the extreme right-wing and that includes holding white supremacist views\".\nGriffiths was given a four and a half year term for encouraging terrorism, with two year sentences for both counts of dissemination of a terrorist publication to run concurrently.\nDet Insp Glynn Jehu, from Counter Terrorism Policing \u2013 East Midlands, said: \u201c51 people lost their lives in the Christchurch attacks. \n\"Spreading messages of extreme hate and violence in the way that Griffiths did is dangerous, reckless and could easily have encouraged others to commit an act of terrorism.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Leading figures from seven main UK parties faced each other in a BBC debate. They made claims on tax, defence spending, NHS and immigration, among other issues.\nWe examined some of them. \nThis is false.\nConservative Penny Mordaunt made the claim twice in the debate, repeating it after Labour's Angela Rayner called it a lie and the BBC's debate moderator Mishal Husain said it had been criticised by the UK statistics watchdog.\nSir Keir Starmer did not confirm the \u00a32,000 per household figure, which he has called \u201cabsolute garbage\u201d.\nThe figure is misleading, because it is totting up more than \u00a3500 a year extra over four years, which is not what you would normally think of if somebody said your taxes were going up by \u00a32,000.\nThat was the concern from the statistics watchdog.\nThe Conservatives came up with the figure by adding up how much they claim Labour's spending commitments would cost overall and dividing this by the number of UK households with at least one person working.\nBut their costing is based on some dubious assumptions and Labour disputes it.\nLike the Conservatives, Labour says it will not raise the rates of income tax, National Insurance or VAT.\nOn Tuesday, in a head-to-head debate with Rishi Sunak on ITV, the Labour leader said: \u201cWe will raise specific taxes, and we have been really clear what they are.\u201d\nHe mentioned putting VAT on private school fees and ending the non-dom status for wealthy individuals who don\u2019t pay UK tax on overseas assets, as well as tax on oil and gas companies.\n\u201cWe will raise those but we won\u2019t raise the others,\u201d he said.\nThe first question of the debate asked the politicians how, as the country marks the anniversary of D-Day, they would ensure our army is ready and the country is safe from major conflict.\nLabour deputy leader Angela Rayner was right that her party has said it would raise the total defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP).\nBut she did not mention that - so far - there is no timeframe for this.\nLabour has said it would do this only \u201cas soon as resources allow\u201d.\nThis is more vague than the Conservatives, who have pledged to hit this spending target by 2030.\nThe claim by the SNP leader in the House of Commons, Stephen Flynn, equates to roughly the number of jobs that Scotland\u2019s oil and gas industry supports in the wider economy.\nThose figures come from an independent estimate carried out for Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), a trade association.\nBut it is misleading to suggest Labour\u2019s plans put all of these jobs are at risk.\nLabour has said it would not issue new oil and gas licences, and would extend the windfall tax on energy companies, which OEUK says could threaten some jobs.\nBut the party has pledged not to overturn existing licences. and says that oil and gas would still be part of the energy mix for decades to come\nAs Mr Flynn acknowledged, the North Sea is running out of oil and gas, so many of the jobs are at risk in the long-term anyway.\nAnd the government's independent adviser - the Climate Change Committee (CCC) - has previously said, there is potential for the transition to renewable energy to \"create more jobs than will be lost\" across the UK.\nThe Lib Dems' deputy leader was responding to a member of the audience who said it was almost impossible to get a doctor\u2019s appointment where he lives in Essex.\nIt\u2019s true that at the last election, the Conservatives pledged 6,000 more doctors in general practice by 2024-25. Their pledge referred to England only, because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland manage their own health systems.\nMs Cooper is right that this pledge has not been met. In December 2019, there were 34,519 full-time equivalent GPs in England, while in April 2024 (the latest available data) the number was 37,327 \u2013 just over 2,800 higher. But this number includes GPs in training.\nIf you look at the number of fully qualified GPs only, the number is down by 523 - from 28,129 in December 2019 to 27,606 in April 2024.\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage was speaking about legal migration. He did not specify which time period he was talking about but this claim is not correct when you examine the latest figures for all visas issued.\nIn the year ending March 2024, about 1.4m visas were issued and about a third went to dependants.\nMr Farage was challenged by the BBC\u2019s Mishal Husain and then said \u201cabout 50% that come are dependants\u201d.\nThat claim is more or less correct for work visas.\nOut of all the work visas issued in the year ending March 2024 - the latest available figures - 48% were issued to dependants.\nThe two-child benefit cap prevents parents from claiming child tax credits or universal credit for more than two children, which many claim has caused hardship for many big families.\nThe Child Poverty Action Group has estimated that scrapping the cap would lift 250,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of \u00a31.3bn.\nGreen co-leader Carla Denyer said that her party wants to remove it and criticised Labour and the Conservatives for supportin",
    "US President Joe Biden has apologised to his counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky for delays in military aid to Ukraine and has pledged $225m (\u00a3191m) in support.\nThe pair met for talks in Paris, a day after they both attended the 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day landings in Normandy, France.\nThe US Department of Defense said the new aid package would include ammunition and anti-aircraft missiles.\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nMr Biden said previous delays in aid had been caused by some Republicans in Congress, but reiterated US support for Ukraine.\n\"The United States will stand with you,\" Mr Biden told Mr Zelensky. \"You haven't bowed down. You haven't yielded at all. You continue to fight in a way that is just remarkable, just remarkable.\"\nIn response, Mr Zelensky stressed the importance of his country's relationship with the US, saying it was crucial in the fight against Russia: \"We count on your continuing support in staying with us shoulder to shoulder.\"\nAfter meeting Mr Zelensky, Mr Biden made a passionate speech at Pointe Du Hoc, a site in Normandy where US army rangers scaled a cliff to storm a Nazi stronghold on D-Day.\nThe US president spoke about the sacrifice of those who lost their lives on 6 June 1944, saying: \"Does anyone doubt that they would want America to stand up against Putin's aggression here in Europe today?\"\n\"They're asking us to do our job: to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy, to stand up to aggression abroad and at home,\" he added.\nEarlier in the day, Mr Zelensky addressed the French parliament, saying the current conflict with Russia meant Europe was \"unfortunately no longer a continent of peace\".\nHe also expressed hope that a summit hosted in Switzerland later this month could help bring an end to the war.\nThe Ukrainian president also met with French President Emmanuel Macron during his visit.\nSpeaking on French TV on Thursday evening, Mr Macron said Paris would send Mirage 2000 fighter jets to Ukraine and train Ukrainian pilots. He said training could begin this summer.\n\"You need normally between five, six months. So by the end of the year there will be pilots. The pilots will be trained in France,\" he said.\nMr Macron also said Western allies would consider a request to send military instructors to train Ukrainian forces on the ground.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the French president's comments showed that he was willing to take a \"direct\" role in the Ukraine conflict.\nFriday's developments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow could arm countries with a view to attacking Western targets.\nMr Putin made the statement while criticising the West's delivery of long-range weapons to Ukraine. He did not specify which countries Moscow could supply with weapons.\nSeveral countries including the US have given Ukraine the green light to strike targets inside Russia.\nMr Biden has given Ukraine permission to use American-supplied weapons to strike targets in Russia, but only near the Kharkiv region. The White House has said Ukraine cannot use long-range ATACMS missiles on Russian soil.",
    "Deputies from the States of Guernsey have had a broadly positive reaction to meetings with Aurigny to discuss the airline's recent problems.\nThe States-owned airline has held a series of meetings this week with politicians to help them understand the issues and the plan to improve the situation.\nDeputy Peter Roffey, president of the States Trading Supervisory Board (STSB), felt \"the worst is behind\" the airline now it had all three of the ATR planes it owns back on the Island.\nHe said Aurigny was leasing two more ATRs soon which would mean it would have \"a program that requires four planes\" and \"one spare plane or 20%, which I think is a relatively good degree of resilience\".\nMr Roffey said the current situation was \"suboptimal\" but he had been \"very impressed\" with the airline's management.\nHe said that some deputies had become \"disproportionately agitated\" by the airline's recent problems and has seen it as \"a way of scoring points\".\nMr Roffey said that a minority of deputies who had criticised the airline's decision to sell their jet earlier this year were \"completely ill informed\".\nHe said the ATRs were more economic and sustainable and the decision to sell the jet was \"completely the right thing to do\".\nDeputy John Gollop said the airline's management \"might acknowledge that communication could be better\" but the airline had had a \"good couple of years\" with their performance \"generally above industry norms\" and had been \"a very good news story\" until recent months.  \nDeputy Chris Le Tissier said he was \"overall happy\" with the airline's response and wanted to give the \"benefit of the doubt to management\", but warned that \"if it carries on towards the end of the year something will have to be done\".\nMr Le Tissier raised some concerns relating to Blue Islands, the other main airline to fly in and out of Guernsey.\nHe said Aurigny was \"unfairly getting the blame\" when flights which are shared with Blue Islands get cancelled.\nMr Le Tissier planned to raise concerns about the use of Blue Islands aircraft on medical flights with the president of Health and Social Care (HSC), an issue he said was new to him.\nHe said: \"Apparently, HSC only use Blue Island when they send patients to Southampton, which seems a bit of a strange situation when the States of Guernsey, the people of Guernsey own Aurigny.

    "The biggest order 17-year-old Michaela says she ever made on Shein was for \u00a3150, when she bought \"16 plus items\".\nLike millions of others, she's a huge fan of the ultra-fast fashion giant, mostly because of how affordable it is. \nShe also likes the way the influencers on YouTube she watches offer Shein discount codes, which makes her \"buy more\".\nOver the last decade, Shein has gone from a little-known brand among older shoppers to one of the biggest fast fashion retailers globally.\nThe Chinese-founded firm - which also sells a huge range of beauty and home products - doubled its profits to more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) last year, making more than the Swedish fashion group H&M and the UK\u2019s Primark and Next.\nToday, it ships to customers in 150 countries across the world.\nHowever, as the company explores a plan to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange, it remains dogged by controversy over its environmental impact and working practices - including allegations of forced labour in its supply chain. \nMichaela is aware of the backlash and particularly concerned by the amount of plastic Shein uses in its packaging. \nBut she feels most fashion brands face similar criticism and that \"not everyone can afford high-end clothing\".\n\"So at the back of my mind I feel quite bad when I purchase things, but at the same time it\u2019s convenient,\" she tells the BBC.\nShein, pronounced \"she-in\", was set up in China in 2008 by entrepreneur Xu Yangtian and started out selling wedding dresses online.\nSince then it has grown into a global behemoth, best known for selling on-trend clothing, mostly to a Gen Z customer base.\nA big part of the appeal? The price. \nThe average cost of a Shein-branded clothing item is just \u00a37.90 and at any one time, it has as many as 600,000 items for sale on its online platform, dwarfing rivals like Zara or Boohoo.\nIt's also snapped up competitors like Missguided, while Xu Yangtian, who rarely gives interviews, is now said to be one of China's richest men.  \nThe real turning point for the brand came during the pandemic, when online shopping took off and Shein's sales soared, says Louise D\u00e9glise-Favre from analysts GlobalData.\nThe firm has also made smart use of social media, recruiting popular influencers and university students to promote its clothing on TikTok and Instagram.\n\"The brand\u2019s success coincided with a boom in TikTok usage in Europe and the US,\" says Ms D\u00e9glise-Favre. \"The Chinese social media platform participated greatly in spreading awareness about the Shein\u2019s ultra-affordable proposition.\" \nIt has drawn in shoppers by getting pop stars like Rita Ora and Katy Perry to perform at its virtual concerts, but it also attracts a vast amount of organic user-generated content.\nYou might well have scrolled past so-called \"haul\" videos of young women emptying out their newly-arrived packages and giving their frank reviews of crop tops, dresses or beauty blenders from the site.\nShein's business model is similar to Amazon's, in that it partners with thousands of third-party suppliers - many of them in China, Brazil and Turkey - to manufacture its clothes and then ships them from giant, centralised warehouses.  \nIt has also sped up the \"test and repeat\" model made famous by other fast fashion giants including H&M and Zara owner Inditex. \nThis sees Shein suppliers produce items in small numbers, of between 100-200 pieces, and then produce more of any style that is a hit.\nThe brand can turn around a new item in just 25 days - something that would take other retailers months. \nIt also uses \"gamification\" strategies to boost customer engagement on its shopping app which is used by millions of people worldwide.\nUsers get points and discounts for logging in daily, sharing purchases on social media and referring friends.\n\"That encourages users to repeat such behaviours to earn more rewards and, as a result, they keep coming back, engaging with the app, and making purchases,\" says Vilma Todri, an associate professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School in the US.   \nBut the criticism Shein has faced over its operating practices has been hard to shake off.\nAnd those concerns are back in the spotlight as the Chinese firm explores listing its shares in London in a public offering that could value it at a reported $50bn.  \nThere are worries about the environmental impact of mass producing low-cost clothes, and the waste it creates.  \nLast year, a group of US lawmakers also called for Shein to be investigated over claims that Uyghur forced labour in China is used to make some of the clothes it sells.\n\"We have zero tolerance for forced labour,\" Shein told the BBC at the time.\nThe firm has promised to investigate such issues and says it strictly enforces a code of conduct, which all of its suppliers must sign up to.\nIt has also launched a resale platform for shoppers in the US and France to boost its green credentials, while it says producing clothes in smaller batches means very little material goes to waste.\nBu",
    "\u201cThe far right is on the march\u201d is something you often hear said across Europe right now. \u201cThis feels like Europe of the 1930s.\u201d\nSo perhaps it is no surprise that with 350 million people across the European Union currently voting for their direct representatives in the European Parliament, there\u2019s nail-biting by many a Eurocrat in Brussels. But are fears - and media headlines - exaggerated?\nMillennials and first-time Gen Z voters are among those predicted to pull rightwards. Figures gathered recently for the Financial Times newspaper suggest around a third of young French voters and Dutch under-25s, and 22% of young German voters, favour their country\u2019s far right. This is a significant increase since the last European Parliament election in 2019.\nFar-right parties are predicted to take up to a quarter of the total seats, and if they do win big, the optics will be clear. But the granular detail of what impact it could have on life and policy-making in the EU is more nuanced. \nAnd that is because the nationalist right itself is nuanced - different nationalist right politicians in different countries hold different positions. Some have toned down former far-rightist rhetoric to try to widen their appeal to voters.\nSo, what might change in Europe if the European Parliament swings to the right?\nThe EU has long nursed a huge ambition - to be ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to the environment. But Europe\u2019s voters are increasingly concerned about the cost of a green transition.\nTake the recent mass farmers\u2019 protests. Tractors from all over the EU descended on Brussels and the European Parliament, bringing them to a standstill. The protesters said EU and national environmental laws and bureaucracy were putting them out of business.\nNationalist-right parties in France, the Netherlands and Poland jumped on this bandwagon, spotting an opportunity to pitch their claim to be representatives of \u201cordinary people\u201d against EU and national \u201cout-of-touch elites\u201d.\nThe result? The EU rolled back or rescinded several key environmental rules, including stricter regulations on the use of pesticides.\nEnvironmentalists worry the EU has now avoided specifying how farmers should contribute to its vision of slashing 90% of emissions by 2040. They believe a shift rightwards in the European Parliament could mean more watering down or endless delaying of green objectives.\nMost European voters say they don\u2019t want to leave the EU, though they have plenty of gripes about how it works. Instead, right-wing nationalist parties are promising a different EU - more power for nation states, less \u201cBrussels interference\u201d in everyday life.\nIf their voice gets louder in the European Parliament, it could make it harder for the European Commission to take on more competencies from national governments, like health policy.\nYou\u2019d think this would be an obvious one, and that a swing to the right in the EP would lead to tougher EU legislation on migration. \nTake far-right leader in the Netherlands, Geert Wilders. His PVV party became the largest group in the Dutch parliament this autumn after national elections. He\u2019s promised \u201cthe toughest migration law of all time\u201d, and exit polls suggest the PVV will do well in this election.\nBut it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that EU migration and asylum policy has already long been nicknamed Fortress Europe. A huge priority is to keep people out. There\u2019s been a flurry of economic deals with non-EU countries like Tunisia, Morocco, Libya and Turkey to crack down on people-smugglers sending over economic migrants or asylum-seekers.\nWhat a bigger grouping of the hard-right in the European Parliament could change, though, are so-called solidarity policies. \nEU countries are each supposed to take a quota of asylum seekers, or at least pay significant contributions, to help fellow EU members like Italy and Greece, where most migrants land by people smuggler\u2019s boat. But nationalist-right MEPs may refuse to play ball, as we\u2019ve already seen with populist nationalist governments in Hungary and, until recently, in Poland.\nRussia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has prompted leaders across the EU to talk about making their \u201cneighbourhood\u201d more secure.\nNot just by spending more on defence but by speeding up the process - or at least showing more concrete enthusiasm - for neighbouring countries to join the EU. I\u2019m talking here about Ukraine, Georgia and western Balkan nations like Kosovo and Serbia, the latter being of great concern to Europeans because of its closeness to Moscow.\nBut the nationalist right is generally less than keen. They fear the costs of enlargement. A bigger EU, with more poorer countries in it, would likely need a bigger budget, with chunkier contributions from comparatively richer member states.\nIt would also mean members of the bloc who\u2019ve received considerable EU subsidies like Romania, Poland and also French farmers (still the biggest single beneficiary of the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy) would pro",
    "Amanda Knox said she is \"tired\" and feels \"victim blamed\" after a Florence court re-convicted her for slander in a case connected to the 2007 murder of her British roommate. \nThe verdict on Wednesday comes years after Ms Knox was acquitted of killing Meredith Kercher. Ms Knox and Ms Kercher were both exchange students living in Perugia. \nOn Thursday, she called the re-conviction for slander a \"huge step backwards\" on her podcast, Labyrinths with Amanda Knox. \n\u201cI'm feeling very determined to keep fighting this. I\u2019m feeling confused by this outcome because I thought this was a very straightforward proceeding,\" she said.\nKnox, 36, will not go to prison because she previously served four years for the murder, for which she was convicted originally. \nDuring the murder case, Ms Knox was convicted of slander for blaming the murder during police interrogation on local bar owner Patrick Lumumba.\nMr Lumumba was arrested in connection with the murder. He spent two weeks behind bars, but was later released without charge after a customer gave him an alibi.\nMs Knox's conviction on the slander charge was quashed last year and a retrial ordered.\nThe hearing this week was held behind closed doors, and audio and video recording was prohibited.\nMs Knox claims she was \"psychologically tortured\" by police and did not \"knowingly or wittingly\" accuse an innocent man of Kercher's murder. She says she attempted to recant to police, but they wouldn't listen.\n\u201cI really thought that this trial would bring that fact into focus because it\u2019s been greatly overlooked,\" she said during the podcast. \nMs Knox, now a criminal justice reform advocate, described feeling \"victim blamed\" and \"tired\" on the podcast. \n\u201cI\u2019m just sitting here 17 years later with an open wound that I thought was going to be healed this time around,\" she said.\nKnox's lawyers also have said they expect to appeal against the latest verdict.\n\"If the right thing happens, I will be acquitted of this. It\u2019s just going to take more time now,\" she said, adding that she plans to fight. \n\u201cWhat is happening to me is wrong. It\u2019s been wrong from the very start.

Nine of those callers needed to be treated at a hospital.\nReporting the reading of 113F (45C) at Sky Harbour, the NWS's Phoenix office said this exceeded the previous high for 6 June that was set in 2016.\nPhoenix is America's hottest big city, and there were 645 heat-related deaths last year in the wider Maricopa County.\nFirefighters have been put on standby to submerge heat-stroke victims in ice. Some popular local hiking trails have been closed off.\nThe group of 11 Trump rally attendees were later released from hospital, the Associated Press reported.\nIn preparation for a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, where temperatures are expected to reach 104F, the Trump campaign told CNN they planned to double the number of EMS staff on site, provide more than 38,000 bottles of water and a cooling tent with air conditioning. \nThe Southwest's first heatwave of the year is the result of a heat dome: an area of high pressure in which hot air is pushed down and trapped, causing temperatures to soar over large areas.\nTemperatures are about 20-30F above average for this time of year.\nWhile heat domes were once described as rare, they are becoming more common and intense because of human-induced climate change, scientists say.\nThe European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service announced on Wednesday that the world has surpassed one full year of back-to-back monthly heat records. \nThe climate change service also found that May marked the 11th consecutive month that the global average temperature was at least 1.5C above the pre-industrial average of the late 1800s, which references a period before there was a significant increase in emissions of greenhouse gases. \nScientists say the high temperatures were driven by human-caused climate change combined with the El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon.\n\"We are living in unprecedented times,\" Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus, said earlier this week.",
    "A Scottish woman who allegedly inspired the stalker character Martha in hit Netflix drama Baby Reindeer is suing the streamer for defamation, negligence and privacy violations.\nFiona Harvey - who has identified herself as the woman on whom Martha is based - argued in a lawsuit that Netflix told \"brutal lies\" about her to over 50 million viewers around the world.\nThe lawsuit, filed in a California court, seeks over $170m (\u00a3132m) in damages for Ms Harvey. She claims the Baby Reindeer series falsely depicted her as a convicted criminal who spent time in prison for stalking. \nNetflix has vowed to \"defend this matter vigorously\".\nIt said it would stand by the right of the show's creator and star, Scottish comedian Richard Gadd, to \"tell his story\".\nMr Gadd wrote the series about his alleged experience of being stalked by a woman he met at the pub where he worked. He has previously appealed to fans to refrain from trying to identify Martha, a character who he first described in a stand-up comedy routine.\nHe is not named as a defendant in Ms Harvey's lawsuit.\nThe first episode of the hit mini-series claims that \"this is a true story\". The show's end credits say that the programme \"is based on real events: however certain characters, names, incidents, locations, and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes\u201d.\nNeither Mr Gadd nor Ms Harvey's real names are used in the series, and neither Netflix or Mr Gadd have confirmed that Martha was based on Ms Harvey.\nWhile giving evidence before the Culture Media and Sport Committee in Parliament last month, Netflix executive Benjamin King said the show was \"obviously a true story of the horrific abuse that the writer and protagonist Richard Gadd suffered at the hands of a convicted stalker\".\nMr King was subsequently challenged by an MP - the SNP's John Nicolson - to substantiate his statements. Mr Nicolson said \"journalists can find no evidence to back up the Netflix claim\" of a conviction for the woman identified as the inspiration for Martha.\nFor her part, Ms Harvey alleges in her case that Netflix \"did literally nothing\" to confirm that Mr Gadd's story was true.\nMs Harvey also denies that she sexually assaulted the show's creator, according to the court documents, which allege that Netflix \u201ctold these lies, and never stopped, because it was a better story than the truth, and better stories made money\u201d.\nIn one scene in the series, the Martha character is depicted as sexually assaulting the show's protagonist along a canal one night.\nMs Harvey told BBC News on Thursday that she was certain her team would win the case. \"Otherwise, we wouldn't be doing it,\" she said.\nRichard Roth, a New York-based lawyer representing Ms Harvey, told the BBC there was \"no doubt\" that Ms Harvey's identity was used for Baby Reindeer's plot.\nHe said he had \"incontrovertible documentary evidence\u201d proving that his client had never been convicted of a crime.\nThe lawsuit includes a photo of a background check and a certificate that claims that Ms Harvey has no criminal convictions on her record. \nMs Harvey, who lives in the UK, says that since the series was released in April she has received numerous death threats.\nThe experience has left her \"fearful of leaving her home or checking the news\", the lawsuits says, adding that she has \"become extremely secluded and isolated, in fear of the public, going days without leaving her home\".\nIn a nearly hour-long interview with Piers Morgan last month, Ms Harvey confirmed that she had known Mr Gadd during his time working at a pub in London.\nBut she denied that she had acted like the character Martha, who sends Mr Gadd's character 41,000 emails and leaves 350 hours of voicemail messages in the show. \n\"None of that's true. I don't think I sent him anything,\" she said.\n\"No, I think there may have been a couple of emails exchanged, but that was it. Just jokey banter emails.\"\nThe lawsuit does say, however, that some real comments she made to Mr Gadd -  such as a tweet she sent him in 2014 - are used in the show's dialogue.",
    "A wartime museum has been set up dedicated to telling the stories of American World War Two heroes who were based in Norfolk.\nThe museum, located at the back of the Wartime and Vintage store in Swaffham, opened earlier this year.\nOwner James Clarey has collected a variety of artefacts, uniforms and other items that belonged to servicemen for display.\nHe said: \"It's a homage to those men who fought in World War Two, and this is their story.\"\nMr Clarey added: \"It's important to remember their endeavours, sacrifices and these individuals who gave so much for our freedom.\"\nHe said it was \"a lifetime's mission of gathering artefacts to tell these men's stories\".\nThe displays include flight jackets, uniforms and medals, some found in auctions and others donated by relatives of airmen.\n\"It's all out there, you've just got to try and find it,\" explained Mr Clarey.\nHe grew up next to a wartime airfield in Beeston and would walk past a memorial on his way to school, where his curiosity was sparked.\n\"I would wonder who these guys were and what men from America were doing based here.\n\"These were the questions that I asked and as I grew older, I started to read and learn more about them. The result is this museum.\"\nMr Clarey also runs two other museums - The 43rd Bomb Group and The 8th Air Force Heritage gallery, both at the airfield in Old Buckingham.\nHe called this museum \"an extension of the others\", with this one being primarily based on the 2nd air division that had close ties to Norfolk during World War Two.\nA core memory for Mr Clarey was when he found an identity bracelet of a crew member at the crash site of a B17 bomber.\nThe serviceman was killed in the crash and after research, Mr Clarey managed to successfully return it to his mother in Washington in 1995.\n\"This is the catalyst of what I'm doing now. It was the research journey that really got me into the history of what these guys did.\n\"As a boy it fascinated me and it still does now, telling their story so other people can understand too,\" he said.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Mariupol was doomed. Relentless Russian bombing had turned streets into ruins and courtyards into graveyards.\nBut several metres underground in the south-eastern Ukrainian city, a romance was blooming.\nValeria Subotina, 33, had been sheltering in the enormous Azovstal steelworks, the final stronghold in the city, as it was surrounded by Russian forces in spring 2022.\nShe had taken cover in one of dozens of Soviet-era bomb shelters built to withstand nuclear war, deep beneath the industrial plant.\n\u201cYou go down a semi-collapsed staircase, move through passages and tunnels, and go further and further down. Finally, you reach this concrete cube, a room,\u201d Valeria says.\nIn the bunker - alongside soldiers and civilians - Valeria was working with the army's Azov brigade as a press officer, communicating the horrors of Russia's months-long siege to global media.\nThere, too, was her fianc\u00e9 Andriy Subotin, a 34-year-old Ukrainian army officer, defending the plant.\nThe pair had found each other through work - Mariupol\u2019s Border Guard Agency - around three years before the siege.\nWhen Andriy met Valeria, it was love at first sight.\n\"He was special, it felt so warm to be around him,\" Valeria says. \"He was always kind and never refused to help anyone.\u201d\nAndriy was an optimist, she says. He knew how to be happy and found joy in small things: sunny weather, smiles, friends' company.\n\u201cOn the first day we met, I realised Andriy was very different to others.\u201d\nWithin three months, they had moved in together, renting a small one-storey house in Mariupol with a garden. The couple started building a life together.\n\u201cWe travelled a lot, went to the mountains, met friends,\u201d Valeria says.\n\u201cWe fished together and spent lots of time outdoors. We visited theatres, concerts and exhibitions. Life was full.\u201d\nThey decided to get married and dreamed of a big church wedding with family and friends. They picked wedding rings.\nValeria quit her job and began to nurture her creative side, writing and publishing poems about the earlier years of fierce fighting with Russia in Mariupol.\n\"For a couple of years before the full-scale invasion, I was truly happy,\" she recalls.\nEverything changed in February 2022.\nSpring had brought the sun to Valeria and Andriy\u2019s garden, and the first flowers were appearing.\n\"I was starting to enjoy spring,\u201d says Valeria. \u201cWe knew about Putin's threats and realised there would be a war, but I didn't want to think about it.\u201c\nA few days before 24 February, the day the full-scale invasion began, Andriy urged Valeria to leave the city. She refused.\n\"I knew that no matter what happened, I had to be in Mariupol, I had to defend my city.\u201d\nWeeks later, they were both underground, in the Azovstal bunkers.\nThey only got to see each other occasionally, but when they did those were moments of \u201cpure happiness\u201d.\nAt this point, Mariupol was nearing a humanitarian catastrophe.\nStrikes to infrastructure had cut water and power supplies to parts of the city, and there were food shortages. Civilian homes and buildings, too, had been destroyed.\nOn 15 April, a large bomb was dropped on the plant. Valeria narrowly escaped death.\n\u201cI was found among dead bodies, the only one alive. On the one hand, a miracle, but on the other, a terrible tragedy.\u201d\nShe had to spend eight days in an underground hospital in the plant with severe concussion.\n\u201cThe smell of blood and rot was everywhere,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt was a very scary place where our wounded comrades, with amputated limbs, were lying everywhere. They couldn't get proper help because there were very few medical supplies.\u201d\nAndriy was deeply worried for Valeria after her injury and started planning a wedding right there, in the bunker.\n\"It felt like he was in a hurry, like we wouldn't have any more time,\" says Valeria.\n\u201cHe made a couple of wedding rings out of tin foil with his own hands, and asked me to marry him. Of course, I said yes.\n\u201cHe was the love of my life. And our rings made of tin foil - they were perfect.\u201d\nOn 5 May, the couple were married by a commander stationed at the plant. They had a ceremony in the bunker, wearing their uniforms as wedding attire.\nAndriy promised his wife that they would have a proper wedding when they returned home, with real rings and a white dress.\nTwo days later, on 7 May, he was killed in action at the steel plant, by Russian shelling.\nValeria didn\u2019t find out about it straight away.\n\u201cPeople often say you feel something inside when a loved one dies. But I, on the contrary, was in a good mood. I was married and in love.\"\nOne of the hardest things was having to hold in a \u201clump of grief\u201d, as she was defending her city alongside \u201cher boys\u201d - comrades - at Azovstal.\n\u201cI was a bride, I was a wife, and now I am a widow. The scariest word,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI could not react the way I wanted to at that moment.\n\u201cMy boys were always around. They sat next to me, they slept next to me, they brought me food and supported me,\u201d she says. \u201cI could only cry when they weren\u2019t watching.\u201d\nAt o",
    "The daughter of Hunter Biden has told jurors that her father seemed \"great\" and \"hopeful\" around the time he purchased a gun in October 2018. \nNaomi Biden, 30, gave surprise testimony in court in her father's gun trial after she was called to the witness stand by his defence team.\nShe said she did not see her father use drugs at any point in 2018, and that he was living with a sober coach late that year.\nThe US president\u2019s son is accused of lying about his drug use on a form when purchasing the firearm and ammunition from a Wilmington, Delaware, gun shop on 12 October 2018.\nMr Biden, 54, has pleaded not guilty to the charges, with his defence team saying he was in recovery at the time and therefore did not lie on the paperwork.\nIt is the first trial for the son of a sitting US president. Mr Biden could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted.\nProsecutors wrapped up their case early on Friday after calling their remaining two witnesses. \nOne of them, FBI forensic chemist Jason Brewer, testified that a \u201cminimal\u201d amount of cocaine was found in a leather pouch that contained Mr Biden\u2019s firearm.\nBut he said he could not say for sure how the cocaine got there, or who it belonged to.\nMr Biden's defence team then began calling their own witnesses, starting with Jason Turner, who worked at the gun shop where Mr Biden purchased the firearm, and Ron Palmieri, the owner of the shop. \nTheir testimony featured a combative exchange with Mr Turner, who told Mr Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, that he did not understand \"what gun shop life is like\". \nNaomi Biden was then called to the stand - a surprise move that prosecutors acknowledged they were unaware of ahead of time.\nSpeaking in mostly simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answers, she said she first became aware of her father's drug use after the death of her uncle, Beau, from cancer in 2015.\n\"After my uncle died, things got bad,\" she said.\nShe recalled having gone to Los Angeles while he was living with a sober coach in late 2018, saying that she \"told him I was so proud of him\". \n\"He seemed great, he seemed hopeful,\" she said of another encounter she had with him in New York City in late October 2018. \nDuring cross-examination from prosecutors, she said that she did not see him at any point use drugs that year, but she admitted she would not know what he would look like under the influence.\nIn that same October 2018 timeframe, she testified that she had borrowed her father's vehicle to help her move, saying it was in \"good condition\" and did not have much in it.\nProsecutors asked her about a 17 October text message she received from her father, sent at 02:00 that day, asking where the keys to his truck were and whether he could get it back. \n\"Right now?\" she responded, and later said: \"I'm sorry dad, I really can't take this.\" \nShe testified that she did not know why her father needed the car at that time, but that he \"still seemed good\". \nHer testimony stands in contrast to that of Hallie Biden - Hunter Biden's ex-girlfriend and the widow of his late brother, Beau - who got rid of the gun 11 days after Mr Biden purchased it. \nHallie Biden told the court on Thursday that she discovered Mr Biden's gun in his truck amid clothes and clutter, including drug paraphernalia. \nShe said she \"panicked\" when she found it. She then stuffed it in the leather pouch, wrapped it in a small purple gift bag and disposed of it in a rubbish bin at a local grocery store. \n\u201cAre you insane?\u201d he texted, telling her to go back to Janssen\u2019s Market and retrieve the weapon.\nIt was later found by a man who was rummaging through the refuse for recyclables.\nMs Biden said that she, too, fell into drug addiction after she was introduced to crack cocaine by Mr Biden during their relationship, which began after Beau Biden\u2019s death in 2015, but that she quit using in August 2018.\nAt court on Friday were US First Lady Jill Biden, along with Mr Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden, who has attended the trial every day so far.\nAlso there were Valerie Biden and James Biden - the siblings of President Joe Biden.\nPresident Biden has continued with his public duties. On Friday, he gave a speech in France on democracy after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nIn an interview with ABC News, Mr Biden said he would accept the outcome of his son's trial and wouldn't pardon him if he were convicted.\nAs the trial got under way this week, Joe Biden said he would not comment as president, but that as a father he felt \"boundless love\" for his son.\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4m (\u00a31.1m) in taxes.",

    "The board of Howard University, a historically-black university in Washington DC, has moved to strip Sean \"Diddy\" Combs of his honourary degree \nThe announcement comes after CNN published a CCTV video of the hip-hop producer hitting an ex-girlfriend in a hotel hallway.  \nIn a statement on Friday, the university said his \"behavior as captured in a recently released video is so fundamentally incompatible with Howard University\u2019s core values and beliefs that he is deemed no longer worthy to hold the institution\u2019s highest honor.\"\nThe rapper apologised after the video was released last month for the attack on singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura.\n\"I was disgusted when I did it. I'm disgusted now,\" Mr Combs said in his statement.\n\"I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I\u2019m so sorry.\"\nHoward University conferred the degree on Mr Combs in 2014. It said in its statement that it would also end a scholarship in his name and terminate a 2016 \"gift agreement\" with the rapper. \nThat agreement was a $1m (\u00a3785,000) donation that he made through his foundation.\nThe Sean Combs Foundation did not respond to a request for comment. \nThe university's statement said Mr Combs' name would be removed from all documents listing honourary degree recipients.\n\"The University is unwavering in its opposition to all acts of interpersonal violence,\" the statement said. \nFour women, including his former long-time partner Ms Ventura, have filed lawsuits against the musician, accusing him of sexual and physical abuse.\nMs Ventura's lawsuit was settled in November, and Mr Combs has denied all sexual assault allegations. \nIn a statement issued last December, Mr Combs defended himself against what he described as \"sickening allegations\" made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\n\"Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged,\" he said, adding he would fight to clear his name.\nIn March, federal agents raided two houses owned by the star \"as part of an ongoing investigation\" into sex trafficking.\nHis lawyer called the action an \"unprecedented ambush\" and a \"gross overuse of military-level force\", and maintained his client's innocence.",
    "Two people were arrested in California as part of a suspected Lego theft ring after police found more than 2,800 stolen sets. \nPolice said Friday they found boxes of Lego stacked to the ceiling inside a man's home in Long Beach, just south of Los Angeles. \nThe toys ranged in price from $20 to over $1,000 (\u00a316 to over \u00a3786).\nRichard Siegel, 71, and Blanca Gudino, 39, were arrested in connection with a series of organised retail thefts that stem back several months, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. \nAuthorities started investigating in December after a store reported a series of thefts. The store's loss prevention personnel identified Gudino as a suspect, police said. \nOfficers said they observed Ms Gudino taking items from the same retailer in multiple areas this week, then give Mr Siegel the sets at his Long Beach home. \nDetectives searched the home Wednesday and found more than 2,800 boxes of Lego. While officers searched, police said potential buyers of the toys arrived at the home \"lured by advertisements placed by Siegel on internet sales sites\".\nIt was not clear whether Mr Siegel and Ms Gudino had lawyers.\nPhotos from the investigation show Lego sets meticulously organised in a home, with the boxes covering artwork on the walls and a fireplace. \nThe Lego included popular sets from the Star Wars franchise like the Millennium Falcon, which go for nearly $850 online (\u00a3668), and R2-D2, which are priced from $100 to $200 online (\u00a379 to \u00a3157). There were also sets from the Lord of the Rings and Back to the Future franchises. \nSiegel faces a charge of organized retail theft and Gudino is facing a charge of grand theft. \nExpensive Lego sets have become a popular target for thieves, especially as the sets have expanded from a child's toy to a popular hobby for adults. \nThefts have been chronicled by local media in places like Philadelphia, Las Vegas and Florida. \nIn April, four suspects were arrested after authorities found about $300,000 in stolen Lego merchandise, according to the California Highway Patrol. The suspects are accused of stealing Lego sets for cars, motorcycles, Star Wars items and Minecraft products to resell them. \nAlso in southern California this year, more than $100,000 worth of Lego was stolen from retailer Bricks & Minifigs, a speciality store that sells new and used Lego, according to BBC news partner CBS News.

    "Charging in with a leather ball in his hand, about to create cricket history, was a software engineer on leave from his day job.\nSeconds later, Saurabh Netravalkar\u2019s arms were raised to the sky in the steaming hot Texas sun.\nThe tall left-arm pace bowler had secured a historic win for Team USA, leading the 18th ranked underdogs to an overtime victory (called a super over in this shortened version of the sport) over Pakistan in the T20 World Cup on Thursday.\nWhen the Indian expat came to America in 2015 to study a masters in computer engineering at the prestigious Cornell University, he didn\u2019t even pack his cricket shoes.\nTeam USA is made up of characters like Netravalkar, whose LinkedIn account currently says \u201cprincipal member of technical staff at Oracle, professional cricketer\u201d.\nHis team-mate Nosthush Kenjige performed 800 hours of community service just so he could be eligible to play for the US.\nAnd now they are local heroes and Team USA is perched at the top of its World Cup group, ahead of tournament favourites India and sixth-ranked Pakistan.\nFor USA Cricket team manager Kerk Higgins, this is the first phase of what he thinks will be a deep push in the World Cup co-hosted by the US and the West Indies. His goal is to get out of the group stage and into the Super 8s.\nSpeaking to the BBC just minutes after the historic game, Higgins said the massive win was still sinking in and that the \u201cenergy is very high\u201d.\n\u201cI always said that we could beat a top nation. I saw the way the boys are playing over the last month or so. This is not really surprising to me,\u201d he said.\nMost Americans were oblivious to the magnitude of their team's victory, unaware there was even a cricket World Cup going on in their country. \nUS player Aaron Jones told the BBC the \u201creally big\u201d win would \u201copen the eyes\u201d of Americans not following the sport.\nAnd that\u2019s the hope for the International Cricket Council (ICC) as it tries to get a foothold in the world\u2019s biggest sports market, where fans are more accustomed to Super Bowls than super overs.\nSchool teacher Ricky Kissoon, who helps run the New York Big Apple Cricket league, said the US win over Pakistan was a \u201cbig deal\u201d for helping the next generation fall in love with the sport. \n\u201cI saw that there are a lot of young players that are coming through the school system, and after the school cricket is over, they don\u2019t have an opportunity to play,\u201d he told the BBC.\nThe league has nine teams, up from eight last season.\n\u201cA lot of the kids out there, they\u2019re excited, especially with the World Cup on right now,\u201d he said.\nMr Kissoon says cricket is slowly growing in New York, particularly in the \u201cmelting pot\u201d of ex-pat communities who miss playing their favourite sport.\n\u201cIt\u2019s growing, you may not see a lot of mainstream Americans, but they\u2019re trickling in. And that\u2019s a win,\u201d he said.\nBut the battle for the hearts (and wallets) of Americans can\u2019t be compared to the impact the football World Cup held in the US in 1994 had on soccer in the country.\nFans on social media have complained that cricket world cup matches in the US are not shown on mainstream broadcasters. And the big match-ups like India v Pakistan in New York this weekend are played in the morning (making it prime time evening TV in India).\nThese two arch-rivals rarely play each other because of diplomatic tensions. But when they do, it's a blockbuster match-up. \nThe 2011 World Cup semi-final was watched by more than 400 million people. To compare, the most recent Super Bowl had a global television audience of around 250 million.\nAli Zar, who owns Zar Sports - one of only a handful of cricket stores in New York - says the India-Pakistan match being played at the new Nassau County International Cricket Stadium outside of New York City on Sunday is the one people are waiting for.\n\u201cThere is no rivalry that you can explain India versus Pakistan. This is its own class. This is on a different level,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say Pakistan wins and India loses, everybody\u2019s gonna break their TVs. If India wins, Pakistan loses, in their countries people are gonna be very upset for a couple of days. And they\u2019re going to start breaking their TVs.\u201d\n\nOn the ticket resale market, the cheapest tickets for the Sunday game are about $830 each. On the ICC website, the cheapest available ticket costs $2,500.\nMr Zar thinks having these iconic World Cup matches played in America will \u201cplant the seed\u201d for future generations.\n\u201cA lot of Americans are walking in (to his pop-up merchandise store) and they\u2019re asking questions about the sport. They know there is a world cup going on, so they ask us a question \u2013 what is cricket?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI was born in Pakistan so I know about this sport. My kids are born here, other kids are born here. They are starting to ask questions about this sport\u2026 They are interested.\u201d",
    "Elliot Castro was 16 and selling mobile phones from a Glasgow call centre when he first conned someone out of their bank details.\nSoon he was enjoying a champagne lifestyle, that included first-class flights and luxury watches. \nThe teenager would go on to mastermind the theft of \u00a32.5m from an audacious series of scams before finally being brought to justice in a department store toilet in Edinburgh. \nCastro, who now works as a fraud prevention expert, shared his remarkable story in a new BBC Scotland documentary, Confessions of a Teenager Fraudster.\nIt chronicles his rapid rise from leaving school with no qualifications to spending $1,000 (\u00a3786) on a bottle of champagne for friends in a New York bar.\nCastro, now 42, recalls the first time he conned a customer after they called in with an order.\nInstead of putting the order through as normal he pretended there was a problem with the credit card and then proceeded to dupe them into thinking he had their bank on the line.\nSeconds later he had their details and a scam was born.\nHe recalled: \"I don't remember having that Eureka moment, if you like.\n\"It was just something that I did one time and I thought 'I wonder if I can do this?'\"\nCastro's spending was modest to begin with but, like his offending, it rapidly escalated.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings programme: \"That was the beginning of five years of absolute craziness from the time I was 16 up until 21, 22. \n\"The first time I ever got hold of a card it was CDs and haircuts and T-shirts at that point.\n\"There was no hint of how mental it would get later on.\"\nThe fraudster was born in Aberdeen in 1982 and attended eight different schools before he moved to Glasgow with his family in 1998.\nHe described himself as a dreamer and admitted lying on the application for his call centre job and said he was 18 instead of 16.\nCastro, who is half Chilean, said: \"I had it in my head that I would just have this amazing lifestyle.\"\nHis criminal career eventually bankrolled exclusive holidays, five-star hotels, lavish parties and limousines.\nDuring one trip to London in 1999 Castro bought a Gucci belt for \u00a3300 - which he said was more than he earned in a week in the call centre.\nThe Home Alone fan later splashed more than \u00a38,000 on a first-class flight to New York, where he stayed in the Plaza Hotel, which features in the celebrated movie.\nHis trip featured a three-day $15,000 (\u00a311,791) spending spree on the city's exclusive Fifth Avenue. \nCastro admitted: \"A general day in my life at that time was wake-up, go shopping, buy things, go drinking, go back to whatever hotel I was staying in that night, sleep, wake up the next day and repeat.\n\"But all of this time I had to be aware that I was possibly being followed or that someone would be looking to catch me.\"\nIn 2001 he enjoyed trips to Germany, France and Spain.\nThe following year he spent time in Ireland, where he stayed at The Clarence Hotel in Dublin and claimed he rubbed shoulders with U2 stars.\nCastro said: \"It's a hotel owned by Bono and the Edge and we had a conversation one night in the bar where I told them I was working for the Ministry of Defence or a hotel consultant.\"\nThe con man had several brushes with the law, dating back to 2001 when he spent four months in a young offenders' institute in Lancaster.\nMonths later he was arrested at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh and taken to Manchester, where he was sentenced to 18 months at HMP Hindley.\nDuring this time he got a job in the prison library and read up about the internet.\nThis research led him to use internet cafes on his release to make anonymous flight bookings with stolen credit cards.\nIn 2002 he was arrested in Toronto and jailed for 87 days before being deported in 2003.\nHis international crime spree eventually came to an end in the Harvey Nichols department store in Edinburgh the following year. \nCastro said: \"I was beginning to feel done with it, I'd started for the first time in my life to make friends.\n\"But the downside was I couldn't tell them who I really was.\n\"The situation became unbearable.  \n\"So I do wonder, was there a subconscious part of me that wanted to give it up?\"\nThat day he bought \u00a32,000 of vouchers with a card that wasn't in his name.\nThe receptionist called the card company, who approved the transaction.\nBut, acting on a hunch, she called them back.\nHe said: \"They got in touch with the real card holder who verified it was fraudulent and stupidly I came back to the shop less than an hour later and that's the moment it ended.\n\"I went to the toilet quickly and when I opened the cubicle door there was a plain clothes police officer there and that was the beginning of the end.\"\nThe following year at Isleworth Crown Court in Middlesex, Castro admitted fraud offences amounting to more than \u00a373,000 and was sentenced to two years.\nCastro admits he benefited from a lack of co-operation between law enforcement agencies and card companies.\nHe said: \"Through the five years, if they'd had bet",
    "The US judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush-money case in New York City has written a letter to prosecutors and the former president's defence team about a Facebook post in which a person claims to have known the jury's decision before it became public. \nJustice Juan Merchan's letter says that on Friday \"the court became aware of a comment\" on the court's Facebook page, \"now labeled as one week old\" from a user named \"Michael Anderson\".\n\"My cousin is a juror and says Trump is getting convicted,\" the post says, according to the judge. \"Thank you folks for all your hard work!!!\"\nBBC News has not verified the post, which has been deleted, or the claims allegedly made within it. \nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office and Todd Blanche, Trump's lead attorney, did not respond to requests for comment. \nJustice Merchan did not indicate whether the now-deleted post had been investigated or whether officials suspect any wrongdoing.\nLast week, Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsified business records. He is due to be sentenced on 11 July. \nJustice Merchan's letter did not specify when exactly the post was made, but he said it was written in response to a 29 May post about oral arguments made \"unrelated to this proceeding\".\nTrump was convicted on 30 May, one day before the court's post.\nAccording to US media, the post was made by a now-deleted account that regularly trolls the social media pages of the New York court system.\nBecause Trump has not been sentenced yet, his defence team could move for the verdict to be set aside temporarily while they investigate the matter. The could also call for a new trial if they can prove that jury misconduct affected the former president's rights.  \nTrump's team might also ask the judge to bring in each juror to question them, in an effort to establish whether any outside influence affected their verdict.\nJurors in the first-ever criminal case against a former US president were under strict orders from the judge not to discuss the case with any outside parties ahead of their verdict.

    "Hannah Debellotte and Charlie Gibbs are joking around as they make lunch in the shared kitchen of their supported-living flats.\nCharlie's on a day off from her job at a nursery, while Hannah has just started a course to become a nail technician. They've both come a long way since moving here in difficult circumstances.\nCharlie's mother died from cancer when Charlie was 18, her father having already died.\nWhen she first moved in she was given grief counselling and helped to get into a routine of cooking and cleaning.\n\"I didn't know how to look after myself, my mum had always done those things for me,\" says Charlie, who's now 22. \n\"If I didn\u2019t have this place, the worst-case scenario would\u2019ve happened because I didn\u2019t have any family. I would\u2019ve been homeless or worse. I was an adult in the eyes of the law but I was lost. I still needed that support.\u201d\nThe pair live in supported housing, a type of accommodation that enables vulnerable groups - including domestic abuse victims, homeless people or those with a learning disability - to live semi-independently.\nAt their small block in East London, 16-25-year-olds can cook together, play pool or garden on the allotment, while support workers help them develop life skills and apply for jobs or training. Some were brought up in care, while others may be young parents.\n\nHannah, now 20, had to leave home as a teenager to escape a difficult situation.\n\"I wouldn\u2019t know how to manage money properly or cook by myself. All the responsibility is now on me, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to fully be by myself if it wasn\u2019t for this place,\" she says.\n\"They help with trauma and they give you support through therapy.\"\nCharlie and Hannah both say they feel lucky to have found this place. Look Ahead -their supported-housing provider - has recently had to close similar services due to local authority funding pressures.\nIt is a situation echoed across the supported-housing sector, with nearly a third of providers polled saying they've had to close services in the past year. More than half cited funding as an issue.\nEmma Osei-Lah worked for some of Look Ahead's decommissioned youth services. She says young people were often shunted into B&Bs or hotels without any support.\n\"It's horrible because the young people don't know what's going to happen to them. [They're thinking]: 'Where am I going to go? How am I going to get the support that I need? How do I start my life journey without the help?' It's so important that we provide this.\"\n\nPolling by trade body the National Housing Federation (NHF) also found six in 10 supported-housing providers expected to close some services in the future.\nThe main reasons cited were funding restrictions or tough commissioning decisions for local authorities.\nThe trade body polled 124 supported-housing providers, responsible for more than two-thirds of the housing stock in the sector.\n\"Supported housing is facing a huge crisis at the moment,\" NHF chief executive Kate Henderson says.\n\"The key reason that services are at risk are huge pressures on local authority budgets combined with rocketing inflation.\n\"Without supported housing, people would experience homelessness, or maybe end up in residential care, in hospital or in an institution. That's bad for the taxpayer and it's bad for the individual.\"\nThe NHF is calling for the incoming government to reinstate ring-fenced funding for sheltered housing, so that councils don't have to find the money out of their existing budgets.\nIts analysis suggests there are 1,540 fewer supported homes today than there were in 2007, while the population has grown by 12%.\nEmma says the importance of supported housing \"cannot be underestimated\".\n\"One young person said to me, 'You're like the mum I never had', and that touches you. It's an adult figure, someone to go to and say: 'Hey, this happened' and you give them advice on things. It's their support system.\"",
    "Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has demanded an investigation into a stock market crash that hit investors at the end of the general election.\nHe accused top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders of making misleading predictions about stock prices surging after 4 June, the day the results were announced.\nMr Gandhi, from the Congress party, claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi encouraged people to buy stocks before this, which led to them losing money when the market crashed.\nMr Modi's party, the BJP, has denied the allegations.\nMr Gandhi has demanded that a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigate the alleged scam and the role of Mr Modi and senior ministers. \nHe alleged that weeks before election results, Mr Modi, ex-Home Minister Amit Shah, and former Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman advised people to \"buy stocks before 4 June\", suggesting that the market would surge after, anticipating a BJP victory.\nIn May, Mr Shah told NDTV news channel in an interview: \"Stock market crashes should not be linked with elections, but even if such a rumour has been spread, I suggest that you buy (shares) before 4 June. It will shoot up.\" \nMr Gandhi has labelled it \"the biggest scam\" in India's stock market history, alleging that the manipulation benefited certain \"dubious foreign investors\", causing Indians to lose trillions of rupees.\nMr Modi's departing trade minister, Piyush Goyal, has refuted the allegations, accusing Mr Gandhi of misleading investors.\nExit polls had predicted that the BJP would comfortably win a majority - securing more than 272 seats in the 543 member parliament - while together with its alliance partners, this figure would touch 360-370.\nHowever, the results were drastically different from these predictions, with the BJP failing to reach the halfway mark on its own and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) getting just 293 seats.\nMr Gandhi has now claimed that the exit polls were \"fake\" and that the BJP knew that it was not going to win more that 220 seats \"from its internal survey and the feedback from the intelligence agencies\".\n\"Despite that, the exit polls were made to show that the BJP was winning a large number of seats,\" Mr Gandhi alleged.\nThis, he alleged, led to massive buying of stocks on 3 June.\nWhen the results came out the next day, the Indian stock market saw one of its worst crashes in years, with investments worth billions of dollars being wiped out.\nThe BJP's Mr Goyal said that it was Indians who gained from the rise and fall in stock prices, since in April and May, when the market was on an upswing, foreign investors had sold shares which Indians had bought.\nAnd this happened again on 4 June, when the market crashed, he said.\n\"So foreigners bought at a high price and sold at a low price. Indian investors sold at a high price and bought at a low price. So in a way, Indian investors earned even in this period. No one suffered a loss,\" he said.\nOn Friday, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that Mr Goyal's explanation was \"rubbish\" and added that it did not answer specific questions raised by Mr Gandhi.\nThe BJP has not responded to Mr Ramesh's allegations.",
    "Hiring in the US surged unexpectedly last month, continuing to defy predictions of a slowdown while raising fresh questions about when interest rates will fall.\nEmployers added 272,000 jobs in May, the US Labor Department said, above expectations of 185,000 new roles.\nThe larger-than-expected gain emerged despite the highest borrowing costs in more than 20 years, which analysts have been expecting to weigh on the economy. \nThe US central bank has raised interest rates sharply since 2022 to fight inflation, which measures the pace of price rises. The Fed has cited the strength in employment as a sign that the economy can handle the current rates.\nThe latest job figures undermine other data suggesting signs of softening and will bolster the case that talk of cutting borrowing costs is premature, analysts said.\n\"Today's data suggests the Fed is going to have to sit tight and wait a while longer before that first cut can be considered,\" said Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, the investment management firm.\nHe added that the figures had the potential to take any move this year \"off the table\".\nThe European Central Bank and Bank of Canada announced rate cuts this week, part of a global shift to lower borrowing costs as the shock of inflation exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine starts to fade.\nBut in the US the Federal Reserve has said it wants more confidence that high borrowing costs are working to slow the economy and help ease pressures pushing up prices.\nInflation in the US has come down sharply since 2022, but progress appears to  have stalled in recent months. The most recent reading put inflation at 3.4% in April, compared with the Fed's 2% target.\nAnalysts said wage gains reported on Friday were likely to add to concerns that inflation may not return to the 2% target as quickly as hoped.  \nThe Labor Department said average hourly pay increased 0.4% from April to May, the pace picking up again after several months of slowing.\nOver the last 12 months, wages are up 4.1%, it said. Economists had expected a 3.9% increase.\nWhile good news for workers, analysts said the figures were likely to give the Fed pause as it debates whether to reduce borrowing costs. It is looking to balance getting inflation under control with the risk that leaving interest rates too high for too long could trigger a more severe slowdown in economic growth.\n\"This report means the Fed will leave interest rates at their current high level for a few more months yet,\" said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\nBut he said that he still expected some weakening in the coming months, noting that the jobless rate, which is calculated using a different survey from the jobs figures, ticked up to 4%, from 3.9% in April.\nMr Shepherdson said he expected the Fed to cut rates in September, and make even more aggressive reductions in the months after.\n\"When the labor market turns, the Fed will be quickly left looking excessively cautious and short-sighted,\" he said. \nHiring in the US has surprised analysts with its strength for more than a year.\nThe resilience, supported in part by government spending and a wave of immigration, has raised hopes that the world's largest economy might avoid a downturn that can follow on from relatively high borrowing costs.\nMore recently, some data had raised questions about whether cracks might be starting to appear. \nThe economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.3% in the first three months of the year, down sharply from the prior three months as growth in consumer spending eased. \nThough the hiring in recent months could ultimately prove weaker than currently estimated, the bigger-than-expected job gains in May will soothe fears that \"the bottom had suddenly dropped out of the economy,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics said. \n\"The Fed will remain focused on the upside risks to inflation rather than the downside risks to the real economy,\" he said.",
    "A council has voted to trap and kill moles that have been making molehills on a field because it believes they are a danger to public safety.\nThe parish councillors in Woodborough in Nottinghamshire have opted to use lethal \"scissor traps\" despite volunteers offering to flatten the molehills.\nThe RSPCA said these traps risk causing \"prolonged suffering\" because they do not always kill moles outright.\nChurch warden Ray Goddard is now leading a group called Mole Patrol, which he believes will solve the problem humanely.\nMr Goddard said: \"Well I think the council are making a mountain out of a molehill, and I just wish that they would work with us.\n\"I want to work with the council and come to a humane solution, instead of having this dreadful killing.\"\nMr Goddard said he had already successfully controlled molehills at the village church for a year by carefully removing the soil every week.\nThe Mole Patrol group - which includes children from a school next to the field - has now started doing the same.\n\nEssie, 11, said: \"There are a lot of moles but I think it's bad to kill them because they're innocent, they haven't really done anything.\"\nCameron, 10, said he and some of his friends had already found a dead mole and it made him feel \"heartbroken\".\n\"We just saw the trap and we looked underneath and we saw the mole and I think it was dead,\" he said.\n\"I felt heartbroken because if people did that to us we wouldn't like it, so how would the moles feel?\"\nCouncillors said in a statement: \"Woodborough Parish Council recognises its responsibility to manage risk on the playing field for the safety of its users following advice from its insurance provider.\n\"The field is well used for football, cricket, bootcamp classes and school sports in addition to being open to the general public.\n\"Daily damage is being caused by moles, and removing the mole hills does not reverse this damage.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "It\u2019s the beating heart of the Scottish clubbing scene \u2013 and even thousands of miles away from Glasgow, James \u2018Harri\u2019 Hannigan and Domenic Cappello are reminded of the love for the Sub Club.\n\u201cWe used to joke when we\u2019d go away that there\u2019s always someone who\u2019ll come up with a Sub Club T-shirt and a Sub Club tattoo,\u201d says Domenic, one half of the duo at the core of the Jamaica Street venue.\n\u201cWe were in Penang [in Malaysia] in a bar joking about how there\u2019s no chance this is going to happen, and as we\u2019re walking out a guy goes \u2018Harri and Dom?\u2019 Pretty much everywhere you go people have heard of the Sub Club.\u201d \nPart of the reason for that is the duo themselves, who this year celebrate three decades of their Saturday night Subculture slot.\nIt is the world\u2019s longest-running weekly house and techno night, having kicked off on 9 April 1994 - when Take That were topping the charts, Oasis were just about to release their debut single and Taylor Swift was four years old. \nHarri was already established at the club, DJing at Subculture's predecessor Atlantis every Saturday alongside Scottish clubbing legends Slam, before pairing up with Dom. \n\u201cThe people that owned the club decided they wanted to change direction,\u201d recalled Harri, speaking to Radio 6 Music . \n\u201cThe Slam guys were playing quite hard techno then. They said to me \u2018do you want to take over the Saturdays?\u2019.  I was in a bit of a pickle and I asked Dom and Oscar [Fullone] to do it with me as I was too scared [to do it alone].\u201d \nFrom there, the duo helped the club become a revered Glasgow institution, establishing itself as a Saturday night staple for scores of clubbers, and a pioneering venue for house music in the city.\nThree decades on from that first April night, and the duo still take to the decks every Saturday, with their longevity meaning that among the other DJs to have joined them is Harri\u2019s son \u2013 Jasper James. \n\u201cJasper was born the year I started my first residency at the Sub Club. All this time later I\u2019m still there and Jasper has become a successful DJ and producer in his own right. \nHarri and Dom both believe the longevity of Subculture is tied to their passion still being strong for discovering new music. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll always play some classics, and things that have been popular over the past 30 years but generally it\u2019s new music,\u201d says Dom. \n\u201cI think when you\u2019re pushing new music forward, [the night] doesn\u2019t go stale.\u201d \nThe venue itself helps too, as does the community that have gathered there over the years.\n\"It doesn\u2019t try to be anything other than a nice space for people to dance in,\" adds Dom.\n\"It\u2019s dark enough that you can hide if you want to,  there\u2019s quiet bits where you can talk with your pals, there\u2019s bits where you can get lost on the dancefloor. It\u2019s the simplicity [of the club]... There\u2019s people who\u2019ve been coming here for 30 years and they still love it.\"\nThat community spirit runs through to the DJs as well, with Ross Telford and Stevie Cox the other regulars at the night.\nTelford is also the venue's general manager, while Cox worked her way up from taking jackets to stepping behind the decks.\n\"She started working here in the cloakroom then was doing the odd night [DJing] and we really liked her. It was quite organic. \n\"Telford was the same, he was working behind the bar and one night gave me a mixtape. I was driving home and listened to it, and I phoned Paul [Crawford, the club's former owner] at the time and went \u2018this wee guy is brilliant!\u2019\"\nThe recent 30th anniversary saw old staff and familiar faces return to the club, which Domenic describes as being \"like a big family\".\nThat familial feeling comes across in Harri and Dom's own relationship, where both men bring in their own musical tastes.\n\"Dom and I just do our things at home immersed in our own bubble, and then we meet on a Saturday and it seems to work\" says Harri.\n\"Getting to play in the same place for 30 years playing new music, it\u2019s a bit of an anomaly. You feel like you\u2019re skating on thin ice a wee bit, but it\u2019s pretty good fun.\"  \nThat's an argument that his partner in crime believes in.\n\"The reason it has lasted so long is we never look too far ahead. We never thought it would last 30 years, you were just thinking 'we\u2019ve got another week, another week.' We never got too comfortable.\"",
    "The death of Leeds Rhinos star Rob Burrow last weekend sparked an outpouring of emotion for the rugby league legend whose very public battle against motor neurone disease (MND) had greatly raised awareness of the condition.\nWhile he was alive, the 41-year-old father-of-three's fundraising efforts, alongside former Rhinos teammate Kevin Sinfield, raised millions of pounds for MND charities.\nBut the incredible life and struggles of Burrow, who was born in Pontefract and grew up in Castleford, now look set to have a wider lasting legacy in Leeds, the city where he made his name, and beyond - not least for others  with the life-limiting condition.\nPerhaps his most immediate legacy will be the specialist centre at Seacroft Hospital in Leeds named after him, and towards which much of Burrow and Sinfield's fundraising efforts were focused.\nBefore Burrow's death, the pair had raised \u00a35.8m towards a final target of \u00a36.8m for the construction of the Rob Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease, which will be for MND patients, their families and carers.\nWork on building the centre was due to begin on Monday, less than a day after Burrow's death, and the groundbreaking ceremony went ahead as planned.\nJames Lewis, leader of Leeds City Council, said: \"The long-term goal of finding a cure for MND would be the biggest legacy.\n\"It was really poignant timing that the ground was broken on The Rob Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease at Seacroft Hospital on Monday.\"\nMr Lewis said in recent times it was difficult to think of two people who made more of a \"positive impact\" on the city of Leeds than Burrow and Sinfield.\nThey had both had a \"galvanising\" effect, he added.\n\"The other thing as well is the Rob Burrow Marathon, which has brought people together to raise money for MND,\" Mr Lewis said.\n\"Whenever there's a marathon in Leeds, it will be really associated with Rob Burrow.\"\nBurrow had previously said the MND centre would be \"a beacon of hope and support\" for those affected by the illness.\n\"It\u2019s a place where patients will find not only medical assistance, but also the compassionate care and understanding they deserve, for them and for their families,\" he said.\n\"My dream is that every person who walks through these doors feels supported, understood, and never alone. This centre is for all of us, our shared sanctuary.\u201d\nPhil Wood, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said Burrow's dream - and now his legacy - was coming ever closer to reality.\n\"The new centre will help advance our patient care, best practice-sharing and, hopefully, research in the long term, which will be such a fitting legacy for Rob,\" he said.\nBurrow chose to document his battle with MND, which provided hope to others fighting the life-limiting condition.\nLottie Clarke\u2019s husband, James, died in April aged 44, after his own struggle with MND.\nMrs Clarke, 47, who grew up in Ilkley, said she believed Burrow's legacy would be the strength and inspiration he had given to others in similar circumstances - and that would continue.\nSeeing Burrow and his family cope with living with the disease gave her husband and his family not only hope, but also the push to raise money to fund research into the disease, Mrs Clarke said.\n\u201cIf somebody can live like this, of a similar age and with young kids, then so can we,\u201d said the mother-of-three.\nMrs Clarke ran the Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon in 2023, as part of a fundraising drive which has now topped \u00a31m.\nThe Clarke family has also raised money for the My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, a charity set up by former rugby union player Doddie Weir to help find a cure for MND following his own diagnosis.\n\u201cRob was definitely the inspiration to do all of that \u2013 without a doubt,\u201d said Mrs Clarke, who now lives in Hampshire with her children.\n\u201cIf Rob hadn\u2019t been there, I don\u2019t know. There are few inspiring people out there that make you think you can get through it.\"\nAnother physical legacy of Rob Burrow's life and work could be a statue of the rugby star alongside Kevin Sinfield at the home of the Leeds Rhinos in Headingley.\nPlans for the statue were shelved when the focus shifted to raising funds for the Rob Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease.\nHowever, the club could \"probably revisit that in the coming weeks and months\", a spokesperson told the BBC.\nThe original design was based on a photo of Burrow and Sinfield embracing at the former's testimonial match in 2020.\nMeanwhile, a \"fitting way to ensure Rob's legacy and achievements live on in Leeds\" has also been promised for the wider city by James Lewis.\nThe council leader said that while it was too early to say exactly what that might be, \"as the weeks move on we will work with Rob's family, the Rhinos and MND charities around what's actually the best legacy that Rob and his family would want and what we can work towards on that.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

The development would also boast open space for the private use of residents and a children's play area for the wider public.\nProposals will be considered at the city council\u2019s planning committee on Thursday.\nA previous planning application for the site in Great Western Close, for 310 homes, was approved in 2021.\nHowever, a recently published council officer's report noted the \"applicant now seeks to gain approval for a more intensive form of development at the site\".\nIt said: \"The development would further safeguard a large portion of the site which has a high ecological and biodiversity value and retain access to this for the public.\"\nThe report added the provision of affordable housing would be 6%, despite the council usually seeking 35% for residential developments of 15 dwellings or more.\n\"It has been concluded that the current offer of 6%, in the form of on-site, market-discounted homes for first homes and affordable rental units, would be the option with the greatest benefit to the city,\" the report said.\n\"The Affordable Housing Team supports this recommendation and adds that there is a high need for such units within this area of the city.\"\nMany apartments would feature private balconies at upper levels.\nOne of the recommended conditions is the payment of a new viability assessment upon an agreed level of occupancy being reached at the development.\n\"Should the new financial appraisal identify that the development could sustain a planning obligation, above and beyond the agreed 6%, this shall then take the form of affordable housing (on-site) or an off-site financial contribution towards affordable housing elsewhere in the city,\" the report said.\nThis news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has asked a US court to liquidate his assets, legal filings show, which could allow him to start paying damages he owes the familes of victims of a 2012 school shooting.\nThe surviving families of the Sandy Hook shooting have not yet seen any of $1.5bn (\u00a31.32bn) Mr Jones was ordered to pay in 2022. \nThe request, filed in a Texas court on Thursday, could speed up payments to the families, some of whom have faced harassment over Mr Jones\u2019s claims.\nMr Jones and his media company Infowars have been contacted for comment.\nThe court documents show Mr. Jones has asked the court to convert his previous personal Chapter 11 bankruptcy claim to Chapter 7, which would allow the media personality to sell any assets rather than try to restructure his finances.\n\u201cThere is no reasonable prospect of a successful reorganization,\u201d his lawyers said in the filing, explaining the reason for the Chapter 7 claim.\nThe request appears in line with a settlement offer made by Sandy Hook families in 2023 that would allow Mr Jones to liquidate in order to pay a minimum of $85m (\u00a367m) over 10 years. \nAmong the assets that could be sold include Mr Jones\u2019 ownership in Free Speech Systems, the parent company of his Infowars media outlet.\nBoth Mr Jones and Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy in late 2022, which set up potential delays in victim pay-outs.\nA judge ruled last year that Mr Jones would not be released from paying the settlement despite the bankruptcy filings.\nMr Jones was ordered in 2022 to pay families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims $1.5bn (\u00a31.32bn) in multiple defamation cases over false claims about their relatives\u2019 deaths at a suburban Connecticut school in 2012.\nMr Jones, 50, for years falsely claimed the attack - which included the murders of 20 young children and six staff members - was \"staged\" in an elaborate conspiracy to limit gun rights.\nThe theories were false, but many of the ideas he broadcast led to harassment for the victims' families - including death threats - and have since been used to cast doubt on other US mass shootings.\nTestifying in a Texas court in 2022, Mr Jones admitted he was wrong and called the killings \"100% real\".\n\u201cMaking Alex Jones liquidate his assets in bankruptcy is a big step toward holding him accountable for his wrongdoing,\u201d Avi Moshenberg, a lawyer for Sandy Hook victims\u2019 families, said in a statement to the BBC on Friday.\n\u201cBut it is only one step of many more we are committed to taking to bring him to justice,\u201d he added.",
    "Doctors in Wales are recommending a new pay offer from Welsh government should be accepted.\nThe new pay award on the table for junior doctors, SAS doctors and consultants could potentially bring the dispute in Wales to an end.\nDifferent offers have been made to each of the three groups and will go to BMA Cymru Wales members to vote. \nIt follows 10 days of strike action by junior doctors and planned action by senior doctors which were called off at the last minute for pay talks to resume in April.\nJunior doctors have been offered an additional 7.4% uplift, taking the total to 12.4% for 2023-24, which the Welsh government said was in line with the offer accepted in Scotland.\nSome consultants would get an additional pay rise of up to 10.1%, if accepted.\nFor SAS doctors the pay offer for newer contracts includes increases of between 6.1% to 9.2% as well as an additional rise for associate specialists on closed contracts.\nThe offer will be voted between 12 and 26 June.\nDr Oba Babs Osibodu and Dr Peter Fahey, co-chairmen of the BMA\u2019s Welsh Junior Doctors Committee said they were \"encouraging\" members to accept the deal. \nHowever, nurses have responded angrily to the increased offer for doctors and the Royal College of Nursing said it was seeking urgent meetings with ministers.\nHelen Whyley, executive director of the union, said nurses felt \"let down and misled\" and that promises of there being \"no money in the pot for NHS nursing staff salaries was either untrue or demonstrates they can\u2019t manage their finances\".\nMs Whyley added that the announcement came \"only days after the first minister opened our annual RCN congress on home soil in Newport, speaking of his unwavering support for nursing staff\". \nShe said this was \"merely hot air\" while concerns over inadequate staffing, patients treated in corridors and other pressures were causing \"severe moral distress, leading to an increase in nursing staff so overwhelmed with pressure from work that they even considered taking their own lives\".\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \u201cWe greatly value Wales\u2019 nursing workforce, which does so much to look after and provide life-saving and life-changing care for people, often in very pressured circumstances.\n\u201cWe have always been open and transparent about Welsh government finances in our negotiations with the RCN and other Agenda for Change unions. And we will continue to be so as we continue to work in social partnership with all NHS trade unions.\u201d\nDr Stephen Kelly, chairman of BMA Cymru Wales' consultants committee, said the group was pleased to reach an offer that \"we believe honours our overwhelming strike mandate and offers significant improvements\".\nDr Ali Nazir, chairman of BMA Cymru Wales' SAS doctor committee said: \"By taking part [in industrial action] and getting us here they have played a part in securing a better future for SAS doctors in Wales.\"\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan, and First Minister Vaughan Gething said the offers were \"at the limit of our affordability\". \nThey added the pay structure for consultants would be reformed to \"better support recruitment and retention\".\nThe offer also aims to address imbalances in the existing contracts for specialist doctors, associate specialists, and specialty doctors, \"to ensure consistency and fairness\".\nIf the pay award is accepted, it would mean industrial action in Wales and Scotland would have come to an end, though it continues in England and Northern Ireland. \nAndrew RT Davies MS, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said: \"After offering the worst settlement figure in the UK, the Labour government claimed there was no money to meet the pay increase.\n\"Now it appears the money was always there and whilst the Welsh government were dithering, Wales' longest waiting lists on record have been exacerbated,\" he said. \nPlaid Cymru spokesperson for health, Mabon ap Gwynfor, said: \u201cWe welcome the improved pay offers made to junior doctors, SAS doctors and consultants, and that non-pay elements, such as the reform of pay scales and contract terms will also be included.\n\u201cPlaid Cymru has been clear: Our NHS is nothing without its dedicated staff and it is only right therefore that they are awarded as such. Today\u2019s news is a welcome step forward. \n\"It\u2019s now important that discussions continue and that the Labour Welsh government provide a long-term commitment for full pay restoration so that hard working NHS staff do not have to consider industrial action again.\u201d",

    "US radio host Charlamagne tha God says opinion polls suggesting black Americans may flee the Democratic party to vote for Donald Trump may be \"overstated\". \nIn an interview with the BBC's Americast, he said: \"Everybody keeps talking about Donald Trump and the inroads he's making with black men, but I don't see it.\"\nBoth President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have ramped up their efforts to court black voters, as November's White House election looms.\nPollsters currently predict a tight race decided between a few swing states, where some polls have shown Trump gaining ground among black voters, a key Democratic voting bloc.\n\"I don't know if those polls are accurate,\" Charlamagne tha God, an influential voice among black Americans, told the BBC.\n\"I'm sure there are some black men that support Donald Trump, but that is not the overall sentiment,\" added the broadcaster, whose legal name is Lenard McKelvey.\nA recent New York Times and Sienna College poll suggested that over 20% of black voters in key swing states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - would back Trump in November. \nThat signals a deep shift compared to 2020, when 92% of black voters nationally cast their ballot for Mr Biden to help him win, according to Pew Research. \nBut McKelvey - host of the popular radio show The Breakfast Club, which boasts over 4.5 million weekly listeners - said that support might be \"a little over-overstated\".\nThe negative polling for Democrats is more of a signal of black voter frustration than a new voting trend, he added.\n\"History has shown us that the Democratic party hasn't fulfilled a lot of its promises,\" he said. \n\"The thing I would always say to the Democrats and President Biden is black people are always yours to lose.\" \nThe Biden campaign has spent millions of dollars targeting black voters, whom the president recently called the \"backbone\" of the Democratic party at a campaign stop.\nHowever, inflation, immigration and the Israel-Gaza war have weakened his standing.\nFormer President Trump, too, has made a concerted effort to win over black voters, from posing with black Americans at a fast-food chain, to inviting rappers on stage during a rally. \nThere is also speculation that Trump may choose Tim Scott, a black Senator from South Carolina, as his running mate to win over more of the African-American vote.\n\"Just because you got black skin colour doesn't mean that you will be able to energise black people to run out there and vote for you,\" McKelvey said.\n\"And Tim Scott is definitely not gonna move that needle with black voters.\" \nMcKelvey said Trump and Mr Biden are \"the two worst candidates ever in the history of candidates running for president\".\nAlthough McKelvey did not outright endorse a candidate, he told the BBC: \"I'm voting to preserve democracy this year.\" The phrase is often used by the Biden campaign.\nIn the last election cycle, Mr Biden caused uproar after he said African-Americans \"ain't black\" if they don't vote Democrat. He quickly apologised.\nBut McKelvey told the BBC's Americast that he has \"never been mad at that statement... because that was his honest opinion, you know\".",

    "Hunter Biden's ex-girlfriend has testified that she \"panicked\" when she searched his car and found a gun - a moment that set off a chaotic string of events that has brought the president's son to a federal courtroom.\nHallie Biden, who is also the widow of the defendant's late brother Beau, said that she had discovered the revolver amid piles of clothes and litter in the glove compartment of Hunter Biden's truck. \nThe Delaware court will begin hearing from two more witnesses on Friday as prosecutors present their remaining evidence to jurors. \nIt is unclear if Mr Biden himself will testify in what is the first trial for the son of a sitting US president. \nThe 54-year-old is accused of lying on a form about his drug use when he purchased the gun and ammunition on 12 October 2018 in Wilmington, Delaware. He could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted.\nMr Biden has pleaded not guilty to three charges related to his possession of a firearm while allegedly using narcotics.\nHis defence team says he was in recovery at the time, so was truthful when he indicated on the paperwork that he was not a drug user.\nOn Thursday, the court heard from Hallie Biden, a central figure in the case who became romantically involved with the defendant shortly after the 2015 death of his brother and her husband.\nMs Biden, 50, told the court she was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" to have started smoking crack cocaine herself after Mr Biden introduced her to the drug.\nIn often emotional, detailed testimony, she spoke of the pair's \"volatile\" and \"off-on\" relationship, as well as their struggles with drug use and agonising battles to recover. \nMs Biden testified that she had stopped using the drug in August 2018, but that Hunter Biden had continued to use it.\nConcerned after seeing Mr Biden looking \"exhausted\" and fearing he could have relapsed into crack use, Ms Biden told jurors she had searched his truck early on the morning of 23 October 2018 - something she had frequently done. \nThere, among piles of clothes and garbage, she had found \"remnants\" of crack cocaine as well as drug paraphernalia. \n\u201cOh, and the gun, obviously,\" she added.\nAlmost instantly, she recalled, panic set in. \n\"I didn't want him to hurt himself, and I didn't want my kids to find it and hurt themselves,\" the mother-of-two said. \n\"I was afraid to kind of touch it. I didn't know it was loaded,\" Ms Biden added.\nFearful, she wrapped the .38 calibre Colt Cobra revolver into a leather pouch, stuffed it into a purple \"little gift shopping bag\" and drove to a nearby grocery store, where she threw it in a rubbish bin.\n\"I realise it was a stupid idea now,\" she said. \"But I was panicking.\" \nInitially, she did not plan to tell Mr Biden about what she had done. But when he woke up that morning, he realised it was missing. \n\"Did you take that from me Hallie,\" read one angry text shown to jurors. \"You really need to help me think right now, Hallie. This is very serious.\" \nAt his urging, she returned to the store to find the gun but was unable to. She then filed a police report. \n\"I'll take the blame,\" she texted him from the scene. \"I don't want to live like this.\" \nIt has previously emerged that the weapon was discovered by a man who often rummaged through the grocery store\u2019s refuse to gather recyclable items.\nMs Biden also told the court that she had not see Mr Biden use crack cocaine in the days leading up to him buying the gun and her disposing of it.\nAs she testified, Hunter Biden appeared to look intently in her direction.\nHe also looked back at his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, who has attended each day of the trial so far.\nHallie Biden also told the court that it was only after their relationship began that she had learned of Mr Biden's drug use.\nShe found crack cocaine at her house - where he would frequently stay - and later repeatedly saw him use the drug. \nCrack, she said, left him \"agitated or high-strung, but at other times, functioning as well\".\nThe prosecutor asked on Thursday about a text message Hunter Biden had sent to Ms Biden the day after he bought the gun, saying he was waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\nShe told the court that had meant \"he was buying crack cocaine\".\nTwo days after the gun purchase, he texted Ms Biden that he was \"sleeping on a car smoking crack\".\nThe series of texts also included several emotional messages from Ms Biden in which she pleaded with him to get sober. \n\"I'm afraid you're going to die,\" one message read. \nThe defendant's lawyers explained the texts by suggesting their client had been lying about drug use to avoid seeing Hallie Biden - noting that she had had no way of knowing what he was actually doing at the time. \nDuring cross-examination, Ms Biden confirmed she had not seen him using drugs around this time. \nAbbe Lowell, Mr Biden's attorney, asked her whether the request to \"help me get sober\" could have also referred to alcohol - to which she agreed. \nMs Biden's testimony was followed by Millard Greer, a former Delaware State",
    "A fascinating insight into the vital supplies carried by soldiers on D-Day has been put on display as part of a special 80th anniversary exhibition.  \nMess tins full of essential supplies - including four sheets of toilet paper - are on show at Weedon Depot in Northamptonshire, where some of the guns for the allied invasion of Normandy were prepared.\nThe tins also contain food such as biscuits and an early form of instant tea. \nThe exhibition also includes a guide given to soldiers about how to behave in once in France - warning them \"the French are more polite than most of us\". \nWeedon Depot was originally built to help protect England from invasion by Napoleon during the early 19th Century and it was still being used as an ammunition store in the 1940s.\nSandra Lee, one of the guides at the Depot's visitor centre, said it played its part in supplying weapons for D-Day: \"The guns came into the depot, they were inspected, prepared at the armouries because they'd come in with grease and everything on, and sent out to the soldiers.\"\nPeople from the surrounding villages were pressed into service to pack the mess tins of supplies.\nOne of the exhibition's cabinets shows the contents of each of the cans.\nMs Lee said: \"They've got the Tommy pack, the cooker, the water.\n\"Each soldier needed 4,000 calories to last that day - it had all been worked out.\n\"The people here prepared it all {including] the tea - they'd get it ground down, add in milk powder, add in sugar, because you're not doing that on the beaches.\"\nThe supplies were individually wrapped in brown paper packages, which were then packed into little tins which served as plates on the beaches.\nAlongside the food and drink was a small ration of another essential item.\nMs Lee added: \"They've got onto the beaches, they're being fired at, and all they've been given is four sheets of toilet paper, and I'm not sure that four sheets would be enough if I was running onto a beach and being fired at.\"\nThe display also includes essential behaviour guidance for the soldiers, many of whom had never have left the British Isles before.\nTypical instructions included: \"The French are more polite than most of us, remember to call them Monsieur, Madame or Mademoiselle, and not just 'Oy'.\"\n\"Don't criticise the French army's defeat of 1940.\"\nAnd, to make sure the work of the good people of Weedon didn't go to waste, \"Don't sell or give away your food or equipment.\"  \nThe visitor centre is open from Wednesday to Sunday and the exhibition will continue until October.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The US has told Israel it must be fully \"transparent\" over an air strike that reportedly killed at least 35 people at a central Gaza school packed with displaced people on Thursday morning.\nLocal journalists told the BBC a warplane had fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school in the Nuseirat urban refugee camp.\nThe Israeli military said it had conducted a \"precise\" strike on a \"Hamas compound\" in the school, but Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run government media office denied the claim.\nThe US called on Israel to identify publicly the Hamas fighters it said it had killed - just as the Israeli military gave the names of nine of them.     \nIsrael frequently identifies militants it targets in air strikes but it is rare for the US to urge it to do so.\nThe Israelis \u201ctold us there were 20 to 30 militants they were targeting [and] they\u2019re going to release the names of those they believe they\u2019ve killed, those militants\u201d,  US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. \n\u201cThat is what they have said they would provide. We expect them to do that, as well as any other details that would shed light on this incident.\"\nIn a near-simultaneous news briefing, Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari gave the names of nine Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters he said had been killed in the strike. The Israeli military later said it had confirmed the deaths of eight more Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members in the strike, bringing the total to 17.\nIn Washington, Mr Miller said the US has seen reports that 14 children were killed in the strike.\n\"If that is accurate that 14 children were killed, those aren\u2019t terrorists,\" he said.\n\"And so the government of Israel has said they are going to release more information about this strike... We expect them to be fully transparent in making that information public.\u201d\nThe latest deaths come just a week after 45 people were killed in an Israeli strike in the Gazan city of Rafah.\nThe latest strike, local journalists and residents say, happened in the early hours of Thursday at al-Sardi school, which is in a south-eastern area of the densely populated, decades-old camp, where the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, provides services.\nVideos shared on social media showed the destruction of several classrooms in one of the school's buildings, as well as bodies wrapped in white shrouds and blankets.\nDead and wounded people were rushed to the al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Hospital, in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which has been overwhelmed since the Israeli military began a new ground operation against Hamas in central Gaza this week.\nThe BBC is working to verify the details of the strike in Nuseirat camp. Reports on the exact number of dead have varied. \nGaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said 40 people had been killed, including 14 children and nine women, and 74 others had been injured. \nUnrwa's commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, said at least 35 people had been killed and many more had been injured. The agency\u2019s director of communications, Juliette Touma, told the BBC the figures were coming from Unrwa \"colleagues on the ground\".\nWitnesses described a scene of devastation following the strike. \n\u201cI was asleep when the incident occurred,\u201d Udai Abu Elias, a man who was living at the school, told BBC Arabic. \n\"Suddenly we heard a loud explosion and shattered glass and debris from the building fell on us. Smoke filled the air and I couldn't see anything. I didn't expect to make it out alive. I heard someone calling for survivors to come out from under the rubble. I struggled to see as I stumbled over the bodies of the martyrs.\u201d\nUnrwa said 6,000 displaced people had been sheltering in the school complex at the time. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months.\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the strike through a spokesperson, saying that UN premises must be \"inviolable\" and protected by \"all parties\" during conflicts. \nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said jets had conducted a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside\" the school. An annotated aerial photograph highlighted classrooms on two upper floors of the building, which the IDF said were the \u201clocations of the terrorists\u201d.\nUS officials have continued to lobby for what President Joe Biden called an Israeli ceasefire proposal.\nThe three-part plan would begin with a six-week ceasefire in which the Israeli military would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza.

    "Newcastle United's new kit deal with Adidas has rekindled memories of nineties and noughties success, but how important could the partnership be in helping the club break into football's elite level?\n\"It was typical Newcastle - 100 miles an hour,\" recalls fan Gavin Haigh of the Magpies' charge towards the Premier League title as 1995 turned into 1996.\n\"We were battering everybody and it felt like the doldrums pre-Kevin Keegan taking over as manager [in 1992] were light years away.\n\"It was crazy. We had all these glamorous players and we were wearing Adidas.\"\nThe team, dubbed The Entertainers for their swashbuckling style, swept all before them on their way to a 12-point lead at the top of the table.\nBut stumbles in the final stretch saw them overtaken by Manchester United and led to Keegan's infamous \"I would love it if we beat them\" interview as the pressure mounted.\nAlmost 30 years on, that season's home and away strips with their grandad collars and Newcastle Brown Ale sponsorship are as fondly remembered by fans as the marauders who wore them.\n\"Seeing us associated with Adidas was such a great statement,\" says Haigh, author of Black and White Stripes: The Greatest Collection of Newcastle United Matchworn Shirts.\n\"Having their three stripes on the arm felt like we'd arrived. It gave us a coolness. Those shirts are among our best ever.\n\"The burgundy-and-blue away one is revered, although it was only worn seven or eight times which most people don't realise.\"\nAfter Puma and Castore tie-ups from 2010 onwards, the club confirmed a new Adidas kit deal last September with the announcement referencing the era when David Ginola, Les Ferdinand and later Alan Shearer had the St James' Park faithful dreaming of trophies.\nThe first home strip from their renewed partnership has now been unveiled with the manufacturer saying it has opted to take inspiration from the club's 2002/3 campaign when the Magpies clashed with Juventus and Barcelona in the Champions League.\nHowever, former Nike and Puma designer Craig Buglass - who worked with Adidas as an unofficial consultant on the new strip - explains there is much more to the multi-year deal than nostalgia.\n\"Simply put, it's exposure - hundreds of [Adidas] stores all over the world and massive marketing budgets,\" says the Geordie, who created strips for Arsenal and Barcelona as well as the one worn by Brazil when the South Americans last lifted the World Cup in 2002.\n\"As soon as the [Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund] buyout of the club happened in 2021, I knew immediately Castore wouldn't last much longer.\n\"Castore, as much as it's a great brand, it's not an Adidas or Nike. What you want is a global market. I can see us becoming the envy of clubs on so many levels.\"\nCurrent manager Eddie Howe saw his men miss out on European qualification for next season after a seventh-place finish in the Premier League, but Buglass believes a combination of the Adidas deal and PIF ownership could see Newcastle \"become one of the game's biggest names within the next 10 years\".\nOn top of the standard releases, the Geordie, who now runs the Spark Design Academy for aspiring kit creators, expects a number of lifestyle offerings along similar lines to Adidas's collaboration earlier this year with Manchester United and the Stone Roses.\n\"They've really tapped into fan bases and partnered with companies that pulse with supporters,\" he says.\n\"In my opinion, it's the perfect marriage for Newcastle because the fans love to wear the team colours and gear in general.\"\nSome reports have put the value of the contract as high as \u00a330m or even \u00a340m per year, although the club and manufacturer were both tight-lipped when contacted by the BBC.\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire believes those figures are likely to be over-estimated.\nWhatever their accuracy, he argues every pound will be \"critical for a club like Newcastle trying to break into the elite level\" of the sport as the Premier League trials an alternative financial system next season set to operate like a spending cap.\n\"A club's revenue total comes from tickets sales, broadcasting deals and commercial deals. Included within the commercial deals, the two biggest tend to be the front-of-shirt deal and the kit-manufacturing deal itself so kit contracts will become increasingly important,\" he says.\nEven so, Maguire has a much more cautious view on the deal's potential impact.\nFirstly, he says manufacturers have what are termed Tier 1 partners in each geographic area - big-hitters such as Germany's Bayern Munich, Spain's Real Madrid and Italy's Juventus.\nIn Premier League terms, that means Manchester United will be Adidas's \"flagship brand\" with an \"impact upon the total amount of money it is willing to pay to Newcastle as a guaranteed sum\".\nSecondly, he warns the Tyneside club may well find it difficult to attract new fans across the globe even if there is success on the pitch.\n\"I think there are potential benefits in terms of shirt sales as A",
    "A group of men have been jailed for their role in death of a man who was stabbed in the heart and pushed into a canal.\nAhmed Alshran, 33, was attacked along with another man on Dale Street in Manchester city centre in August 2023, and died weeks later from his injuries. \nMohammed Al-Enizi Hameed, 36, of Rusholme, was found guilty of his murder and sentenced to life in prison with a minimum tariff of 24 years.\nA 17-year-old boy, who has not been named for legal reasons, was also found guilty of murder and sentenced to 13 years in jail.\nHussein Muhalhal, 20, of Longsight was found guilty of grievous bodily harm and sentenced to five and a half years in jail.\nAnother 17-year-old boy, who was also not named, was also found guilty of grievous bodily harm and sentenced to two and half years in prison for his role in the attack. \nGreater Manchester Police said the men were seen on CCTV gathering on the Rochdale Canal Tow Path off Dale Street in Manchester city centre at about 18:25 BST on 16 August.\nMr Alshran and a group of friends walked along the same tow path when he and one of his friends were stabbed by the group, who then ran away.\nA passerby heard Al-Enizi Hameed say \"come bring the knife, go get a knife, let's kill him\" in the moment before the attack, police said. \nMr Alshran was found lying by the canal after pulling himself from the water, having being pushed in by one of his attackers. \nHis friend recovered from his injuries, but the 33-year-old spent weeks in intensive care before he died.\nDet Supt David Moores said hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and phone records were scanned as part the investigation. \nHe said the attack was \"despicable\", adding he hoped it brought Mr Ahmed's family comfort to know the four men would \"spend a long time behind bars\". \nIn a statement provided to police, Ahmed's family said they wanted to thank those who worked to investigate his \"senseless\" murder, and bring \"justice\" to those responsible. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Residents have called for a disused factory which suffered a major fire to be redeveloped.\nAbout half of the building at the former Delphi Diesel Systems site in Newton Road, Sudbury, went up in flames on 28 May.\nNo-one was injured and a 14-year-old boy has since been arrested on suspicion of arson, Suffolk Police said.\nThe building had been empty since 2020 when the factory, which made components for the motor industry, closed, causing hundreds of job losses.\nLocals are torn on whether the site should be redeveloped into housing.\nClifford Thompson worked at the factory as a machinist for 25 years before taking early retirement.\n\"It's a shame but I'd like to see them develop houses there,\" he said.\nHis wife, Mary, added: \"Any residential housing that may be proposed, I'd prefer they were social, council-type houses for young families that are here.\n\"The building has been sitting there empty for so long and there's been some vandalism recently so it does need opening up.\n\"I just hope it will be developed and it will be something good for the town. How soon? I don't know.\"\nResident Dean Attridge said: \"I think it needs to be either used as a factory again or demolish it and build something other than houses on there because there's a lot of new builds going on around the Sudbury area and Long Melford, so I'd rather it be something that would bring jobs into the town.\n\"I think we could build a cinema on there or a bowling alley because there's not a lot of entertainment in Sudbury unless you like to drink.\"\nDavid Norris also worked at Delphi Diesel Systems, but as a telephone engineer.\n\"It should be reused as there's lots of opportunities for it to be used,\" he said.\n\"It could be turned into a sports complex to entertain kids like bowling alleys\u2026 trampoline parks, indoor exercise areas.

    "A judge has dismissed an appeal over an employment tribunal that found a council racially discriminated against an employee.\nA panel in April 2023 found \"race played a part\" in decisions made by Ruth Lake, a senior member of staff at Leicester City Council, in relation to social worker Bindu Parmar.\nThe authority's appeal was dismissed on Tuesday on all its 11 grounds.\nA city council spokesperson said the authority was considering challenging the decision.\nMrs Parmar, a British national of Indian origin, claimed she was discriminated against after she was made the subject of a disciplinary investigation in January 2021. \nA report into the tribunal in 2023 said Mrs Parmar was accused of not acting in line with leadership standards but the panel found there was \"nothing of substance\" to start an investigation and that there was \"no other credible explanation\" for the way she was treated. \nThe local authority argued in its appeal that the panel had misapplied the law, used insufficient grounds to shift the burden of proof on to the authority during the tribunal and failed to show adequate reasoning for its conclusion. \nIn his published appeal judgement summary, Judge James Tayler said: \"The Employment Tribunal did not err in law in holding that the burden of proof had shifted to the respondent to disprove discrimination and that it had failed to do so.\"\nMrs Parmar, who is not currently in employment, told the BBC she felt \"vindicated\" by the dismissal but was too \"anxious\" to return to the same line of work. \nThe 58-year-old, who said she worked at the council for 33 years, added she was \"shocked\" that the council decided to appeal against the ruling in the first place. \n\"Since last year\u2019s judgement there\u2019s been no acknowledgement that anything was wrong,\" she said.\n\"It just feels like they don\u2019t want to change and don\u2019t want to learn any lessons.\"\nMs Lake appears to still be employed by the council at the time of publication, according to the authority's website. \nConcluding his 37-page long published report, the judge said: \"I regret that this judgment has ended up being so long; I have not had the time to make it any shorter. \n\"If I had, I might merely have said that this is just the type of appeal that the Court of Appeal warned against in [another case].\"\nThe judge referenced mention of the \"correct approach\" to interpreting employment tribunals which had been reiterated by the Court of Appeal, stating they must be read \"fairly and as a whole\" and not focusing on passages in isolation. \nA city council spokesperson said: \u201cWe are very disappointed and do not agree with the judgement in this case. We are therefore considering an appeal.\n\u201cIn view of this, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this time.\u201d\nA further appeal would be dealt with by the Court of Appeal.\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "US regulators are investigating after a Boeing 737 Max 8 flown by Southwest Airlines rocked side to side while in air, a potentially dangerous movement known as a Dutch roll.\nIt is one of two new inquiries involving Boeing planes that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recently confirmed.\nThe agency is also involved after Boeing reported learning of potentially falsified documents used to certify titanium in its planes.\nThe issues have emerged at a time when the safety record of Boeing planes is under intense scrutiny.\nBoeing referred questions about the Southwest flight to the airline, which said it was co-operating with the investigation. \nBoeing also said that the titanium issue was \"industry-wide\", involving shipments from a limited set of suppliers. \nIt said tests performed so far indicate that the correct alloy was used, despite the false documentation. \nThe company said it sourced the metal separately from its supplier and it believed a small number of parts had been affected.\n\"To ensure compliance, we are removing any affected parts on airplanes prior to delivery. Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely,\u201d  the company said. \nThe New York Times, which first reported the issue, said a supplier to Spirit AeroSystems, which makes parts for Boeing and European plane-maker Airbus, started looking into the issue after noticing holes from corrosion. \nSpirit, which had alerted the two manufacturers to the problem earlier this year, said more than 1,000  tests had been completed on the suspect parts, which had been removed from production.\n\"It is the documents that were counterfeit, not the titanium,\" spokesman Joe Buccino said. \"The problem is we've lost traceability.\"\nThe FAA said Boeing had issued a bulletin to suppliers to be on the alert for counterfeit records and that it was probing the scope of the issue.\nCanadian transportation safety officials said in a separate statement that they were working with foreign regulators to determine a co-ordinated approach to the titanium issue, and that officials \"will not hesitate to take action\".\nThe so-called Dutch roll, said to have been named after an ice-skating technique attributed to the Netherlands, occurred on a 25 May flight from Phoenix, Arizona, to Oakland, California. \nThe FAA said the aircraft regained control and no-one on board was injured, but the plane suffered \"substantial\" damage. \nA post-flight inspection of the two-year-old plane revealed significant damage to a unit that provides backup power to the rudder. \n\"Dutch roll can be unpleasant but the 737 exhibits relatively benign characteristics.  The time elapsed since the incident, and the absence of airworthiness action on the fleet, suggest that this is a one-off, not another widespread problem for Boeing,\" said Tim Atkinson, a former UK accident investigator-turned-consultant.\nSafety campaigners have raised alarm about the quality of recent planes produced by Boeing. \nAn incident in which a panel broke off a plane in mid-air in January reignited concerns, sparking lawsuits and increased oversight of Boeing. \nBoeing has slowed its production and last month presented the FAA with an action plan aimed at resolving the issues. \nTheo Leggett contributed to this article.

    "A female ice hockey team that has just clinched second place in a league during its first season has appealed for more members to join as the women's sport continues to grow, it said.\nCambridge Kodiacs started competing in October, joining the Women's National Ice Hockey League Division Two South.\nThe 25-strong squad, led by captain Christina Ashley, narrowly missed out on a promotion place in Sheffield last weekend.\n\"It's going out and playing a sport you really, really, love and putting an insane amount of dedication into it and it's really fun,\" she said.\nAshley, 35, who is from Ontario, Canada, and started skating at the age of two, said while the women's sport was \"definitely different\" in the UK, the newly-launched Professional Women's Hockey League's (PWHL) in North America demonstrated its scale of growth.\n\"[People] thought for a long time there would be no interest in the women's game,\" she said.\n\"That it would be totally different and no-one would want to see it, but it's incredibly entertaining; a really great sport and they've been packing out arenas, selling them out.\" \nIn a bid to build on its success, the Cambridge Kodiacs are holding two trial sessions later this month and inviting girls and women to apply.  \nThe team only formed last year after a women's ice hockey session at the Cambridge Ice Arena prompted the idea to develop a competitive squad.\nFor Ashley, who moved to the UK with her scientist husband, it was her first season back after giving birth to her second child.\n\"I went back [to playing] when she was seven months - it was a bit crazy but she is obsessed with ice hockey too now and loves watching,\" said the marketing manager.\nAshley said members, aged 15 upwards, trained on the ice for at least 90 minutes a week and travelled across the country to compete at weekends.\nShe said their devotion to the sport and \"unrivalled team spirit\" were big factors in their success so far. \nHowever, she said the gender gap in the sport still put female players at a disadvantage. \nShe said she knew of one women's club which could only train on the ice rink between 23:00 and midnight on a Friday, once other teams and sessions were over.\n\"We're very fortunate we have teams to play with - and we're really happy about that - but we get terrible ice times sometimes,\" said Ashley, who's been playing for about 30 years in Canada, France, England and Sweden.\n\"In the men's NHL [in the US] you can go anywhere from being paid $1.5m to $10m in a season... the women's side in the PWHL - their first round of contracts was between $50,000 and $80,000 so there's a massive gap.\"\nAshley also said longer seasons in the women's game added to competition and training costs and the team now hoped to find a sponsor and develop the amateur side.\n\"Our goal is to provide a space for women to play that's free to play,\" she said.\n\"So they can come, play their sport, give it as much dedication as they need and have the support there to not have it drain their bank accounts.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A university says applications are coming in from across the world to study a new masters degree in \"smart agriculture\" this September.\nSuccessful applicants at Nottingham Trent University will have the chance to tackle some of the biggest challenges facing farmers.\nThe course offers students the chance to explore how artificial intelligence (AI), vertical farming, automation, and precision agriculture could protect food supplies and reduce energy and fertiliser costs. \nA growing population and climate change are expected to put pressure on food supplies in the UK and across the world. \n\nMasters students will join researchers based at the university's Brackenhurst campus.\nWorking in glasshouses and solar-powered shipping containers, they develop 'recipes' to produce food crops far faster than would be possible outdoors. \nSenior researcher Dr Gadelhag Mohmad says his computer takes twice-daily readings to measure how his vegetables are responding to the nutrients and lighting mix in high-tech vertical farms.\nAubergines, Swiss chard, peppers, and various lettuce varieties all grow suspended over a hydroponic tank, with their roots immersed in nutrient-rich water rather than soil.\nThe data produced trains an AI system to suggest the optimum mixes to produce multiple crops without wasting expensive energy or fertiliser.\n\"We only give the exact amounts that the plants need,\" says Dr Mohmad. \n\"It means we can grow three trays of plants using the same amounts that we previously used for just one tray.\"\nIt's not just about salad crops. In China, growers are already successfully boosting rice production using these techniques.\nIn the UK, the university's results are attracting interest from the commercial food sector, which wants to install similar shipping containers in distribution centres. \nThe academic leading the research, Prof Chungui Lu, says supermarkets like crops grown without soil because they are pest-free, clean and fresh.  \nA controlled environment also means supermarkets know their orders are not in danger from a sudden storm or flooding and are virtually guaranteed to arrive on time. \nThe university says graduates who become expert in these methods will be in demand as vulnerable crops fail and the impact of climate change worsens. \n\"The course includes the skills you need to manage a vertical farm,\" says acting deputy dean, Julia Davies. \n\"We want to support students to recognise the value of short supply chains in sustainability and producing more nutritious food.\n\"The advances we've made means this feels like the right time for a course in smart agriculture\", says Prof Lu. \"This is the future of agriculture.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Beachgoers in the Gulf Coast of Florida have been told to be vigilant, after three swimmers were attacked by sharks in two separate attacks.\nOne woman was said to have had part of her arm amputated after being bitten on Friday in Walton County in north-west Florida.\nLess than two hours later, at another beach four miles further east, two teenage girls were in waist-deep water with friends when they were attacked.\nOne of the girls suffered \"significant injuries to the upper leg and one hand\" while the other had minor injuries on one of her feet, fire officials said.\nAuthorities have been patrolling the shoreline in boats and some beaches were closed, although they reopened on Saturday with purple flags warning of dangerous marine life.\nThe first incident happened at around 13:20 local time on Friday when a woman, about 45-years-old, was attacked near WaterSound Beach, South Walton Fire District said.\nShe suffered \"critical injuries\" to her hip and lower left arm and was airlifted to hospital, fire officials said.\nPart of her arm had to be amputated, fire chief Ryan Crawford later told a news briefing, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.\n\nThe second attack - on two girls about 15 years old - happened at about 14:55 local time near Seacrest Beach, the fire department added.\n\"Please swim carefully, respect the Gulf, stay hydrated, and look out for your loved ones,\" South Walton Fire District said on X. \nWalton County Sheriff's office said on X on Saturday that during patrols, deputies spotted a 14 ft (4.2m) hammerhead shark in Santa Rosa Beach - but stressed they were \"not uncommon\".\n\"We want to reiterate that sharks are always present in the Gulf,\" they said. \n\"Swimmers and beachgoers should be cautious when swimming and stay aware of their surroundings.\"\nAccording to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File, there are around 70 to 100 shark attacks every year worldwide, resulting in about five deaths.\nThe ISAF said last year, there were 69 unprovoked shark bites on humans and 22 provoked bites globally.\nIn Florida, the majority of shark attacks are by requiem sharks - a family of sharks that like warm seas and include species such as bull sharks or blacktip sharks. \nMost attacks occur in nearshore waters, typically near a sandbar where sharks feed and can become trapped at low tide.\nSmall fish are traveling in schools near the shore this time of year, which might have been a contributing factor in Friday's attacks, the Bay County Sheriff's Office suggested.\nThe time of the attacks - in the middle of the afternoon - was also an anomaly, Walton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson said, according to CBS News.",

He survived and has since undergone surgery.\nTwo witnesses - Marie Adrian and Anna Ravn - described the Copenhagen assault to the local newspaper BT, saying: \"A man came by in the opposite direction and gave her a hard shove on the shoulder, causing her to fall to the side.\"\nThey said that while it was a \"strong push\" the prime minister did not hit the ground and that she sat down at a nearby caf\u00e9 to recover.\nMette Frederiksen's office said that the incident had left the politician \"shocked\" and that she was suffering \"minor whiplash\".\nA 39-year-old man is due to appear at a hearing at the Frederiksberg Courthouse on Saturday afternoon in connection with the incident.\nThe attack comes two days before Denmark votes in the EU election.\nMs Frederiksen, leader of Denmark's Social Democrats, had earlier taken part in a European election event with her party's lead candidate Christel Schaldemose.\nThe Social Democrats are the biggest party in Denmark's coalition government. They still lead the polls, but their support has fallen back considerably in recent months.\nDanish Environment Minister Magnus Heunicke said on X: \"Mette is naturally shocked by the attack. I must say that it shakes all of us who are close to her.\"\nEU chief Charles Michel said on X that he was \"outraged\".\n\"I strongly condemn this cowardly act of aggression,\" he said. \nMs Frederiksen, 46, became prime minister in 2019 after taking over as leader of the centre-left Social Democrats four years earlier. This made her the youngest prime minister in Danish history.\nSoon after, she became embroiled in a spat with then-President Donald Trump  after she rebuffed his idea of the US buying Greenland.\nMr Trump called her \"nasty\" after she dismissed the suggestion of such a land deal as \"absurd\".\nIn 2022, Ms Frederiksen was heavily criticised by a commission investigating her government's decision to cull millions of mink during the Covid pandemic.\n",

Others, like Luke, are choosing to swap their smartphones for much simpler devices, so-called \u201cdumbphones\u201d.\nHis new phone only has texts, calls, maps, and a few other limited tools.\n\u201cMy friends\u2019 usage is like four to five hours I think, and that\u2019s how much mine used to be before I got this,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNow mine\u2019s like 20 minutes a day which is really good because I only use it for what I need it for.\u201d\nParents are also turning to dumbphones, not only for their children, but to help themselves be more present for their families.\nLizzy Broughton, who has a five-year-old son, recently bought an old-school style Nokia \u201cflip\u201d phone.\n\u201cIt helped me recalibrate my own habits, I have way more quality time with my son,\u201d she explained.\nShe says that when it\u2019s time for him to get his own phone, she\u2019ll choose a similarly pared-down model.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like the best idea to just start with a smartphone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re handing over the world, like try to figure out how to navigate that.\u201d\nSales of dumbphones have been increasing in North America. At Dumbwireless in Los Angeles, store-owners Daisy Krigbaum and Will Stults cater to customers looking for low-tech devices.\n\u201cWe have a lot of parents looking to get their kid that first phone, and they don\u2019t want them drifting off on the internet,\u201d he said.\nBut giving up the smartphone is easier said than done. Mr Stults said some schools require pupils to have certain apps. And it is difficult to hold the line when children see their friends being given expensive smartphones, said Ms Broughton.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to require a community of parents to actually be like, can we do this differently?\u201d she said.\nOne workaround is a device called \u201cunpluq\u201d, which you tap against the phone to wirelessly block certain apps, like social media.\n\u201cParents can control the smartphone with this tag, and also monitor the usage,\u201d Mr Stults said.\nThere are several phones that have now been developed particularly for users who want to avoid an addiction to mindless scrolling.\nChris Kaspar founded the company Techless to develop an \u201cintentionally boring\u201d but sleek device that looks much like an iPhone. The latest version is dubbed the \u201cWisephone II\u201d.\n\u201cIt has no icons, just words, two colours, and two fonts.\u201d He describes it as \u201cvery peaceful, very tranquil\u201d.\nIt will have some limited third-party tools, such as the taxi application Uber, but no social media.\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking this question\u2014what\u2019s actually good for us?\u201d Mr Kaspar said.\nHe first developed the phone with his teenage foster daughters in mind and says 25% of their sales are to children, but that it is marketed to adults.\n\u201cIf you have a phone that\u2019s branded as a kids\u2019 device there\u2019s some shame associated with that. So we made a very adult, sophisticated, Apple-esque, really nice device,\u201d he said.\nWith revenue from apps and social-media advertisement in the billions of dollars, the big companies have little motivation to encourage different habits, he said.\nMeanwhile, Canadian teen Luke says he is planning to stick with his new device, much to the amusement of friends.\n\u201cThey think it\u2019s pretty weird but at this point I\u2019m like it doesn\u2019t really matter because it\u2019s helped me so much,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely taken me into a better spot right now.\u201d",
    "Forget wanting to meet someone with a GSOH for some TLC through the local newspaper. Dating apps in the 2020s have borne a whole new dictionary of acronyms and phrases.\nTechnology has progressed leaps and bounds since the turn of the millennium, redefining how young people communicate with friends and, more recently, how we date.\nWhereas old acronyms include the likes of GSOH (Good Sense Of Humour) and WLTM (Would Like To Meet), newly popular configurations of capital letters include ENM (Ethical Non-Monogamy), ONS (One Night Stand), and NSA (No Strings Attached).\nAccording to Ofcom statistics published in January, more than one in 10 UK adults use online dating services; 2.49m adults use the top app, Tinder, alone.\nAnd the rise of swiping, prompts and ghosting has brought with it a new \"language\", with many young single people across the world explaining what they're after in jumbles of capitalised letters.\nConsequently, acronyms have become indecipherable to some, with one dating expert claiming singletons are in fact \"shortening their reach\".\nMatt turned to online dating after coming out of a 16-year relationship three years ago, but has also tried in-person dating events.\nAlthough he thinks it is \"easier\" to strike up conversation with people online, he says the connection is \"so much weaker\" and acronyms can be \"off-putting\".\n\"I find the use of acronyms like FWB (Friends With Benefits) and ONS really difficult,\" the PE teacher said.\n\"I'm not looking for that, but seeing that makes me slightly concerned as I take a princess kissing frogs approach.\n\"The joy of dating now is you get to date lots of different types of people and it allows me to refine what it is I'm actually looking for.\n\"This person is just up for 'Yes, let's commit immediately, or let's not do it at all'.\"\nBut online dating in the 2020s has opened Matt's mind to other ways of describing himself.\nAfter someone explained to him the breakdown of his past relationship might partly be down to conflicting star signs, the 44-year-old from Bath has started using astrology to guide his decisions on swiping right.\n\"It's not my sole deciding factor, but if I see somebody who lists her star sign as being one of the top four compatible with mine, I'm more likely to pursue a conversation with that person,\" said Matt, who is also a mental health coach.\nJacob Lucas, a dating coach from Westbury in Wiltshire, said acronyms can complicate and \"take away the authenticity\" from the \"competitive\" 21st Century dating experience.\n\"What [the use of acronyms] does is it isolates people who don't know what they mean,\" he told the BBC.\nJacob said someone that ticks all the boxes may be looking for something \"NSA\", but doesn't know what the acronym stands for and decide they are \"not going to bother\" with a potential match.\nAs a result, it can lead to daters unintentionally \"shortening their reach\", so Lucas recommends communicating your desires in plain English.\nBut, Jacob said, acronyms can act as a \"green light\" to other potential dates, especially those who are interested in certain types of sexual encounters and kink communities.\nCommon acronyms used to communicate sexual wants on dating apps include ONS and GGG (Good, Giving and Game).\nThe latter means someone believes they are good in bed, give equally to their partner and are game to try new things in the bedroom.\n\"It's filtering out people who don't understand that lingo,\" Jacob said.\n\"People who get really involved in that realm of the dating world know what those acronyms mean.\n\"It's kind of like a signal, you can hit a target niche more.\"\nJordan has been online dating \"on and off\" since he turned 18.\nNow 24, the mechanical engineer from Gloucester said he does not take it \"super seriously\", usually describing himself using a funny one-liner.\n\"In terms of bios, people either don't share a whole lot or they share too much,\" Jordan said, admitting he has \"absolutely no idea\" what most acronyms mean.\n\"An ex told me what DDLG means, which I thought was strange, to put it lightly.\"\nDespite his confusion regarding some acronyms like DDLG (Daddy Dom Little Girl), Jordan would not let it stop him from getting to know someone.\n\"If I liked the look of someone, I'd just Google it or swipe right and ask later,\" he said.\nOne concern about acronyms is the way they may \"isolate\" older people, who were not raised online.\nAlthough older generations might have written a lonely hearts advertisement several decades ago, they may have no idea what modern acronyms found on the likes of Tinder, Bumble and Hinge may translate to.\n\"I can't imagine how confusing it would be seeing all of these, it's like a language you subconsciously learn,\" Jordan said.\n\"For younger people, I feel like you would learn a lot of them through social media.\"\nJo Tucker returned to the dating world a few years ago after splitting from her husband, even dabbling in on-screen dating by appearing on Channel 4's First Dates.\nThe 44-year-old from Paulton i",
    "\"We will not lose hope,\" the wife of missing TV and radio presenter Michael Mosley has said, as efforts to find him continue on the Greek island of Symi. \nThe 67-year-old vanished after setting off on a walk on Wednesday. \nHis wife Dr Clare Bailey Mosley said in a statement that the days since he went missing had been \"the longest and most unbearable\".\nTeams of police, firefighters and volunteers are now into a fifth day of searching for Dr Mosley, known for his TV programmes and BBC Radio 4's Just One Thing podcast.\nEmergency crews in the area called off the search on Saturday evening as night fell as the search area is too dangerous to explore in the dark.\nEfforts to trace Dr Mosley are due to resume on Sunday morning.\nIn her statement, Dr Bailey Mosley said: \"It has been three days since Michael left the beach to go for a walk. The longest and most unbearable days for myself and my children.\n\"The search is ongoing and our family are so incredibly grateful to the people of Symi, the Greek authorities and the British Consulate who are working tirelessly to help find Michael.\n\"We will not lose hope.\"\nDr Bailey Mosley has been searching the island assisted by friends. The couple's four children have also arrived on Symi to help with the search. \nMichael Mosley went missing on Wednesday after leaving his wife on Agios Nikolaos beach about 13:30 local time (11:30 BST). \nHis wife later reported Dr Mosley, who did not have his phone, missing. \nBBC News has seen new CCTV - one of the last-known sightings - of a man believed to be Dr Mosley walking with an umbrella next to the marina in the village of Pedi on Wednesday, heading towards rocky hills.\nThe new footage, recorded at about 14:00 local time (12:00 BST), appears to show the man walking steadily and unaided, an unnamed police officer told BBC News.\nGreek authorities have since shifted their search operation to this part of the island. \nIn the mountainous terrain it would be easy to fall and injure yourself, or wander off the trail and get lost.\nOne theory that has emerged is that Dr Mosley was trying to take a much longer route than previously thought, passing over miles of exposed hillside. His accommodation was in the main town about 1 mile (1.6 km) from Pedi.\nWhen BBC News walked a short bit of the same path Dr Mosley is believed to have followed, under the midday sun, the effects of the heat could be felt quickly. \nSo far, police and firefighters have been using drones, a helicopter and a sniffer dog to try to locate the missing presenter.\nDivers have also been looking in the water, as well as patrol boats, private boats and commercial boats, Symi's coastguard said.\nSymi's mayor Eleftherios Papakaloudoukas said the search will continue until Dr Mosley is found.\nMr Papakaloudoukas added he was unsure why the missing presenter would try to make a long, potentially arduous journey in such heat, but hopes he is found \"safe and alive\".\nBefore moving into TV, Dr Mosley studied medicine in London and qualified as a doctor but for the last couple of decades has been working as a presenter, documentary maker, journalist and author.\nHe has appeared on BBC One's The One Show and ITV's This Morning. \nDr Mosley is also columnist for the Daily Mail and his TV programmes also include Channel 4 show Michael Mosley: Who Made Britain Fat? and BBC show Trust Me, I'm A Doctor. \nHis wife is also a doctor, author and healthy living advocate.\nWednesday 1330 local time (11:30 BST) - Dr Michael Mosley leaves his wife Clare on Agios Nikolaos beach and sets off on a walk\n1350 - Man carrying umbrella is seen on CCTV in Pedi\n1357 - Same man is seen again at Pedi's marina heading north-east\nThursday 1115 - Police are unable to find the presenter, so they inform Athens and request assistance from the Greek fire department\n1400 - Greek fire services, with six firefighters and a drone team, arrive in Symi\n1900 - Helicopter deployed to assist search\nFriday - Divers join the search in the water around Symi\nSaturday 0600 - Firefighters resume search for Dr Mosley\n1400 - His wife Clare says the Mosley family \"will not lose hope\" and thanks those involved in the search\nAdditional reporting by Insaf Abbas in Symi and Andre Rhoden-Paul in London",
    "Social media site X has taken action against a network smearing UK politicians, including Labour's Wes Streeting, with doctored clips - removing several accounts and posts.\nIt comes after a BBC investigation - part of its Undercover Voter project - revealed how a group of accounts had been creating and sharing the deepfake images ahead of the general election.\nThe accounts then posted misleading comments to bolster the impression the clips were real.\nThis is the first time X has responded to allegations I have raised with them in more than 12 months. I have contacted them more than a dozen times previously with no response. \nElon Musk bought the social media company, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022 and made various changes to the site. \nThis involved mass job losses, including in the social media site\u2019s communications team. \nAt one point, emails to X's press office triggered an automatic reply featuring a poo emoji. Now, the automatic response says \u201cBusy now, please check back later\u201d.\nAn X spokesperson told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections.\n\"We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"\nWhile some of the fake clips and comments shared by this group of accounts on X were clearly absurd and satirical, others falsely portrayed candidates saying politically damaging things. \nIn the comments, the network of X users works to make them appear believable. The videos have racked up tens of thousands of views.\nOne post included a doctored video of Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, on the BBC's Politics Live show. As the presenter discusses politician Diane Abbott, the footage is made to sound as though Mr Streeting is saying \"silly woman\" under his breath - but he never said those words.\nThe clip was shared by a user called Men for Wes who, in the comments, expressed outrage at the \"really nasty people\" in the Labour Party. Other users swarmed in the comments to endorse the clip as real. Mr Streeting denounced the clip as fake.\nSeveral hours after being shared, the doctored clips of Mr Streeting  was labelled as fake by X\u2019s reader-operated fact check service. Faked clips of Labour candidate Luke Akehurst, Keir Starmer and Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage were also posted by these accounts.\nFollowing my investigation, the Men for Wes account has been suspended by X and the videos from its account are no longer visible on the site. Some of the other profiles have also been removed.\nA spokesperson from X also told the BBC how more than \"500,000 contributors in 70 countries\" are participating in Community Notes, X\u2019s reader-operated fact check service.\nIt said in the UK the social media company is \"supporting efforts to increase digital literacy during the election period\".",
    "Schools across the UK are under unprecedented pressure as they struggle to address a range of social issues unrelated to teaching. A group of schools in the West Midlands town of Telford illustrate the problems. Here, for a growing number of pupils, simply getting to school is an achievement in itself.\nIt is lunchtime and a handful of pupils at Lantern Academy, a Telford primary school, are playing indoors even though the sun is out. As head teacher Michelle Skidmore approaches, they begin to gather their coats.\n\u201cAre you heading out?\u201d she asks. A five-year-old boy responds. It is not clear what he is saying, and Ms Skidmore tries to help. He repeats himself, four times in total, before she figures out that a family member of his has gone to hospital. He runs outside.\n\u201cWe have a number of children who struggle with basic communication,\u201d says Ms Skidmore. \u201c'Can I go to the toilet? Can I have a drink?\u2019 These are some of the basic sentences we have to teach our children to say.\u201d\nThe children, whose parents speak English at home and have no learning disabilities, are coming to school unable to communicate. The staff therefore have to teach them Makaton, a basic form of sign language that uses symbols and signs to allow them to express themselves.\nSome of the children who cannot talk are not toilet-trained either. At the start of Reception in September, eight of the 27 four-year-olds came to school in nappies. The school has had to develop \u201cintimate care plans\u201d to keep them clean as well as providing potty training.\nOne mother says her son was late reaching all his milestones, and had no interest in learning to use a potty before going to school.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t ready,\u201d she says. \u201cSo when we felt he was, the school really helped with that.\u201d\nA child in Year 1 is still not toilet-trained at six years old.\nMichelle Skidmore is the 14th head at the school since 2016. The high staff turnover reflects the challenges the school has faced in recent years.\nPolling suggests that most people think public services have deteriorated nationally in recent years. This article is the first of three focusing on the town of Telford, which a BBC News analysis has identified as facing particular challenges across its courts, schools and health services. Similar problems to those found in Telford are widespread, however.\nSituated in one of the most deprived areas of Telford, Lantern Academy was known as Queenswood Primary when it was run by the local authority, and rated as \u201cRequires Improvement\u201d by Ofsted. It was renamed to give it a fresh start when it joined a local multi-academy trust, the Learning Community Trust, two years ago.\nForty-eight per cent of pupils receive free school meals - about double the England average. But the new ethos that Ms Skidmore has worked hard to create is being severely tested by challenges resulting from the Covid pandemic. \u201cFor some people, the role of parenting has changed - 100%,\u201d she says.\nEducational experts and teaching unions say the forced closure of schools during the pandemic meant some families lost sight of the value of education. In some cases, they were too busy working to home school their children, or didn\u2019t have the space. When schools reopened, they placed less importance on ensuring their children attended.\nIn addition, many schools found that parents\u2019 mental health became strained. And this coincided with the closure of services where people with young children could meet, and receive professional support. Some parents today do not know how to play with their children, the school has discovered, so it now runs a weekly class to teach them.\n\u201cI keep going back to that competition element - my child\u2019s walking, my child\u2019s no longer in nappies - those milestone moments, they\u2019ve gone now because those parent and toddler groups, where you\u2019d see all that, have gone,\u201d Ms Skidmore says.\nParents at Lantern Academy also sometimes struggle to keep their children healthy. School welfare officers now sometimes accompany them to doctors\u2019 appointments, at the parents\u2019 request, so they can be confident of fully understanding the medical advice.\nChildren\u2019s mental health has also become an ever greater challenge since the pandemic, and it is the key driver behind the biggest problem faced by all the schools in the trust - attendance.\nThe trust has 7,000 pupils on its books across 13 schools - five primary, five secondary, two special schools and a pupil referral unit. At any time about 700 pupils, 10% of the total, are being looked after by a team of welfare officers employed to support teachers and families to get through the school year.\n\u201cWhen we're digging into the background problems now, we're noticing that things are getting more complex for a lot of children and families,\u201d says Nikki Morrison, a school welfare officer for 20 years, who leads a team of eight.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve higher rates of parental mental health issues, we've got the cost of living crisis, we've got children who are on waiting lists to be as",
    "All cats in England must be microchipped and registered on a database from Monday under new laws.\nThe new legislation applies to all cats aged 20 weeks and older, including indoor cats.\nThe RSPCA said that one in 10 cats going into their centres were still not microchipped, despite the incoming law change.\nPet owners found breaking the rules face a \u00a3500 fine if they do not comply within 21 days.\nData from a Cats Protection survey suggested about 1.9 million cats in England were not microchipped.  The charity said owners of about 300,000 cats were not sure if they were microchipped or not.\nMicrochipping involves a small chip being \"quickly and simply\" inserted under the animal's skin to give the pet its own unique code.\nThe chip can then be scanned and matched to the owner's contact details that are kept on a database.\nMicrochipping cats is not yet a legal requirement in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.\nVet Rory Cowlam, RSPCA ambassador and CBBC presenter, said: \u201cThe thought of a pet going missing and never being able to find them is a pet owner's nightmare, which is why microchipping is so important. \n\"Having microchipped many animals myself, I can assure you it\u2019s quick, easy and is the best way to ensure that if your pet does go missing, or becomes injured, they can be reunited with you. \u201c\nThe animal charity said the new rules would improve cat welfare, help track down missing pets and could stop owners abandoning their animals.\nThe RSPCA said last year more than 7,500 abandoned cats were reported to the charity and more than 1,500 so far this year.\nMicrochipping can be done by a vet or local rescue and rehoming centre and usually costs between \u00a320 or \u00a330.  It is also the owner\u2019s responsibility to update the database if they move home or their details change.\nCats Protection said recent research it had carried out showed cat owners who had not microchipped their pet felt it was unnecessary because their pet either did not go out or did not wander far.\nMadison Rogers, from the charity, said: \u201cSome owners think they are never going to go through the trauma of losing their pet cat, but in the last year 115,000 pet cats in England went missing and never returned home so this is much more common than people think.\u201d",
    "Four hostages kidnapped by Hamas have been reunited with their families, after being rescued in a raid that Palestinian officials say killed scores of people.\nNoa Argamani, 26, Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrei Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 41, were freed on Saturday, eight months since being kidnapped from the Nova music festival on 7 October.\nIsraeli forces, backed by air strikes, fought intense gun battles with Hamas in the Nuseirat area, in what the Israel Defense Forces called a \"high-risk, complex mission\".\nPalestinian officials say women and children were among those killed in the military assault.\nTwo hospitals in Gaza, al-Aqsa hospital and al-Awda hospital, said they had counted 70 bodies between them, while Hamas's government media office said at least 210 people had been killed in Israeli strikes in and around the al-Nuseirat refugee camp.\nIsrael estimated there were fewer than 100 casualties, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said.\nImages from the area show intense bombardment, and hospitals there said they were overwhelmed with casualties, including children, and that they were unable to treat everyone. Other photos show people mourning the dead.\nThe rare rescue of hostages - a joint operation conducted by the IDF,  Israel Security Agency and Israel Police - comes eight months into war with Hamas in Gaza. \nIDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said the mission was based on \"precise\" intelligence and the hostages were freed from two separate buildings in Nuseirat.\nIsraeli forces came under fire during the operation, he said. One special forces officer was wounded in the Gaza hostage rescue and later died in hospital, Israeli police said.\nThe IDF said the released hostages were all in good health, and they were later pictured embracing family members at a medical centre near Tel Aviv.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Israeli forces for operating \"creatively and bravely\".\n\"We will not let up until we complete the mission and return home all the hostages - both those alive and dead,\" he added.\nDefence Minister Yoav Gallant said special forces operated \"under heavy fire\" when rescuing the four hostages.\n\"This is one of the most heroic and extraordinary operations I have witnessed over the course of 47 years serving in Israel\u2019s defence establishment,\" Mr Gallant said.\nThe US also provided intelligence support to Israel in the raid, according to the BBC's partner CBS News which cited two American officials.\nThey added that US forces did not take part in the operation and the temporary pier in Gaza - which has now resumed aid deliveries after being damaged by heavy seas - was not used in the operation.\nMiss Argamani, a Chinese-born Israeli citizen, was kidnapped from the Nova festival and harrowing video footage from 7 October showed the 26-year-old being taken away on the back of a motorbike screaming, \"Don't kill me!\"\nFresh video of her being reunited with her father, smiling and embracing him on board a vehicle, was broadcast soon after news of the rescue operation on Saturday.\nMr Kozlov, a Russian who moved to Israel in 2022, and Mr Ziv had both been working as security guards at the festival when they were kidnapped. \nMr Jan had been due to start a job at a large tech company the day after he was kidnapped. \nThe Hostages Families Forum Headquarters, a group representing the families of the hostages, described the rescue as \u201ca miraculous triumph\u201d and thanked the IDF for the \u201cheroic operation\u201d.\nThe group added: \u201cThe Israeli government must remember its commitment to bring back all 120 hostages still held by Hamas \u2014 the living for rehabilitation, the murdered for burial.\u201d\nWhile there was jubilation in Israel, images and video showed death, injury and destruction in the area, including around the al-Nuseirat refugee camp.\nAccording to BBC Verify, it appeared that Israeli strikes took place across several locations in central Gaza, but Nuseirat - the location of the IDF operation to release four hostages - seems to have been hit hardest.\nOne video from the al-Aqsa hospital shows numerous people with injuries lying on the floor, while other videos showed a frequent stream of new patients being driven in by car and ambulance and carried into the building.\nThe Hamas government media office said at least 400 were wounded in the densely-populated area.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called for an emergency United Nations Security Council session to discuss what he has called \"the bloody massacre that was carried out by the Israeli forces\" in and around the al-Nuseirat refugee camp.\nThe European Union's high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell said on X: \"Reports from Gaza of another massacre of civilians are appalling.\n\"We condemn this in the strongest terms. The bloodbath must end immediately.\"\nThe rescue of hostages comes amid efforts for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. \nMr Netanyahu has been urged to reach an agreement but faces opposition from far-right alli",
    "A police officer who sang a \u201cclearly homophobic and offensive\u201d version of Wham!'s Last Christmas to colleagues has been sacked.\nFormer PC Leon Cunningham worked for Thames Valley Police in Reading, Berkshire, from November 2010.\nA panel found in a separate conversation with colleagues, he implied that being gay was \"a choice\u201d and referred to two female colleagues by an offensive term in a text message.\nThe panel concluded if the \u201cwell-respected and liked\u201d officer was not sacked, it would \u201cclearly undermine public trust and confidence in policing\u201d.\nMr Cunningham admitted he replaced the lyrics to the Christmas classic in November 2022 as it was being played on a radio in a police office.\nSome colleagues disputed his version of events, with one senior officer saying he mentioned the word \u201cbum\u201d.\nA senior officer said he told Mr Cunningham to stop singing \"homophobic songs\".\nThe panel also found he implied being gay was \"a choice, rather than natural\u201d in an earlier conversation with colleagues in April 2022.\nHe admitted using the offensive word in a text message, also in November 2022, but he said while the reference was \"objectively offensive... he did not intend to imply anything negative or sexual when using the term\".\nThe panel said Mr Cunningham\u2019s response to the allegations \u201cfailed to demonstrate any insight or reflections about his proven behaviour nor provide any reassurance\u201d about what he had learned from the proceedings.\nIt found his conduct was \u201cserious and clearly poses a potential risk of repetition to colleagues and members of the public with protected characteristics\u201d.\nKarimulla Akbar Khan, the panel's chairman, said if Mr Cunningham had been left to serve as a police officer, it would have sent \u201cthe wrong message that such conduct will be tolerated\u201d in the force.\nThe panel said Mr Cunningham should be added to the College of Policing's barred list. \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "South Korea has said it will resume propaganda broadcasts against North Korea for the first time in six years in response to Pyongyang's campaign of sending rubbish-filled balloons across the border.\nOver 300 North Korean balloons were detected over Saturday and Sunday with around 80 landing in the South carrying scrap paper and plastic sheets.\nNorth Korea is yet to respond to the announcement, but Pyongyang considers the loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts an act of war and has threatened to blow them up in the past.\nLast month North Korea appeared to send at least 200 balloons carrying rubbish over the border in retaliation for propaganda leaflets sent from the south.\nOver the weekend North Korea resumed its waste campaign against its neighbour by sending balloons carrying sacks of rubbish over the border into South Korea.\nIt was in retaliation for activists in the South sending 10 balloons containing leaflets critical of the North Korean regime on Friday, according to AFP news agency.\nSouth Korea's military said there are no more balloons in the air adding that no hazardous materials have been found. \nIt has warned the public not to touch the balloons and to be aware of falling objects. \nThe public should report any sightings to the nearest police or military unit, the military added.\nFollowing the latest batch of balloons, South Korea\u2019s National Security Council said loudspeaker broadcasts on the border would resume on Sunday after agreeing to restart the loudspeakers for the first time since 2018.\nOn Thursday an activist group in South Korea said it had flown balloons into North Korea carrying leaflets criticising the leader Kim Jong Un, dollar bills and USB sticks with K-pop music videos - which is banned in the North. \nIn recent years, the broadcasts have included news from both Koreas and abroad as well as information on democracy and life in South Korea. \nThe South Korean military claims the broadcasts can be heard as much as 10km (6.2 miles) across the border in the day and up to 24km (15 miles) at night.\nIn May, a South Korea-based activist group claimed it had sent 20 balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets and USB sticks containing Korean pop music and music videos across the border.\nSeoul's parliament passed a law in December 2020 that criminalises the launch of anti-Pyongyang leaflets, but critics have raised concerns related to freedom of speech and human rights.\nNorth Korea has also launched balloons southward that attacked Seoul's leaders.\nIn one such launch in 2016, the balloons reportedly carried toilet paper, cigarette butts and rubbish. Seoul police described them as \u201chazardous biochemical substances\u201d.\nWith additional reporting by Jake Kwon in Seoul",

    "A same-sex couple who adopted a child five years ago have said the BBC's new drama Lost Boys and Fairies had them both \"in tears\".\nThe three-part series, inspired by real experiences and filmed in Wales, follows the story of a gay couple who adopt a son.\nIt has received widespread acclaim from TV critics and viewers on social media for its frank portrayal of the adoption process from an LGBT perspective.\nMike, 45, said watching each episode had brought back \"a lot of memories\" for both himself and his partner Tony, 48.\nWarning: Article contains spoilers\nMike and Tony, who have been together for 20 years and live in south Wales, adopted their son when he was four years old.\n\"Watching the series, we were both in tears at certain points, there were certain triggers,\" said Mike.\n\"Not just because of the drama that\u2019s there but also because of the memories, and you realise how close it is to home.\"\nMike said starting a family was something both he and Tony had \"always wanted\".\n\"I always wanted to be a dad, Tony always wanted to be a dad.\n\"As the laws changed to allow more rights for LGBT people to become parents, it became something we wanted to do.\"\nMike said their experience of the adoption process was positive and their extended families were \"100% supportive\" throughout.\n\"We\u2019ve not had any negativity, although I know people do,\" he added.\nThe drama's opening episode sees the character Gabriel, played by Sion Daniel Young, tell his father that he and his partner, Andy, plan to adopt.\n\"I just think a child needs a mother,\" his father is seen telling him.\n\"A child doesn't need a mother. A child needs love,\" Andy responds.\nMike said this particular scene struck a chord with him.\n\"There\u2019s no reason why anybody shouldn\u2019t consider adopting,\" he said.\n\"There should be no stigma attached to it. If somebody can give a child love and a home, then that\u2019s it.\"\nIn the UK, prospective adopters can be single, married, in a civil partnership, part of an unmarried couple, or the partner of the child's parent, but they must be over 21.\nThe process to adopt, which involves an assessment from a social worker and a series of other checks, can take many months.\nThe series portrays the relationship which develops between Gabriel, Andy and their social worker, Jackie, as their adoption assessment progresses.\nMike said it reminded him of the friendship he and Tony formed with their own adoption social worker.\n\"We had an amazing social worker called Gayle and watching the TV programme we could see elements of Gayle in there\u2026 she put you at ease, she was so friendly and chatty. We still bump into her occasionally walking the dog.\"\nMike said he was also touched by the milestones portrayed in the series, such as when Gabriel drives his son Jake - played by Leo Harris - home for the first time.\n\"That first moment of getting in the car and driving him home and going 'yep, this is it now, we\u2019re dads'.\n\"It\u2019s a range of emotions that just go through you \u2013 it\u2019s like a family bringing home a baby after giving birth.\"\nMike said some of the hardest scenes to witness were the flashbacks to when Jake was first taken into care.\n\"That hurt,\" he said.\n\"Because you only know as much as the social worker. You don\u2019t know what went on behind closed doors.\"\nMike said he was pleased to see same-sex couples adopting in a TV series.\n\"You get adoption covered from a heterosexual point of view, I wouldn\u2019t say regularly, but it\u2019s been done,\" he said.\n\"But to see it from an LGBT background, I think it\u2019s great, because there may still be that stigma\u2026 and it\u2019s nice to prove that yes it is possible because there\u2019s a lot of us that do it.\n\"Our son doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s got two dads \u2013 he doesn\u2019t see anything negative about it.\"\nAll episodes of Lost Boys and Fairies are available on BBC iPlayer.

    "A picture of one of the freed Israeli hostages embracing her father after 8 months in captivity, features on many of the front pages. \nThe Sunday Times calls the image \"a photograph that restored hope to a nation\". It says the Israeli rescue operation has given an \"increasingly isolated and despairing nation... its greatest morale boost in months\". She's free! declares the Mail on Sunday.\nThe inside of the Sunday Mirror carries pictures of all four of the hostages who were rescued, with the headline \"free at last\".\nRishi Sunak has told the Sun on Sunday that his plan to change the benefits system will save \u00a312bn a year. He says failing to deal with the challenges facing it will lead to \"a huge waste in human potential, an increased benefits bill and higher taxes\".\nThe Sunday Telegraph picks up on a different Tory election pledge. It says the party would ensure climate targets take into account the cost to households. \nEnergy Secretary Clare Coutinho tells the paper that Labour's plan to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030 would \"risk blackouts\". The paper does not carry a response from Labour.\nThe Observer has more detail about Labour's plan to open \"80 new rape courts\" in England and Wales. It says the party would use them to fast track cases to tackle the backlog. The paper says Labour would also introduce \"specialist rape units in every police force\".\n\"Farage: We're now 'real' opposition\" is the headline in the Sunday Express. In a scathing interview, the Reform UK leader says the Tories cannot be the opposition if Labour wins the election because they \"spend their whole life arguing with each other\". He also calls the party \"snobby\".\nThe Mail on Sunday leads with an update on the search for Michael Mosley. It says divers have been hunting for the missing TV health expert in a \"dangerous cave complex known as the Abyss\". The paper says there are fears he could be trapped in the cave's \"endless\" underwater tunnel system.\n\"Our pain\" says the front page of the Sun - alongside a picture of Dr Mosley with his arm round his wife, Clare. The Express has pictures of rescue teams and volunteers scouring the cliffs for the broadcaster with the headline: \"Desperate family join search for TV doctor in scorching 40 Celsius heat\".\nSeveral of the papers marvel at Taylor Swift's performance - and costume changes - in Edinburgh. \"The Swifties' squeals can be heard in the Outer Hebrides\" says the Mail. There's yet more praise in the Times.

We will leave decisions on safe school streets and local traffic measures to local communities - not politicians in Westminster.\u201d\nLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"The Conservatives have had a year to do this since the Labour mayor brought it in; they've not done it. \n\"It's funny that they come up with these policies at election time.\u201d\nHe said what particularly \u201cangered a lot of people\u201d who drove into London from areas such as Surrey, Sussex, Hertfordshire and Kent, was that \u201cthey didn't get any help for a car scrappage scheme\u201d.\nGreen London Assembly member Caroline Russell said: \"Ulez is installed under the current powers of the Mayor of London so the Conservatives need to come clean about how they plan to take those powers away.\n\u201cLondoners like breathing cleaner air and have just voted in May overwhelmingly in favour of parties that support our London-wide clean air zone.\"\nIn August, Ulez was expanded to include outer London.

Completely unforgivable. Shameful.\n\"And it is Rishi Sunak who will have to answer for his actions.\"\nFirst Minister John Swinney, who attended the commemorations in Portsmouth and Normandy, said Mr Sunak had been \"rendered useless\".\nAnd he suggested voters would punish the Conservative Party on 4 July.\nSpeaking in Livingston, West Lothian, he said: \"I think Rishi Sunak's credibility is completely destroyed by his departure from D-Day early and the insult he delivered to the veterans who had travelled to Normandy for that solemn occasion.\n\"It also, frankly, was a desertion of the international responsibilities of the Prime Minister.\"\nScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said Mr Sunak should have remained at the commemoration event rather then travelling to London for an ITV interview.\nBut he dismissed calls for the prime minister to resign.\nHe told BBC Scotland News: \"I don't think he needs to consider his position but I think he should read into the criticism, that people are obviously concerned about what he did.\n\"That's why he apologised and I think he was right to apologise.\"\nThe prime minister apologised on Friday but urged people not to politicise the event.\nMr Sunak said he cared deeply about veterans and was honoured to attend services in Portsmouth and France.\nHe added: \"After the conclusion of the British event in Normandy, I returned back to the UK. \n\"On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer - and I apologise.\"\nScottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton predicted the prime minister's actions would have far-reaching consequences.\nWriting on X he said: \"During elections there are moments in time that don\u2019t just punctuate the campaign, but can define or even end an entire career.\n\"Rishi Sunak\u2019s abandonment of the D-Day commemorations and the veterans we honour on the beaches of Normandy feels like one such moment.\"",

    "Two soldiers killed in a World War One battle 110 years ago are finally going to be laid to rest.\nSgt John Smith from Gloucestershire and Gunner Charles Lightfoot from Edinburgh served with the 29th Battery of Royal Field Artillery.\nThey died during the Battle of Aisne in France in September 1914, but their bodies were not found until 2009.\nTheir families will travel to France next week to pay their respects to the fallen soldiers on behalf of their late relatives, who never found out what happened to them.\nSgt Smith and Gunner Lightfoot were presumed missing until 15 years ago, when French historian Jerome Buttet discovered an inscription in a cave near Chassemy.\nIt read: \"15 Sept 1914, Here lies Sjt Smith and 3 Gnrs, 29th Battery RFA\".\nMr Buttet brought in archaeologists, who discovered two sets of remains in the cave.\nMinistry of Defence (MoD) detectives at Imjin Barracks in Gloucestershire carried out research and DNA testing, which allowed them to identify the two fallen men as Sgt Smith and Gunner Lightfoot.\nSgt Smith's great nephew, Andrew Smith said he was \"amazed\" to receive a message from Gunner Lightfoot's granddaughter in 2018.\n\"I've known about my great uncle since I was a small boy, but the information I had was quite scanty,\" Mr Smith, who lives in Willsbridge near Bristol, said. \n\"He was my grandfather's brother, and I was very, very fond of my grandfather.\n\"To be able to pay my respects to him, I'm almost doing it for my grandfather.\"\nThe incredible discovery has brought the families of the two soldiers together.\nGunner Lightfoot's granddaughter Sue Kruk, who lives near Portsmouth, got in touch with Mr Smith to make him aware of the discovery.\nMs Kruk was told about her grandfather as a young girl, and was \"delighted\" to receive confirmation that the remains were that of Gunner Lightfoot.\n\"It means the world, I know how much it meant to my grandmother and my mother,\" she said.\n\"It's closure at long last.\"\nMarcus Gibbons, from Malmesbury in Wiltshire, is also a great nephew of Sgt Smith.\nHe and Mr Smith did not know each other until the MOD investigation, but will both travel to the Vendresse British War Cemetery in France, along with other family members, for the reburial service next week.\nMr Gibbons said he was not made aware of Sgt Smith until two-and-a-half months ago.\n\"It's great he's finally being laid to rest with respect,\" Mr Gibbons said.\n\"I think it's incredible work that the war detectives have done in identifying him.\n\"It's a shame he was taken so young.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

They have four - what might feel very long - weeks to go.\nA loyal minister says there are only two options now: \u201cLose your head or get on with the campaign.\u201d\nIn the frenzy of campaigns, just like in politics and life in general, everyone makes mistakes sometimes.\nThis one is almost impossible to fathom.\nIt wasn\u2019t a split-second decision that went the wrong way, or a hot-mic moment like Gordon Brown\u2019s grisly \"bigoted woman\" comment about Gillian Duffy back in 2010. It was a deliberate choice made in advance.\nSunak\u2019s decision to miss some of the ceremony was always likely to cause diplomatic offence and upset veterans. And from a campaigning point of view, he was turning down some of the most powerful images any candidate could dream of, to be seen alongside the American President, the Royal Family and military figures.\nHis early departure meant he wasn't part of a photograph of world leaders. Instead Foreign Secretary David Cameron was pictured standing alongside President Biden, France's President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nIt should have been a golden opportunity for the prime minister to project strength, particularly when the Conservatives are trying to portray Labour as weak on defence. \u201cIt was a no brainer,\u201d one minister says. \u201cWhy not pick up the $100m bill on the floor?\u201d\nA quick apology is just about the only aspect of affair that was not a disaster.\nThe danger for the Conservatives now is not just that the D-day blunder colours the election conversation, but that fear and loathing inside the campaign bursts into the open.\nIn the seven-party BBC debate last night, the saga gave the smaller parties a political gift - Nigel Farage blasted the PM for being \u201cunpatriotic\u201d.\nSunak is, I\u2019m told \u201cgenuinely remorseful\u201d about what happened and has acted in government to try to help veterans, so this stings.\nBut even before this, there were fears that Reform UK, under Farage\u2019s leadership, could nudge past the Conservatives in polling, possibly in the next few days.\n\u201cIf Reform overtake [it] will lead to total panic,\u201d a party source told me. No doubt Sunak\u2019s early exit is particularly tricky because it\u2019s likely to upset precisely those voters the Conservatives have been trying to entice back.\nAll of the smaller parties, for whom it can be hard to get a word in edgeways, were able to hammer the Tories last night with what seemed genuine indignation.\nIt was also noticeable that they are all assuming a Labour victory \u2013 indeed, they are trying to turn that projection to their campaigning advantage.\nThe Greens, Plaid and the SNP all, in various ways, tried to portray themselves as the ones who can keep Labour honest, to hold the party to its left-wing roots and stop it becoming what they claim would be a softer pastiche of the Tories.\nOne source told me: \u201cIt\u2019s clear the smaller parties are the only challenge to Labour, and that\u2019s part of their way into the debate. It\u2019s clear the Tories aren\u2019t winning so who holds Labour to account?\u201d\nIndeed one senior Conservative source believes the share of the vote for the smaller parties is likely to be the highest it\u2019s ever been this time round. Let\u2019s see.\nMy regular reminder: voters are volatile, and there is a long time left in this campaign.\nBut as we talked about last week, if Labour wins, it might have to get used to much of the pressure coming from the broad left.\nPlaid and the SNP also both made positive arguments for immigration - a rare moment in politics in 2024. An SNP insider said their party \u201cactually has something to say, breaking the conspiracy of silence on cuts, on Brexit and on migration too\u201d.\nThe Lib Dems - who are having the bounciest of campaigns \u2013 admit that for smaller parties, \u201cthe existential challenge is not that people don\u2019t like your policies: it\u2019s that people literally forget you exist\u201d.\nSmaller parties sometimes have to be the fastest, the funniest, or the most controversial to cut through.\nThere is no doubt in this general election, though, that smaller parties could hold a lot of sway. See how often Keir Starmer\u2019s been campaigning in Scotland to try to humble the SNP.\nOr just ask Conserv",
    "Taylor Swift is not just a musical phenomenon, but a business unicorn too. \nThe Eras tour which has arrived in Edinburgh is reckoned to be pushing her wealth well north of $1bn (\u00a3785.51m).\nForbes, the money magazine, reckons she is worth $600m (\u00a3471m) from performance and her back catalogue is worth as much, while she has around $125m  (\u00a398.2m) worth of real estate.\nOther musicians who have reached such heights have done so by investing their musical earnings in other ventures.\nThis daughter of Pennsylvania, and of a financial broker, mints money with astute leverage of her market power. It's known as Swiftonomics. \nShe is reputed to demand more than 100% of gross ticket sales, leaving the promoters to make their margins from sales of food and drink and extras. That's why they want ticket-holders to get there early.\nBy doing multiple nights at one venue, she cuts touring costs and forces her fans to come to her. \nAs Edinburgh is showing and London soon will, they do so in very big numbers, some over long distances.\nWe are told that financial savvy is part of her appeal to the fanbase. \nShe took on Apple over royalties for tracks streamed on its music service, and she won. She did the same with Spotify, refusing to let her songs go on its free-to-use service.\nHarvard Law School uses her as an example of negotiating power, saying in its teaching materials: \"Taylor Swift was able to turn her back on negotiations with Spotify because she had no shortage of other negotiating partners eager to work with her.\"\nThe 34-year old is smart and has become very rich both by dictating terms to music industry bosses and by selling to that fan base. And they love her for it.\nAfter she sold the rights to her earlier recordings to an investment company, she rebelled against its constraints on her artistic freedom. \nWhile the investor had rights to those recordings, she retained the composer's rights, and has re-recorded multiple albums, persuading her fans to buy the re-records as the preferable and definitive collector's item. Fans do so over the originals by a ratio of 4:1. \nThis is not just about streaming.\nThe return of vinyl records has put them back into the basket of commonly-purchased goods included in the inflation survey for the Office for National Statistics.\nTaylor Swift has a sizeable share of that vinyl market, often selling to people with no turntable, but who choose to collect for the artwork.\nIs she a one-off? Possibly. But Scots author Will Page, a former chief economist at Spotify, reckons she has skilfully captured the opportunities arising out of fundamental disruption.\nOthers may not reach her heights of financial success, but he thinks she points the way for others to follow.\nMr Page said: \"She has raised the bar in terms of what an artist can achieve in this complex value chain, both from streams and tickets.\"\nSo let\u2019s take a look at some of the trends in the music industry that Taylor Swift represents.\nDigital streaming threatened to destroy the industry while downloads could be pirated. \nBut the industry fought back and streaming replaced sales of vinyl, cassettes and, more recently, CDs and DVDs.\nThat put immense market power in the hands of a small number of platforms.\nSpotify is focused on music and podcasts, while that is only part of the business model for Amazon, Apple and YouTube.\nBut distribution costs of streaming are tiny compared with the price of boxing up hardware and trucking it out to shops. \nWithout them, artists can claim a much higher proportion of a download sale than they could earn from a CD \u2013 as much as 30% compared with a maximum of 15%.\nStreaming also offers unlimited space for people to enter the market place.  \nMr Page said the \"supply side explosion is beyond anyone\u2019s imaginings\".\nHe added: \"Spotify can have 120,000 tracks uploaded in one day, which is more than all the music released in 1989.\"\nMr Page said the industry was making more money but had \"more mouths to feed,\" with nine million creators on Spotify alone. \nIn 2009, the Performing Rights Society had 50,000 song-writers. It has 173,000 now.\nHe said: \"The population of artists and songwriters in the UK has tripled since Spotify\u2019s launch. That\u2019s a positive story. How do you feed them all? That\u2019s another story.\"\nDigital downloads let artists like Taylor Swift launch her album as a global event. Everyone can download on that day.\nTwo trends arise from this. One is that it\u2019s easy to reach your fan base, and listeners to new music are increasingly turning to those who sing in their own language. \nThe top 10 most streamed tracks in each European country can be dominated by those countries\u2019 musicians.\nSo the dominance of English language is waning. That makes it more difficult to market international stars.\nThe other is that listeners to music and viewers of song videos turn to streaming platforms to sample new bands. \nThey are less likely to go out to pubs and clubs, in the hope of seeing the Next Big Thing while it's sti",
    "An appeal has been made for volunteers to help clear Himalayan Balsam from a site owned by the Woodland Trust.\nThe plant is considered an invasive species in the UK and has taken hold across the country - including at the Smithills Estate near Bolton.\nIt is hoped volunteers can help remove the balsam before the plant flowers in July and August and the seeds are scattered across the ground.\n In a short space of time, Himalayan Balsam can smother other vegetation as it grows and spreads.\nHimalayan Balsam was first imported to the UK by Victorian botanists in 1839, as a garden plant. It has no natural rivals and can reach a height of up to three metres. \nIt can quickly dominate ditches and streams because its seeds travel in the water, meaning riverbanks can quickly become infested. \nThe result is that native species struggle to survive. \nRoberta Gleaves of  the Woodland Trust at the Smithills Estate said: \"We want to try and get rid of Himalayan Balsam. We've got quite a lot of different patches of it across the site and we need loads of hands to try and pull it out. \n\"Its important to do this before it flowers in July and August because the seeds scatter everywhere. Its a problem because it changes the soil, so not many other plants can grow around it.\" \nThe Woodland Trust is looking for volunteers throughout the summer. \nMs Gleaves said removing the Himalayan Balsam could be therapeutic: \"You're just pulling plants out of the ground - but it's a great wellbeing task because of the sound it makes, and the repetitiveness of the action. \n\"We've got 90 volunteers signed up to the Smithills Estate but we're always looking for more. The more hands the better, because it covers a wider area in a shorter space of time.\"\nThe Smithills Estate was bought by the Woodland Trust in 2015 and is the size of around 1000 football pitches. \nIts a mix of grassland, farmland, moorland, wooded cloughs and bog habitats, crisscrossed by dry stone walls.\n Since 2015, the Woodland Trust has planted 130,000 trees at the Smithills Estate. They've also planted thousands of sphagnum moss plugs - which hold water. This helps to keep the moorland wet and prevents the spread of wildfires.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Campaigners calling for Sheffield to be recognised as the \"home of football\" have said they remain confident that a museum dedicated to the sport will open in the city.\nThe Sheffield Home of Football (SHOF) charity said the \"longer-term aspiration\" would need about \u00a32m in funding.\nThey even want Sheffield to be designated as a World Heritage Site for its contribution to football's history.\nThere are about 50 footballing \"firsts\" the city can lay claim to with evidence, including being the place where the modern rules of the game were invented and being home to the world's oldest club, Sheffield FC.\nHistorian and SHOF trustee Steve Wood said he was \"convinced\" funding opportunities would \"come along at some point\".\nHe said: \"The short-term aspiration is to do all the things that can get us there.\"\nCurrently, Yorkshire has just two places that have been granted World Heritage Site status by Unesco; the village of Saltaire near Bradford, and Fountains Abbey near Ripon.\nThe charity argues that the significance of football to Sheffield is as important as the association between Liverpool and The Beatles.\nThe trustees have plans for regular walking tours and an app that will guide users around places of footballing interest.\nMr Wood said Sheffield \"has the credentials\" to be recognised by Unesco as the official home of football.\n\"If there's one place that can have that argument then it's Sheffield,\" he said.\n\"There isn't anywhere that comes close. It's all there really, in terms of making a claim.\"\nLast Saturday a blue plaque was unveiled at 9 East Parade in the city centre to commemorate Sir Nathaniel Creswick, a \"founding father\" of the game who worked in the building.\nOther influential figures in the development of football lived and worked nearby, said Mr Wood.\n\"You associate Stratford with Shakespeare, you associate the Cavern Club in Liverpool with The Beatles.\n\"If you go to the Amazon and talk to the local people, show them a copy of Revolver, Shakespeare's books and a football, we are quite confident which one most people will recognise.\n\"Football is bigger than Shakespeare and The Beatles, so therefore 9 East Parade is Sheffield's Cavern Club.\"\nThe building itself - now a law firm's offices - would be too small for a museum, Mr Wood said.\n\"Nearby there are lots of buildings up for lease. There are possibilities in that part of the centre of Sheffield to develop something.\n\"A museum is still an aspiration for Sheffield because Sheffield, being the birthplace for football, does need somewhere to display things.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Europeans in 27 countries are voting in elections that will have a wide impact across the European Union and beyond.\nOver four days until the end of Sunday 9 June, about 373 million voters are eligible to vote from Finland in the north to Cyprus in the south, Ireland in the west to Bulgaria in the east.\nAt stake is the make-up of the next European Parliament, the direct link between Europeans and the EU's institutions.\nHow Europeans vote will shape the direction of the EU over the next five years, on climate change and migration, greater integration or increased nationalism.\nRight-wing and far-right parties have made significant gains across Europe, and this shift to the right is likely to be reflected in the next European Parliament. \nThe Parliament, based in Brussels and Strasbourg, passes laws that affect the lives of EU citizens and has the job of endorsing the annual budget, which this year reached \u20ac189bn (\u00a3160bn). It shares that power with the Council, made up the EU's national governments.\nThe result of EU elections also has a bearing on who will be president of the European Commission.\nVoting began on Thursday 6 June in the Netherlands, followed by Ireland and the Czech Republic on Friday, then Italy, Latvia, Malta and Slovakia on Saturday. The majority of EU member states are voting on Sunday.\nMost voting takes place on one day although Czechs have until the end of Saturday to cast their ballots, and Italians have from Saturday afternoon until late on Sunday to vote. Belgians are not just voting in European elections on Sunday, but in national and regional elections too.\nIn most EU countries you have to be 18 to vote, but if you're 16 you can vote in Germany, Austria, Belgium and Malta, while in Greece the minimum age is 17. In a handful of countries including Luxembourg and Bulgaria, voting is compulsory.\nResults are decided by proportional representation, so every vote counts, although some countries have a minimum electoral threshold of up to 5%. Average turnout in 2019 was 50.7%.\nBy the end of Sunday 9 June it will be clear which parties have won the Parliament's 720 seats, 15 more than in 2019. The UK took part in the last European elections before leaving the EU, and some of its seats have since been redistributed or kept in reserve if the EU expands.\nThe number of MEPs each country has is proportionate to its population. Germany, the EU's most populous country, has 96 while France has 81 and Italy 76. Greece, Sweden, Portugal and the Czech Republic all have 21 while Malta, Luxembourg and Cyprus have the minimum number of six each.\nAs the only EU institution directly elected by voters across 27 countries, it connects European citizens to the two other big institutions: the EU's executive branch - the European Commission - and the Council, which is made up of ministers from EU governments.\nThe European Parliament shapes the direction of EU laws and policies by amending and passing laws and deciding on international agreements and enlargements. It must endorse the EU's annual budget, and it can ask the Commission to propose legislation. \nMEPs oversee the work of the Commission and Council. They share responsibility with the Council for adopting laws put forward by the Commission.\nMost MEPs sit in political groups ranging from left to right, rather than by nationality, so they often have juggle allegiances to party or country. \nTraditionally the two biggest are the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) and the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), but others groups have become increasingly significant.\nThe liberal Renew Europe group and the Greens/European Free Alliance were the next biggest in the last parliament, but two groups made up of right-wing and far-right parties have set their sights on big gains.\nThey are the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the Identity and Democracy (ID) group. \nTwo smaller groups play a key role too. One is the smaller left-wing GUE/NGL grouping, the other is the MEPs not aligned to any group - from Hungary's nationalist Fidesz members to the handful of separatists from Spain's Catalonia region.\nAlthough the main purpose of the June election is to decide the make-up of parliament, voters often use the occasion to send a message to their national governments. \nFrom Italy to France, Austria to Belgium, Germany to the Netherlands and beyond, parties on the far right are eyeing significant gains. A Dutch exit poll has already placed Geert Wilders' Freedom Party almost neck and neck with a left-green alliance.\nPolls suggest the two groups on the right, ECR and ID, could overtake the centre left and become the second largest force in Parliament. However, Germany's far-right AfD has been expelled from the ID group because of a series of scandals.\nUntil now the centre right has tended to work together with the centre left but the EPP may come under pressure to seek new allies if the centre left performs badly.\nA move to th",

    "Wales' first minister Vaughan Gething says he wants a \"new start\" after losing a vote of no confidence in the Welsh Parliament.\nMr Gething said he would not resign after 29 Senedd members voted in favour of the no-confidence motion, with 27 voting against, accusing opposition parties of \"political opportunism\" during a general election campaign. \nThe Welsh Conservatives called the vote over donations made to Mr Gething's leadership campaign by a company owned by a man previously convicted of environmental offences. \nThe Tories and Plaid Cymru have both called for the first minister to resign. \nMr Gething, who was campaigning in south Wales on Saturday, said: \"If we can carry on and find a way through to have a new start, that\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in doing.\"\nHis comments come after Labour MS Jenny Rathbone said the first minister\u2019s future looked \"very uncertain\" after the vote, adding that \"the reputation of the Senedd is at risk\" due to ongoing questions around the \u00a3200,000 donation.\nMr Gething said the party needed to be able to have \"trusted conversations\" with each other.\n\"I know it\u2019s difficult for people in my own party - it\u2019s been difficult for me and my family, but I need to think what\u2019s the right thing to do for my country.\"\nHe also denied that the decision to continue was undermining the Senedd, saying the opposition parties\u2019 decision not to allow a \"pairing\" process to account for the two absent Labour members was a \"breach of normal convention\".\n\"I\u2019m not ignoring the vote. I realise though, there was a formal process to go through, and that wasn\u2019t the choice that was made,\" he said.\nWith 30 MSs in the 60-seat chamber, Labour does not have an overall majority in the Senedd and could now face difficulties passing financial plans and legislation if opposition parties refuse to cooperate.\nMr Gething said \"there is a choice now whether the country can function, whether government can function, whether the Senedd can function\".\n\"Are we prepared to stop the whole institution from working based on the immediate politics of the general election? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do.\"\nTom Giffard, Conservative MS for South Wales West , accused Mr Gething of \"ignoring\" what the Senedd, and the Welsh people, were saying to him, describing it as \"very arrogant\".\nHe said the Labour group was \"weak and divided\", adding Mr Gething could not control it, likely leading to legislation not being passed.\n\"There\u2019s two ways we can break the impasse. Either Vaughan Gething has to resign, or we should call a Senedd election,\" he said.\nBut Mr Giffard said the Conservatives would not rule out working with Mr Gething in the future, particularly when it came to passing budgets.\n\"I think it\u2019s unlikely that we would work \u2013 even find agreement quite frankly \u2013 on most issues,\" he said, adding the Conservatives were \"always happy to work for the betterment of the people of Wales\".\nPlaid Cymru\u2019s Mabon ap Gwynfor, MS for Dwyfor Meirionydd, accused Mr Gething of acting with \"contempt\" towards the Senedd.\n\"The Senedd elects the first minister, and in this instance the first minister has lost the confidence of the Senedd, therefore he should respect that.\n\"His refusal to step down shows contempt to the Senedd and to the people of Wales and he should consider his position,\" he said.\nBut Mr ap Gwynfor said Plaid Cymru would also consider cooperating with Labour \"on a case-by-case basis\" for passing budgets and legislation.",
    "Imagine packing your possessions into bags, saying goodbye to family members and closing the front door of your home, not sure when you will be safe to return. \nThat's what some of the 180,000 Ukrainian refugees now in the UK experienced before moving here under the Homes for Ukraine scheme when Russian forces invaded their homeland in February 2022.\nTwo years on, what is life like for those who fled and set up new lives in the west of England?\nOlha Stukman, 33, lived in the western city of Khmelnytskyi when the war broke out.\nOlha said when she and her 11-year-old daughter Mira first arrived at the home of sponsors Julie and John Reynard in Cheddar, Somerset, she \"could only look at everything with frightened eyes\".\n\"When we first arrived everything was foreign.

    "WNBA rookie Caitlin Clark, the women's basketball phenom who has taken the world by storm, created a sea of orange at a Washington arena on Friday night.\nThe city's residents and locals from nearby communities in Maryland and Virginia appeared much more keen to don Clark's orange Indiana Fever jersey when seeing the star athlete play in the US capital on Friday, rather than wear the red and blue of the hometown Washington Mystics.\nAnd when announcers read Clark's name before the start of the game - which the Fever went on to win in a nailbiter - the crowd roared in support of the basketball star.\n\"I'm technically a Wizards fan,\" said 26-year-old Maryland resident Briana Florez, referring to the local NBA basketball team, \"and a Washington fan in general - but tonight, we're Caitlin Clark fans.\"\nThe cheers of approval of Clark that rocked the arena in Washington on Friday came after a week of speculation and debate about her treatment in games since she entered the league in March.\nThe much-anticipated prospect has faced tough defensive coverage and strong challenges from fellow players in the months she\u2019s been dribbling on a WNBA court.\nMany of Clark's supporters have pointed to a few especially bruising moves that she has faced, but most noted a foul that was replayed on sports shows for the past week and sparked the nationwide conversation in the US about the player's tough treatment.\nDuring a game last Saturday, Chicago Sky guard Chennedy Carter gave Clark a sharp shoulder-check that caused the rookie to fall over and spill onto the ground.\nNew fans and analysts - many of whom are giving the WNBA a closer look now that it is seeing a sharp rise in popularity - called foul over the past week, but longtime women's basketball viewers said that these were overreactions.\n\"I'm just taken aback that the new fans are so shocked,\" said Candace Buckner, a sports columnist with the Washington Post who regularly writes about women's basketball.\n\"It's a contact sport,\" she added. \"It's almost as if you were a new opera fan and you were surprised there was music.\"\nFans at the game in Washington on Friday gave a mixed response after a week of heated coverage. Some said Clark was receiving an unnecessarily tough welcome to a sharp-elbowed league, while others said she was simply being closely guarded due to her talent.\n\"I think she is treated a little bit harshly,\" said Susan Abed, a 63-year-old business owner who came to Washington from her home in Virginia to watch Clark play. \"I mean, I think a lot of players probably are jealous because of the money she's making.\"\nAshley See, a 38-year-old librarian, said that \"you're gonna get hit. It's just the nature of the sport\".\n\"It's not a full contact sport, so nobody's expecting you're going to get, like, laid out,\" she added. \"But, you know, I think a little bit of contact is normal.\"\nCarter's shove that caused Clark to take a spill was ultimately upgraded to a flagrant foul by the league, after it received intense media scrutiny and public criticism.\nFever coach Christie Sides called Carter's foul \"unacceptable\", and said the team had sent the league a collection of plays - in which they allege Clark had been inappropriately treated - for review.\n\"It's tough to keep getting hammered the way she does and to not get rewarded with free throws or foul calls,\" Sides said last week.\nFans at the Fevers-Mystics game on Friday noted that the league and its players have to respect and appreciate the woman who has brought new life to the WNBA - a sports league that has struggled for years to develop a strong audience.\n\"At the end of the day, they're all WNBA players, they're all in the same league and whatever's good for one person in the league is probably good for a lot of people in the league,\" Ms See said. \"There are chances for more players to get the spotlight and she's just sort of the trailblazer.\"\nClark drew massive crowds to Iowa City - a secluded community of 75,000 in the middle of farm country - when she played at the University of Iowa. In college, she established herself as a once-in-a-generation phenomenon, and a player that people have to watch.\nOnce she was drafted as the first overall pick by the Indiana Fever in April, her incandescent star power carried that flock of new fans to the WNBA - a professional league that has struggled to maintain a strong fandom. Last year, WNBA teams saw an average of 6,615 fans in attendance at their games.\nClark's new team already surpassed its total home attendance of the entire 2023 season after just five games. With Clark\u2019s fans fuelling the league\u2019s meteoric growth, the Fever have seen an average of 15,886 fans across their first 11 games, both home and away.\nInterest in Friday's game in Washington was so high that it was moved from the 4,200-seat Entertainment & Sports Arena in the southern reaches of the city to the Capital One Arena. The 20,300-seat home of the NBA's Washington Wizards is right in the heart of the US capita",
    "Council planners have given permission to erect a statue of a prominent suffragette in her hometown to honour its women.\nLady Rhondda, born Margaret Haig-Thomas, grew up in Newport and led a 40-year campaign for women to be allowed to sit in the House of Lords.\nSadly, she died before the law she fought for was changed, too late to take her own seat.\nCouncil officers gave the green light for the bronze 8ft (2.43m) statue to be placed on the eastern side of the Millennium Footbridge in Newport city centre.\nIt is being sculpted by artist Jane Robbins, will be the fourth in a series of five statues celebrating inspirational Welsh women.\nLady Rhondda's statue has won the support of those living near the proposed site, with a dozen letters of support \u2013 and no objections.\nOne respondent said it was \"about time that Newport had a statue of a woman in the city\".\n\"It's great that she's finally getting the recognition that she deserves,\" they added.\nAnother supporter said the statue \"shines a strong light on the role of women, and in particular a famous leader of women and the suffragette movement who lived in Newport for most of her active life\".\nLast year, a statue of the poet Cranogwen, her bardic name, became only the third sculpture in Wales of a real woman.\nA pioneer in many fields she challenged expectations of women during the Victorian era and became the first woman to win a poetry prize at the National Eisteddfod.\nBorn in Llangrannog, Ceredigion, in 1839 as Sarah Jane Rees, she became one of Wales' most popular poets and also worked as a head teacher, ship's captain, campaigner and journalist.\nIn 2022, A statue of Elaine Morgan, one of Wales' leading writers and feminists, was unveiled in her home town in Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nThe coal miner's daughter, who excelled in both the arts and science, died in 2013 at the age of 92.\nIn 2021, a monument to honour Betty Campbell, Wales' first black head teacher and black history campaigner, was unveiled in Cardiff in what was believed to be the first statue of a named, non-fictional woman in an outdoor public space in Wales.\nMrs Campbell, who died in 2017, proved her doubters wrong after being told as a child that her dream job as a head teacher was \"insurmountable\".\nThe statue was commissioned following a BBC Wales Hidden Heroines poll after a panel of experts made a list of 50 historic Welsh women after finding there were no statues celebrating heroines in Wales.\nCampaign group Monumental Welsh Women has said its fifth and final statue will honour Elizabeth Andrews (1882-1960), described as \"one of the most influential Welsh female political activists of the early 20th century\".\nAs the first Labour Party women's organiser for Wales, she set up women's sections, describing them as \"working women's universities\".\nOne of her earliest tasks was translating leaflets from English to Welsh to urge women to use their newly-won vote.",
    "\u201cHoly crap they are good. I need more Tiny Habits!\u201d\nThose were the words of rock legend David Crosby, posted to his Twitter profile in May 2022.\nHe\u2019d just stumbled across the music of three college students from Boston, whose lush harmonies and bucolic melodies reminded him of his own work in Crosby, Stills and Nash.\nBefore long, other musicians took note. Kacey Musgraves invited them to sing with her, Noah Kahan took them on tour and Elton John (it\u2019s always Elton John, isn\u2019t it?) championed them on his radio show.\n\u201cThey\u2019re delicious,\u201d he enthused. \u201cWe love them.\u201d\nThe band are still overwhelmed.\n\u201cThe question we keep asking is, how do they know about us - all of these people we've looked up to for, like, ever?\u201d marvels singer Maya Rae.\n\u201cLike, with David Crosby, that was only five months into us being a band, and he found us on some YouTube video.\u201d\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s the power of social media,\u201d says her bandmate Cinya Kahn.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re sending these people our music!\u201d\nSince Crosby\u2019s tweet, the trio have gone from viral videos to a headline act with impressive speed.\nThey\u2019ve just finished a sold-out European tour and released a critically-acclaimed debut album, All For Something, recorded with Phoebe Bridgers\u2019 producer, Tony Berg.\n\u201cYou can't process all this stuff in the moment,\u201d says the band\u2019s final member/gentle giant, Judah Mayowa.\n\u201cIt just happens, then I look back later and think, \u2018Wow, we actually did that. That was kinda cool.\u201d\n\nThe Tiny Habits story begins, as all good stories should, in a university toilet.\nAll three members had enrolled in Boston\u2019s prestigious Berklee College of Music, only to have their studies disrupted by the pandemic.\n\u201cSo basically the way you would make friends was on Instagram,\u201d recalls Maya, who\u2019d joined the school as an international student from Canada.\n\u201cCinya posted an Instagram story about not knowing how to use the toilet roll holders in our dorm building. So I swiped up and said, \u2018Me neither, let me know if you work it out.'\n\u201cA while later, she saw the DM and was like, \u2018Hey, I figured it out\u2019.\n\u201cShe sent me a whole video about how to use it and we met up and sang that night in my room. The rest is history.\u201d\nThey completed the trio with Alabama-born student Judah, whose music they\u2019d also discovered on Instagram, but the chemistry wasn\u2019t instantaneous.\n\u201cIt might have been if I wasn't so nervous!\u201d laughs Cinya. \u201cBut we\u2019d not been socialising because of Covid, so we were facing the terror of being around people again and also singing with them.\u201d\n\u201cBut as we kept doing it we all realised, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s something exciting here\u2019,\u201d adds Maya.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the singing,\u201d says Judah. \u201cI was like, \u2018Hey, I kind of like these people\u2019.\u201d\n\nThey started off with covers. Recording themselves in college stairwells and cramped bathrooms, they\u2019d re-arrange pop hits like Kelly Clarkson\u2019s Breakaway and Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s Call Me Maybe as melancholy folk songs.\nAt first, they posted videos to their individual Instagram accounts, where they mingled with photos of nights out, trips to Disneyland and, in Judah\u2019s case, shirtless gym selfies.\nBut people rapidly homed in on those celestial harmonies.\n\u201cY\u2019all\u2019s unison is simply unfair,\u201d wrote one. \u201cDelicate, exquisite. Bravo!\u201d added another.\nFans started requesting new songs in the comments, and the \u201clike\u201d counter spun so fast it threatened to fall apart.\nIn February 2022, the friends surrendered to the inevitable. \u201cGood news!\u201d announced Cinya. \u201cWe are officially a group.\u201d\nAll they needed was a name.\n\u201cWe started texting words back and forth until something clicked,\u201d recalls Cinya.\n\u201cI think I said \u2018habits\u2019 first, and then we were like Scary habits... Wild habits\u2026 Tiny Habits!\u201d\nThe name is almost too perfect. The band\u2019s music is rooted in small details \u2013 subtly plucked acoustic guitars, ethereal melodies and situationally-specific lyrics.\nThe early single Tiny Things, for example, is about finding romance in the mundanity of daily life, from changing the bed sheets to doing the dishes.\n\u201cLove is not a film re-enactment,\u201d the trio observe. \u201cI don't need the moon or a mansion.\u201d\nBy November, fellow Berklee graduate Lizzy McAlpine had employed Tiny Habits to accompany her on NPR\u2019s prestigious Tiny Desk concert series.\nThen, legendary music manager Steve Macklam, whose clients include Elvis Costello and Diana Krall, offered to represent them.\n\u201cWe met him and fell in love with him,\u201d says Maya. \u201cAnd yeah, he opened literally every door possible.\u201d\nThey recorded their debut EP in just two weeks and released it in April 2023. An album followed last month, with reviewers calling it \u201ca folk-pop colossus\u201d and \u201ca pure joy to experience\u201d.\n\nWatching the group in concert, and meeting them over coffee the following morning, it\u2019s clear Tiny Habits were meant to be together.\nThere\u2019s a tenderness and intimacy to their friendship that\u2019s reflected in the music.\nDuring our interview, Maya keeps a sisterly, reassuring hand on Judah\u2019s knee; and the trio frequently answer in u",
    "New CCTV of a man believed to be missing TV and radio presenter Michael Mosley on the Greek island of Symi has been seen by the BBC.\nThe footage appears to show one of the last-known sightings of the 67-year-old walking with an umbrella next to the marina in the village of Pedi on Wednesday, heading towards rocky hills.\nThe mountainous terrain is described as \"not easy\" by those involved with the search.\nDr Mosley, known for his TV programmes and BBC Radio 4's Just One Thing podcast, vanished four days ago while on holiday - after leaving a beach on foot.\nA search and rescue operation, involving helicopters and drones, continues.\nThe new image appears to show the man in good form and walking steadily, an unnamed police officer told BBC News. \nThis is believed to be one of the last two CCTV sightings of the man with the umbrella before he left the village.\nEarlier on Saturday, firefighters started searching a 4 mile (6.5km) radius over a mountainous area that is surrounded by sea.\nAsked if there had been any sign of Dr Mosley, he said there has been \"nothing\".\nOne theory that has emerged is that Dr Mosley was trying to take a much longer route than previously thought, passing over miles of exposed hillside. \nDr Mosley's accommodation was in the main town about 1 mile from Pedi.\nDr Mosely's movements have been pieced together from a series of CCTV images.\nA man believed to be the broadcaster was seen on Pedi\u2019s main street holding an umbrella about 20 minutes after leaving the beach.\nA member of the rescue team described the search as a \u201crace against time\u201d and said he could be \u201canywhere\u201d.\nHis four children have arrived on Symi to help with the search. His wife Dr Clare Bailey Mosley has also been searching the island joined by her British friends, Symi's mayor said. \nAll patrol boats, private boats and commercial boats near the island have been searching for Dr Mosley, Symi\u2019s coastguard said, while police and firefighters have been using drones and a sniffer dog to try to locate the missing presenter.\nDivers have been \"looking into the water\" with the help of the Hellenic Coast Guard. \nSymi's mayor Eleftherios Papakaloudoukas said the search will continue until Dr Mosley is found.\nHe added he was unsure why the missing presenter would try to make a long, potentially arduous journey in such heat, but he hoped the presenter is found \"safe and alive\". \nGreek police said Dr Mosley left his wife on the beach on Wednesday, before setting off on a walk to the centre of the island.\nHis phone was found where he was staying with his wife, who reported him missing, a police spokesperson told BBC News.\nAn appeal saying he was missing was posted on a local Facebook group on Wednesday, alongside a picture of Dr Mosley wearing a blue cap, polo shirt and shorts.\n\"Have you seen this man? He set off to walk back from [Agios Nikolaos beach] at about 13:30 and failed to make it home,\" it said.\nSymi is part of Greece's Dodecanese island group and sits about 12 miles (19km) north-west of Rhodes. In the 2021 census it had a population of approximately 2,600 people.\nThe majority of its beaches are remote and people are advised to take boats to visit them.\nBefore moving into TV, Dr Mosley studied medicine in London and qualified as a doctor but for the last couple of decades has been working as a presenter, documentary maker, journalist and author.\nHe writes a column for the Daily Mail and his TV programmes also include Channel 4 show Michael Mosley: Who Made Britain Fat?\nDr Mosley has been an advocate for intermittent fasting diets, including the 5:2 diet and The Fast 800 diet.\nHis wife Clare Bailey Mosley, is also a doctor, author and healthy living advocate.\nThe couple recently appeared at the Hay Festival where Dr Mosley presented a special edition of Just One Thing.\nReacting to the \"shocking news\", his fellow Trust Me, I'm A Doctor co-star Dr Saleyha Ahsan said she was \"praying he is found safe\" and she feels \"sick with worry\".\nOn Thursday's edition of The One Show, presenter Alex Jones opened the programme by expressing concern that \"our friend\" had gone missing.\n\"Our thoughts are very much with his wife Clare and the rest of his family at this worrying time. We hope for more positive news,\" she added.\nWednesday 1330 local time (11:30 BST) - Dr Michael Mosley leaves his wife Clare on Agios Nikolaos beach and sets off on a walk\n1350 - Man carrying umbrella is seen on CCTV in Pedi\n1357 - Same man is seen again at Pedi's marina heading north-east\nThursday 1115 - Police are unable to find the presenter, so they inform Athens and request assistance from the Greek fire department\n1400 - Greek fire services, with six firefighters and a drone team, arrive in Symi\n1900 - Helicopter deployed to assist search\nFriday - Divers join the search in the water around Symi\nSaturday 0600 - Firefighters resume search for Dr Mosley\nAdditional reporting by Insaf Abbas in Symi and Andre Rhoden-Paul in London",
    "The Scottish Conservatives have insisted party leader Douglas Ross played no part in the decision to stop a general election candidate from standing.\nMr Ross will contest the Aberdeenshire North and Moray East seat on 4 July after David Duguid was effectively de-selected.\nMr Duguid, who had held the Banff and Buchan seat since 2017, had already been adopted by local party members and has disputed suggestions that he is \"seriously ill\".   \nParty chairman Craig Hoy told BBC Scotland News that Mr Ross - who sits on the eight member board - did not take part in two meetings regarding Mr Duguid.   \nMr Hoy, who was campaigning in Glasgow, said: \"We had two meetings of the board to discuss the situation with David\u2019s ill-health, but Douglas was present at neither of those meetings.\"\nWhen asked if Mr Ross had recused himself from the meetings, Mr Hoy said the Highlands and Islands MSP had not been there and it was a \"decision taken unanimously\" by the management board.\nHe added: \"Douglas did not feed into these meetings. He did not feed into the decision. This was a very sensitive issue.\"\nBBC Scotland News has been told Mr Ross has not attended any meetings of the board in 2024.\nMr Duguid is in hospital after becoming ill in April but wrote in a social media post that reports he could not stand in the election due to health problems were \"simply incorrect\".\nThe former Scotland Office minister added that no-one on the party management board had visited him in hospital.\nIn a further update on Saturday he revealed he had reached an \"important milestone\" and had been able to visit the hospital shops in his wheelchair to buy some newspapers.\nMr Duguid added: \"I was a bit surprised to see so many of them describe me as 'seriously ill'.\n\"That was true when I was in intensive care in ARI a month ago.\n\"But certainly not now.\n\"I continue to be fully focussed on my rehabilitation and making great progress daily.\"\nHe signed off by adding he had \"more milestones planned for next week\".\nMr Ross previously stated that he would be standing down as an MP at the election to focus on his duties at Holyrood, where he has been an MSP since 2021.\nHowever he will now contest Aberdeenshire North and Moray East after being adopted by party members on Thursday. \nMr Hoy admitted it had been a \"difficult few days\" for the party, but said they did not have \"sufficient assurance\" that if Mr Duguid stood it would not work against \"both his health and his recovery\".\nThe decision means Mr Duguid is not eligible for a \u00a315,000 redundancy payment from Parliament.\nThe move has been met with criticism from some within the party, with sources telling BBC Scotland News on Friday that \"the optics are terrible\" regarding the decision.\nBut Mr Hoy said that Mr Ross should not consider standing down, as he was \"leading the charge\" for the party into the upcoming election.\nOther parties have used the deselection as ammunition to attack the Tories.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said Mr Ross' selection was \"typical of his character and the character of the Conservative party\". \nScottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton described Mr Duguid's treatment as \"desperately sad\".\nHe added: \"If he genuinely didn't want to stand down then this looks terrible for Douglas Ross.\"\nOn Friday Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes, an SNP MSP, criticised the move and said Mr Duguid had been \"ejected from his seat\" to allow Mr Ross to stand.

    "The Methodist Church in Ireland has apologised \"unreservedly for failures in pastoral support and care\" to the LGBT community and their families.\nThe church also said it strongly condemned all forms of homophobia both within the church and the wider community.\nHowever, the church has decided that marriage remain a relationship \"between one man and one woman\".\nIt has decided not to follow the Methodist Church in Great Britain in allowing same-sex marriages.\nThe Methodist Church in Ireland (MCI) is one of the main religious denominations and is made up of about 200 churches in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nThe United Methodist Church in the US recently voted to allow LGBT clergy to serve in the church, reversing a 40-year ban.\nIt is unclear whether individual Methodist churches in Northern Ireland or the Republic will have the power to allow people in same-sex relationships to continue in leadership roles.\nThat followed an amendment voted on by members of the MCI at their conference in Belfast.\nSteven Smyrl, who is in a same-sex marriage and currently sits on the church council of the Methodist Church in Sandymount in Dublin, welcomed the apology.\n\"It was very welcome, but how far does it go?\" he said.\n\"It still leaves a lot of same-sex people wondering are their relationships given any worth or dignity.\"\nMr Smyrl had previously been dismissed as an elder by the Presbyterian church due to his relationship.\nHe hoped the MCI's ban on same-sex marriage would change.\n\"The chances are if the Methodist Church in Ireland survives - like the other evangelical churches in Northern Ireland - I think in the Methodist Church there will be an acceptance of open gay relationships including same-sex marriage.\"\nMr Smyrl said there were a large number of gay people in the Methodist Church.\n\"Many of them are just quiet, they keep their head down, they don't ever let on their situation about their home life, and that's a really sad way to exist,\" he said.\nSexuality was debated by members of the Methodist Church in Ireland during their 2024 conference in Belfast.\nA decade-long review into \"human sexuality\" by the church was presented to delegates as a report.\nIt reviewed Christian teaching on human sexuality, and recommended standards for membership and leadership of the MCI.\nThe report into human sexuality also explored \"the disciplines required in regard to sexual behaviour\" by leaders in the church, including clergy or members of church councils - the governing bodies of individual Methodist churches.\nThe report heard concerns \"about inconsistency of approach - for example, where entering into a same-sex dating relationship was seen as grounds for being asked to step aside from a role, while being in a sexually active, unmarried, opposite-sex relationship was not\".\nAs a result the report recommended individual churches and their councils could decide if people in same-sex relationships could serve in leadership roles.\nDelegates were told in a document, however, that did not mean \"anything goes\".\nAnd an amendment passed by members left it unclear if those in same-sex relationships could be in leadership roles within the church.\nDuring a passionate debate, some speakers were critical of the review's recommendations on sexuality and said they could not support it.\n\"Boundaries that God instituted in creation for human flourishing are no longer part of what it means to be an Irish Methodist,\" one said.\nOthers said they felt \"conflicted\" and were concerned about \"a split in the church\"\n\"Churches who have adopted this approach are in decline,\" one said.\nBut others supported the review, with one Methodist who backed it saying it \"expresses the inclusiveness of the gospel\".\n\"I am queer and I want to work with children and young people through the church,\" another delegate said.\n\"It is what I believe God has put me here to do and why should one part of my identity bar me from doing that?\"\nMembers of the church backed the report on human sexuality by 148 votes to 64.",
    "The first of the results in the Republic of Ireland's local council elections have started to be declared. \nA total of 949 city and county council seats will be filled across 31 local authorities. However, it could be the beginning of next week before all councillors are declared. \nThe polls closed at 22:00 local time on Friday.\nVoting also took place in the Republic of Ireland on Friday in the European elections, but those ballots will be separated and local elections are counted first.\nIrish state broadcaster RT\u00c9 is reporting that current indications suggest the two main government parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, will likely be in a battle to be the largest party in local government. \nTallies suggest, however, that both parties will lose seats. \nMore than 2,100 candidates had been selected or declared for the local election.\nThe polls will provide political parties with an insight into voter sentiment.\nThe current Irish government has been in place since June 2020, when Fine Gael, Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green Party voted to enter a coalition together. \nThe next election must be held by March 2025. \nSpeaking to reporters at Cork City Hall, T\u00e1naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said the government still intended to \"go full-term\u201d.\n\u201cLocal election results do not correlate the general election results,\u201d the Fianna F\u00e1il politician said.\nHowever local elections can help \u201cin terms of bringing new candidates forward\u201d for general elections, he added.\nPaschal Donohoe, minister for public expenditure, said while it was still early days, it appeared his party - Fine Gael - had been successful in \"getting out its votes\".\n\"The early tallies show that there is a large majority of people who are willing to vote in a very different way to how extremists and the far right will make the case for,\" he added.\nThe full results of the elections will take days to be finalised because Ireland uses a system of proportional representation which allows voters to rank every candidate in each race by order of preference. \nThe process means ballot papers are sorted and counted multiple times by hand.\nThe two main coalition government parties, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, can breathe a collective sigh of relief as their losses are not expected to be on the scale many had predicted.\nFor Sinn F\u00e9in, on the other hand, a victory is being seen by many as a relative defeat.\nThe main opposition party will have more councillors elected to local authorities this time, but not as many as it wanted or expected.\nThe party will now have to figure out why, especially at a time when the government has been under sustained pressure on a number of fronts, notably over a long term housing crisis and a more recent crisis around immigration.\nOne theory is that the party miscalculated and ran too many candidates. But even before polling day, opinion polls were suggesting a drop in popularity for Sinn F\u00e9in.\nAway from the big parties, the big winners in this election could be independent candidates.\nAmong those expected to be elected to Donegal County Council are a number of members of the 100% Redress Party.\nThe party has been campaigning for 100% government redress for thousands of residents whose homes have been crumbling due to defective blocks.\nSpeaking to RT\u00c9, Sinn F\u00e9in's finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty said the party would make gains in some counties, but added there would be a lot of disappointment among new candidates. \nIt had been a tough election, Mr Doherty said, adding there was still a lot to play for and there were strong indicators coming from the three constituencies for the European election. \nSinn F\u00e9in had a disappointing local election in 2019, he added, but nine months later the party saw candidates who missed out being elected to parliament.\nHe said Sinn F\u00e9in would \"dust themselves down\" and look at \"the lessons that can be learned\". \nOne voter cast more than her vote at her polling station in Bray, County Wicklow.\nOona McFarland was separated from a very special ring when it fell into the ballot box.\nStaff at the polling station noted down the number of the box, which meant count staff were extra careful when separating votes. \nShe was reunited with the ring which is in memory of her late daughter at the count centre on Saturday.\n\"It is a very sentimental ring, so I'm delighted to have it back,\" Ms McFarland said.\nAbout 373m people across the EU are eligible to vote to elect 720 MEPs in the European elections.\nVoting has been taking place across Europe over four days, and as a result, Ireland will not start counting European votes until Sunday 9 June.\nResults cannot be announced until after 22:00 local time on Sunday when voting has ended across Europe.\nFourteen MEPs will be sent back to Brussels from the Republic of Ireland.\nFive will represent the constituency of Midlands North-West, a 15-county constituency in which 27 candidates are running.\nFive will represent Ireland South, where 23 candidates are running across",

    "Gig-goers have criticised a new entry cut-off time at Halifax's Piece Hall, which regularly hosts concerts by big name acts.\nThe venue has said all ticket holders must now be in the site by 20:00 BST.\nPeople planning to attend shows have questioned the need to be there so early and businesses such as bars and restaurants have expressed fears they will lose revenue. \nThe Piece Hall said the new time is due to enhanced security measures such as a single-file metal detector. \nBlondie headlined at the standing-only venue on Friday evening, and other acts including Placebo and Tom Jones are set to play at the former Georgian cloth hall through the summer.\nOn the Piece Hall website it states on gig nights: \"Doors open 6pm.

    "The brief is simple: follow the election and produce a piece of art. The resulting work will go to the Parliamentary Art Collection, the artist will get \u00a320,000. There are just two rules - it must be politically balanced and it must reflect the entire geography of the UK.\nFor Joanne Coates, the official Election Artist for 2024, it's an opportunity to \"tell this story of the election in parallel to what we see in the media\", she says.\nUntil 4 July, the date of the election, she will travel alongside politicians \u2013 and the press - up and down the country, watching their campaigns up close.\nWhereas journalists might focus on the story of the day and then quickly move on, an artist can \"step back and look at things in a different way\", she says.\nAccording to Coates' website, her work explores themes of \"rurality, hidden histories and inequalities relating to low income\" and \"power, identity, wealth and poverty\" - subjects often coloured by political beliefs and ideologies. Would she struggle to remain politically balanced?\n\"It's a challenging aspect, but I relate it to being from the countryside and visiting the pub,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"In a country pub there are lots of different people from lots of different backgrounds with lots of different political views and because you're in a small place you have to get on with everybody, so it's something I'm used to in my everyday life.\"\n\"I'm not there to make a judgement,\" she notes. \"The artwork will always be interpreted by an audience in different ways, but i think it's vital for this role to not bring a political viewpoint.\"\n\"It's a challenge but a really good one.\"\nCoates is the seventh official election artist, chosen by the Speaker of the House of Commons' Advisory Committee on Works of Art, and is tasked with creating an artwork that will \u201cinform and inspire future generations\".\nPrevious artists have included sculptor Cornelia Parker, photographer Simon Roberts, and sketch artist Adam Dant.\nThe first, in 2001, was portrait painter Jonathan Yeo, probably best known for his portrait of King Charles III, which he unveiled earlier this year.\nThe whole thing was a \"wonderfully bonkers experience\", he told me from his studio in west London.\n\"Tony Blair was refusing to sit for portraits, or at least his advisors didn't want him to do it.\"\nSo the Committee came up with an idea: why not have an election artist and make it portrait focused?\n\"An election is a bit like when two sides go to war,\" Yeo says, \"and there's a long tradition of war artists documenting wars and to have an election artist doing the same job, but then with the secondary job of getting a portrait of the three main party leaders.\"\nGetting enough time with Blair to sit for a portrait was difficult. The other party leaders, William Hague and Charles Kennedy, were game but, surrounded by advisors, Blair was kept at distance. \n\"I was usually kettled along with the journalists on the battle buses\" Yeo says \"or the photographers and the cartoonists.\"\nEventually, a plan was hatched. Yeo would wait in Blair's office at lunchtime and, when he returned, he'd have no choice but to sit for an initial portrait sketch.\n\"Blair comes in, and he's super charming, and I manage to do a few sketches and take a few photos, and after about two minutes, Alistair Campbell walks in and says 'Right, you've had your time, now... [go away]'.\"\nThe result was Proportional Representation; a punny triptych of portraits of the main party leaders, sized according to their share of the public vote.\n\"I placed Blair in the middle, Hague on the right and Kennedy on the left. At that time, Blair was quite centrist and in many ways, Lib Dem policies were to the left of Labour polices.\"\nIn 2005, he told a select committee the scheme should continue.\n\"I think there's a great potential to make this a tradition. I think there's a lot more story telling that can be done around it.\"\n\"It's the moment where politicians engage with the public, and it's that dialogue that an artist can interpret in an interesting way.\"\nThat engagement is perhaps most vividly represented by the piece produced for the 2019 election by Nicky Hirst. \nA dazzling, dangling mobile that hangs from the roof of Portcullis House, across the road from the Houses of Parliament. Made up of geometric shapes in bright primary colours, it follows a theme seen on her Instagram feed from her time following the election that year.\n\"I went everywhere by public transport and had conversations with people along the way,\" she says.\n\"People literally showing their colours became a thing. When people put those posters in their windows or the signs outside. It was that feeling of literally showing their colours that struck me.\n\"At the time I was looking for a sign.\"\nSigns such as an X (as you might write on a ballot) or 10 (as in Downing Street) repeatedly feature in the electionartist2019 feed. Eventually, these would inspire her final piece.\n\"It's celebrating the process, and the right to",

    "The chairwoman of a 132-year-old football club has spoken of the many challenges it faces in the modern world.\nHadleigh United FC based in Hadleigh, Suffolk, was established in 1892.\nChairwoman Tracy Croker said the club struggled in terms of funding as well as physical space that the FA said it was aware of.\nIt comes after football equipment retailer FORZA spoke to 186 individuals from English football clubs and found seven in 10 clubs felt they lacked sufficient funding.\nSpeaking of the research that also found 28% of clubs were using equipment beyond normal levels of wear and tear, Ms Croker said: \"I think that's probably symptomatic of most grassroots clubs at the moment.\n\"We do have to squeeze out every single minute of use out of all of our equipment and to find the funding to replace that is hard work.\"\nMs Croker said while they were \"lucky\" at Hadleigh United with a \"committed team of volunteers who go above and beyond\", they had to \"constantly\" seek funds.\nAnother key issue the club faces is a lack of space partly due to an increase in women and girls playing. \n\"We want to expand more but we can't at the minute because we simply don't have enough space to play,\" Ms Croker said.\nShe suggested that future developers and planners building new homes in the area consider providing extra facilities alongside their plans. \n\"It's important for everyone's mental and physical health - I think we all realised that after the pandemic,\" she added.\nA spokesperson for the FA said it recognised the challenges faced by grassroots leagues and clubs across the country.\n\"Our focus and ambition across grassroots football in England is to transform grass pitch quality and deliver further 3G pitches to improve player experience and ensure that more games are played as originally scheduled,\" they added.\nThe research from FORZA found that 92% of clubs believed bad weather and adverse conditions were the biggest threat to match cancellations.\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Cat owners in Derbyshire are being urged to ensure their pets are microchipped as a new law comes in to force.\nIt was already a legal requirement for dogs to be chipped in England, and that was extended to cats on Monday.\nBut staff at the Derbyshire Cats Protection Centre said the majority of felines brought to the Ashbourne site over the last year - 66% of them - were not microchipped.\nHelen Wood, manager of the centre, said: \"It does make it very difficult to reunite cats with their owners if they are not microchipped.\"\nAll cats have to be microchipped before they reach the age of 20 weeks old or feline owners will risk a fine of \u00a3500 under the new law.\nMs Woods said getting cats chipped was a \"one-off\" process that was quick and harmless.\n\"Microchips are around the size of a grain of rice,\" she said.\n\"It's very small and can be implanted by our vets very quickly. \n\"It doesn\u2019t hurt the cats, it's like giving them an injection and they are then chipped for life.\"\nTatum Stander, a vet at Bright Side Vets in Swadlincote, agreed that is \"very important\" for pets to be chipped and said it was important for owners to ensure their details are up to date.\n\"One of the worst thing you can go through is to lose your pet,\" she said.\n\"People think you get the microchip done and your details are updated automatically.\n\"Please make sure your phone number and address is up to date on the system or we won't be able to reunite your cat with the owner.\"\nA 2024 report by the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) said about two million cats in England had not been microchipped.\nThe report also showed that 54% of cat owners were not aware that cats had to be chipped in England before the change in the law. \nChristine Middlemiss, chief veterinary officer at the PDSA, said: \"Microchipping is by far the most effective and quickest way of identifying lost pets. \n\"As we\u2019ve seen with dog microchipping, those who are microchipped are more than twice as likely to be reunited with their owner.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Can pupils from Northern Ireland's most diverse primary school dig it? Thanks to a unique archaeological project, they most certainly can.\nThe schoolchildren of St Patrick's Primary School in Dungannon, County Tyrone, have been time travelling by getting their hands dirty at one of Northern Ireland's most significant archaeological sites.\nAnd the project at the Hill of O'Neill, part of a new Community Archaeology Programme by Queen's University Belfast, has proved a hit.\nPaula, originally from Lithuania, said: \u201cI like living here because the history is so interesting to me and I love being able to discover more.\u201d\nThe three-year project is giving members of the public free access to rare archaeological digs, skills sessions and tours throughout Northern Ireland.\nDungannon has a sizeable East Timorese, Portuguese, Polish, Lithuanian and African community.\nSt Patrick\u2019s now has the highest number of newcomer pupils of any primary school in Northern Ireland.\nA newcomer is a pupil who is often originally from outside the UK and does not initially speak the same language as their class teacher as a result.\nThe school recently took part in the Community Archaeology Programme at the Hill of O\u2019Neill, located at the highest point in Dungannon\u2019s town centre.\nThe family of nine-year-old Raphael are originally from Portugal - he said: \"During the trip were looking at artefacts found there and we got to draw them and we even got to pick up and feel them, it was amazing.\"\nKenisha, who is also nine with family from East Timor, said her favourite part was \"whenever we went outside\". \n\"We got to measure the old castle on the hill and I think we did a really good job.\u201d\nFor their teacher, Suzanne McKenna, who speaks of her pride at the school's many nationalities, there is \"no better place\" for the project than the Hill of O'Neill. \n\"We\u2019re so lucky to have a site that is steeped in such history, so close to us.\"\nThe Hill of the O\u2019Neill is located on a hilltop in the centre of Dungannon and now serves as a cultural hub and park for the town.\nFor much of the 20th Century this site had been used as an RUC and Army barracks before it was transferred to the local council in 2007.\nThe historic building on the hilltop today represents the remains of a late 18th Century mansion, of which two circular corner towers still stand - but the location has a much deeper history.\nBy the later medieval period the site had become the principal power centre for the Hugh O\u0301 Ne\u0301ill lordship in County Tyrone and the setting for his main castle.\nThe O\u2019Neills would dominate political power in Ulster and this would remain the case until the beginning of the 17th Century, with south-east Tyrone\u2014and Dungannon\u2014at the epicentre of their lordship.\nIn the aftermath of the Ulster Plantation, the O\u0301 Ne\u0301ill capital was taken over by Sir Arthur Chichester.\nHe was the lord deputy of Ireland and a veteran of the English army, which had defeated the Gaelic lords led by Hugh O\u2019Neill during the Nine Years War of 1594\u20131603.\nA new town grew up around the hilltop and, while the castle seems to have continued in occupation through to the 1680s, by the end of the 17th Century it had been demolished.\nPeter Lant, the education officer at the Hill of O\u2019Neill, gave the St Patrick's pupils a tour of the site during their recent trip. \n\u201cThe importance of this site can\u2019t be overstated, the O\u2019Neill\u2019s had worldwide connections, from the king of Spain to the king of France,\" he said. \n\u201cWhen the O\u2019Neill\u2019s had their castle here, the power struggle to become the strongest clan on the island of Ireland, would rival anything you see on TV shows like Game of Thrones.\u201d\nArchaeological excavations of the Hill of O\u2019Neill were carried out in 2003 and 2007 and revealed remnants of the old castle.\nQueen\u2019s University archaeologist Brian Sloane, who was part of the dig, said \"it was a really important excavation because we found the remains of Hugh O\u2019Neill tower house, it\u2019s about six to eight feet under the ground of the current site\".\n\u201cDuring the excavation we found things like jugs dating back to the 1600s, and to be the first person to hold it for 500 years or think that maybe Hugh O\u2019Neill drank from it, that\u2019s why archaeology is incredible.\u201d\nMr Sloane, now excavation director of the Centre of Community Archaeology at Queen\u2019s University, gave a demonstration to the St Patrick\u2019s Primary School pupils during their recent trip to the Hill of O\u2019Neill.\n\u201cThe kids took scale measurements of the site and took drawings, much like we did when we were excavating the site, it\u2019s a bit of craic and they enjoy being out of the classroom and doing something extraordinary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about impressing on the children that the site, the soil, the artefacts, can all tell a story, because with the next scrape of dirt there\u2019s always the possibility you will find something amazing.\u201d\nThe Community Archaeology Programme NI (CAPNI) received a grant of more than \u00a3600,000 from The National Lottery Heritage Fund to the Centre f",

    "When Javier Milei was campaigning last year to become the president of Argentina, he brandished a chainsaw to symbolise his determination to substantially cut public spending.\nNow six months into his right-wing presidency, how is his shock therapy for both the country\u2019s government and economy working?\n\u201cThe changes our country needs are drastic,\u201d Mr Milei said shortly after being elected. \u201cThere is no room for gradualism.\u201d\nAnd he certainly took swift action. In his initial package of measures, he devalued Argentina\u2019s currency, the peso, by 50%, slashed state subsidies for fuel, and cut the number of government ministries by half.\nThe quick reduction in public spending has helped Argentina swing from a fiscal deficit \u2013 the difference between the government\u2019s spending and income - of 2tn pesos ($120bn; \u00a393bn) in December of last year to a surplus of 264.9bn pesos in April.\nArgentina also reported a surplus in January, February and March, marking the first time it had achieved this monthly target since 2012.\nHowever, Mr Milei, who describes himself as a libertarian, has made cutting inflation his main priority, telling the BBC last year that it was \u201cthe most regressive tax that most afflicts people\u201d.\nInflation has slowed - in April the month-on-month rate fell to 8.8%, the first time since October that it was not in double figures. This inflation measure is closely followed in countries like Argentina that have long had high inflation.\nYet when it comes to the more globally recognised annual inflation rate, this hit 289.4% in April. To put that into perspective, in the UK the annual rate is currently just 2.3%.\nAnd although official growth figures are not yet available for the period since Mr Milei took office on 10 December, there is evidence that Argentina's economy has contracted sharply, with consumer spending dropping off in the first three months of this year.\nMeanwhile, other pledges that Mr Milei made while campaigning, such as replacing the peso with the US dollar and abolishing the central bank, have taken a back seat recently.\nThe problem for President Milei is that his La Libertad Avanza coalition (in English \u2013 Freedom Advances) does not command a majority in the Argentine Congress. And it has found it hard to strike cross-party deals.\nMr Milei wants Congress to grant him the power to privatise more than two dozen state-owned companies, including the state airline, the railways, the postal service, and the national water supplier.\nHis initial \"omnibus\" bill, containing the privatisation plans and hundreds of other economic measures, failed to pass a second reading in February. A streamlined version, resubmitted to Congress in April, cleared the lower house but has yet to be approved by the Senate.\nThe president also faces strong opposition from trade unions, who have taken to the streets in protest, saying that workers' rights will suffer from the wholesale deregulation of the economy.\nJuan Cruz D\u00edaz, managing director of Argentina-based geopolitical risk consultancy Cefeidas Group, says Mr Milei's economic policies in office are as radical as those promised during the campaign, just somewhat delayed.\n\"His administration has been forced to slow down these reforms, given the political and social roadblocks it has faced,\" says Mr D\u00edaz.\nHe adds that specific factors causing the president to tread cautiously are \u201cthe deterioration of people's purchasing power and the fear of increased social unrest\u201d.\nThis comes as there has been no let-up in the number of people living in poverty, which has risen from about a quarter of the population in 2017 to more than half now.\nHowever, the International Monetary Fund, which over the decades has lent more money to Argentina than to any other country, gave the government high marks in May, saying that its performance was \"better than expected\" and that its economic programme was \"firmly back on track\".\nAs to whether President Milei can get more policies agreed by parliament, Mr D\u00edaz  says that while some sectors of the opposition are open to dialogue with the government, left-leaning parties are completely opposed to his agenda. These include the Peronist faction controlled by ex-President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner.\n\"In this context, the government's ability to negotiate and build consensus is being tested on a daily basis, a test that Milei himself often hinders with certain outbursts and unnecessary confrontational statements,\" says Mr D\u00edaz.\nIn fact, many Argentines are seeing Mr Milei's ebullient personality as more of a hindrance than a help.\nIn its latest survey, the Zuban C\u00f3rdoba political consultancy firm found that 54% of respondents thought the president was paying more attention to his international political image than to solving Argentina's problems.\nThat perception has no doubt been bolstered by Argentina's current diplomatic row with Spain, which has led Madrid to recall its ambassador to Buenos Aires.\nKimberley Sperrfechter, emerging markets econo",
    "It is not an exaggeration to say Dr Michael Mosley transformed people\u2019s lives.\nFor those who feared the growing waistline bulge over a straining belt was just an inevitable and depressing part of life, his cheerful, experimental approach to better health offered a solution that seemed to work for many.\nTributes are now pouring in for the TV, radio presenter and author, who over two decades produced programmes and books that were watched, listened to and read by millions of people.\nAnd among them are many who have spoken about how he inspired them to change their lives.\nFor publisher Emma Waring his Fast 800 recipes taught her how to eat \"in a way that allowed me to lose weight while still enjoying satisfying and delicious food\".\nReacting to his death, she wrote: \"I am >6.5 stone lighter and healthier for life thanks to him. Sad, sad news.\"\nSome studies have questioned this approach to weight loss, but Labour's former deputy leader, Tom Watson, said Mosley was \"a hero to me\" - after he lost more than seven stone (44kg) and was able to stop taking drugs to regulate his type 2 diabetes.\n\"It's hard to describe how upset I am by this news,\" he wrote on Sunday. \"Through courageous, science-based journalism, Michael Mosley has helped thousands of people get well and healthy. I'm one of them.\"\nThere are many others who have taken inspiration from his work.\nFor instance, the actor Benedict Cumberbatch took up his 5:2 diet to slim down for his role in the BBC series Sherlock.\nAuthor Jeanette Winterson wrote about the transformative effects of fasting on cholesterol, joint pain and general wellbeing after being inspired by him.\nAnd when I met Mosley one day for a quick interview at a public event I was struck by the queue of people near him waiting to say thank you.\nIt had all grown out of Mosley\u2019s own life experience, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in 2012.\nIt led to him looking to see what the latest health science could offer as a solution, trying it out and then telling the world.\n\"I wrote the Blood Sugar Diet because I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic,\" he said. \n\"I was not particularly overweight, weighing about 86kgs and I didn\u2019t look particularly fat, but that was because a lot of the fat I was carrying was internal. I was a TOFI, Thin on the Outside, Fat Inside.\u2019\nIn a TV interview in 2020 he said he managed to reverse his diabetes in 2012, and eight years later \"I am the same weight I was then, and my blood sugars are entirely normal\".\nThe heart of his programme for weight loss was fasting.  \nFor two days each week he encouraged reducing food intake down to around 800 calories a day.  \nHowever, his Blood Sugar Diet and 5:2 Diet also introduced a swathe of the population to a rapidly developing area of medical research that was beginning to question some of the assumptions of healthy eating.  \nAfter years of being told that fat was the enemy, blame was shifting to sugar, carbohydrates and our increasingly processed and narrowing range of foodstuffs.\nClaire Yates, from Buxton, Derbyshire, believes Dr Mosley \"saved my life\".\nShe is one of many people to get in touch with BBC News to share how Dr Mosley affected their lives, saying she was a type 2 diabetic, but his book \u201cchanged everything for me\u201d.\n\u201cI have been following him closely ever since,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI've seen him twice on tour, he has changed my life since, I was able to reverse my diabetes and lose weight.\u201d  \nThe 48-year-old called him an \u201cabsolute legend of man\u201d and said her \u201cheart breaks for his family\u201d.\nAkila Lingham, another person who got in touch, added: \u201cHe remains an inspiration to all the pre-diabetics, diabetics,  and those with increased cholesterol levels - he provided another choice of reversing these issues by diet and exercise.\u201d\nIt was an unexpected burst of fame for a man who only started producing TV science programmes after switching careers from banking and medicine. \nOne of his ideas as a producer was the programme Trust Me I'm a Doctor presented by Dr Phil Hammond, who paid tribute to a friend and colleague who he says was far more than just a lifestyle guru.\n\"As well as talk about lifestyle measures you could take, he wanted to challenge the medical establishment. He wanted to talk about huge inequalities in health care,\" he told BBC News.\nHe was, he says, someone who had had a real impact.\n\"I think his legacy will live on. Anyone who met him will always smile because he was such a loving, kind, generous person that had a slightly infectious and impish laugh. So, I'm really sad. But I'm also really proud and lucky to have had him in my life.\"\nIt was an episode of the BBC's Horizon, Ulcer Wars in 1994 about the search for a cure for ulcers, that inspired Michael Mosley's gung-ho enthusiasm for self-experimentation.\nIn the programme, he featured Dr Barry Marshall who had infected himself with an ulcer to prove they were caused by an infection rather than stress.\n\u201cI discovered that almost all the great medical discoveries were made b",
    "Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz has quit the emergency government in a sign of deepening divisions over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's post-conflict plans for Gaza.\nSpeaking during a news conference in Tel Aviv on Sunday where he announced his resignation, Mr Gantz said the decision was made with a \"heavy heart\". \n\"Unfortunately, Mr Netanyahu is preventing us from approaching true victory, which is the justification for the painful ongoing crisis,\" he said.\nConsidered by some to be a potential challenger for power in Israel, Mr Gantz called on Mr Netanyahu to set a date for elections.\nMr Netanyahu responded with a post on X: \u201cBenny, this is not the time to quit the campaign, this is the time to join forces.\"\nMr Gantz is a political rival of Mr Netanyahu and a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\nHis centrist National Unity party was in opposition until 11 October 2023 when, after the start of the war following Hamas's 7 October attacks, he agreed to form an emergency government with Mr Netanyahu.\nNational Unity holds five posts in the emergency government.\nCurrent opposition leader Yair Lapid backed Mr Gantz's decision as \u201cimportant and right\u201d on social media.\nImmediately after the announcement, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir demanded a place in the war cabinet. \nMr Ben-Gvir is part of a right-wing coalition that has threatened to quit and collapse the government if Israel accepts a ceasefire proposal put forward by US President Joe Biden.\nMr Gantz's influence in the government was widely seen as a counterbalance to that of far-right members of Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition.\nLast month, Mr Gantz set a deadline of 8 June for Mr Netanyahu to lay out how Israel would achieve its six \"strategic goals\", including the end of Hamas rule in Gaza and the establishment of a multinational civilian administration for the territory.\nThe prime minister dismissed the comments at the time as \"washed-up words\" that would mean \"defeat for Israel\".\nA retired army general and frequent critic of Mr Netayanhu, Mr Gantz had been a member of Israel's key decision-making \"war cabinet\", along with the prime minister and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.\nDuring the news conference, Mr Gantz said he was not only personally resigning from the government, but also withdrawing from the National Unity party that he chairs.\nThe move will not topple the Israeli government, since Mr Netanyahu will still hold a majority with 64 seats in the 120-seat Knesset.\nIt does, however, further isolate the prime minister and lay bare the deep political divisions over how he is running the war.\nThe resignation also comes one day before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken makes a three-day trip to the region, where he plans to visit Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Qatar to press for a ceasefire agreement.\nIn a separate development on Sunday, Israel's army announced the resignation of a senior commander who headed the IDF's Gaza division over what he called his failure to prevent the 7 October attacks.\nBrigadier General Avi Rosenfeld is the first IDF combat commander to step down since the attacks.",
    "A special type of fluorescent dye might help surgeons better locate and remove prostate cancer cells, UK scientists from University of Oxford believe.\nGetting rid of all of the cancer is vital to cut the risk of it coming back. \nThe glowing dye attaches to a protein found only on the cancer cells.\nIn a small, early trial on 23 men, surgeons say it helped them find areas of cancerous tissue not picked up by the naked eye or other clinical methods.\nA larger trial is now planned, funded by Cancer Research UK (CRUK).\nIn some of the 23 men having prostate cancer operations, surgeons spotted cancer cells that had spread to nearby tissue and lymph nodes, which they say they may have missed with conventional methods. \nThis is the first time this method has been tested on humans in the UK, with the findings now published in the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.\nA larger trial, called the Promote study, will further test how effective this is compared with other approaches.\nLead researcher Prof Freddie Hamdy told the BBC it was too early to know if it would work on every patient, but that it was \"promising\".\n\"In many patients, we saw cancer that we would not have seen otherwise,\" he said.\n\"It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve managed to see such fine details of prostate cancer in real-time during surgery,\" Prof Hamdy said.\n\u201cWith this technique, we can strip all the cancer away, including the cells that have spread from the tumour which could give it the chance to come back later. \"\n\"Equally important is cancer we don't see,\" he added.\nProf Hamdy believes the method will mean more healthy tissue can be preserved in surgery, reducing the chance of side effects that can sometimes happen following prostate operations, such as erectile dysfunction and incontinence.\n\nDavid Butler from Bradford, West Yorkshire took part in the trial. \n\"It did locate cancer that was in my lymph nodes and also my bladder,\" he said.\nHe had a course of radiotherapy after his surgery and has since been clear of cancer.\n\"I count myself as very lucky,\" he said.\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with about 52,300 new cases every year.\nDr Iain Foulkes, executive director of research and innovation at CRUK, said: \u201cWe need better tools to spot cancers which have started to spread further. The combined marker dye and imaging system that this research has developed could fundamentally transform how we treat prostate cancer in the future.\"\nCRUK hopes that if the trials go well the dye could be adapted to use in surgery for other types of cancer too in the future. \n",
    "President Emmanuel Macron has called snap parliamentary elections later this month in the wake of a big victory for his rival Marine Le Pen's National Rally in the European Parliament vote.\nThe far-right party is on course to win 32% of the vote, exit polls say, more than twice that of the president's Renaissance party.\nAnnouncing the dissolution of parliament, he said the two rounds of voting would take place on 30 June and 7 July, a few weeks before the Paris Olympics.  \nMr Macron made the dramatic and surprise decision in a televised address from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace an hour after voting closed and exit polls had been declared in France's EU elections.\nHis decision came not long after National Rally's 28-year-old leader, Jordan Bardella, had openly called on the president to call parliamentary elections.\n\"I have heard your message,\" the president told French voters, \"and I will not let it go without a response.\"\n\"France needs a clear majority in serenity and harmony,\" he said, adding that he could not resign himself to the far-right's progress \"everywhere in the continent\".\nNow barely two years into his second term as president, Mr Macron already lacks a majority in the French parliament, and though this European vote in theory has no bearing on national politics, he clearly decided that continuing his mandate without a new popular consultation would place too much of a strain on the system.  \nThe upcoming parliamentary elections also won't affect Mr Macron's own job, as they are separate from the presidential elections and his term as president still runs for three more years.\nMs Le Pen, who has twice been defeated by Mr Macron in presidential elections, immediately reacted, saying her party was \"ready to exercise power, ready to put an end to mass immigration\".\nCalling a snap election is a huge surprise for the country, and a huge risk for President Macron.\nHe could have reacted differently. He could have just kept going, explaining the far right\u2019s massive victory as a European aberration which would be corrected at more important elections.\nHe could have trusted to the impending European football championship in Germany and above all the Paris Olympics to keep people\u2019s minds off politics for a couple of months.\nThat was certainly how the Paris commentariat thought he would take his party\u2019s rout.\nBut one can only assume the president had seen this coming, and planned his response in advance.  \nCertainly the result was an almost exact replica of the polls, so he would have had plenty of time to consider his options.\nThe fact is that he is stuck.  \nWithout a majority, getting any bill through the National Assembly is already a struggle. With most of the country now so clearly against him, any new legislation \u2013 for example the upcoming budget \u2013 could have proved explosive.\nSo he has plumped for \"clarity\".  If National Rally has the votes then, he says, they should be given the chance to govern.\nObviously the president will hope his own Renaissance party can mount a fight-back at the elections on 30 June and 7 July - or that other parties will do better too.  \nBut he must appreciate that the odds favour another victory for National Rally. Maybe not one so sweeping as Sunday's result, but enough for it to become the biggest party in parliament.\nAt which point we might well have a Prime Minister Marine Le Pen, or indeed Jordan Bardella.",
    "An urgent call has gone out to medical students to help London hospitals recover from a major cyber-attack.\nA critical incident was declared on Tuesday after the ransomware attack targeted the services provided by pathology firm Synnovis.\nServices including blood transfusions and test results have been severely disrupted.\nIn a leaked message to trainee medics at Guy's and St Thomas' Trust, students have been asked to volunteer for 10 or 12-hour shifts.\nA spokesperson for NHS London said staff were \"working around the clock\" to minimise \"the significant disruption to patient care\".\nThe cyber-attack, believed to have been carried out by a Russian group calling themselves Qilin, affected services provided by King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust as well as Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust. \nSurgery and transplant operations at Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals are believed to have been impacted, as is the Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital and primary care services.\nIt is understood staff on wards are now using paper-based methods and signing blood transfusion bags.\nIn the message to trainees, which has been seen by the BBC and The Sunday Times, medical students were told they would act as \"floorwalkers\" and hand deliver blood tests.\nIt said: \"In this critical situation, we urgently need volunteers to step forward and support our pathology services.\n\"The ripple effect of this extremely serious incident is felt across various hospital, community and mental health services in our region.\"\nStudents were told that their assistance was \"crucial\" and that it was an opportunity to \"demonstrate your commitment to patient care\".\nIn a separate leaked email to staff, the chief executive at Guy's and Thomas' Trust, Prof Ian Abbs, said difficult conversations were being had with patients who have had appointments cancelled.\nHe confirmed the disruption would last for a number of weeks and that a response was being coordinated by the regional NHS England team.\nAt Guy's and St Thomas', trust staff raised concerns that clinical decisions were being made without the support of pathology.\nIn another letter they were told staff had the full support of management \"to make decisions based on your best professional judgment\".\nA spokesperson for NHS London said they were sorry to all those impacted by the cyber-attack.\n\"Pathology services are integral to a wide range of treatments and we know that a number of operations and appointments have been cancelled due to this attack,\" they said.\n\"We are still working with hospitals and local GP services to fully assess the disruption, and ensure the data is accurate. \n\"In the meantime our advice to patients remains, if you have not been contacted please do continue to attend your appointments.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Pictures of Dr Michael Mosley appear on almost all the front pages. \nThe Daily Mail shows him with his arm round his wife, Clare, who pays tribute to her \"wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband'. \nThe Daily Mirror says he put his own body and its ailments on the line to make great television. The Guardian says the presenter \"made complex ideas look breezily simple\". While The Sun calls him a \"health champ of the masses\", whose diet plans \"changed the approach to weight loss\".\nFormer home secretary Suella Braverman has told The Times the \"Tories must embrace Farage\". She tells the paper it's time to \"unite the right\", and says there's \"not much difference\" between Nigel Farage's policies and those of her own party. The Daily Telegraph's columnist Kamal Ahmed takes a very different view. He says the Tories can't afford to turn \"Faragiste\", as \"elections are won from the centre\".\nThe \"i\" says it's spoken to Conservative insiders who say fears of a post-election takeover by Mr Farage are mounting. The paper's main story is a poll by BMG Research, which suggests both Labour and the Tories are yet to convince voters they have the answers to the challenges facing the UK. The poll -- which was a representative sample of more than 1,500 adults -- also suggests voters think Labour will win, but doubt life will improve.\nThe Financial Times says Labour has thrown out plans to bring back a lifetime cap on the amount savers could have in their pensions before paying tax. The paper says the party is looking to \"de-risk\" its election campaign, by avoiding tax-raising policies that could be attacked by the Tories. It quotes allies of the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as saying there \"will be no black hole\" as a result of the change.\nAnd the Daily Mirror says the environmentalist and broadcaster Chris Packham has called on Taylor Swift fans to protest against her use of private jets. \nMr Packham tells the paper the pop star has \"enormous power\" and is \"speaking to an audience which will have significant problems in their lives due to climate breakdown\". Ms Swift's publicist says she has bought \"double the amount\" of carbon offsets needed to compensate her travel during her current Eras Tour.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "Scientists sampling DNA in the air to monitor the spread of deadly diseases said their work could help make food prices cheaper.\nThe Earlham Institute in Norwich said its air sampler processes detect bacteria, viruses and other micro-organisms - which pose a threat to plants, animals and humans - more quickly and accurately than other techniques.\nThis could help farmers grow crops more cheaply and efficiently as they would not need to use as many chemicals.\nIt could also transform environmental conservation work as well as public health measures.\nAll living things are constantly shedding bits of DNA into their surroundings.\nMia Berelson, who is a PhD student at the institute, says this technique gives us an idea of what is living where, and when, very quickly.\n\"Each device works like a really big hoover. They suck in over 200 litres of air per minute,\" she says.\n\"The air goes through the filter, and anything in the air - like bits of bacteria, skin cells, bits of pollen - that all gets stuck on the filter.\"\nThat DNA will then be sequenced and a profile will be created of all the different organisms detected in the area.\nThe Earlham Institute has been sampling the air near farmers' fields for several years but is now also sampling coastal, forest and city locations too.\nEight samplers have been placed across Norfolk including Brancaster, Norwich city centre, Thetford Forest and at Carlton & Oulton Marshes in Suffolk.\nThere are many more now in Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Oxfordshire.\nThe team switches on the devices at the same time for one hour and will repeat the experiment every three months to get an idea of seasonal changes.\nThe full results will be analysed in Spring 2025.\nPost-doctoral scientist Darren Heavens said: \"Food will be cheaper.\n\"If we inform the farmer that there's a pathogen in the air, he can take a more targeted approach when it comes to spraying [chemicals].\n\"If he only has to spray one, he'll save money. If the pathogen's not there at all, he  won't have to spray at all, again saving money.\n\"If he can save money, that can be passed on and the customer will get a cheaper product.\"\nBut the research has only just begun, so it will be a while before any difference may be noticed at the checkouts.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A team of cold water synchronised swimmers, many of them women over 50, is being featured on Paris Metro billboards to advertise this summer's Olympics.\nAlmost Synchro, who train at Henleaze Lake in Bristol, first got together for a mass synchronised swim to celebrate the lake's centenary in 2019.\nTeam member Annabel Bennett said: \"We didn't even know about the Metro feature until someone mentioned it.\"\nIt is part of a celebration of sport ahead of the games, which begin on 26 July.\nMs Bennett said: \"[Photographer] Eva Watkins took the pictures of us in the early days and she won several awards for them - they pop up every now and again.\n\"People would go to Paris and come back and tell us about them. Apparently they're really huge.\"\nPhotographer Eva Watkins, who has since travelled to the French capital to see her work, said: \"I was completely shocked and honoured.\n\"It's not something I ever thought was going to happen to me.\"\nMs Watkins took the photos as part of her degree at the University of West England during 2019 and 2020.\nShe said: \"I wanted to work with a community of people that were doing something different.\"\n\"The work started creating context behind it as we started shooting. We talked a lot about mental health and physical health,\" she added.\nMs Bennett said Almost Synchro was formed after 85 swimmers turned up for the swimming lake's centenary celebration in 2019.\n\"We made the number 100 in the water [and] it was like being 10 again, swimming with your friends in the water and making patterns.\"\nTwenty of them decided to continue as a synchronised swimming group, making up the first outdoor synchro team in the country.\nMs Bennett said they train seriously and laugh endlessly. \"It fulfils [us] and ticks a lot of boxes.\n\"It's great they put a photograph of us up. We are celebrating what sport means to a lot of people.\n\"We're not professionals, but we take it seriously.\"\nMs Bennett said synchronised swimming can give people body confidence is another thing synchronised swimming can give people.\n\"I can't say I would have chosen to stand in public in my swimming costume but it's very liberating,\" she said.\n\"We've declared ourselves - here we are, tall, short, thin, fat. This is us and we stand there in our swimming costumes.\n\"How liberating is that? Not only for us, but for other people looking at us.\n\"We're not afraid of who we are, and who we're becoming.\"\nMs Bennett signed up to the Henleaze Lake centenary celebration synchronised swimming just a few months after having a double mastectomy.\n\"I was diagnosed through a routine mammogram. I almost didn't go and was blas\u00e9 even when I was called back.\n\"They found a huge tumour then another one on the other breast so I had two primaries.\"\nShe had a double mastectomy and later went on to have a hysterectomy.\n\"I know the swimming has really helped my movement and my recovery.\n\"When you lose a body part - I became very disorientated and dizzy. I couldn't bend forward as my head would spin.\n\"But now I can dive in the water again and I'm doing forward somersaults.\n\"I just didn't want to not dive again and gradually I've overcome it in my brain and it's been great.\"\nShe said the pressure of the water is quite impactful too and believes it helped a bit of lymphedema - swelling - that she wanted to reduce.\n\"When you've had radical surgery movement can be an issue but I put my arms up and fling them around all the time [during synchro practice], she added.\n\"I know it has helped my flexibility and range of movement.\"\nMs Bennett said that as well as the physical benefits of the swimming, it has been positive to have somewhere to go where she can \"lark about with friends and just laugh\".\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Among them are the heads of neighbouring Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives - but not Pakistan or China.\nTight security has been in place in Delhi, which was declared a no-fly zone, with more than 2,500 police officers deployed around the venue. \nSpeaking as he was sworn in by President Draupadi Murmu, Mr Modi said he would uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India and govern with \"true faith and allegiance to the constitution\". \nHe said: \"I will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the constitution and the law without fear or favour.\"\nA council of ministers of Mr Modi's new cabinet were also sworn in during the ceremony.\nMr Modi, 73, is only the second Indian leader to win a third consecutive term after the country\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.\nExit polls had projected outright victory for his Hindu Nationalist BJP party, which ruled India for a decade, but it lost its parliamentary majority in the general election. \nHis NDA bloc relied on two key allies, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the Janata Dal (United) JD(U), to cross the 272-seat mark needed to form the government.\nOn Friday, the elected MPs voted Mr Modi as the leader of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the parliament), leader of the BJP parliamentary party, and leader of the NDA.\nIt is not clear what concessions his allies may have negotiated in return for their support. India media report that several are seeking key ministerial posts.\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party, has called the election a mandate against Mr Modi's government. \nMr Modi, however, countered this on Friday, saying: \"Opposition tried to paint 2024 Lok Sabha results as a loss for us. But we didn\u2019t lose, we never lost, we will never lose.\"\nMr Modi thanked voters for their mandate, and said he would \"do everything\" to eradicate corruption and poverty.\n\"Empowering the poor and middle class is our priority,\" he said.\nDuring his election campaign, Mr Modi and his party were accused by critics of using hate speech, attacking the country's Muslim minority, and jailing opposition figures.\nOn Friday, the prime minister-elect said the NDA alliance was \"committed to the principle of \"sarva panth sambhava\" (religious equality).\nThe INDIA alliance has said it will fulfil its duty in parliament by holding the government in check and protecting the constitution.",

    "The family of a convicted sub-postmistress who died before her name was cleared say they have made her final wish come true.\nCaren Lorimer's family took on her case after her death from cancer in April 2022.\nThey were expecting to be back in court this week but her conviction was quashed sooner than expected.\nCaren\u2019s husband David Lorimer said it \"meant the world to him\" but he was sad that his late wife had died before she was exonerated.\nCaren had worked in the New Farm Loch Post Office in Kilmarnock for 17 years before an audit in 2008 uncovered an apparent \u00a338,000 shortfall.\nShe pled guilty to embezzlement to avoid going to prison. \nAt the time Caren had a four-year-old son and an adult daughter.\nIn 2009, she was sentenced to 300 hours of community service and forced to pay the Post Office \u00a315,000.\nShe was one of hundreds of people across the UK falsely accused of crimes like theft and false accounting.\nThe Horizon Post Office scandal has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in the UK in recent times.\nCaren\u2019s family were hoping her name would be cleared at a court hearing on Friday but her niece, Joanne Hughes, received an email from the family's lawyer ten days ago.\nTo her delight it confirmed her aunt's conviction had been quashed.\nJoanne said: \"The first thing I did was call David and I don\u2019t even think I said hello, I just said 'That\u2019s it, she\u2019s clear, she\u2019s clear!'\n\"I think we both had goosebumps.\n\"It\u2019s like we\u2019ve made her final wish come true, which is priceless.\"\nDavid said it was amazing but that his emotions were up and down.\nHe added: \"I\u2019m really, really happy and I\u2019m really sad that Caren\u2019s not here but she\u2019ll know.

    "Cargo and passenger services could be operating from Manston Airport within the next four years after a judicial review into plans was not upheld.\nAirlines have not flown from the site in Thanet since 2014 and owners RiverOak are now eager to begin its redevelopment into an air cargo hub after waiting for a decision from the courts.\nCampaigners described the development as a \"highly-polluting cargo hub\" that went against the government's planning advice in the face of air pollution and climate change.\nHowever Tony Freudmann, main board director at RiverOak, said his firm will be using the latest technology to build \"the greenest airport in Europe\".\nMr Freudmann said most airports in the UK do not have a runway long enough to take a big freighter and those that do, do not have the capacity. \nHe said: \"If you a freighter operator wanting to export goods to a city in India or Indonesia, you can not get it out of the UK.

    "Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie has \"mixed feelings\" over protests that led to three Scottish book festivals losing sponsorship deals.\nCampaigners targeted investment firm Baillie Gifford regarding links to fossil fuels and companies that have supported Israel in the ongoing Gaza conflict.\nThe demonstrations have left events like the Edinburgh International Book Festival at risk of a funding shortfall.\nMr Harvie told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show that the campaign \"hasn't worked\", and that book festivals were a \"soft target\" for protesters to focus on.\nCampaign group Fossil Free Books demanded the festivals stop working with Baillie Gifford over links they claim the firm has to fossil fuel organisations and Israel, allegations which the company has denied.\nBut Mr Harvie said the campaign had not succeeded.\nHe said: \"I have mixed feelings on this in the same ways that I do with Extinction Rebellion protests, which impact on people rather than on the targets like the big fossil fuel companies.\n\"If the target of that campaign was to get Baillie Gifford to divest from fossil fuels and from companies tarred by association with Israel, then it hasn\u2019t worked. \n\"The objective shouldn\u2019t have been to defund literary festivals.\" \nFossil Free Books told BBC Scotland that it was \"disingenuous\" for Mr Harvie to frame their actions in isolation.    \nIn 2023 the climate change activist Greta Thunberg cancelled an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book Festival over its links with Baillie Gifford. \nThe company had sponsored the annual event for 20 years.\nMore than 50 authors went on to call on the festival to end its deal.\nThe then festival director Nick Barley said it would not have enough money to operate without private sponsorship.\nBut on 30 May the Edinburgh International Book Festival announced the deal had ended.\nAnd last week it was confirmed Baillie Gifford's deals with the Borders Book Festival and the Wigtown Book Festival had also ceased.\nBook festival organisers said the constant threat of disruption meant they would not be able to deliver events safely. \nMr Harvie said: \"I don't think the goal was to shut down literary festivals. \n\"The goal should be to focus on the investors and the investment decisions that they make. That's a very legitimate goal. \n\"The danger here is a campaign that ends up hitting a soft target when it should have been aiming for a hard target like the investors.\"\nIn a statement, Fossil Free Books said Baillie Gifford \"is not, and has never been, a sustainable or ethical source of funding for the arts\".\nThe spokesperson added its aim is for festivals to work with writers and non-governmental organisations to \"create ethical fundraising policies\" going forward.\nProtests this year have seen hundreds of writers call on literary events to stop their funding links to Baillie Gifford.\nSinger Charlotte Church and comedian Nish Kumar pulled out of appearing at the Hay festival in Wales, another event that later dropped involvement with the firm.\nHowever a number of other writers criticised the Edinburgh festival's decision, with nearly 70 authors signing an open letter calling the campaign against Baillie Gifford \"deeply retrograde\" and a \"Pyrrhic victory\".    \nMr Harvie added that he hoped there would be more investment companies with \"ethical criteria\" and that he would like to see increased government involvement in subsidising cultural events.\nA proposed Green policy is for stadium gigs - such as Taylor Swift at Murrayfield or upcoming concerts by American singer P!nk at Hampden Park - to have a \u00a31 levy per ticket.\nThat would then be reinvested into smaller, grassroots venues, a stance supported by campaigning charity the Music Venues Trust.",
    "Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross is facing \"significant and serious\" allegations that he used Westminster expenses to travel in his role as a football linesman, the first minister has said.\nJohn Swinney said reports in the Sunday Mail, if accurate, would amount to a \"potential misuse of public funds\".\nThe newspaper said advisers to Mr Ross raised concerns over 28 parliamentary travel claims which may have been combined with his work as a linesman.\nThe Scottish Conservative leader said the expenses were approved by independent parliamentary body IPSA and he would have \"no issue\" with the expenses being examined for a second time.\nBut Mr Swinney called on Mr Ross to \"set out\" all the available information regarding the matter.\nUnder UK parliamentary rules, MPs can only claim travel from their home airport.\nIn Mr Ross' case this was either Inverness or Aberdeen when he was MP for Moray.\nThey can also claim for \"diverted\" journeys, but must supply detailed notes on the diversion.\nAccording to the Sunday Mail, in November 2021 Mr Ross' aides raised concerns over a claim which included a \u00a358 parking fee at Inverness Airport.\nIt was dated July 2018 while parliament was in recess.\nIt also stated \u00a343 rail travel from Heathrow to central London was claimed the day after Mr Ross was a linesman in a match in Iceland.\nSpeaking in Paisley, Mr Swinney said: \"Douglas Ross is normally the first to be out of the stables demanding that everybody sets out all of the information, so I think Mr Ross should do that right away because the story raises very significant and serious issues of the potential misuse of public funds.\"\nFurther claims against Mr Ross also include that he claimed a flight from London to Glasgow on expenses and \u00a3109 parking.\nOn 1 November 2020 it is alleged he claimed \u00a348.99 for parking on the day he refereed a Celtic game.\nResponding to the article, Mr Ross said that he had only ever claimed expenses relating to his role as an MP.\nHe also maintained they had been agreed by the independent parliamentary body that oversees expenses.  \nMr Ross added that he would have no issue with them being scrutinised again.\nThe Scottish Conservative leader told the paper it was \"not possible\" to go from London to a football game as he would not have had his referee kit with him.\nOn Sunday Scottish Conservatives deputy leader Meghan Gallacher told BBC Scotland News the party leader would welcome any further scrutiny.\nShe said: \"He has been clear in terms of this matter being one that occurred a few years ago, but also, in terms of saying that should there be any further investigation into these matters that he would welcome that.\n\"These have been approved by the parliamentary IPSA body.\" \nThe claims follow the ongoing row over the essential de-selection of Conservative candidate David Duguid.\nMr Ross is now contesting the Aberdeenshire North & Moray East seat instead of Mr Duguid, who has been in hospital due to ill-health.\nScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy previously told BBC Scotland News that Mr Ross was not directly involved in a \u201cunanimous\u201d decision taken by the party board on Mr Duguid\u2019s candidacy, despite the leader sitting on the board himself.\nMr Hoy said Mr Ross had not taken part in any meetings regarding the matter.\nOn Sunday Ms Gallacher said the party was \"focused\" on the election and described the decision to deselect Mr Duguid as a \"difficult set of circumstances.\"\nShe added the party had only 24 hours to find a candidate once the decision was taken regarding Mr Duguid's candidacy\nBut Mr Swinney has accused the Conservatives of a \"shameful course of action.\"\nAnd he said the full minutes of the meeting should be presented to the public.

    "Labour has said there is a \"better deal to do\" with Tata on the future of its UK operations.\nOn a visit to Port Talbot, where thousands of jobs are at risk, shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds called on the steel giant to wait until after next month's general election and hold new talks.\nTata is proposing major restructuring plans at Port Talbot, including investing \u00a31.25bn in greener technology, but thousands of jobs will disappear during the transition period.\nThe company also said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election.\nMr Reynolds pledged more government money than the \u00a3500m promised by the Conservatives.\n\u201cThe environment [for steelmaking] will get better,\" he said. \n\"I am asking the company to engage with us in good faith to take advantage of that better operating environment. \n\"And I believe there is an outcome that might not be what all of us ideally want, but will work better for everybody. \n\"Most of all for the people here in Port Talbot.\u201d\nOne employee said the looming job losses were \"really hitting home\".\nJamie Jones, 45, who has worked at the site since he was 17, said worries about redundancies could be felt by those working there, with people\u2019s mental health \"under strain\".\nMr Jones, a third-generation steelworker in Port Talbot, said there had long been \"whispers\" about closures, but that the \"finality of it now is really hitting home\".\n\"It\u2019s difficult. You can feel it in the mood there \u2013 people\u2019s mental health is under strain,\" he said.\n\"People have got mortgages, families. The fact that place might not be supporting their families next year is just difficult to fathom at the minute.\"\nMr Jones also said the closure would have a knock-on effect on other industries in the town.\n\"For every one Tata job, there\u2019s probably four or five other jobs \u2013 the cafes in the town, the newsagents that rely on steelworkers to keep them going. So it\u2019s going to be massive if that place goes,\" he said.\nHe added he hoped whichever party wins the general election would introduce a new industrial strategy that helps save jobs in Port Talbot.\n\"Hopefully the unions and Tata can get together and save jobs for future generations,\" he said.\nBut in a message to staff, Tata chief executive Rajesh Nair warned \"neither the general election nor its outcome has any impact\" on the decision to close both blast furnaces by the end of September.\nIt is a move the company argues is essential in cutting its financial losses and paving the way for greener steelmaking in south Wales.\nIn October the UK government announced it would give Tata a \u00a3500m grant towards the \u00a31.25bn cost of a new electric arc furnace. \nThe new furnace will melt scrap steel, and end the current carbon-intensive method of producing liquid iron from rock.\n\nTata Steel has consistently argued its Port Talbot works was losing \u00a31m a day, and that any move towards greener steelmaking would also need to address the financial losses.\nUnions had called for a longer transition period, keeping at least one blast furnace operational until the electric arc furnace is up and running.\nBut Tata has confirmed it will press ahead with the closure of the heavy end in Port Talbot by the end of September, with construction work on the electric furnace scheduled to begin in August 2025.\nA transition board has been established to coordinate support and training opportunities for affected workers. \nThe UK government pledged \u00a380m towards the fund, while Tata Steel has committed \u00a320m.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said they were committed to ensuring steelmaking took place at Port Talbot and was secure for the future by supporting the transition to electric arc furnaces.\nThey said the UK government was investing \u00a3500m into the new furnaces, as well as creating a transition fund worth \u00a3100m to support workers retrain.\nMillions were also being invested into the wider south-west Wales economy with the Celtic Freeport, which was estimated to create thousands of high skilled, well-paid jobs.\n\"This is a huge contrast to the Labour government in Wales who haven't spent a single penny helping the transition,\" said a spokesperson.\nIn response, the Welsh government said it was extending the eligibility to \u00a325m support schemes, such as ReAct, so Tata workers and those in the supply chain can benefit.\nPlaid Cymru's economy and energy spokesman Luke Fletcher MS said Wales\u2019 economy was being held back by Westminster parties, while Labour was not offering the hopeful vision that Wales desperately needed.\n\u201cFrom thousands of good paying and highly skilled jobs at risk in south Wales, to Westminster\u2019s failure to give Wales the powers we need to be in charge of our own economic destiny \u2013 we know this isn\u2019t as good as it gets,\" he said.\nHe said the party's green new deal set out an economic vision which offered  \u201crewarding, meaningful and fair work\" in the emerging green and net-zero sector.\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said Welsh workers could not be \"c",
    "Illegal off-road vehicles could damage coal tips and potentially cause dangerous landslides, fear officials at the local authority with the highest number of sites in Wales.\nThe warning from Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) council comes as police have called on the public to report incidents of illegal riding over the summer months.\nCoal tips from previous mining activity are a feature of the landscape in many parts of Wales, especially the southern valleys, but can become unstable in bad weather.\nLast year the Welsh government published maps showing the locations of 350 tips across Wales that are deemed higher risk and which need regular checks. \nThe tips are a legacy of decades of coal mining in Wales, which at its peak in the early 20th Century saw 620 collieries operating.\nWhen coal was dug out, the \u201cspoil\u201d, or waste material removed at the same time, was piled into tips which has remained part of the landscape in many mining communities.\nBut in bad weather, some may become unstable and cause landslides, such as one that occurred in Tylorstown, RCT, after storms in early 2020. \nRCT, with 79, is the local authority area with the highest number of Category C and D tips in Wales according to the latest data.\nBut the council said that off-road vehicle users have caused damage to the drainage systems on some tips.\nA spokesperson said this could cause \u201cinstability and potentially landslides\u201d, posing risks to \u201cnearby communities and infrastructure\u201d.\nBob Harris, an RCT councillor, said maintaining the infrastructure is both time consuming and expensive, creating challenges amid limited funding.\nSouth Wales Police are also involved in the efforts to tackle off-road biking, which it described as an \u201canti-social behaviour issue\u201d.\n\u201cIllegal riding can cause large environmental issues with the drainage of the land which alters the water course causing the tips to become unstable which may have an effect in the future,\u201d said Gareth Prosser, the force's community safety manager.\n\u201cNew trees that have been planted can also be destroyed by the off-road bikes too,\u201d he said, adding that over the years tips have become home to a range of wildlife, including birds, insects and reptiles.\n\u201cHowever, the steep and sometimes unstable nature of the tips makes them a potentially dangerous environment,\u201d Mr Prosser said.\nThe force added that any witnesses to illegal off-road biking should contact them with as much information as possible, as they attempt to \u201cdeter users through the coming summer months\u201d.",
    "Mary Lou McDonald has said she has no plans to step down as leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, following disappointing election results for the party.\nIreland's main opposition party have performed worse than expected in local elections amid concerns that they had run too many candidates in certain areas.\nMs McDonald has said she will lead a full review into Sinn F\u00e9in's performance.\n\"Obviously we are disappointed,\" she said.\n\"It hasn't been our day, clearly frustrations - anger, indeed - with government policy on this occasion have translated into votes for independents and others,\" Ms McDonald said.\n\"We will regroup. I am sorry that we did not do better. I know that we can do better.\"\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Simon Harris responded: \u201cI think what Sinn F\u00e9in need to realise here is the Irish people see through the noise.\n\"The Irish people don\u2019t believe they live in a failed state, the Irish people don\u2019t believe in all of the negativity.\"\nMr Harris said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with his party Fine Gael's performance \"right across the country, in rural Ireland and urban Ireland\".\n\nT\u00e1naiste (deputy prime minister) and Fianna F\u00e1il leader Mich\u00e9al Martin said his party had performed \"far better\" than predicted.\nCounting is currently ongoing for three sets of elections in the Republic of Ireland for local councils, the European parliament, and a mayoral race in Limerick city.\nResults so far indicate that government coalition partners Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il will be the largest parties in local government, with independents also faring well.\nThe polls will provide political parties with an insight into voter sentiment ahead of the next general election, which must be held by March 2025.\nThis is Mary Lou McDonald's second local election as party president.\nIn 2019 the party's local government representation collapsed to 81.\nMs McDonald was under severe pressure at the time to improve her party's polling, which was then bolstered by its most successful general election in their history.\nNow she is once again under pressure, as it has fallen in opinion polls and are seeing losses across local authorities.\nMary Lou McDonald looked glum when she entered the count centre at the RDS in Dublin.\nThis was an appearance neither she nor her party had anticipated.\nRight up to the end of polling on Friday night, they were preparing for election celebrations. They expected this to be their big moment for a big political breakthrough.\nIt didn\u2019t happen.\nNow the party faces many questions.\nWhy did so many people who wanted change opt for independent candidates, from a wide variety of social and community backgrounds, instead of Sinn F\u00e9in?\nThe failure to capture these votes will sting. For years now, Sinn F\u00e9in has styled itself as the party with its ear closest to the ground, the party most in tune with communities up and down the country.\nSomething, somewhere seems to have been lost in transmission.\nSources within Sinn F\u00e9in told the BBC that there was a feeling among some local groups that head office were not listening to those on the ground when it came to candidate selection. \n\"What we're going to do is review and reflect on all of those things,\" Ms McDonald told the BBC.\n\"Everything for the review is on the table,\" she said. \n\"I will lead this reflection and this process. When the going gets tough, that's the point at which leaders step forward, they don't step down. \n\"I lead a party with immense talent and immense potential, we don't always get it right. We clearly have lessons to learn.\"\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in president said that she would prefer a general election \"tomorrow morning\" and the party will not be looking again at their manifesto. \nShe denied that Sinn F\u00e9in's tougher stance on immigration in recent months had affected their performance.\nThe party had suggested means testing asylum seekers in recent weeks. \nImmigration featured as one of the key issues in the election campaign.",
    "A company that cut down protected woodland next to the M25 and converted it into a builders' yard has been told to return it to its former use.\nGladwins Storage Ltd has been operating for more than a decade to the east side of the M25 in Buckinghamshire, near the junction with the M40 between Gerrards Cross and Denham.\nBuckinghamshire Council issued an enforcement notice, which said the land could not be used to store scaffolding, containers, vehicles, building materials or waste.\nThe Planning Inspectorate dismissed an appeal from the company and concluded the development on the green belt site was inappropriate.\nThe use of the registered ancient woodland, which is protected by a Tree Protection Order, has been the subject of a long-running legal battle.\nIn 2000 it was refused permission for horticultural activity, and in 2009 a Lawful Development Certificate for vehicle and container storage was refused.\nPlanning inspector Simon Hand said the site had also been the subject of a \"considerable history of enforcement action\" and is \"huge and contains dozens if not hundreds of containers as well as compounds for plant hire, builders yards and many scaffolding companies\".\nMr Hand added it \"was never clear how many persons or companies occupied the site\" and the development was inappropriate, resulting in a severe loss of ancient woodland.\nJonathan Turner, the appellant, said jobs would be lost by closing down the site.\nMr Hand ordered Mr Turner to pay the partial costs of the appeal to the council. \nMr Turner has been approached by the BBC for comment.\nA Buckinghamshire Council spokesperson said it welcomed the decision. \n\"The owner of this site has breached planning regulations and will now have to return the site to its former use, in compliance with the enforcement notice.\n\"The council will be seeking to recover the costs incurred from this preparatory work from the appellant.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Campaigners are calling for better wildlife protection at a beauty spot after a swan died following a dog attack.\nMute swan \"Brucie\" had been a popular presence at Fen Park, Lowestoft, Suffolk, for more than five years and had survived a previous dog attack in August 2021.\nBut on May 28, he was attacked again and, following a neck infection, the RSPCA said vets decided \"the kindest thing to do was to put him to sleep to prevent suffering\". \nLowestoft Town Council and the Friends of Fen Park are now urging all dog owners who visit the area to keep their pets on leads and away from wildlife.  \nBrucie's mate Gracie and five thickly downed cygnets are still in the park in Southwell Road, Kirkley, but visitors fear for their safety. \nRoy Saunders, a regular visitor to Fen Park, said: \"My wife, Angela, rang up the RSPCA to inform them about the dog attack on Brucie. It's so sad. Why do people have to let their dogs off the lead?\n\"We were both very upset and as soon as Angela came home she was crying. Swans mate for life so Gracie is now without a mate which is very sad.\" \nMr Saunders said it was the second time in three years that Brucie had been injured in a dog attack. \nHaving undergone 10 weeks of treatment at the RSPCA East Winch Wildlife Centre near King's Lynn in 2021, Brucie was returned to the park.\nBut the RSPCA said the recent attack caused a neck infection and vets decided he had to be put down.\nThe Friends of Fen Park and Lowestoft Town Council, which owns and manages the site, have urged people to keep dogs on leads while near wildlife.\nA spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: \"We attended the location on May 29 after a call to say that a swan had been attacked by a dog.\n\"The male swan appeared to be bright and alert and had improved from the day before.

    "In a rare interview from prison, a widow of the Islamic State group\u2019s leader has shared her account of their life. Umm Hudaifa was the first wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and was married to him while he oversaw IS\u2019s brutal rule over large parts of Syria and Iraq. She is now being held in an Iraqi jail while she is investigated for terrorism-related crimes.\nIn the summer of 2014, Umm Hudaifa was living in Raqqa, IS\u2019s then-stronghold in Syria, with her husband.\nAs the wanted leader of the extremist jihadist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi often spent time in other locations, and on one of those occasions he sent a guard to the house to pick up two of their young sons. \u201cHe told me they were going on a trip to teach the boys how to swim,\u201d says Umm Hudaifa.\nThere was a television in the house that she used to watch in secret. \u201cI used to turn it on when he wasn\u2019t at home,\u201d she says, explaining he thought it didn\u2019t work. She says she was cut off from the world and he hadn\u2019t let her watch television or use any other technology, such as mobile phones, since 2007.\nA few days after the guard took the children, she says she switched on the television and got \u201ca huge surprise\u201d. She saw her husband addressing the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, showing himself for the first time as the head of the self-declared Islamic caliphate. It was only weeks after his fighters had seized control of the area.\nThe footage of al-Baghdadi making his first public appearance in years, with his long beard, dressed in black robes and demanding allegiance from Muslims, was seen across the world and marked a key moment for IS as it swept across Iraq and Syria.\nUmm Hudaifa says she was shocked to find out her sons were in Mosul with him rather than learning to swim in the Euphrates.\nShe describes the scene from the crowded prison in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, where she is being held while Iraqi authorities investigate her role in IS and the group\u2019s crimes. It\u2019s noisy as inmates accused of various crimes, including drug use and sex work, are moved around the prison and food deliveries arrive from outside.\nWe find a quiet spot in the library and speak for nearly two hours. During our conversation she paints herself as a victim who tried to escape from her husband and denies she was involved in any of IS\u2019s brutal activities.  \nThis is a stark contrast to the way she is described in a court case brought by Yazidis who were abducted and raped by members of IS - they accuse her of colluding in the sexual enslavement of kidnapped girls and women.\nDuring the interview, she doesn\u2019t raise her head, not even once. She\u2019s wearing black and only reveals part of her face, down to the bottom of her nose.\nUmm Hudaifa was born in 1976 into a conservative Iraqi family and married Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, later known by the pseudonym Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in 1999.\nHe had finished studying Sharia, or Islamic law, at the University of Baghdad and she says at the time he was \u201creligious but not extremist\u2026 conservative but open minded\u201d.\nThen in 2004, a year after the US-led invasion of Iraq, American forces detained al-Baghdadi and held him at the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for about a year, along with many other men who would become senior figures in IS and other jihadist groups.\nIn the years after his release, she claims he changed: \u201cHe became short tempered and given to outbursts of anger.\u201d\nOthers who knew al-Baghdadi say he was involved with al-Qaeda before his time in Bucca, but for her, that marked the turning point after which he became increasingly extreme.\n\u201cHe began to suffer from psychological problems,\u201d she says. When she asked why, he told her that \u201che was exposed to something that \u2018you cannot understand\u2019\u201d.\nShe believes that although he did not explicitly say so, \u201cduring his detention he was subjected to sexual torture\u201d. Pictures from another US-run prison in Iraq, Abu Ghraib, that came to light that year showed prisoners forced to simulate sexual acts and adopt humiliating poses.\nWe put her allegation to the US Department of Defense, the Pentagon, but have not received a response.\nShe says she started to wonder if he belonged to a militant group. \u201cI used to search his clothes when he came back home, when he was taking a shower or when he went to sleep.\n\u201cI\u2019d even search his body for bruises or injuries\u2026 I was perplexed,\u201d she says, but she didn\u2019t find anything.\n\u201cI told him back then, \u2018You\u2019ve gone astray\u2019\u2026 it drove him into a raging fit.\u201d\nShe describes how they often moved house, had fake identities and her husband married a second wife.

    "\"Kids with special needs are among the most vulnerable in our society and they're getting treated like second-class citizens.\"\nThat is according to Christopher Flanagan-Kane from north Belfast, whose 11-year-old son is autistic and is still waiting for a post-primary school place for September.\nIn a statement, the Education Authority (EA) told BBC News NI they had been in contact with Aodhan's family \"to provide an update on the placement process and the next steps.\"\n\"We fully understand that this is an anxious time for the family,\" the statement said.\nBut the EA did not provide an answer when asked by BBC News NI about how many children with special educational needs (SEN) were still waiting to have their school place confirmed.\nMost children moving from primary to post-primary had their school place confirmed in mid-May.\nBut the Department of Education (DE) has previously said that there is a big rise in the number of children with special educational needs who require a school place this year.\nMr Flanagan-Kane said the wait for a confirmed place was having a \"big impact\" on Aodhan's mental health.\nAodhan is currently in a special education unit in a mainstream primary but in school for a reduced number of hours.\n\"The school is absolutely amazing, the teachers are amazing but it just hasn't really worked for Aodhan,\" Mr Flanagan-Kane said.\n\"This past year has been very challenging for him.\n\"He first got diagnosed when he was about four with autism and then he was about six when he got diagnosed with ADHD.\"\nMr Flanagan-Kane said that they now wanted to make sure Aodhan got the right place in September.\n\"We had put in for a special education school for Aodhan that mainly dealt with behavioural, social and emotional needs - more nurturing rather than educational needs.\n\"It seemed a good match for Aodhan - we went and visited the school.\"\nBut in May the family was informed by the EA that Aodhan had not been placed.\n\"Aodhan doesn't really fit the criteria for a lot of special education schools because he doesn't really have any learning difficulties as such,\" according to Mr Flanagan-Kane.\nThe school his parents had hoped Aodhan could go to has limited places.\nThat has meant a \"really, really stressful\" situation for the family.\n\"He's asking me on a daily basis, a couple of times a day, have they got a school for him yet,\" said Mr Flanagan-Kane.\n\"Aodhan has two full weeks of school left, and then he has no school to go to come September still.\"\nHe said this had left him feeling \"very, very frustrated over it all.\"\n\"I've feared this time coming up when he was transitioning to secondary school because I've read so many horror stories,\" he said.\n\"This isn't a new thing. This happens every single year.\"\n\"They just don't have enough schools to provide for special education.\"\nIn 2023, hundreds of children with SEN started the summer holiday without knowing which school they would be going to when the new school year began.\nSenior officials at the EA have also warned that \"it is going to be difficult and challenging to place all children\" with SEN in summer 2024.\nThe Education Minister, Paul Givan, has said up to eight new special schools will be built over the next decade, including four in Belfast.\nBut that is a long-term strategy which will not address immediate pressure on places.\nIn its statement to BBC News NI, the EA said that parents and carers \"have been advised that meetings with schools to discuss consultations are taking place across the month of June\".\n\"All families will be informed once their child's place has been finalised, based on their individual needs,\" the statement continued.\n\"Ensuring all children with a statement of SEN receive the right support, from the right people, at the right time, in the right place is a critical priority for the EA and we remain committed to keeping all families informed.\"\nThey also said that parents and carers could contact a SEN helpline on 028 9598 5960 which is open from Monday to Friday from 09:00 .\n Further information, it said, is available on the EA website.",

    "An investigation has begun after four people, including an 11-year-old girl, were taken to hospital when a funfair ride malfunctioned at a country show in south London.\nThe incident happened during Lambeth Country Show in Brockwell Park at about 18:20 BST on Saturday, according to Lambeth Council.\nIt said the investigation would \"determine the cause of the malfunction\".\nFunfair rides at the show will be closed on Sunday, the council added.\nOne of the fairground rides could be seen covered in tarpaulin on Sunday morning, although it was not clear which ride had malfunctioned.\nThe council said emergency services had arrived at the scene shortly after the incident and the funfair had been closed.\nWriting on X, formerly Twitter, the Metropolitan Police in Lambeth said the other injured people were a man and a woman in their 40s and a man in his 50s.\nThe Met added none of those hurt were in a life-threatening condition.\nCordons had been put in place and the Health and Safety Executive would be informed, the police said.\nAdditional safety checks were being carried out on all rides and attractions at the show, Lambeth Council said.\nIt said on Sunday that the four injured people were being cared for in hospital, adding: \"Our thoughts are with them.\n\u201cWe thank the emergency services for their swift response and for the support they are providing to the affected families.\n\"To allow a full investigation, funfair rides at the show will be impacted by closures for the second day of the country show. \n\"The safety and well-being of our attendees remains our top priority, and we are committed to providing a secure and enjoyable experience for all visitors.\u201d\nThe show continued from 13:00 BST on Sunday but with all fairground rides shut and cordoned off.\nA ride topped with a giant frog was among those seen behind tall black fencing.\nSigns that said \"apologies for any inconvenience, this ride will not open today\" were pinned to wire fencing circling the fairground area.\nDisappointed visitors of all ages were seen reading the signs and talking to a fairground worker, who told them all the rides are shut, before heading off to enjoy other attractions at the event.\nBrockwell Park is a popular green space located near Brixton.\nThe incident fell on the 50th anniversary of the Lambeth Country Show, which is one of the \"biggest free family festivals in the UK\", according to its website.\nA spokesperson for London Ambulance Service said four crews were deployed along with members of its hazardous area response team and an air ambulance.\nAll four people injured were taken to \"major trauma centres\", they added.",
    "Facial recognition will be used by a police force at the British Grand Prix for a second year.\nNorthamptonshire Police will use the technology to help prevent criminal activity at the event, which is expected to host about 480,000 people on 4-7 July.\nThe software was first used by Northamptonshire Police at the Silverstone race in 2023.\nDet Supt Richard Tompkins said: \"Each year throws up its own challenges so we can never afford to become complacent.\"\nThe technology works by using a camera to scan faces to match biometrics against those held on a watch list. \nSigns and QR codes will be displayed to \"clearly\" mark where the live facial recognition is being used. \nMr Tompkins said he did not want criminals attending the event. \n\"If you are wanted in Northamptonshire... in surrounding counties, or indeed if we have information that you may be coming to commit crime as part of an organised gang, we will load your image up.\"\nHowever, if someone is identified using the technology, manual checks, including fingerprints, will also take place which is why Mr Tompkins said there are \"slim\" possibilities of people being wrongly identified. \nIn 2020, court of appeal judges found a trial project carried out by South Wales Police to scan thousands of faces to be unlawful. \nIt was found that there had been no clear guidance on where the technology could be used and who could be put on a watch list, and that a data protection impact assessment was deficient. \nThey said the force did not take reasonable steps to find out if the technology had a racial or gender bias. \nCivil rights group Liberty claimed the facial recognition technology would \"always be used disproportionately against communities of colour\".\nMr Tompkins said if it keeps people safe then it is \"something worth doing\". \nHe said: \"I liken this to CCTV in public towns where there was understandingly some concerns to the public a number of years ago.\n\"It's the same thing here, I absolutely get the concerns, we don't retain the data... it comes back to what is the primary aim of the operation.

    "As anti-lockdown protests flared across China\u2019s cities in November 2022, hundreds of thousands around the world were glued to an unlikely source: a mysterious X account, fronted by a cartoon cat.\nProtest footage, details about police movements, news of arrests - Teacher Li Is Not Your Teacher posted a torrent of real-time updates sourced from ordinary citizens.\nLittle of it could be found on China\u2019s tightly-controlled state media or internet. All of it was curated by one person, sitting in a bedroom in Italy \u2013 an art school student named Li Ying.\nMr Li has since become a vital chronicler of information deemed politically sensitive by Beijing. His X account is a window into Xi Jinping\u2019s China where authorities\u2019 vice-like grip on information keeps tightening. From major protests to small acts of dissent, corruption to crime, it is zealously scrubbed off the Chinese internet, only to turn up on Mr Li\u2019s account.\nHe says this has earned him the wrath of the authorities and, in an interview with the BBC, he painted a clear picture of how Beijing pressures dissidents overseas. He alleged the Chinese government is not only harassing him but also his friends, family and X followers in a coordinated campaign of intimidation.\nThe Chinese government has not responded to our questions and we are unable to independently verify all of Mr Li\u2019s claims. But the tactics he detailed have been documented by activists, rights groups and other governments.\nHis activism was an accident, he told the BBC over the phone. \n\u201cIt is the Chinese authorities\u2019 unrelenting constriction of freedom of speech and media freedoms that has led me to slowly change from an ordinary person to who I am today.\"\nLi\u2019s online existence began with writing and posting love stories on Weibo, the Chinese microblogging platform. \u201cI was someone who had made love my main creative theme, I had nothing to do with politics,\u201d the son of two art teachers explained. Even the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which Beijing stamped out, hardly made an impact on him: \u201cI was just like many ordinary people, I didn\u2019t think that the protests had anything to do with me.\u201d\nThen the pandemic struck. As China sealed itself off, Mr Li - by now studying at a prestigious art school in Italy - became desperate to find out what was going on back home. Scouring social media, he was shocked to read about the crushing lockdowns: \u201cThere were people starving, even jumping off buildings\u2026 the feeling at the time was of a lot of suffering and pressure.\u201d\nHe started discussing these stories on Weibo. Some followers privately sent him their stories asking him to publish on their behalf, which he did. Censors took notice, and blocked his account.\nUndeterred, he began a cat-and-mouse game, setting up a new Weibo account each time they shut one down. Fifty-three accounts later, he had enough: \u201cI said okay, I\u2019m going on Twitter.\u201d\nOn X, unfettered by China\u2019s censors, yet accessible through virtual private networks, Mr Li\u2019s following grew. But it only really exploded, to more than a million, in late 2022 during the White Paper protests against China\u2019s punishing zero-Covid measures.\nHis account became an important clearing house for protest information; at one point, he was deluged with messages every second. Mr Li hardly slept, fact-checking and posting submissions that racked up hundreds of millions of views.\nOnline death threats from anonymous accounts soon followed. He said the authorities arrived at his parents\u2019 home in China to question them. Even then, he was sure life would return to normal once the protests died down.\n\u201cAfter I finished reporting on the White Paper movement, I thought that the most important thing I could ever do in this life was finished,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about continuing to operate this account. But just as I was thinking about what I should do next, suddenly all my bank accounts in China were frozen.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realised - I couldn\u2019t go back anymore.\u201d\nFears about Chinese espionage have been steadily growing in the West as ties with China sour. What worries them are reports that Beijing is surveilling and pressuring its citizens who live in foreign jurisdictions. China has dismissed these allegations as \u201cgroundless and malicious defamation\u201d, and said it is committed to protecting the rights and safety of its people abroad.\nBut the accusations are mounting. Last year US authorities alleged that a Chinese police taskforce was using social media including X to harass Chinese targets online, and charged dozens for \u201cinterstate threats\u201d.\nAustralia is reportedly investigating a Chinese espionage operation targeting residents and a former spy has told Australian media how he targeted a political cartoonist in Cambodia and an activist in Thailand. Rights group Amnesty International found that Chinese studying overseas who took part in anti-government protests were being surveilled.\nAnalysts trace China\u2019s so-called transnational repression back to the decade-old Ope",
    "A cigarette butt is suspected to have caused a forest fire that is believed to have killed thousands of young trees.\nNests and charred wood have been found after flames ripped through thousands of trees in Harrow Hill in the Forest of Dean following a \"short hot spell\" in May.\nLeoni Dawson, community ranger for Forestry England, said they were worried \"this whole place is dead and gone\".\nIt is thought no deer or boar were harmed due to a deer fence enclosing the area, but concerns remain for insects, reptiles, small mammals and bird nests.\nDescribing the site, Ms Dawson said: \"You can see how dry it is, how brown and dead it is.\"\nShe said their working assumption was the fire, likely started by a cigarette stub, had spread quickly because it was so dry after a few days of warm sunshine.\nThe trees in the area where the fire started were only planted eight years ago.\nAs the trees were not yet in leaf, the sunlight was able to penetrate the ground and dry it \"quickly\", which Ms Dawson said had enabled the flames to spread more rapidly.\n\"It's really sad.\n\"Because of the time of year it happened, they were flushing. We are worried that this whole place is dead and gone.\"\nForestry England does not have specific records of what was at the site, but charred nests \"beautifully lined with feathers\" were found.\n\"We're hoping they were just at that building phase and there were no chicks or eggs in there,\" Ms Dawson said.\n\"The birds themselves would have been able to fly away, but it's just whatever was contained within those nests that we would be worried about.\"\nTo prevent a similar situation from happening again, Ms Dawson urged visitors to be responsible.\n\"Please do not have barbecues, especially the little disposable ones, they are so dangerous,\" she said.\n\"If you're going to smoke, carry a little pouch with you that you can put your butts in so you can dispose of them properly when you get home.\"\nAnyone who noticed a forest fire was advised to get to safety before calling 999, with a what3words location that was particularly helpful to fire crews, she added.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Before the country heads to the polls on 4 July, BBC Scotland News has been asking voters what matters to them.\nAs part of our Your Voice, Your Vote series, we have been listening to the issues causing the most concern in communities up and down the country.\nThis week, our reporters ventured to Orkney, Aberdeenshire, Tayside, North Lanarkshire and Fife to ask people what was going to influence their vote.\nThe journey started at Kirkwall Harbour, the UK's busiest cruise destination, where 232 cruise liners will dock this year.\nTourism is important but the big ticket items on people's minds were transport, cost of living and energy.\nThey said everything on an island was more expensive.\nLiam Valentine, 33, and his daughter Ellie, who has just turned one, were enjoying the competition at a junior athletics weekend. \nLiam told BBC Scotland News his major concern for his growing family was the cost of living.\nHe said: \"I think for future generations, especially having two young children that are going to go through it as well \u2013 then I feel we need to have more affordable housing and to be able to afford food.\"\nBack on the mainland, the next stop was Broughty Ferry.\nIt now forms a new constituency with Arbroath and Angus.\nPeople there said they wanted to see more economic help for young people.\nThe subject of the NHS came up, as did crime, with calls for more police officers.\nIan Ashton operates SaltDog Marine - which runs boat trips on the River Tay to see Dundee's dolphins.\nHe said 80% of his customers were local to the city with the rest coming from countries like Japan and the USA.\nIan told BBC Scotland News he would like to see regeneration in the area.\nHe added: \"Having investment in things that draw people into your towns, I think, is really important.\n\"There's a real sense of community in Broughty Ferry, it has evaded the empty shops of the high street and, anything that can sustain that or promote that would be the big thing for most of the shop holders.\n\"I would say a look at rates would help.\"\nHeading south to Coatbridge, traditionally an industrial town, the issue that kept coming up was the health service. \nAlthough a devolved matter and not therefore a general election issue as such, people were worried about its sustainability.\nAt the Summerlee Mining Museum, locals said the NHS should be a \"number one\" priority for politicians.\nYounger voters worried about getting on the property ladder and the cost of living was on many minds.\nAnna Butterfield runs a Jo Jingles baby group. She has seen her business become less of a priority for parents.\n\"People's priorities are paying food bills.

    "Nearly 300 rapes and sexual assaults reported by sex workers during the Emma Caldwell murder investigation were not dealt with by police at the time, a senior officer has confirmed.\nPolice Scotland\u2019s deputy chief constable said an operation had been launched to examine sex offences which were reported around 2005. \nShe said a number of the offences were now being dealt with by the courts.\nA former detective told the BBC he had received multiple reports of rape when he worked on the murder inquiry. \nBut he said they were \u201cboxed\u201d \u2013 marked as irrelevant and not followed up.\nWillie Johnston, who was in charge of the murder inquiry at the time, declined to comment.\nThe then Strathclyde Police launched one of its most expensive murder investigations after Emma Caldwell\u2019s body was found in remote woodland in South Lanarkshire in 2005.\nThe 27-year-old had been working as a sex worker in Glasgow, to fund her heroin addiction.\nAbout 800 women were working in the city\u2019s red light district at the time and many were interviewed by detectives on the inquiry.\nA BBC Scotland podcast, Who Killed Emma?, revealed a total of 276 rapes and sexual assaults reported by sex workers during the investigation were not followed up by police.\nFormer Det Sgt Willie Mason worked on the inquiry in 2005.\nMr Mason was based on a bus run by a church group which parked each week in the red light district.\nHe was tasked with gaining the trust of the women who were working on the streets. \nMr Mason said the women began reporting attacks to him \u2013 sometimes up to five reports on one night.\nHe said: \"I would take what was classed as a message from them, and then I would write it up the following day, and put it into the inquiries, saying their name, their age, date of birth, address, where they could be contacted, and saying that a man in a blue car, you know, had attacked her.\n\"Just the basic details that they were telling me. Sometimes they were able to name them, sometimes they weren\u2019t.\n\"It could be anything from a slap in the face to, you know, a rape.\n\"It wasn\u2019t just me that was collecting them. The guys out doing the general leg work, they were putting these reports in as well.\"\nThe former detective said questions were raised at briefings with those leading the Emma Caldwell murder inquiry about what was happening with the reports.\nHe said: \"But we were told at one point in a daily briefing, a number of daily briefings, when these questions were raised, that this wasn\u2019t a matter for this inquiry team.

    "Structures which emerged from a cliff due to coastal erosion may be connected to a centuries-old fishery in the area, experts believe. \nPolice were called to Foxton beach in Northumberland in March when the rectangular boxes were spotted by a dog walker who thought they were graves.\nBut an investigation has concluded  they are likely to be tanks for live bait.\nNorthumberland Coast National Landscape Officer Sarah Winlow said they could have been \"cut through the layer of beachrock when the cliff must have been further back\".\nAfter the discovery a mini excavation was carried out by local archaeologists who suspected the boxes might be burial cists - stone-lined coffins dating from the Bronze age onwards.\nThey called in Adrian Osler, a former maritime curator with Tyne and Wear Museums, who pointed out evidence of a coble fishery for the nearby village of Lesbury in the Whaw Burn area from the 17th Century.\nHe believes the structures could have been used for bait or live catch storage, or for preserving lines or nets.\n\"The principal baits used in inshore fisheries were limpets and mussels, either of which might be held in short-term storage in water,\" he said. \nA stone-lined pit had previously been recorded at the site in 2013 and it appears there is a third pit heading back into the cliff which could not be investigated because it was too dangerous to access. \nThe dig revealed the tanks were cut into beachrock, an unusual formation of sand and seashells which has also been recorded further up the coast at Cocklawburn.\nMs Winlow said: \"Our current hypothesis is that the tanks were cut through the layer of beachrock at some point between the 17th and 20th Centuries, when the cliff must have been further back.\n\"The spring tides have damaged both exposed pits but, in the past few weeks, the rate of erosion seems to have to slowed and the site now appears to be stable and covered up once more.\" \nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "The father of an Israeli hostage rescued during a military operation in Gaza died a day before he could be reunited with his son, a relative has said.\nAlmog Meir Jan, 22, was held in Gaza for eight months after being kidnapped from the Nova music festival on 7 October.\nHe was one of four hostages who were rescued from central Gaza on Saturday, in an air and ground raid that also killed scores of Palestinians.\nIn the months before Almog's release, the health of his father Yossi deteriorated and he was \"glued to the television\", his sister Dina told Israeli broadcaster Kan.\n\"He was worried that he (Almog) was in the hands of murderers and about what was happening to him and what he was going through,\" Ms Jan said.\nYossi Jan is believed to have died of a heart attack.\n\u201cMy brother died of grief and didn\u2019t get to see his son return,\" Dina Jan said.\nThe rescue of Almog Jan and three other hostages was met with jubilation and relief in Israel, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netyanhu praised special forces for operating \"creatively and bravely\".\nBut the humanitarian toll of the operation, which included a barrage of Israeli airstrikes, has sparked condemnation.\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 274 people were killed in the operation. If confirmed, it would make it one of the deadliest days in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict.\nA Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said the death toll was fewer than 100. \nQatar's Prime Minister called for an intensification of global pressure on Israel to stop its \"barbaric aggression\" in Gaza, during a summit in Doha on Sunday.\nThe European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, condemned the killings as \"another massacre of civilians\".\nAn Israeli minister said that instead of condemning Hamas for hiding behind civilians, the EU had condemned Israel for saving its citizens.\nIsraeli forces, backed by air strikes, fought intense gun battles with Hamas in the Nuseirat area, in what the Israel Defense Forces called a \"high-risk, complex mission\" based on \"precise\" intelligence.\nIn addition to Almog Meir Jan, hostages Noa Argamani, 26, Andrei Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 41, were rescued during the operation.\nSome 116 people kidnapped in October remain in captivity. More than a third of them have already been confirmed dead, but that number is thought likely to be higher.\nBenjamin Netanyahu visited the four returned hostages in hospital, telling one \"we didn't give up on you for one moment\".\n\u201cWe expect Hamas to release them all. But if they don\u2019t, we will do whatever it takes to get them all back home,\" Mr Netanyahu said outside hospital.\nOn Sunday, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 37,084 people had been killed since the beginning of the conflict.",
    "A 79-year-old woman bled to death following a hip operation after being rushed to a hospital which lacked a service to save her, a coroner has said.\nChristine Booker from Wareham died on 24 February 2023, the day after her hip replacement.\nCoroner Brendan Allen said she was initially transferred to Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester, which had no out-of-hours interventional radiology (an imaging procedure), before being sent to Royal Bournemouth Hospital.\nIn a Prevention of Future Deaths report, he said patients in west Dorset faced a \"potentially considerable and significant delay in the provision of urgent and life-saving treatment\".\nMrs Booker suffered a large amount of bleeding when a surgeon at the private Winterbourne Hospital in Dorchester drilled into her hip socket, the coroner said.\nShe initially appeared to recover but her blood pressure plummeted about three hours after the operation, her family added.\nAfter resuscitation efforts, she was transferred to Dorset County Hospital.\nHowever, she then had to be flown 27 miles (44km) by air ambulance to Bournemouth, arriving shortly after 22:00 GMT, the family said.\nShe underwent embolisation - a procedure to stop the blood flow - but died the following day from haemorrhagic shock, the inquest recorded.\nWriting to Dorset County Hospital, the coroner said the lack of an out-of-hours service in Dorchester exposed patients to an \"increased risk of death\".\nThe hospital told the BBC it would respond in due course.\nMrs Booker's husband Peter, 84, who celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary with her shortly before she died, said \"a lot of mistakes were made\".\nHe added: \"It was avoidable, as far as I understand.

    "Glasgow's oldest chippy has fed thousands of customers in its 149-year history - including a former Beatle.\nThe Beltrami family opened the Swiss Restaurant on Glasgow Cross, where the city centre meets the east end, in 1875.\nIt was then acquired by the Corvi family in 1938 and renamed the Val d'Oro.\nEnrico Corvi, 65, who runs the shop said: \"It's been a way of life for us since we were kids.\n\"I've done 58 years behind the counter.\"\nThe walls of the old fashioned chippy showcase the family's heritage and how the area has gradually changed over the decades.\nFor many years, it was managed by Luigi Corvi - an experienced tenor known for serenading Celtic fans with Italian opera before matches at Parkhead.\nHis performances eventually led to an invitation to sing before the Queen at the Scottish Parliament's opening in 2011.\nHis brother Enrico, a trained theatre actor who attended the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London, took over in recent years with the help of his son, Gianluca.\nGlasgow Cross was formerly the hub of the city, with High Street running down the centre.\n\"There was no lack of restaurants or small businesses at the cross,\" said Enrico.\n\"It was crammed between Saltmarket, London Road, Gallowgate, High Street and Trongate - it was very busy, there were hundreds of businesses. \n\"If my grandfather had come over to Scotland even 40 years before I think he still would\u2019ve made his fortune around here.\"\nPeter Corvi, who died in 1992, first came to Scotland from Tuscany in Italy in the 1930s.\nBut he was put off by his job washing dishes in Dundee and returned home.\nHowever his brother, Berty, persuaded him to return to the country, where he himself had found success in opening an ice cream van in Bo'ness, Falkirk.\nPeter took his advice and opened an ice cream van to compete with his brother.\nSoon he made the move to Glasgow where he went on to open a series of chip shops, including the Coronation and the Tivali.\nBut the Val d'Oro is the only shop still in the family and is one of the oldest chippies in Scotland.\nEnrico said the chippy even stayed open during wartime, as bombs threatened the city.\nHe recalled: \"My grandfather could barely speak English and he was one of the very few that wasn't interned.\n\"Because this area was so rough and ready, the police wanted to keep my grandfather there because he knew that he could handle them.\"\nHe said that one bomb was dropped in Glasgow Green and threw up a cordite haze, which settled on the streets.\n\"When it settles, you can't see anything unless you go underneath the haze,\" he said.\n\"It sits at a certain level. People were ducking underneath the haze and going into the Val d'Oro and asking 'can you give me ten fags Louis?'\"\nEnrico said the area was \"rough\" at the height of the Val d'Oro's popularity but it has improved in recent years.\n\"My dad was good at fighting and you needed to be a fighter to have a shop around here,\" he added.\nThe shop reached its peak in the 60s and 70s, when the restaurant would be bursting with life and full until closing time at midnight.\nEnrico said: \"You didn't have the in-house entertainment that you have today.\n\"People had to come out - and that's what made the atmosphere in here.\n\"People would come out at night and it would be buzzing in here and out on the pavement.\"\nBut Enrico said things started to change for the shop once people started moving out of the city centre.\n\"When they built the new towns nearby the city, they all became the satellites of Glasgow and drew down the population of the city, even to the present day. \n\"There is a trickle back into the city centre, but not what it was in those days when it was so busy.\"\nThe shop has seen some famous faces over the years, including Paul and Linda McCartney in 1973.\n\"He did a U-turn outside in the jeep, parked up, came in and asked for two fish suppers,\" Enrico said.\n\"They were on their way up to their farm on the Mull of Kintyre.\" \nEnrico said other famous customers included Jack Mulroy, Larry Marshall, Jimmy Logan, Marti Pellow and Frankie Boyle.\n\"We've had illustrious customers, but the main one is the great Glasgow public,\" he said. \"We still get people coming in that were coming in 60 years ago. \n\"Some of them had their first date in the Val d'Oro and a lot of our customers were brought up with us. We knew all the families. \n\"But it's a world away from what it was as a living, breathing part of the community.\n\"A lot of these bonafide Glasgow customers aren't around here anymore.\"\nEnrico remains an optimist and added: \"With a bit of investment and a bit of thought, you can turn the clock back on this shop.\"\nDespite the financial challenges the Val d'Oro faced during the Covid pandemic and cost of living crisis, Enrico still has high hopes of the future.\n\"We're a fundamental part of the city,\" he said.\n\"As long as we keep the quality and keep the enthusiasm, we'll always get someone coming in the door.\"",
    "A team of professional and amateur archaeologists has been digging for prehistoric, Roman, medieval, and Georgian remains.\nThe dig at Cothelstone Farm in the Quantocks is funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and gives volunteers the opportunity to learn how to excavate a site.\nThe site was significant to people during the Bronze Age right up until medieval times, archaeologists said.\nDan Broadbent, historic heritage officer for the Quantock Landscape Partnership Scheme, said: \"What makes it so special is the idea that you have a single place looking out at this fantastic view which was clearly important for people in the past over a long period.\"\nThe scheme, alongside charity DigVentures, organised the dig after seeing aerial images of the site which showed \"potential features\".\n\"Our aim was to really understand those features, ideally what their function may have been and how they might have related to each other,\" Mr Broadbent said.\n\"We appear to have people here using this site in the Bronze Age, we've got Roman pottery, and then we've got this later phase of early medieval, probably Saxon burials,\" Mr Broadbent added.\n\"So people keep returning to this spot, seeing it as significant and that to me is what makes it really, really special.\" \nVolunteers from the local area were digging at the site, alongside professional archaeologists.\n\"We've got a good group of volunteers who have been with us over the years and I think some genuine friendships have been formed,\" Mr Broadbent said. \n\"There's something about the nature of doing archaeology with likeminded people, there's also something really mindful about it.\n\"The point of our work is to make it available to the local community.\"\nHarriet Tatton, who is an archaeologist working with DigVentures, said the dig had been \"worth it\". \n\"We had an arrowhead come out of one of our large ditches, which is very cool,\" Ms Tatton said.\n\"As the story has evolved, we discovered that the ring ditch was probably visible into medieval times, the Romans would have seen it, the Anglo-Saxons would have seen it, so being able to tell that story has been very cool.\"\nThe ring ditch was likely a ceremonial site during the Bronze Age.\nAfter recording all the findings, the team will begin cleaning up the site.\n\"We don't just leave the site like this, I think there'll be some very unhappy sheep if we left big holes in the ground. \n\"We will get a digger in who will backfill everything.

Although probably not in the way he\u2019d have liked.\nAs votes for the European Parliament were still being counted, Mr Macron dominated the headlines. \nHis drubbing in the poll by French hard-right nationalists had been expected. His decision to dissolve France\u2019s national parliament as a result, came as a shock.\nHe had played with the idea last year, after getting trounced in France\u2019s last general election but few expected this move now.\nIt\u2019s a huge gamble. From a position of weakness.\nEmmanuel Macron describes himself as a centrist and a passionate European. \nThis snap general election, taking place in two rounds on 30 June and 7 July, could result in him having to work alongside a French prime minister from the Eurosceptic far right. \nMarine Le Pen, regularly portrayed as his political nemesis, declared on Sunday that her party was ready to govern.\nIt\u2019s happened before in France that the president, who is the country\u2019s most powerful politician, and the prime minister, hail from different political parties. \nBut if the new prime minister were to come from the far right, that would be a first for France.\nMarine Le Pen has worked hard in recent years to try to broaden the appeal of her political movement and to soften its extremist image. \nShe and her supporters hope this significant victory at EU level (her National Rally party garnered more than double the number of votes of President Macron\u2019s Renaissance party) will translate into huge wins in the snap election back home.\nHer dream would be that those successes would then bring her, or her hugely popular prodigee, the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a big stride closer to eventually becoming French president - something she\u2019s attempted and failed to achieve a number of times before. The next presidential vote in France is scheduled for 2027.\nStaying with this election for the European Parliament, the hard right and nationalist right made gains in many parts of the EU, with voters worried about migration, inflation and the cost of environmental reforms.\nBut whether they will be able to really influence future EU policy is unclear.\nThe majority of seats in the EU chamber where the bloc\u2019s laws are debated, modified, passed or rejected, remain firmly in the hands of centrist parties.\nTo affect EU policy, hard-right parties from across the bloc will have to unite, to give them clout.\nAnd that\u2019s a challenge. They have differing national priorities and some deep-seated differences, like how far to support Ukraine against Russia.\nOne issue affecting the lives of all EU citizens, that the hard right has already influenced, is environmental reform. It\u2019s a trillions-of-euros priority for the EU which has long been ambitious about wanting to be a world leader in climate action.\nBut green parties lost a whopping 20 seats in this EU Parliament vote. \nEU taxpayers, faced with the cost-of-living crisis, are increasingly nervous, even resistant to new environmental rules, putting them under pressure to purchase a new heating system for their home or a less-polluting car. \nFarmers across the EU have staged mass protests about environmental rules they label unfair and ruinous.\nThe hard right across Europe visibly used their grievances to portray themselves as the voice of the people, standing up to \"remote elites\" in Brussels and in national government. \nThe result: under pressure ahead of this EU Parliament vote, a number of EU environmental regulations were watered down or rescinded, including one governing pesticide rules. This weakening of green goals could well be an indication of things to come.\nA final thought: When trying to make firm predictions about the kind of power the nationalist right will, or will not, exert in the EU going forward, labels are often not that helpful.\nSome hard-right nationalists are becoming more mainstream to woo more voters and increasing numbers of centre-right politicians have been aping the language of the far right on hot button issues like migration and the environment, in an attempt to hold on to supporters.\nOverall, the centre-right won the largest number of seats and made the biggest number of gains in the European Parliament. \nYou might not see that headline all that often though. It\u2019s less eye-catching than a debate about far-right gains.",
    "The biggest issue facing the Labour Welsh government is the UK general election, Wales' transport secretary has said.\nKen Skates said there was \"no denying\" that Welsh Labour colleagues were focused on \"the need to turf out the Tories\" - while critics continue to call for First Minister Vaughan Gething to resign over his campaign donations row.\nMr Gething lost a vote of no confidence in the Senedd on Wednesday, and opposition parties have indicated they wouldn't support the government to pass a future budget.\nWhen asked on BBC Politics Wales how the Welsh government would pass legislation without a majority, Mr Skates said \"everything would change on July fifth if we wake up to a new UK Labour government\".\n\"Vaughan is determined to deliver for the people of Wales,\" he added.\nMr Skates denied the Welsh government would be distracted by the UK election, saying it was delivering \"on doctor's pay, we've seen it with the significant improvements in rail services operated by Transport for Wales\". \n\"We are delivering, and we'll go on delivering,\" he said.\nMr Skates also said Mr Gething hadn't considered resigning, and insisted he had the \"full support of his colleagues\" in Labour.\nMeanwhile, former first minister Carwyn Jones has called on critics of Mr Gething to give him a chance \"to prove himself\".\nMr Gething's lost no-confidence vote in the Senedd came by two votes, following a row over donations to his leadership campaign by a man convicted of environmental offences.\nTwo Labour colleagues who have had fallouts with Mr Gething were said to be too ill to take part in the vote, after which both the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru have called on the first minister to resign.\nSpeaking to Sunday Supplement, Mr Jones said: \"He knows he'll have to work very, very hard to make sure that he increases the people of Wales' confidence in his tenure as first minister.\"\nMr Jones was first minister of Wales between 2009 and 2018, and followed by Mr Gething's predecessor Mark Drakeford.\nMr Jones added: \"There's an election in 2026, that'll be the time to judge the Welsh Labour government and Vaughan as a first minister. \n\"He hasn't had much of a chance to prove himself.\"\nAsked if Mr Gething had brought the problems on himself, Mr Jones replied: \"Well, people have to judge for themselves. \n\"I'm absolutely sure Vaughan would've wanted to have a different start to his time as first minister.\n\"But he does need, I think, to be given the opportunity to prove himself over the next two years, and then people can judge him in [a Senedd] election.\"\nWelsh Conservative's leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"With Vaughan Gething at the helm, the Welsh government is completely paralysed and unable to focus on the people\u2019s priorities and deliver the change needed to save Wales\u2019 public services.\"\nPlaid Cymru's leader Rhun ap Iorwerth accused Labour of playing \"political gamesmanship\".\nHe said: \"They are asking us to move on to concentrate on the election because they want us to forget about what happened. We can't. And the people of Wales cannot forget about what happened.\n\"This is a scandal of the like of which we have never had before in Wales.\"",
    "A high-profile British judge who resigned from Hong Kong\u2019s highest court last week has warned the city is \u201cslowly becoming a totalitarian state\u201d and judges are being compromised by an \u201cimpossible political environment created by China\u201d.\nLord Sumption\u2019s comments on Monday came as a third senior foreign judge in the past week resigned from the Court of Final Appeal.\n\"The problem in Hong Kong has been building up over the last four years and I think all the judges on the court feel concerned about this,\" Lord Sumption told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"I have reached the point eventually where I don\u2019t think that my continuing presence on the court is serving any useful purpose.\"\nOn Monday he wrote in a newspaper op-ed that the city's rule of law has been \"profoundly compromised\".\nHong Kong\u2019s government said it \"strongly disapproves\" of Lord Sumption's opinions, calling them a \"betrayal against Hong Kong's judges\".\nIt highlighted remarks from the other leaving judges who said they still believed in the independence of the courts.\nCanadian judge Beverley McLachlin, who resigned on Monday citing her wish to spend more time with family said: \"I continue to have confidence in the members of the Court, their independence, and their determination to uphold the rule of law.\u201d\nBut her departure as well as that of Lords Sumption and Lawrence Collins - another former UK Supreme Court justice- last week means at least six senior foreign judges have stepped down from sitting in Hong Kong since a major national security law (NSL) was imposed by China in 2020.\nLord Sumption has been much more overtly critical than his peers- arguing that the laws, which have been widely criticised as being draconian,  have overridden the independent functioning of courts and heaped pressure on the judiciary.\n\u201cIntimidated or convinced by the darkening political mood, many judges have lost sight of their traditional role as defenders of the liberty of the subject, even when the law allows it,\u201d he wrote in the Financial Times.\nSpeaking to the BBC on Monday, Lord Sumption said it had become increasingly clear that Hong Kong\u2019s supercharged security laws were being used to \"crush peaceful political dissent, not just riots.\"\nLegal experts have for some time now warned about the city\u2019s degraded rule of law in the wake of laws enacted by Beijing.\nChina and Hong Kong have defended the NSL laws as crucial to maintaining law and order in the city after major pro-democracy protests and unrest in 2019 and 2020.\nBut rights groups and Western governments say the law has been used to criminalise acts of free speech and assembly, leading to a near complete silencing of dissent in the global financial hub,.\nMore recently, the EU and the US  heavily criticised as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d the conviction of 14 democracy activists on 30 May for \u201csubversion\u201d . The defendants in the landmark Hong Kong 47 case face a minimum of 10 years in prison and could even be jailed for life.\nThat case \"was the last straw\", Lord Sumption said, referencing the court's assessment that organising a political primary was tantamount to a national security crime.\n\"The judgement... was a major indication of the lengths to which some judges are prepared to go to ensure that Beijing's campaign against those who have supported democracy succeeds.\"\nHe also emphasised the other major problem: \"If China doesn't like the court's decisions it can reverse them.\"\nSuch a precedent was set in 2023, when in the high-profile prosecution of Hong Kong billionaire Jimmy Lai, Beijing overturned the Court of Final Appeal\u2019s ruling to allow the democracy activist his choice of lawyer.\nHe also spoke of further pressures on judges, describing in his op-ed an \u201coppressive\u201d environment. He wrote of the government\u2019s \u201ccontinued calls for judicial \u2018patriotism\u2019\u201d and the outrage sparked in the rare instances when a judge acquits or grants bail to an NSL defendant.\n\u201cIt requires unusual courage for local judges to swim against such a strong political tide. Unlike the overseas judges, they have nowhere else to go,\" he wrote.\nIt is a holdover from Hong Kong\u2019s past as a British colony.\nAfter the UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, the agreement between the countries stipulated that the special territory would continue to operate with its freedoms and systems for 50 years-  including its common law legal system which  operates in several other jurisdictions worldwide.\nCurrently there seven foreign judges remaining on the court\u2013 three British and four from Australia. Typically they are very experienced senior judges who have retired from their countries\u2019 senior courts.\nThey operate as overseas non-permanent appointees; a typical appeal bench of five judges at the Court of Final Appeal will see a foreign judge hearing the case along with three other local judges.\nTheir presence was long seen as a sort of bulwark protection to help uphold the British-style common law legal system which has been key to Hong Kong\u2019s stature ",
    "Politicians are certainly making a lot of noise right now, but is anybody listening to what they have to say?\nThe level of public engagement in an election campaign is ultimately measured by turnout - the percentage of eligible voters who actually bother to cast their vote.\nAcross the north-west of England, turnout levels vary enormously.\nAt one end you've got Westmorland and Lonsdale in South Cumbria. At the last general election in 2019, nearly four in five voters in the constituency put their X in a box.\nPeople there bucked the national trend - not only is it the most northerly seat held by the Liberal Democrats, but it was one of very few rural areas which voted Remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum.\nFormer Lib Dem leader Tim Farron was elected as its MP in 2005. He lives in Milnthorpe, which is now part of a revised Morecambe and Lunesdale constituency that was won by the Conservatives in 2019.\n\"He often pops in, we often see him around the market square,\" said Jill Davis, a legal assistant at Milne Moser estate agents in the town centre.\n\"People round here are very set in their ways.\n\"But now the constituency has changed, I think we might see a change. \n\"A lot of younger people are coming in, and I think they will maybe change it when they come to vote.\"\nHer vote will not be changing, she said.\n\"Even though it's a Lib Dem area, we've always voted Conservative. And I'll be voting Conservative again,\" said Ms Davis.\nMeanwhile another resident said he hoped for a Labour victory.\nRod Stott proudly showed us a photo of him meeting Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner when the party's battle bus rolled into Morecambe earlier this week.\n\"We've had 14 years of terrible government,\" he said. \"I have four children and 11 grandchildren, and I want a future for all of them. \n\"And I don't see a future for them if we carry on the way we are.\"\nOn a good day, Blackley and Broughton in northern Greater Manchester is only about an hour's drive away down the M61.\nPeople there seem far less bothered about politics - only 52% of eligible voters cast their vote in the last general election five years ago.\nBoundary changes are also happening there - with the traditionally staunch Labour heartland constituency changing its name to Blackley and Middleton South.\nGraham Stringer has been the area's MP for more than a quarter of a century, going back to 1997 when his boss Tony Blair swept to power in a Labour landslide.\nIn the Harpurhey area, several people told us they did not see the point of voting, because none of the parties adequately represented their views.\n\"I stay away from it,\" said army veteran Mark Taylor, who now works as a gas engineer.\n\"I see politics in the news a lot, but they make promises and never stick to them.\"\nWhile party politics turns him off, he said he was still very concerned about political issues.\nHousing and homelessness are some of the most important topics for him.\n\"When you walk past people homeless it makes me sad, and it makes my child feel sad. \n\"He asks questions but I can't give him the answers.\"\nMark said were politicians  to visit his area, \"coming and seeing the people from the streets, where they are living, and how they are living\" he could be persuaded to lend them his vote.\nEndurance Obabueki, who runs a cafe on Moston Lane, also said politicians were rarely if ever spotted locally.\n\"I would like them to come here, of course - to hear the opinion of each and every one of us,\" she said. \n\"Then maybe they would know where they are not doing good, and make improvements.\"",
    "The Bishop of Bradford has appealed for wider media coverage of the civil war in Sudan, after returning from a visit to the country.\nThe Sudanese army has been fighting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces for more than a year, in a conflict which has killed thousands and forced millions from their homes.\nThe Right Revd Toby Howarth visited the country last week with the Right Reverend Nick Baines, Bishop of Leeds.\nBishop Howarth said the Sudanese civil war had been overshadowed in the media by the \"appalling events in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"It's almost like the bandwidth of media and governments around the world has just got so stretched,\" he said.\n\"It is like people don't have room for something else.\n\"But something which is this big, yet hardly makes it to our news feeds, is extraordinary to me,\" he added.\nBishop Howarth said he and Bishop Baines had visited Sudan against the advice of the UK government.\n\"The main reason Bishop Nick and I went was basically to say, 'you are not forgotten, we pray for you every day, we love you, we stand with you',\" he said.\nBishop Howarth said people displaced by the civil war in Sudan \"feel abandoned\".\n\"It's awful. You hear these numbers - more than 10 million people displaced, more than three million children in danger of dying from malnutrition - but it really came home to me when we visited a camp for internally displaced people,\" he said.\nBishop Howarth said seeing the camp, where 800 families lived  in tents, had made things seem \"very real\" to him.\nHowever, he said he had also met \"an extraordinary woman called Victoria, in a broken down tent\".\nThe bishop said in the days after fighting broke out, Victoria had encountered \"all these people sleeping on beaches with nothing\".\n \"So, she found a place on ground which used to be an old social club, cleared it and moved the people there,\" he added.\nBishop Howarth said that over the period of a year, Victoria had \"campaigned, advocated, found tents and a toilet block and done incredible work through love\".\nHe said Victoria told him: \"What does love do in a situation like that?

    "Disappearing bank branches and cash machines running out of money are leaving people concerned over the future of their high street.\nThe last bank branch in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, closed in April, leaving the remaining cash machines in the town struggling to cope with demand.\nMore than 20 bank branches have closed in Wales so far in 2024, with two thirds of branches expected to go between 2015 and 2025, partly due to online banking. \nSara Bailey, who runs Hot Gossip coffee shop in Treorchy, said her business and others had suffered since Barclays closed its doors, with remaining cash points in the town running out of money \"once, even twice a day on some days\".\n \"When Barclays went, it took the cashpoint it had with it,\" she said.\nThere are two other cash points in the town, she said, but they have struggled to cope with the demand.\n\"We are a cash-only business here, so we have had to turn customers away. A few other businesses here have had to do the same.\"\nA few doors down from Hot Gossip, Nicola Lund helps her father run Top Cards, a greetings card shop, where the cash machine shortage is also having an impact.\nShe said: \"The Post Office is quite a way in to town as well, so older people have to walk down there to get cash out, and they don't want to walk back - I don't blame them,\" she said, adding a nearby phone shop said its footfall had decreased since the bank closed.\n\"I am worried about the future of the business because of this.\"\nIn a statement Barclays said consumer behaviour had changed, with the majority now choosing online banking, which was reflected in the Treorchy branch. \nIt said it had provided a mobile van two days a week since the branch closed. \nTreorchy is not alone in losing its banks, with Mountain Ash facing a similar situation half an hour away.\nThe town has been without a bank since the last branch, Lloyds, closed in 2017.\nA \"banking hub\" is expected to open in the town next year, which will allow customers of any bank to withdraw and deposit cash, as well as make payments.\nThe service will join seven others across Wales \u2013 two of which are currently open, in Welshpool, Powys, and Prestatyn, Denbighshire.\nFurther locations are cited for Abergele in Conwy county, Abertillery in Blaenau Gwent, Morriston in Swansea, Porthcawl in Bridgend county and Risca in Caerphilly county.\nIn Treorchy, a temporary hub has been opened on the site of the former Barclays on Bute Street.\nLike others in Wales it is run by Cash Access UK - operating Monday to Friday between 09:00 and 17:00 \u2013 which said it was looking for a permanent home for the hub.\nResearch by the consumer organisation Which? suggested by the end of 2025, Wales will have lost two-thirds of the bank branches that were open in 2015, leaving only 188 left in the country.\nThe Welsh Affairs Committee has launched an inquiry into the issue, finding the number of bank and building society branches in Wales fell from 695 in 2012, to 435 in 2022, and 22 high street bank branch closures had already been announced for 2024.\nAdrian Buckle, head of research for the trade association UK Finance, said there had been an increased trend of banks reviewing the costs of operating branches.\n\"If you go back 15 years, six out of 10 payments that we made were made using cash - but, as of last year, this had fallen to about 14% of payments,\" he said.\nMr Buckle said although he does not expect bank branches to become a thing of the past, the way banks operated on the high street may change, including the likely prevalence of banking hubs.\n\"It\u2019s no longer financially viable to have five or six separate banks that have their own branches. But they can now share a branch, and provide that face-to-face banking service to customers in the area who want to bank that way.\n\"I do think it's something that we'll see the entire industry taking more advantage of, and that will be something that will be good for consumers,\" he said.",

    "A stretch of road linking communities in West Somerset, which has been closed to cars for more than a year, might never reopen due to climate change, a geological firm claims.\nThe B3191, known locally as Cleeve Hill, previously provided access to those using camping and touring sites in Blue Anchor to the harbour town of Watchet.\nThe road was first closed by Somerset County Council in January 2023, after a survey showed ongoing erosion along the coast had accelerated.\nSomerset Council is working with the Environment Agency on plans to secure the road's long-term future but Geckoella, the firm monitoring the coastline, believes the situation will only get worse.\nThe road sits just feet from the rapidly eroding cliff edge, and forms part of the popular Somerset section of the England Coastal Path - linking Brean and Minehead.\nThe B3191 has been closely monitored for the past couple of years by the independent firm Geckoella, which has been advising Somerset Council on what is happening on the West Somerset coastline.\nAnd while there were hopes the key route could be reopened fully when the council allowed pedestrians to use the road over Easter - experts say it is unlikely to ever happen. \n\"It's going to get worse,\" Dr Andy King, the director of the firm told BBC Radio Somerset. \nDr King laid the issue squarely with climate change, calling the rate of erosion there \"unprecedented\".\nHe said the impact of climate change was not only the raised sea levels, but an increase in persistent rainfall in the area, meaning coastal erosion was getting worse. \n\"The cliff is moving at different rates at different places,\" he said, noting it was \"highly unstable\".\nAllotments that used to sit on the cliff have now all but disappeared. Dr King said 17.5 metres was lost in just 10 months.\nBut while the coastline is being pushed back, Dr King said: \"Nobody is going to be standing by or letting Watchet erode into the sea.\"\nSomerset Council, which is responsible for the coastline said the focus in the short term was to find a way to allow cyclists to use the road, while providing support and marketing for events in Watchet.\nDr King said the \"automatic reaction\" in cases like this was to \"build a wall\", but added these were expensive to maintain at the same rate as climate change.\nInstead, he said the best defence was to \"work with nature - building out groynes from the cliffs and hold the beach sediment\", which in turn will act as an \"energy absorber\".\nFurther down the coast, boulders were placed at points at Minehead and Blue Anchor to slow down the rate of erosion - at a cost of millions of pounds and before the council declared a financial emergency.\nHowever, Dr King said \"houses are close to being undermined\" along the coastline, so sustainable options need to be explored. \nContractors Geckoella can make recommendations to Somerset Council, who in turn will make decisions about what will happen next.\nWhen asked whether the road would ever reopen to cars, Dr King said no, adding: \"It's highly unstable\".\nResponding to local talk about moving the road inland slightly, he described this option is simply \"kicking the can down the road\", not to mention \"hugely expensive\".\nThe Environment Agency said: \"There is \u00a31m of flood defence grant in aid and \u00a3500,000 of local levy funding for Cleeve Hill. \n\"Our understanding is the money is for coastal works, such as cliff reinforcement or strengthening, and couldn\u2019t be diverted towards an alternative road further inland.\n\"In any case, this would represent a fraction of the money required.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X, external.

    "A family's historic home in North Yorkshire could be further opened up to the public in a bid to fund the conservation of one of its designated heritage assets.\nA proposal to transform Grade II-listed former stables into homes or holiday accommodation on the Sutton Park estate, at Sutton on the Forest, north of York, is to go before councillors.\nThe proposal will be scrutinised by a variety of bodies as the documents state the affected site is near Sutton Park House, a Grade I-listed property .\nPapers suggested the plan would be \"a new long-term use for the former stables, so historic significance can be sustained\".\nThe papers, unveiled by Robert Sheffield, heir to the title of 9th Baronet Sheffield, have been lodged with North Yorkshire Council, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nAccording to the plans, the proposed development would have no impact on views to and from Sutton Park House.\nThe house features Old Master paintings and furniture which originally adorned the Sheffield family\u2019s London seat, Buckingham House, which later became Buckingham Palace.\nSutton Park House and gardens are opened up to the public on selected dates during the year.\nThe proposal for the stables stated that the site was in open countryside, inside a designated conservation area and was home to five species of roosting bat, all of which features were protected to some extent.\nIt added: \u201cThe proposed residential conversion is very small in scale and appropriate and commensurate in size and scale with Sutton on the Forest.\u201d\nPlanners were also expected to look at the potential impact on other listed buildings in the grounds, including an ice house and a walled kitchen garden, and on the village\u2019s conservation area, within which the stables are located.\nHowever, agents for the developer said as \u201cmodest changes\u201d to the exterior of the stables, a mix of single and two-storey buildings were being proposed, they did not believe the development would have an impact on the other heritage assets.\nThe document stated: \u201cIn the main the existing openings and features are to be used and there is no change planned to the external space surrounding the building.\u201d\nIt added that if planners or Historic England believed the impact of the development would have a significant impact on the heritage assets, the \u201cimportant public benefits\u201d of the proposal should be considered, which included \u201cproviding opportunities for visitors to visit and stay at Sutton Park to better appreciate and understand its history and significance\u201d.\nAs there were five species of roosting bat on the site it would be necessary to get a European Protected Species Licence from Natural England before starting the development, if given the go-ahead, the application said.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

But for many people, they\u2019re reminded of how extraordinarily he helped to transform their lives.\"\nHe described Dr Mosely as \"an adventurer\" with a \"curious and creative\" spirit, adding that he leaves behind an \"incredible legacy\". \n\u201cHe made people feel there was a real opportunity to change things and that the challenge was exciting and playful as well,\" he said. \nScience broadcaster Dr Chris van Tulleken, who also worked with Dr Mosley, said his former colleague had invented \u201can entire genre of broadcasting\u201d over the course of his career.\nHe added that Dr Mosley\u2019s work \u201cquietly changed my daily practices\u201d, from brushing his teeth while standing on one leg to sometimes fasting.\n\u201cHe was giving people tools they could use that everyone could afford,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\nCalypso Haggett, Dr Mosley's business partner and chief executive of The Fast 800 weight-loss programme, said in a statement that he was a \"shining light for the whole team\".\n\"I had the great privilege of knowing Mi",
    "TV and podcast presenter Michael Mosley was best known for offering tips on simple ways to improve our health and wellbeing, backed up by science - everything from when to exercise and what to eat to how to get more sleep.\nHe was often the guinea pig - willing to try out anything before recommending it to others (swallowing tapeworms and trying psychedelic drugs, for example).\n\"Michael wanted to look at whatever would help people live better, healthier lives,\" says his former co-presenter on Trust me I'm a Doctor, Dr Saleyha Ahsan.\n\"Something that wasn't a fad, that they could keep going at and which they didn't feel guilty about.\"\nWe pick out his top five health hacks:\nHe popularised the idea of intermittent fasting - eating normally on five days a week and much less than usual on the other two, in order to lose weight and boost your health.\nIt's called the 5:2 diet, and it sparked huge interest when his Horizon TV programme Eat, Fast and Live Longer was broadcast more than 10 years ago.\nWanting to reverse his type 2 diabetes, he stuck to the diet for five weeks, eating fewer than 600 calories on fasting days, with a light breakfast and dinner and plenty of water and herbal tea in between. During that time, he lost nearly a stone and his blood markers, including glucose and cholesterol, improved.\nThe notion of fasting to cut calories got the nation talking and spawned fasting recipes, calorie-restricted menus and even a book.\nTo make it even easier, he challenged people to simply try staying away from food for 12 hours a day, between 8pm and 8am, for example - something called time-restricted eating. \nDoing the recommended amount of exercise each week is a challenge for many. \"When do I find the time?\" is the frequent complaint.\nDr Mosley's Just One Thing podcast researched the concept of \"exercise snacking\" - doing a few minutes of physical activity whenever possible, rather than scheduling one long gym session that might not happen.\nFor those with busy lives, he suggested shunning the lift and running up the stairs instead, and going for brisk walks, particularly first thing in the morning.\n\"We live at the top of a steep hill - I always cycle down to the town for the shopping and push myself hard on the way back,\" he said on the podcast, illustrating how to make exercise an integral part of his daily routine.\nHe also investigated the more controversial concept of high-intensity interval training, or HIIT - short bursts of intense exercise with periods of recovery in between - as a way of maximising workout time.\nDr Mosley was fascinated by how cold temperatures could be harnessed to help our health and wellbeing.\nHe investigated the benefits of everything from taking cold showers to exercising in the cold and sleeping in a cool bedroom.\nIn interviews, he revealed how he liked to turn the heating down at home.\n\"I live in an old house which is expensive to heat - so we pile on layers of clothes and keep the thermostat at about 15 degrees,\" he said, adding that his wife was less keen on the arrangement.\nHe discovered that turning the thermostat down by just a few degrees could improve fat and blood-sugar metabolism, boost your mood, and might even protect against type 2 diabetes.\nWhen he went for a jog on a chilly day, he found out how exercising in colder weather can allow you to go further than on a hot day, enabling you to work harder, for longer, with less effort.\nAnd he was also a fan of taking cold showers (like motivational speaker and extreme athlete Wim Hoff), admitting he started every morning in a warm shower and turned it to cold for around 30-to-40 seconds.\nThe body's reaction to being immersed in cold water - the cold shock response - forces up the heart rate and makes you breathe more quickly, which is thought to be beneficial in short bursts.\n\"It's the best simple exercise you can do,\" said Dr Mosley in a recent interview.\nWhat was he talking about? Squats, press-ups and planks.\nThese are resistance exercises, working some of the biggest muscles in the body.\nWhen muscles are tensed and held still, as these exercises demand, research suggests there is a sudden rush of blood when you relax, which can reduce blood pressure.\nAs they are potentially better than doing crunches or sit-ups for the core muscles, he would do squats every morning - before his cold shower, of course.\n\nMost of us know what we should be doing to eat healthily - eating plenty of fruit and vegetables and cutting back on fatty and sugar-laden foods being the primary objectives.\nBut are there hidden health benefits in some foods?\nThanks to Dr Mosley, we learned it's potentially better to cook tomatoes than eat them raw. Tomatoes contain a powerful antioxidant, called lycopine, which helps the body fight off damaging chemicals, and cooking the red fruit lets the good stuff out and into the body.\nAnd when it comes to beetroot, he concluded it was best to buy it raw and bake it, or drink the juice to enjoy this nitrate-rich purp",
    "A popular YouTuber from Cyprus has been elected as an independent MEP to the European Parliament.\nFidias Panayiotou has previously described himself as a \"professional mistake maker\" and some of his online hijinks include trying to hug 100 celebrities - including Elon Musk -  and spending a week in a coffin. \nThe 24-year-old has more than 2.6 million subscribers and - despite having no political experience - garnered the third-largest number of votes with 19.4%.\n\"It was a shock what happened, a miracle,\" said Mr Panayiotou.\nHe told state broadcaster CyBC: \"The parties should take it as a warning that they must modernise and listen to the people.\"\nLast year Mr Panayiotou was forced to apologise after he caused outrage in Japan for a YouTube video in which he dodged train fares and a five-star hotel breakfast bill. \nThe clip, which racked up millions of views, saw him travel across Japan on its famed bullet train, while dodging fares by hiding in toilets and feigning illness. \nBut on Sunday, he celebrated his win with a gathering at Eleftheria Square in the island's capital Nicosia, where he said: \"We are writing history. Not just in Cyprus, but internationally.\"\nAccording to Politico, Mr Panayiotou declared in January he would run in the polls. \nAppearing on Cypriot TV, Alpha Cyprus - where he wore trainers, shorts, a suit jacket and three neck ties - he admitted that he had never voted, knew little about politics and the EU, but that he could no longer stand the continued rule of \"nerds\" in Brussels.\nWhen Mr Panayiotou submitted his candidacy in April, he admitted that his goal was not to get elected but to motivate young people to get involved in politics. \nThe Mediterranean island nation has a population of about 900,000, of whom more than 683,000 were registered to vote in the weekend's polls.\nTurnout in Cyprus was at just under 59% - up from 45% in the 2019 elections, with analysts attributing the rise in part to the \"Fidias factor\".\nAccording analysis of exit poll data by news site Philenews, Mr Panayiotou won 40% of the votes from the 18-24 age group and 28% of votes from the 25-34 group.\nSix Cypriot MEPs were elected. \nMr Panayiotou came third behind the conservative DISY (25%) which retained its two MEPs, and the communist party AKEL (22%) which lost one of its two MEPs. \nCypriot voters also elected an MEP from the ultranationalist party ELAM (11%) and the centrist party Diko (10%).",
    "An appeal has been launched for O blood-type donors to book appointments across the country following the ransomware attack affecting major London hospitals.\nThe IT attack means the affected hospitals cannot currently match patients' blood at the same frequency as usual.\nSeveral London hospitals declared a critical incident, cancelled operations and tests, and were unable to carry out blood transfusions last week after the attack on the pathology firm Synnovis, which Qilin, a Russian group of cyber criminals, is understood to have been behind.\nOn Monday afternoon, the NHS blood donation website implemented a queuing system for booking appointments, which is used to manage times of higher demand. \nNHS Blood and Transplant is calling for O positive and O negative blood donors to book appointments in one of the 25 NHS Blood Donor Centres in England.\nFor surgeries and procedures requiring blood to take place, hospitals need to use O- type blood -  known as the universal blood type - as this is safe to use for all patients. It is used in emergencies or when a patient's blood type is unknown.\nBlood has a shelf life of 35 days so stocks need to be continually replenished, the NHS said.\nKing's College Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' (including the Royal Brompton and the Evelina London Children's Hospital) and primary care services in London declared a critical incident after last week's IT attack.\nProf Stephen Powis, medical director for NHS England, said staff were going \"above and beyond to minimise the significant disruption to patients\".\nHe added: \"We know that a number of operations and appointments have been postponed or diverted to other neighbouring hospitals not impacted by the cyber-attack, as we prioritise pathology services for the most clinically urgent cases.\"\nJust 8% of the population have type O negative but it makes up about 15% of hospital orders.\nO positive is the most common blood type - 35% of donors have it - and it can be given to anybody with any positive blood type. This means 76% of the population can benefit from an O positive donation.\nThis National Blood Week it has been revealed that three blood donations are needed every minute in hospitals and there are about 13,000 appointments available nationally this week in NHS Blood Donor Centres with 3,400 available in London.\nDr Gail Miflin, chief medical officer for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: \"Patient safety is our absolute priority.\n\"When hospitals do not know a patient's blood type or cannot match their blood, it is safe to use O-type blood.\n\"To support London hospitals to carry out more surgeries and to provide the best care we can for all patients, we need more O negative and O positive donors than usual.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "If diplomats have groundhog days, when they are condemned to reliving the same 24 hours, perhaps Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, felt a certain weariness as his jet approached the Middle East on his latest trip. \nIt is his eighth diplomatic tour of the region in the eight months since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year.\nThe politics of trying to negotiate an end to the war in Gaza and an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners were already complicated. \nThey are more tangled than ever now that the Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz has resigned from the war cabinet of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with his political ally Gadi Eisenkot. Both men are retired generals who led the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as chiefs of staff.\nWithout Benny Gantz, the Americans have lost their favourite contact in the cabinet. Now he\u2019s back in opposition, Mr Gantz wants new elections - he is the pollsters\u2019 favourite to be the next prime minister - but Mr Netanyahu is safe as long as he can preserve the coalition that gives him 64 votes in the 120-member Israeli parliament. \nThat depends on keeping the support of the leaders of two ultranationalist factions. They are Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister.\nThat is the point at which Secretary of State Blinken\u2019s mission collides with Israeli politics. President Joe Biden believes that the time has come to end the war in Gaza. \nMr Blinken\u2019s job is to try to make that happen. But Messrs Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have threatened to bring down the Netanyahu government if he agrees to any ceasefire until they are satisfied that Hamas has been eliminated.\nThey are extreme Jewish nationalists, who want the war to continue until no trace of Hamas remains. \nThey believe that Gaza, like all the territory between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan, is Jewish land that should be settled by Jews. Palestinians, they argue, could be encouraged to leave Gaza \"voluntarily\".\nAntony Blinken is in the Middle East to try to stop the latest ceasefire plan from going the way of all the others. Three ceasefire resolutions in the UN Security Council were vetoed by the US, but now Joe Biden is ready for a deal.\nOn 31 May, the president made a speech urging Hamas to accept what he said was a new Israeli proposal to end the war in Gaza. \nIt was a three-part deal - which has now been backed by a UN resolution - starting with a six-week ceasefire, a \"surge\" of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the exchange of some Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. \nThe deal would progress to the release of all the hostages, a permanent \u201ccessation of hostilities\u201d and ultimately the huge job of rebuilding Gaza. Israelis should no longer fear Hamas, he said, because it was no longer able to repeat 7 October.\nPresident Biden and his advisers knew there was trouble ahead. Hamas insists it will only agree to a ceasefire that guarantees an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war. \nThe destruction and civilian death inflicted by Israel in Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza during the raid to free four hostages last week can only have strengthened that resolve. The Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza say that 274 Palestinians were killed during the raid. The IDF says the number was less than 100.\nMr Biden also recognised that some powerful forces in Israel would object. \n\"I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal,\" he said in the speech. \"Regardless of whatever pressure comes.\"\nThe pressure came quickly, from Messrs Ben Gvir and Smotrich. They are senior government ministers, viscerally opposed to the deal that Joe Biden presented. It made no difference to them that the deal was approved by the war cabinet, as they are not members. \nAs expected, they threatened to topple the Netanyahu coalition if he agreed to the deal.\nNeither Hamas nor Israel have publicly committed to the deal that President Biden laid out. \nHe accepted that the language of parts of it needed to be finalised. The ambiguity in parts of the proposal might in other conflicts, between other belligerents, allow room for diplomatic manoeuvre. But that would require a shared realisation that the time had come to make a deal, that more war would not bring any benefit.\nThere is no sign that the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is at that point. He seems determined to stick the course he has followed since 7 October. \nSome reports out of Gaza said that Palestinians in the ruins of Nuseirat camp were swearing at Hamas as well as Israel for disregarding their lives. \nThe BBC cannot confirm that, as like other international news organisations it is not allowed by Israel and Egypt to enter Gaza, except under rare and highly supervised trips with the Israeli military.\nIt seems clear though, that vast numbers of Palestinian dead have strengthened, not weakened the resilience of Hamas. For them, survival of their group and its leade",
    "A university says it will help to fund flights home to Nigeria for crisis-hit students who it reported to the Home Office.\nStudents at Teesside University were thrown off courses and ordered to leave the UK after a currency crisis left them struggling to pay tuition fees.\nFollowing protests and the intervention of the Nigerian government, the university told the BBC it has now re-enrolled some affected students and opened a travel fund.\nOne student said the offer did not go far enough, adding: \"The wide-rippling effects of this are unmanageable and piling up.\"\nAs reported by the BBC, the Middlesbrough-based university recently withdrew sponsorship for a number of students and reported them to the Home Office after they fell into tuition fee arrears.\nThe students had seen their savings depleted as a consequence of Nigeria's worst economic crash in generations.\nTheir financial struggles were exacerbated when the university changed payment plans from seven instalments to three.\nThe impact was so significant that a nearby food charity said 75% of its clients are now Nigerian students struggling to cope with the cost of living.\nAs a consequence, some missed tuition fee payments and were subsequently frozen out of their studies.\nSoon after, they received Home Office letters ordering them to leave the UK.\nIn May, a university spokesman said failure to pay was a breach of visa sponsorship requirements, and claimed it had \"no choice\" but to alert the Home Office. \nA Teesside University spokesman has now confirmed some affected students have been told they can resume their studies.\n\"We are working with a small group who do need to return to their home country and are opening an international relief fund for this group only to offer additional financial support for these unexpected travel costs,\" he added.\nThe university has told some students they can complete their studies from Nigeria or return to the UK to resume them at a later date.\nThe BBC understands some of those affected are now lodging legal appeals after being told to return to Nigeria.\nOne, who did not want to be named, said the university's offer failed to consider the significant impact their actions had on those affected.\nHe said: \"I was asked to return home, pay the balance remaining and apply to return at a later date, but I don't trust them now.\n\"I feel this is a way to escape responsibility and they may not let me come back.\n\"If they did, it would cost me thousands to pay flights, visa fees and NHS fees again.\n\"I've already spent so much coming here and now they want me to go back without any kind of certification to reflect my achievements.\n\"The whole aim of coming here was to study, we haven't committed any kind of crime.\n\"There's been no apology for the stress and trauma the university has put me through.\"\nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "The United Nations\u2019 refugee agency has warned judges it may have new evidence from 2024 that Rwanda has endangered asylum seekers, despite Parliament passing a law declaring the country is safe.\nIn a highly significant intervention in the continuing legal battle over the policy, the UNHCR told the High Court on Monday that it is investigating new allegations of abuses.\nThose allegations include individuals potentially being sent to countries where they could be tortured, despite Rishi Sunak arguing, during the same period, that Rwanda was a safe partner for the UK.\nA judge has granted the UN agency permission to prepare a dossier before a flight of asylum seekers can leave the UK.\nThe court\u2019s decision is a blow to the government because the agency\u2019s intervention was a deciding factor in the Supreme Court finding that the original Rwanda plan was unlawful.\nHome Secretary James Cleverly\u2019s lawyers have told the court that no one will be sent to Rwanda before 24 July. Labour has pledged to scrap the policy if it wins the general election on 4 July.\nDespite the uncertainty over the future of the scheme, at least a dozen major challenges are now before the courts - most from individual asylum seekers who want to know their future.\nDuring the first Rwanda legal battle in 2022 and 2023, the UN\u2019s evidence was critical to judging whether the country could be considered a safe and fair place to send asylum seekers.\nIt showed the British courts evidence of Rwanda subjecting refugees to \u201crefoulement\u201d - the practice of illegally returning an asylum seeker to a country they had fled from, despite knowing they may be tortured.\nDuring Monday\u2019s hearing, lawyers for the agency said that it wanted time to prepare and present new evidence on what had happened since it compiled its original evidence in 2022.\nLawrence Bottinick, a UN official, told the court in a witness statement that the agency had not seen any improvements.\n\u201cIn particular, UNHCR is aware of repeated incidents of refoulement from Rwanda and denial of access to the asylum procedure to asylum seekers in Rwanda post-dating my earlier statements,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThese incidents have occurred in a variety of contexts and continued into 2024.\u201d\nMr Bottinick said the incidents continued to undermine the \u201cfairness, reliability and coherence\u201d of Rwanda\u2019s process for assessing refugees - but that the UN\u2019s team needed more time to gather and fact-check these incidents before they could be presented in court.\nThe agency\u2019s lawyers also told the court that its staff had met British officials in Kigali, Rwanda\u2019s capital, on 7 December last year, and told them they knew of at least seven cases of refoulement during 2023.\nThat same day, Rishi Sunak unveiled his new Rwanda plan, which bars judges from considering whether the country is unsafe.\nLawyers for Mr Cleverly told the High Court that there was no legal reason why any of the questions potentially being raised by the UNHCR should stop a flight on 24 July. \nBut Mr Justice Chamberlain ruled the agency\u2019s evidence could be important and gave it permission to gather as many facts as possible to present to the court by 28 June.\nThe judge gave the home secretary until the day after the general election to tell the court what he thinks about the UN\u2019s evidence.",
    "While much of the European election reaction has focussed on French President Emmanuel Macron's bombshell snap election announcement after the far-right National Rally won there, parties in other countries across the EU have been considering their gains and losses.\nAlthough far-right and nationalist parties have made gains, the centre-right also performed well, holding its position as the largest grouping and managing to gain seats. \nCentre-right parties came out top in Germany, Greece, Poland and Spain, and made significant advances in Hungary.\nHere are some key takeaways from our correspondents around Europe. \nDamien McGuinness in Berlin\nIt has been a sorry sight for Germany's three-party coalition government, but unlike Emmanuel Macron, Chancellor Olaf Scholz says he will not call for an election.\nThe alliance between the Social Democrats, Greens and liberals was already tricky, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine meant breaking economic and energy ties with Russia and renouncing former pacifist feelings.\nThis alienated some core supporters, created party rifts, and overall rattled voters. A huge surge in migration has also put strain on the resources of local councils.\nWhile the government has managed to boost military spending and pivot away from cheaper Russian energy, it means money is tight.\nStep in the populist far-right and far-left, who promise a quick return to peace and prosperity: \"Just negotiate with Putin, and buy Russian gas again,\" says the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nAfD came second with 15.9% and Scholz's social democratic SPD came third with 13.9%. Coming up top was the conservative CDU party with an impressive 30% of the vote.\n\"We want to end the war so just stop sending arms to Ukraine and stop migrants coming,\" says the new populist far-left party BSW led by ex-communist firebrand Sahra Wagenknecht.\nMost German voters and politicians believe dealing with Moscow and migration is not that straightforward, and a majority in Germany support Ukraine.\nBut in times of insecurity and uncertainty, simple messages are seductive.\nLaura Gozzi in Rome\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has cemented her grip on Italian politics.\nShe used the European elections to boost her own popularity by putting her name at the top of her party's ballot, and it proved a successful gamble: with 29%, she has increased the vote gained by her party in the 2022 general election.\nBut there is another success story in Italy. The opposition centre-left Democratic Party (PD) performed better than hoped, with 24% of the vote - its highest result since 2014.\nThe result will boost the PD and lend credibility to its leader, Elly Schlein, who has seemingly managed to find her footing after just over a year at the helm of the country's biggest opposition party.\nSmaller parties in the governing coalition will have some thinking to do. Forza Italia - the party founded by late media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi - won slightly more votes than the once-mighty and now floundering League party, headed by Matteo Salvini.\nEven the League's founder, Umberto Bossi, declared he would vote for Forza Italia to signal his discontent at the direction the League has taken. Two centrist parties - one led by former PM Matteo Renzi - failed to hit the threshold required to send MEPs to the European Parliament.\nBut despite these internal going-ons, Italy has, rather unusually, emerged from the European elections as a pretty stable country - much more so, in any case, than some of its neighbours.\nAnna Holligan in The Hague\nLast November, anti-immigration Freedom Party (PVV) leader - and long-time Marine Le Pen ally - Geert Wilders won a shock victory in the Netherlands\u2019 national election.\nThe EU election predictions suggest the public sentiment hasn't changed much since then.\nThe headlines: Green-Left parties secured the most seats, while the Freedom Party made the greatest gains.\nThe nuances: Centre-right parties had a strong showing.\nDutch and EU political veteran Frans Timmermans said: \u201cThis shows that a majority in the Netherlands wants to strengthen Europe and certainly not destroy it.\u201d\nWhile Geert Wilders - who until recently promised a referendum on Nexit (i.e. Netherlands' exit from the EU) - posted five red love heart emojis on X. \"Still the biggest winner with five more seats.\u201d\nInterestingly, the biggest celebrations I witnessed in the parliament bar last night were being held by two relative newcomers, at opposite ends of the political spectrum.\nPro-EU Volt (from none to two MEPs) cheered and toasted beneath an archway of blue and yellow balloons. \nWhile outside the revolving doors, the unmistakable Farmer Citizen Movement leader Caroline van der Plas was taking in some fresh air alongside the party's new MEP Jessika van Leeuwen. \nBoth were initially predicted to gain two MEPs, although the latest prediction suggests BBB will win just one. \nNick Thorpe in Budapest\nIn Hungary, Viktor Orban\u2019s Fidesz party won both the European an",

    "Drug company Moderna says its combined flu and Covid vaccine, which targets the two diseases in a single shot, has passed a vital part of final-stage scientific checks.\nThe phase-three trial shows the vaccine arms the body with protective antibodies.\nAnd it does so as effectively as separate flu and Covid shots, results suggest.\nFewer injections would be more convenient and simpler, Moderna says.\nChief executive Stephane Bancel told BBC News he hoped the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine could be made widely available in 2026 - or perhaps, 2025.\n\"We are very delighted about the results, because it\u2019s the first time in the world that a company is able to show positive phase-three results combining in a single dose flu and Covid vaccine,\" he said.\n\"You get one dose, one needle,\" which meant \"ease and peace of mind for the consumer\".\nCompetitors Pfizer and BioNTech are testing a similar two-in-one mRNA vaccine against flu and Covid.\nScientists hope mRNA vaccines will be faster to make and update than the current ones used against flu, and be a better match for ever-changing strains. \nIn the continuing Moderna trial, the mRNA-1083 jab produced a higher immune response than the licensed comparator vaccines.\nIt matched or bettered currently approved flu jabs, including high-dose ones designed for older people.\nAnd it was better than Moderna\u2019s existing Covid booster, Spikevax, at making the body produce disease-fighting antibodies \u2013 probably because it had been designed to fight more recent variants circulating around the world, Mr Bancel told BBC News in an interview.\nThe results are from 8,000 volunteers \u2013 all aged over 50 and half over 64.\nModerna said it had focused on older people because they were most likely to continue to be offered Covid vaccines.\nBut it plans ultimately to offer the new jab to younger people also.\nAny side effects were generally mild - a bit of soreness where the needle went into the skin and some tiredness - as with regular vaccines.\nThe company plans to present the findings at a medical conference, as well as submit them for publication.\nProf John Tregoning, an immunologist at Imperial College London, said work on a dual vaccine was \"a promising direction of travel\", but that the science world awaited the full data for scrutiny. \nModerna is also developing an mRNA vaccine against a disease called cytomegalovirus, for which it hopes to have late-stage trial results this autumn.\nCurrently, there is nothing to protect pregnant women and their unborn babies against CMV.\n",

So far Xbox\u2019s 2024 has been dominated by headlines about mass layoffs and criticism over the closure of four in-house studios.\nMicrosoft\u2019s showcase didn\u2019t dwell on any of that, but it did take the chance to remind us all that it now owns a big chunk of the AAA games industry thanks to its $65bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nFree to flex its merger muscles this year after finally sealing the deal, it kicked off with a montage from upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which got its own dedicated preview straight after the main event.\nFrom there it launched into an action-packed trailer for Doom: The Dark Ages, and the rest of the one-hour session crammed in a host of flagship franchises including Warcraft, Diablo, Elder Scrolls Online and the recently revitalised Fallout 76.\nAt times it felt like a greatest hits reel, and Microsoft seemed to drive that point home when it closed the main preview with footage of a new Gears of War game. The soundtrack of Gary Jules\u2019s Mad World was the same song used in the influential trailer for the original 2006 game in the series. A full-circle moment.\nFans also got glimpses of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Fable, the Perfect Dark reboot and Ukraine-developed STALKER 2.\nCritics would say the showcase could\u2019ve been more varied - when you boil it down it was heavy on open-world action, RPGs and first-person shooters. But fans would point out those are the genres Xbox built its brand upon. \nAnd there was also praise for the diversity on show - many of the titles seen featured female protagonists or people belonging to ethnic minorities as their main characters.\nMicrosoft\u2019s gaming division has been accused of lacking direction recently, and questions will remain about where it wants to take the Xbox brand in future and whether all of its studios will survive.\nBut for one night, at least, it successfully steered the conversation back to its games.\n\nHost Geoff Keighley warned fans ahead of this year\u2019s event that the headline Summer Game Fest showcase would be a \u201clight\u201d affair with no big surprises.\nAnd he was pretty much true to his word.\nWith the exception of a guest appearance from Remedy Entertainment\u2019s Sam Lake announcing that new content for 2023 game of the year contender Alan Wake 2 would be released the next day, the event didn\u2019t contain many drop-your-coffee moments.\nAnd apart from Civilization VII - an update in the long-running strategy series - and a new Sonic game, there weren't too many appearances from well-known franchises.\nBut we did find out that popular online shooter Valorant is coming to consoles, got a brief glimpse of the upcoming Harry Potter Quidditch Championship, and a star-studded trailer for Killer Bean. We also saw the first set of games from horror movie studio Blumhouse, including a new title from Bafta-winning game director Sam Barlow.\nSony and Lego also revealed that their collaboration based on PlayStation's Horizon series will also be coming to PC and Nintendo Switch, but not Xbox.\n\nSo far this year most of gaming's real breakout success stories such as Palworld, Helldivers II and Animal Well have come from smaller studios.\nAnd, for those people who did feel the otherwise well-received Xbox showcase was a bit samey, there was a range of indie trailerfests to keep fans busy.\nAs well as two dedicated streams after the main event, there were also sessions dedicated to women-led games, titles from Latin American developers and Wholesome Direct - an hour celebrating \"uplifting, compassionate, cozy games\".\nAmong Us developer Innersloth unveiled its new funding project, Outersloth, aimed at helping other indie developers to get their games out.\nWith headlines focusing on troubles at the triple-A end of the games industry, the struggle for indies to find funding can get overlooked. And Innersloth - a pandemic success story - got praise for paying back some of its own breakout success.\nThirsty Suitors studio Outerloop Games (no relation), is ",
    "Socialite Rebecca Grossman has been given a jail sentence of 15 years to life over a hit-and-run car crash that claimed the lives of two young brothers.\nMark and Jacob Iskander, who were 11 and eight respectively, were fatally hit in 2020 while crossing a road with their family in Westlake Village, California.\nGrossman, the co-founder of the Grossman Burn Foundation, was convicted by a Los Angeles jury in February of charges including second-degree murder. \nDuring the 60-year-old's sentencing, she apologised to the family but insisted she did not see the two young boys on the night of the crash. \nHer lawyers argued during the trial that the boys were first struck by a vehicle driven by Scott Erickson, a former LA Dodgers baseball star. They said Grossman was driving behind it.\nThe court heard that the pair had been drinking cocktails earlier that day.\nThe explanation that Erickson's car hit the boys first was labelled a \"ridiculous theory\" by the prosecution, which also said Grossman was driving at almost twice the speed limit. \nErickson has denied wrongdoing.\nGrossman was ultimately convicted of two counts each of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter and one count of hit-and-run driving.\nAhead of the judge's sentencing, the prosecution argued that she had showed a \"complete lack of remorse\".\nHowever, the judge rejected a request of a longer sentence of 34 years to life, saying she was not the \"monster\" the prosecution had made her out to be.\nGrossman could be seen crying during the hearing, and said she would have sooner \"driven into a brick wall\" than hit the boys with her car. \nShe said she had been advised by her lawyers against contacting the victims' parents - something the boys' mother disputed.\nNancy Iskander said she saw Grossman outside the hospital's emergency room on the night of the crash. \"She looked me in the eye!\" she said, according to the BBC's US partner, CBC News. \"You looked me in the eye. You knew they were dying.\"\nGrossman co-founded the Grossman Burn Foundation with her husband, Peter Grossman. The organisation exists to support burns victims around the world.",
    "Another passenger has contacted BBC London after being seriously injured using the Elizabeth line at Ealing Broadway in west London.\nRolf Kern, 82, had to go to hospital after he badly gashed his shin trying to board an Elizabeth line train. He says the vertical gap between the platform and the train is too high and caused his injury. He says he is now considering legal action.\nIt comes weeks after another passenger broke their foot on the same platform.\nTransport for London (TfL) said it was \"sorry\" that some passengers had sustained injuries and that safety was its \"number one priority\".\nWARNING: This article contains an image of an injury some may find upsetting.\nMr Kern says the gap is too high: \"Normally, I take the left or right-hand side and use the handrail. But this time I happened to be in the middle and I missed the step and fell flat on the floor. I immediately realised I'd hurt myself very badly.\"\n\"The wound was very bad. It was a two-inch gap under the knee and the skin was  actually totally detached. It's very, very serious.\" \nMr Kern says the height of the step is unacceptable: \"It is the sheer fact that the step is 12 to 14 inches high, which I find for a modern, new line where the government invested so much money is unacceptable.\"\nIn February, also at Ealing Broadway station, Eric Leach stepped off an Elizabeth line train on to the platform. \nSuch was the force from the drop that he broke a bone in his foot. He collapsed on the platform.\nMr Leach, who also suffered bruising to his right knee, says the gap is not acceptable: \"It's a 12in gap. Mums with buggies, people with heavy luggage, elderly people, of course it's not acceptable.\"\nHe told BBC London: \"It's a scandal, someone will be seriously injured or die. It's a death trap.\"\n\"I was trying to get off. Other people were trying to force their way on. I was terrified looking at the gap, lost my balance and came down and fell and broke a bone in my left foot. And mashed up my right knee.\n\"I was on the ground for about 20 minutes. I was taken home in a taxi and a couple of days later I realised I was bad so I went to Ealing Hospital. \"\nMr Leach's story was seen worldwide with 7.9 million views on BBC London social media channels Instagram, Facebook and X.\nThe Elizabeth line opened in May 2022 and cost \u00a319bn.\nThe platforms at Ealing Broadway are owned by Network Rail and aren't new. Before the introduction of Elizabeth line services, they were used by GWR trains out of London Paddington.\nSafety guidance says new platforms should not have a horizontal gap larger than 27.5cm (10.8in) or a vertical gap of more than 23cm (9in).\nHowever, Rail Safety and Standards Board rules only apply to new stations, so Ealing Broadway as an older platform doesn't fall under the regulations. The rules don't apply.\nA TfL spokesperson said: \u201cWe are sorry that some customers have sustained injuries at Ealing Broadway station and we wish them a full and speedy recovery.\n\u201cSafety is our number one priority and while the height difference between the train and the platform at this station, which is owned by Network Rail, and all Elizabeth line stations comply with the required safety standards, we recognise that it can be larger at some older stations.\n\u201cWe provide manual boarding ramps for anyone who requires them and staff are available for anyone who needs assistance. \n\"We also make on-train announcements reminding passengers to mind the gap when leaving the train.\"\nTfL continued to work with its operator, MTR-Elizabeth line, and its infrastructure provider, Network Rail, to \"ensure all our stations remain safe and accessible for all our customers\", the spokesperson added.\nMr Kern is now trying to find fellow passengers who witnessed what happened, as he considers legal action. His leg is healing.\nTfL says the Elizabeth line operator MTREL is in contact with Mr Kern and says it is actively investigating the incident.",
    "Two days after Israel's operation to free four of its citizens from central Gaza, more details are emerging of how Saturday\u2019s rescue mission unfolded and of the hostages' eight months in captivity.\nThe Hamas run health ministry says at least 274 Palestinians were killed and almost 700 injured in the assault.\nIsraeli special forces freed female hostage Noa Argamani using the element of surprise - but another team which had freed three male hostages came under attack prompting the Israeli military to launch massive air strikes on crowded nearby streets as covering fire, killing scores of Palestinians.\nAfter weeks of meticulous planning and acting on intelligence, the green light for the operation dubbed Seeds of Summer was given by Israel\u2019s war cabinet last Thursday evening.\nAround 10:00 local time on Saturday morning and in broad daylight, two teams of Israeli special forces, some disguised as Palestinians, crossed into Gaza. It\u2019s thought they were travelling in at least one truck and in civilian cars.\nThe streets of the densely populated Nuseirat refugee camp were busy with people shopping in a nearby market.\nThe targets were two residential apartments a few hundred metres apart.\nEyewitness Isaam Jameel Arouqi told the BBC some of the Israeli soldiers came from a truck full of furniture.\nHe said there were two in civilian clothes and around 10 in masks and military uniforms.\n\u201cSuddenly, special forces came out of it and started shooting,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking from hospital, Mr Arouqi says he was shot three times in the chest and stomach.\nThere are reports of a second truck with mattresses on top from which a second team emerged, possibly using a ladder to get into one apartment.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says the operation to free 25-year-old Noa Argamani went smoothly as special forces took her captors by surprise, and quickly killed the guards.\nIsrael\u2019s Channel 12 television, which has spoken to Miss Argamani's family, says the young woman told them she had been asked to wash the dishes on the morning of the raid.\nAccording to Channel 12, she suddenly saw the Israeli soldiers with masked faces who said \u201cNoa it\u2019s the IDF\u201d.\nOne soldier asked if he could pick her up over his shoulder.\nOnly then did she realise what was happening.\nAfter being transported by car she was then flown out of Gaza by helicopter.\nHer 246-day ordeal was over.\nThe IDF says the simultaneous operation to free Shlomi Ziv, 40, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Almog Meir, 21 from the second apartment was more challenging as by this time the element of surprise had been lost.\nMore is known about the family who the Israeli military says were holding the three men.\nRamy Abdu, the chairman of the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor organisation, said initial evidence showed the Israeli special forces used a ladder to enter the family home of Dr Ahmed Al-Jamal.\nHis 36-year-old, son Abdullah al Jamal is a one-time freelance journalist who had also worked for Hamas as a spokesperson.\nThe special forces shot Ahmed and Abdullah dead along with several members of their family, Mr Abdu said.\nThe IDF\u2019s Chief Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari who was able to watch and listen to the operation unfold live via video link says the code name for the hostages was \"diamonds\".\nHe described hearing with relief the words \"the diamonds are in our hands\", signalling the three hostages had been freed.\nBut it was getting the three male hostages out of Gaza where things began to go wrong.\nBy now the IDF says their forces were coming under heavy fire from Palestinian fighters.\nIt\u2019s reported that at least one of the vehicles that they were leaving in broke down.\nThe Israeli military decided to send in more support, attacking from the air, from the sea and on the ground with massive force.\nMobile phone video from the scene shows people diving for cover as missiles whistled in and gunfire rang out.\nLater footage showed bodies strewn in the street.\nIt was in these moments that so many Palestinians are likely to have died.\n\"Many people were in the streets, scared and running away. It was as if it were Judgment Day. No-one knew where to go,\" Mohammed Mahmoud Hamed told the BBC.\n\"There were many people killed, so many that we couldn't even get to them. They couldn't rescue or retrieve the bodies, especially those who were wounded. People were scared to go rescue them because of the intense shooting and bombing,\" he said.\nThe Israeli military said aircraft had \"struck dozens of military targets for the success of the operation\".\nThe two hospitals in central Gaza, al-Aqsa Martyrs' hospital in Deir al-Balah and al-Awda, a facility in Nuseirat, were already at breaking point and were quickly overwhelmed with bloodied casualties including many children laid out in the corridors.\nAt al-Awda sitting at the bedside of his young daughter, her head bandaged, was Mohamed al Assar.\n\"Two of my daughters were killed and the rest were wounded,\" he said.\n\"My wife, my daughter Raghad, my daughter Re",
    "In modern times, an airport is a likely starting point for millions of Hajj pilgrims setting off on the journey to Mecca.\nMore than a thousand Muslims are expected to travel through Manchester Airport this week as the north of England's only transport hub with direct flights to Jeddah.\nIhram changing rooms and Wudhu washing facilities have been set aside in terminal two specifically for pilgrims travelling to the holiest site in Islam. \nShurma Chowdhury, a Muslim chaplain at the airport, said the annual pilgrimage was  a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" experience.  \nShe is one of the first faces that pilgrims will see at the airport, and is there to ensure their trip goes smoothly. \n\"For some people, it could be their first time at an airport, so I am just here to help them around,\" Ms Chowdhury said \n\"The last thing you want is to be worried you\u2019re lost and you\u2019re going to be late for prayer or trying to find the washrooms.\"\nTours for Hajj, which falls this year between 14 and 19 June, set off from Manchester this week, with many expected to spend ten to 21 days in Saudi Arabia.\nHajj is the annual pilgrimage made by Muslims to the holy city of Mecca, with millions making the journey from across the world.\nJeddah Airport is about an hour's drive to Mecca.\nMs Chowdhury said many pilgrims would perform the Hajj only once, and it was an \"expensive undertaking\", which can cost up to \u00a310,000 per person.  \nCovid-related restrictions remain in place meaning spaces were \"very limited\", she added.\nSome, like Mohammed Nawid Ahmed Hanif and Dahira Naveed are making the pilgrimage for the first time. \n\"It\u2019s very important, as it is one of our pillars of Islam,\u201d Mr Ahmed Hanif said, adding the pair \"wanted to do it at a young age\".  \nImran Valley said he was \"elated\" as he and his wife Hasfa made final preparations in the departures lounge.\n\"I just want to get there, I just want to experience it, I hear people say it\u2019s a magnificent place,\" he said. \n\nHasfa, who has undertaken Hajj before, said she was \"feeling the pressure\". \n\"You want to get everything right, it\u2019s so important, the journey is so significant, you can\u2019t afford to get anything wrong.\"\nAnother Muslim chaplain at the airport, Faruk Ali, said designated areas had been set aside at the airport for pilgrims to \"change into their Hajj gear, which we call Ihram\".\nThis consists of two white cotton garments worn on the upper and lower parts of the body by men only, he said. \n\"It's important for those travelling direct, as they have to be in the Hajj gear before they enter certain boundaries of Saudi Arabia.\"\nListen to the best of\u00a0BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Iceland's government has issued a licence to hunt whales to the country's sole whaling company - a move condemned by animal welfare groups.\nThe licence for the 2024 hunting season allows the Hvalur company to kill 128 fin whales.\nThe decision \"is based on a precautionary approach and reflects the government's increased emphasis on the sustainable use of resources,\" the government said.\nThe Humane Society International animal protection charity said the licence was granted \"despite clear evidence of immense animal suffering\". \nIt said an independent report by the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority on whaling in 2022 \"revealed some whales killed in Icelandic hunts had taken up to two hours to die, with 41% of whales suffering immensely before dying for an average of 11.5 minutes\".\n\"Such suffering was deemed in contravention of the country\u2019s Animal Welfare Act,\" the charity said.\nIceland, Norway and Japan are currently the only three nations that allow commercial whaling.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Icelandic government said the licence to Hvalur \"is valid for the 2024 hunting season\". \nIt said the company was now permitted to hunt \"99 whales in the Greenland/West Iceland region and 29 whales in the East Iceland/Faroe Islands region, totalling 128 whales\".\n\"This decision aligns with the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute\u2019s 2017 advice and considers the conservative ecosystem factors of the International Whaling Commission,\" the statement added.\nLast year, Hvalur - which is believed to have two whaling vessels - was allowed to hunt 161 fin whales. \nThe whaling season in Iceland usually lasts from June to September, before it becomes too windy and dark. \nMost of the whale meat is exported to Japan.\nThe practice has given rise to protests from conservation groups which consider fin whales - the second-longest marine mammal after the blue whale - to be vulnerable to extinction. \nIn a recent survey, 51% of Icelanders said they were opposed to commercial whaling.",

The conversation makes for difficult reading.\n\"Someone got stabbed, everyone talking abt (sic) it, literally everyone, everyone knows.\"\nOne of the pair responds with a voice note.\n\"It is what it is,\" he says, before they share a final exchange.\n\"I\u2019m scared man.\"\n\"I\u2019m not.\"\n\"IDRC\" - which means \"I don\u2019t really care\".\nThe boys blamed each other, but a jury agreed both had been responsible for Shawn Seesahai's death, even if only one had struck the fatal blows with the machete in the park in November.\nThey become the youngest murderers convicted since Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were detained for killing James Bulger, more than 30 years ago.\nDressed smartly in court, the pair looked like typical 12-year-olds. But one seems to have had a fascination with knives.\nThe internet search history of the boy who owned the machete showed he spent a lot of time searching for similar weapons. \nHe had posed for a photo with the murder weapon and boasted about it to two girls who had been with the pair in the park that day.\nOne of the girls told police it was not unusual for him to carry the machete and the two boys would pass it between them.\nOn the day of the encounter with Shawn, one of them pulled the machete out of his trousers before saying to him, \"keep stepping\". Moments later the vicious attack began. \nAlthough it is rare for anyone this age to be tried for such a serious offence, the West Midlands has the highest rate of knife crime in the country.\nThere have been warnings from youth workers that more very young children are carrying bladed weapons, and that getting hold of them has become too easy.\nThe officer in charge of the investigation, Det Insp Damian Forrest, described the case as \"exceptional\".\n\"It\u2019s not the first case I\u2019ve investigated involving a young man losing his life to knife crime, but it's the first time I've looked at two 12-year-olds being responsible, and that's something that took me by surprise and will stay with me,\" he said.\nSpecial arrangements had to be made at the trial because of the defendants' ages.\nThe boys sat in the main well of the court instead of the dock. Alongside them were family members and specially trained staff to help them understand proceedings. \nThe trial took place in one of the smaller courts in Nottingham to create a less intimidatory atmosphere. None of the legal staff wore wigs or gowns and instead dressed in business suits. The court sessions were reduced to roughly 40 minutes and longer breaks were taken than there would normally be in an adult trial. \nThe court day finished earlier at 15:30 so the boys would not become too tired, and they were offered fidget toys to aid with concentration.\nTrials involving very young children often lead to intense debate about whether there are societal lessons to be learned. \nIt happened in 1968 when Mary Bell was convicted of the manslaughter of two children, aged four and three - the first on the day before she turned 11, and the second a few weeks later. \nIt happened again after Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, both aged 10,  murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993. \nThis case begs the question - how did a 12-year-old boy get hold of a machete? It's not clear, but police think it may have been bought online.\nIt bears striking similarities to Ronan Kanda's murder, which happened about two-and-a-half miles away just 18 months earlier. He was attacked by two 17-year-olds outside his home with a machete in a case of mistaken identity.\nHis killers had also bought that weapon online.\nWeapons like those used in both murders are legally available to buy online to over-18s, although it is illegal to carry them without \"good reason\".\nThe government had announced plans to tighten the law, but it is not clear now what will happen after the general election. \n\"We have to block all avenues and not allow these weapons to be so easily accessible,\" Ronan Kanda\u2019s sister, Nikita, said.\n\"The government definitely needs to do more. They need to act fast because too many lives are being lost now.\" \nHer brother\u2019s murderers managed to bypass rules that prevent under-18s buying such weapons, and the boy who bought the machete used to kill Shawn Seesahai said he bought it for \u00a340 from a \"friend of a friend\".\nQuestions remain about whether weapons like machetes ought to be allowed for sale in this country, as do fears that very young children can get their hands on them, and are not afraid to use them.\nAdditional reporting by Anne Delaney, Senior Producer, Midlands\nFollow BBC Wolverhampton & Black Country on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Passengers say a new pricing system for travel cards in the west of Scotland will make costs skyrocket for many people.\nFrom 24 June, travel group SPT has updated the ZoneCard map so there are fewer zones and new ticket prices.\nWilliam Hill, who travels from Kilmarnock to Glasgow for work, says this means the cost of his 10 week ZoneCard will increase from \u00a3485 to \u00a3890.\nSPT said prices had not increased in several years while individual bus, rail and subway prices had all gone up with inflation.\nMr Hill, 56, told BBC Scotland how he has used the ZoneCards for more than 20 years and will be looking to stop relying on them.\n\"SPT seem to be trying to price out the working person from public transport,\" he said.\n\"Imagine working to a tight budget and going to buy a ZoneCard and finding out your transport costs have doubled.\n\"I fear that there will be people in a worse off situation who rely on this card who will simply not be able to afford this price rise.\"\nMr Hill says he is now focused on getting his driving licence and buying a car as he believes it will be cheaper than the cost of travelling on public transport.\nZoneCards permit travel on the subway, buses and trains in Glasgow, as well as in parts of Ayrshire, Lanarkshire, Dunbartonshire and Inverclyde.\nPeople can select different cards based on which zones they want to travel in, as well as for different periods of time, from a day ticket to an annual pass.\nKevin Stevenson, 31, regularly travels  in Glasgow from Cardonald to his teaching job in Maryhill.\nFor a ZoneCard covering four weeks, he usually pays \u00a399.40.\nHowever the new system means the same commute will cost him \u00a3176.40.\nHe has bought zone cards for the last 15 years, but now says he will be looking for an alternative.\n\"I am all for them reclassifying the zones because they are a bit crazy,\" he said.\n\"I got in touch with SPT and they said the zones have been simplified to allow you to travel further, but that's not going to help the average commuter.\n\"While it's wonderful that I can travel to Paisley or Erskine, I'm not going to start travelling through there to get to my work in Maryhill. It seems like they're just pricing out commuters, it doesn't make any sense.\"\nMr Stevenson said he usually takes a train and a bus to get to work, so an integrated travel card worked best for his circumstances.\nHe added: \"With the changes, it's going to cost me nearly an extra \u00a380 a month.\n\"This city is bad enough in terms of public transport, but this was the only integrated ticketing system that Glasgow offers.\n\"It feels like they just want the ZoneCard to die out, because you can't put up the prices in such a way and price out the people that use the service.\"\nA ZoneCard Forum spokeswoman said decisions about the ZoneCard were made collectively by participating operators.\nShe said: \"The current ZoneCard prices have not been increased for several years, while individual bus, rail and subway prices have all increased with inflation. \n\"As part of the move to the new smart ZoneCard, the new ticket prices have been comprehensively reviewed by the forum for the first time in several years, taking into account current operator pricing as well as the new zone structure.\n\u201cZoneCard is intended to offer good value where customers are travelling regularly using more than one mode of transport several days a week. For single operator travel (e.g. rail only) a single operator ticket will provide better value for money.\"\nShe said the new smart product should be more flexible and convenient to use and renew.",
    "More than 800 councillors have been elected in the Republic of Ireland's local elections so far, as counting continues. \nA total of 949 city and county council seats will be filled across 31 local authorities.\nResults so far indicate that government coalition partners Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il will be the largest parties in local government, with independents also faring well. \nVoters headed to the polls in three elections on Friday.\nThey were the local elections, European elections and Ireland's first directly elected mayor election in Limerick. \nThe polls will provide political parties with an insight into voter sentiment ahead of the next general election, which must be held by March 2025.\nCounting began for the European elections on Sunday and for the local council elections on Saturday.\nSinn F\u00e9in, the main opposition party, is expected to have more councillors elected to local authorities than at the previous local election, but not as many as it wanted or expected.\nDespite an election performance that she admitted \"disappointed\" her, Mary Lou McDonald has said she has no plans to step down as Sinn F\u00e9in party leader.\nSpeaking to reporters Sunday, Ms McDonald said: \"It has not been our day, but we will have our day.\u201d\nShe said that the party had made some gains, albeit modest ones.\n\"We don\u2019t always get it right, we clearly have lessons to learn. We\u2019ve listened carefully, we will regroup, we will come out, we will do better, and I, as the leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, will lead that,\u201d Ms McDonald said.\nShe admitted that the party was \u201cambitious\u201d in the number of candidates it put forward.\nPearse Doherty, Sinn F\u00e9in TD (member of parliament) for Donegal, told RT\u00c9 that the party would have to \"dust themselves down\" and look at \"lessons that can be learned\".\n\u201cIt is not the result we hoped for,\" he said.\n\u201cThere will be a lot of disappointment for some of our new candidates who were trying to break new ground.\"\nWith a general election ahead, Mr Doherty said he still believes people want change.\nThe current Irish government has been in place since June 2020, when Fine Gael, Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green Party voted to enter a coalition together.\nEarly indications suggest the governing parties will not suffer losses on a scale that many had predicted.\nTaoiseach Simon Harris said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with his party Fine Gael's performance \"right across the country, in rural Ireland and urban Ireland\".\n\u201cI think what Sinn F\u00e9in need to realise here is the Irish people see through the noise, the Irish people don\u2019t believe they live in a failed state, the Irish people don\u2019t believe in all of the negativity,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat the Irish people want is pragmatic delivery. The Irish people do want change, they want credible change, that\u2019s the sort of change I\u2019m offering,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking of why many people voted for independent candidates, Mr Harris said there are a lot of \u201chard working, decent\u201d independents. \nHe added that he does not think the story of this election is a surge to independents - rather an \u201cabsolute collapse in support\u201d for Sinn F\u00e9in.\nMr Harris also accused Ms McDonald of making comments that were \u201cquite insulting\u201d to the Irish people by trying to \u201csecond guess them\u201d.\n\"I was very disappointed to hear her comments in relation to, 'maybe the people on this occasion didn't really understand this',\" he said. \n\"The people of this country are sovereign.\n\"I think the people knew exactly what Sinn F\u00e9in were selling, and they just didn't want to buy it.\"\nMs McDonald said earlier that \"clearly frustrations - anger indeed - with government policy on this occasion has translated into votes for independents and others\".\nT\u00e1naiste (deputy prime minister) and Fianna F\u00e1il leader Mich\u00e9al Martin said his party had performed \"far better\" than predicted.\n\nSpeaking to RT\u00c9 this afternoon, former taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it was now \"game on\" for a general election.\n\u201cFor a party that\u2019s been in government for nearly 14 years to win the local elections, and it does look like we\u2019re going to win the local elections, that\u2019s an extraordinary result,\u201d he added.\n\nThe bounce for Fine Gael may be linked to new leader Simon Harris who has moderately increased the party's standing in the polls since Leo Varadkar's resignation in March.\nParty sources say they are buoyed by the successful and accurate candidate selection arithmetic.\nThe story of the weekend may prove to be the independents, who have done well nationally, however, due to the diverse nature of the candidates, very little can be garnered about the outlook of those voting for independents.\nThe first elections for new leaders for Labour's Ivana Bacik and the Social Democrats Holly Cairns look moderately successful, however, no big wins have been delivered for those parties either.\nAround 373 million people across the European Union are eligible to vote in this election.\nTogether, voters in its 27 member states will elect 720 MEPs.

    "Tens of thousands of Swifties swamped cafes, bars and tourist attractions across the centre of Edinburgh while Taylor Swift's billion-dollar tour was in town.\nBusinesses recorded bumper sales over the weekend amid the frenzy of fan excitement for The Eras Tour at Murrayfield Stadium.\nThe US singer's three night stint in Scotland had an \"unbelievable impact\" on the city's hospitality industry.\nThere was also the Edinburgh Taylored Taste Trail which saw shops, cafes and restaurants showcasing cocktails, mocktails, afternoon teas, ice creams, desserts, and cupcakes inspired by the singer's iconic songs.\nThere were Blank Space chocolates, Shake It Off confetti creations and Enchanted teas.\nAnd some businesses even made their own friendship bracelets for customers.\nFriendship bracelets are a major part of the Taylor Swift experience - they are handmade, typically out of plastic wire and colourful beads - many fans add letter beads to spell out some of Swift's albums or lyrics.\nSwifties go up to each other and trade bracelets they have made.\nLauren Stenhouse, owner of Coro The Chocolate Cafe, told BBC Scotland News, she had sold more than 100 bespoke Taylor-inspired chocolate fondue boards with dipping sauces and American pancakes and brownies.\n\"It's been unreal. That's been our best weekend since we have opened.\n\"The cafe was full and we were having to turn people away because it was so busy and we have never had to do that before.\n\"It was so much motivation for us as a small business. Sometimes you can have bad days when you see other businesses closing around you and you think 'maybe we are next' but this makes all the bad memories just dissipate.\n\"We are so excited. I couldn't be more pleased and I cannot believe the impact that tour has had on the hospitality industry in general.\n\"I could never have anticipated the turnout we got so we are just incredibly ecstatic about it and happy.\"\nShe added that there were so many Swifties handing our friendship bracelets to each other in the shop.\n\"They created such a nice community setting, it was really sweet,\" she said.\nClaire Meikle, general manager of The Alchemist, told BBC Scotland that lots of sequins were left behind.\n\"We had hundreds of Taylor Swift fans - they were very recognisable.\n\"Everyone was coming in and looking fantastic, it was just such a lovely vibe in the bar because everyone was happy and excited for the concert.\n\"We had so many people in from the states who were saying apparently it was $5,000 ($\u00a34,000) for one ticket because they don't have control of ticket touts in the US so when they release the tickets they are all swept up immediately and resold for a very high price.\n\"So we had a lot of people in from America and Canada who said they were having a whole holiday for the price they would have paid for in the US.\n\"When you went into the toilets there was a lot of sequins and a lot of glitter everywhere, it was funny. The cleaners have been working very hard.\"\nThe specialist cocktail and mocktail bar in St James Quarter gave out handmade friendship bracelets with certain drinks.\n\"They are quite time consuming to make so we couldn't keep up with demand so then we started putting everything to make one bracelet into a bag so they could make them themselves.\n\"We were running back and forth between other businesses nearby to trade beads with different letters that we needed.\n\"It was a great fun weekend.\"\nClaire Riddoch, marketing manager at at the Camera Obscura & World of Illusions in Edinburgh, said their Giant Kaleidosphere of Taylor Swift and cardboard cut out had been a huge hit with fans.\nA bespoke animation of the singer was created for the tourist attraction on the Royal Mile.\nIt showed the star wearing a Scottish Jimmy hat while playing bagpipes as she travels through the capital on her way to perform at Murrayfield.\nHer image was split into dozens of pieces to create an illusion that runs 9ft deep.\n\"We had a lot of Swifties in over the weekend, we could tell they were here for the concert and were in their hats,\" she said.\n\"We had a lifesize cardboard cut out of Taylor in our foyer which was very popular, so many photographs and selfies got lots of social media interaction.\n\"Our Taylor Swift cut out was so popular we are going to keep it and move her to our Autowed machine so you can get married to her. \n\"There are only two of these machines in the whole world and it's a machine that allows you to get married.\n\"The machine gives you a certificate and a couple of rings and it will marry you to whomever you would like, it's not legally binding but it is very popular so we are going to put Taylor down beside the machine so people can continue their love affair with Taylor if they wish.\"\nIain McKechnie, supervisor of Sweet Paradice Desserts which is painted pink inside and out, said they set up a 19-piece menu inspired by the American singer as she is \"all about pink too\".\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"We were the second biggest pink icon in Edinb",
    "The Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, has said a failed arson attack that took place in Prague last week was \"very likely\" organised and financed by Russia.\nSpeaking after a meeting of the Czech National Security Council, Mr Fiala said the failed attack was evidently part of a \"hybrid\" campaign of sabotage being run by Moscow against European countries.\nPolice said a foreign citizen was arrested on Saturday in connection with the incident and was being held in custody on terrorism charges.\nHe was described as \"a Spanish-speaking man originally from South America\" and had apparently been in the country for five days.\nThe prime minister said the attempt to set to fire to buses at a depot in Prague was likely connected to a spate of arson attacks in Europe that he said appeared to be orchestrated by Moscow.\nThese, he said, included May's arson attack in Warsaw, and a similar attack in a branch of Ikea in Lithuania, which authorities believe were carried out by Russian intelligence agents or their proxies.\n\u201cThe connection [to Russia] is not only possible, but highly probable,\u201d Mr Fiala told reporters. \"The attack was probably organised and financed from Russia.\"\nThe BBC has approached the Russian foreign ministry for comment on Mr Fiala's allegations. \nPolice beefed up patrols across the Czech capital last Friday after claims of a heightened risk to security.\nThey released CCTV footage apparently showing a dark-haired man paying for items in a shop or petrol station. They said the man was possibly dangerous and should not be approached, but gave no further information.\nPolice president Martin Vondrasek said the man had been apprehended the following day. \n\u201cOn Friday we asked the public for assistance. On Saturday morning the suspect was arrested. On Sunday afternoon a criminal prosecution was launched, and today [Monday] a court ordered he be remanded in custody,\u201d Mr Vondrasek told journalists at a news briefing.\n\nThe man - described as a 26-year-old of South American origin - is accused of trying to set fire to buses at a public transport depot in Prague\u2019s Klicov district in the early hours of Thursday morning.\nLocal media initially reported that he had spilt petrol over several buses at the depot, but failed to set them on fire. \nHowever, a spokeswoman for Prague's public transport authority was quoted by news outlet Novinky.cz as saying the man had set several buses alight, and the fires were subsequently extinguished by depot workers. The fires caused an estimated 200,000 Czech crowns (\u00a36,864; $8,738) of damage, she said.\nHe now faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted under terrorism legislation - 30 if given an exemplary sentence.\nSince Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Czech government has become one of Ukraine\u2019s most ardent supporters, providing military assistance including artillery, tanks and ammunition.\nHowever the mutual antipathy predates the February 2022 invasion.\nThe government in Prague says Russia\u2019s GRU intelligence service was behind the 2014 explosions at a Czech arms dump that left two people dead.\nThe Czech Republic was the second country - after the US - to be placed on Russia\u2019s list of \"unfriendly nations\" after a series of diplomatic expulsions that followed an investigation into the explosions.\nMoscow denies any involvement in the incident.",
    "The dramatic rescue of four Israeli hostages in Gaza amid efforts to try to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire has raised questions over the impact it could have on reaching a deal, as mediated talks show no sign of a breakthrough.\nAs images of the freed and smiling three men and one woman dominated TV bulletins and news websites, tens of thousands of people joined protests across Israel on Saturday, urging the government to strike an agreement with Hamas for the release of those who are still being held. \u201cAll of them, now!\u201d the crowd chanted in Tel Aviv.\nHamas meanwhile has called the operation, which its health ministry said killed more than 270 Palestinians, a \u201cmassacre\u201d.\nBeing discussed is a three-stage plan announced by US President Joe Biden earlier this month, which he described as an Israeli proposal. It would secure the release of the hostages and, crucially, pave the way for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.\nNotably, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has not openly endorsed the plan. It is not surprising, as he is facing pressure from multiple fronts and seems to be caught between two options: ceasefire or coalition.\nThe families of the hostages, whose ordeal has gripped the nation, and Israel\u2019s international allies are calling for a deal. From the people captured in October, 116 remain in captivity; more than a third of them have already been officially declared dead, a number that is probably higher.\nAmong those against the proposal, full details of which have not been made public, are two of Mr Netanyahu\u2019s far-right ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. They have threatened to quit the government if the deal goes ahead, which could lead to the collapse of the Netanyahu coalition.\n\u201cTemporarily in Israel there will be more pressure from certain quarters on Netanyahu to not do any deal, that we should continue to do rescue operations,\u201d Gershon Baskin, who helped negotiated a deal with Hamas for the release of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011, said. \u201cAnyone who thinks logically and rationally knows that the only way to get [the] hostages home is through a negotiated deal.\u201d\nThe resignation of Benny Gantz from the emergency government on Sunday is likely to result in more power to both Mr Ben-Gvir and Mr Smotrich \u2013 and, possibly, in more pressure from them on Mr Netanyahu. Described as a moderate, Mr Gantz is considered a possible candidate to be the next prime minister.\nIn Israel, much of the dispute over the current proposal is around the commitment to a permanent cessation of hostilities \u2013 in other words, the end of the war. Mr Netanyahu has insisted Israel will not accept any plan before the destruction of Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, a choice of words that is vague enough to leave his options open.\n\u201cI believe that Netanyahu prefers his coalition over bringing our boys and girls home,\u201d said Michael Hauser Tov, chief political correspondent at the Haaretz newspaper, which is critical of the prime minister. \nThis is a common suspicion in Israel and elsewhere: that Mr Netanyahu is interested in prolonging the war for his own political survival. \u201cI think Netanyahu will try to continue with the negotiations only for his international needs and the relationship with President Biden. And, on the other hand, he\u2019ll try to sabotage the negotiations because he wants to keep his coalition stable.\u201d\nHamas has not yet given a formal response to the plan outlined by President Biden. One of its key demands is a guarantee that the Israeli military will not resume its offensive against the group once the hostages are released.\n\u201cHamas, from my experience with them, puts up a position and they stay firm to it. How long can they last? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr Baskin said. \u201cMy perception is that the longer Israel continues this war, the easier for [Hamas] to recruit new recruits from bereaved families and people who\u2019ve lost their homes, and an armed insurgency against the Israelis will continue as long as Israel is in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli rescue in Gaza, which resulted in the death of one Israeli special forces officer, was considered a successful operation by Israel\u2019s top authorities, despite the carnage in Nuseirat that has been largely ignored in Israel.\n\u201cIf anyone believes that [Saturday\u2019s] operation absolves the government to strike a deal, they are living a fantasy,\u201d Nahum Barnea, an Israeli political commentator, wrote in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. \u201cThe opposite is true. The joy over the successful rescue of the four only evinced the need for a deal.\u201d\nHours after the four freed hostages arrived in a hospital near Tel Aviv, Mr Netanyahu visited them and their families. It did not go unnoticed that this happened before the end of the Jewish Sabbath, when official activities are often muted, and was accompanied by a torrent of videos and photos released by his team.\n\u201cWhen the ending is bad, the prime minister doesn\u2019t show up. He doesn\u2019t call, either,\u201d Avi Ma",
    "James Lawson, the black civil rights activist who travelled to India to study non-violent protest and served as chief strategist to Dr Martin Luther King Jr, has died at the age of 95. \nLawson, a Methodist minister, learned Mahatma Gandhi's principles of civil disobedience and taught them to protesters opposing racial segregation in the US. \nThrough his workshops, he instructed countless activists on how to passively resist horrific violence and threats from the police and angry white mobs in order to expose the immorality of racism. \nKing repeatedly praised his methods, calling him in a speech the day before his assassination one of the great \"noble men\" of the black struggle in America. \nKing, who met Lawson when they were both 28-year-olds, also called his ally \u201cthe leading theorist and strategist of nonviolence in the world\u201d.\nLawson died in Los Angeles, where he lived, his family said on Monday.\nThe son and grandson of ministers, he was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, in 1928.\nLawson said he was motivated to study non-violence when he was eight-years-old after he slapped a child who had called him a racial slur.\nHis mother, who was a passivist, asked him \u201cwhat good\" had become of his response. He vowed to never again use violence to resolve a dispute.\nHis non-violent beliefs were tested early on, when as a university student he refused to be drafted into the US Army to serve in the Korean War. \nLawson served 13 months in prison for draft dodging. After finishing his education, he travelled to Nagpur, India, to work as a missionary and study the resistance tactics developed by Gandhi. \nAfter three years in India, he returned to the US, where he met King, a fellow Methodist minister, at Oberlin College in Ohio.\nHis belief in non-violence came at a time when opinion in black communities was divided over how to resist institutional racism and segregation.\nKing convinced Lawson to move to Nashville and begin studying at Vanderbilt University while also teaching non-violent protest techniques.\nSeveral of his students went on to play prominent roles in the civil rights movement, such as future congressman John Lewis and future Washington DC mayor Marion Barry.\nAfter King was assassinated in 1968, Lawson met and eventually befriended the man convicted of killing him.\n\u201cMartin King would have gone to visit him. I knew this,\u201d he said of James Earl Ray, King's killer.\nLawson went on to officiate Ray's marriage in prison, and came to believe that he was not solely responsible for King's death. \nHe was also a founder of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which played a key role in the racial equality protests of the 1960s.\nIn a 2020 speech during the funeral of John Lewis, Lawson said \"many of us had no choice to do what we tried to do, primarily because at an early age we recognized the wrong under which we were forced to live\".\n\u201cAnd we swore to God that by God's grace, we would do whatever God called us to do in order to put on the table of the nation's agenda. \n\"This must end.

    "A wooden machine that bowled out an Australian international cricketer in 1909 has been recreated by a university's engineering department.\nThe recreation of the bowling machine, designed by Dr John Venn in the early 1900s, was set as a challenge by Hugh Hunt, professor of engineering dynamics and vibration at Cambridge University. \nThe contraption will be used at events and open days to inspire young people considering maths and engineering careers.\nProf Hunt said: \"The idea behind the project was to recreate a bit of history, and to show how much fun you can have with maths.\"\nIt was created from only a black and white photograph of the 7ft (2m) machine, and a patent application from the time for reference. \nWhen the Australians visited Cambridge in 1909, their star batsman Victor Trumper was bowled out by the machine.\nThomas Glenday, head of design and technical services at the university's engineering department, said they did not have any drawings to work with. \n\"It meant we had to sketch it out for ourselves, figure out how the machine was actually going to work, and how it replicates the skill and speed of a spin bowler,\" he said.\n\"The spin has been the key piece, and probably the most complicated part of the design.\"\nThey started with a one-fifth-scale model of the machine using coil springs, before upscaling this with bungee cords. \nTests showed the machine could bowl at about 33mph (53km/h), and Mr Glenday said he was \"very pleased\" with the final product. \n\"It would be nice for it to be throwing balls at 100mph (161km/h) but it's not designed to be a production machine.\n\"It's a historic relic which should be treated as such.\"\nOpening batswoman for the university's women's cricket team, Alice Bebb, 23, tested the machine. \nShe said: \"It's like no bowler I've ever faced before.\n\"It was like a very tall bowler bowling very close to you and it was difficult to predict where it was going to go.\"\nThe machine will feature at Essex County Cricket Club on Monday in an event for the Essex Year of Numbers initiative to inspire a love of learning, with a focus on numeracy. \nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "France's President Emmanuel Macron has called a bombshell snap parliamentary election after being defeated by the far right in the European elections - in a night of drama that overall saw the centre-right tighten their grip on the EU Parliament.\nMr Macron made the announcement after losing to his rivals Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella and their National Rally party.\nFrance\u2019s result was one of the big gains that Europe\u2019s far-right parties had expected, and confirmation came with all the exit polls giving National Rally more than 30% of the vote, double that of Mr Macron\u2019s centrist Renaissance party.\nBut beyond France, the broader story of Europe's four-day vote marathon really belonged to the parties of the centre-right.\nThey strengthened their majority in the European Parliament, with victories in Germany, Greece, Poland and Spain, and significant advances in Hungary, against long-dominant Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n\u201cThe centre is holding, but it is also true that the extremes on the left and on the right have gained support,\u201d said Ursula von der Leyen, the centre-right head of the European Commission, now on course for a second term.\nMs von der Leyen said her centre-right group was an \"anchor of stability\", but such a result required \"great responsibility for the parties in the centre\". \nThe far right did not enjoy as great a surge across Europe as many had predicted.\nIn the Netherlands, anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders\u2019 Freedom Party came second; and in Belgium the separatist Vlaams Belang lost out to the nationalist New-Flemish Alliance.\nEuropeans in 27 countries voted in these elections to elect the next EU Parliament - with the majority of voting happening on Sunday. The European Parliament is the direct link between Europeans and the EU's institutions.\nThere had been talk before the vote that Ms von der Leyen's dominant European People\u2019s Party might consider talking to the two right-wing groups that house the far right. \nBut she made clear the EPP's only allies would be the Socialists & Democrats and the liberal Renew group that includes Mr Macron\u2019s party.\nWhile the centre-right has a commanding 184 seats in the 720-seat European Parliament, the S&D has not lost ground, and the centrists are still third, despite a big drop in seats.  \nGermany\u2019s opposition conservatives were always going to come out on top, and they scored an impressive 30% of the vote. \nBut for Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s SPD party, this was the worst-ever result in a European election, coming third behind the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). \nThe victorious head of the conservative CDU, Friedrich Merz, said it was a disaster for the three-party ruling coalition and he called for a change of tack: \"They're damaging our country with the kind of politics they do.\" \nThe AfD has endured a slew of scandals involving espionage, foreign interference and allegations of Nazi sympathies, and yet its support still held up.\n\"After all the prophecies of doom, after the barrage of the last few weeks, we are the second strongest force. And I'm telling you, the only way is up,\" said co-leader Alice Weidel.\nMeanwhile a new anti-migrant far-left party, BSW, led by charismatic left-wing firebrand Sahra Wagenknecht, also performed well \u2013 rounding off a good night for radical parties.\nIn Hungary, Peter Magyar, a former insider in Viktor Orban's government has proved a dangerous rival to his old ally, polling more than 30% barely two months after forming his centre-right Tisza party. \nMr Magyar told BBC Budapest correspondent Nick Thorpe that Hungarians had a new situation - \"a new opposition party able to defeat this government at the next general election in Hungary.\"\nIn Spain, the centre-right opposition Popular Party (PP) defeated Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialists, but not by the big margin that PP leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o had been hoping for. \nThe centre-right leader said it was a \"resounding electoral triumph\", but the Socialists finished on 20 seats, only two fewer than the PP.\nAnother far-right party, Vox, came a distant third.\nMeanwhile, in Italy, Giorgia Meloni\u2019s dominance of her country's politics continued. \nHer far-right Brothers of Italy polled 29% of the vote, defeating the centre left Democratic Party of Elly Schlein by almost five points.\n\u201cThank you to the Italians who are continuing to choose us\u2026 I am proud of the result tonight,\u201d she told her supporters.\nAnd in Austria, the far-right Freedom Party FP\u00d6 was on course for a narrow but unprecedented victory in the European vote.\nIn just five years, Ms Meloni has more than doubled her party\u2019s seats in the European Parliament, while Ms Schlein\u2019s performance pleasantly surprised even party activists.\nBelgium was holding national and regional elections as well as the European vote, and although the far right had been expected to top the vote, it was the New-Flemish Alliance that came first, bringing an end to the rule of liberal Prime Minister Alexander De Croo. \n\u201cThe far r",

    "A new-born cygnet \"left behind\" by its family after it \"could not keep up\" with the others was rescued by a man, hand-reared and returned safely to its parents and siblings.\nThe baby swan was the last of six to hatch near Jones Boatyard in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, and had to be encouraged from its shell by its mother. \nRob Adamson, known as \"the swan man\" lives and works at the yard, and said after watching the weak youngster get left behind and eyed up by predatory crows and herons, he took it in.\n\"I couldn't leave it, and after two days it gained strength so I returned it - and now you'd never know it was the runt - they are all doing so well together,\" he said.\nMr Adamson has a history of looking after the swans and other wildlife at the boatyard on the River Great Ouse, having brought up \"Sid\", an abandoned cygnet, and built a raft to save a nest threatened by flooding. \nHe had been checking regularly on the latest nest but noticed that while five cygnets hatched and were happily plumping their feathers, one egg was still intact.\nMr Adamson watched as the mother swan trod on the last egg and then tapped it with her beak to allow the youngster to come out.\nThe self-confessed \"wildlife nut\" had been observing the swans for years, and said he had watched the latest nest for several weeks, so the parents were not \"bothered in the slightest\" by his presence.\n\"But I kept seeing this little one left behind in the nest because he just couldn't keep up, and with the crows circling, I couldn't leave him there - he'd have been a gonner,\" Mr Adamson said.\nEven though he has previous experience with rearing a cygnet, he said he \"took advice from former RSPCA staff to make sure what I was doing was the right thing - and they said it was\".\nMr Adamson said he \"tried not to let the cygnet see me too much, because I didn't want it to get attached to me\", and after two days of nurturing, he said the bird \"looked as strong as the others\", so he returned it to the nest site.\n\"He was taken in straight away,\" he said.\n\"A week later, you could hardly tell the six of them apart, but I think I can still recognise Bobbly.\n\"I named him that because when he first took to the water he was so wobbly I thought he would capsize - but now they are all doing so well.\n\"It's just such a thrill that I get to do this - and see all of this.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Evidence of settlements dating back 3,000 years have been discovered near a reservoir.\nThey have been unearthed by archaeologists digging ahead of the construction of a 19.5km (12-mile) water pipeline close to Abberton Reservoir, near Colchester.\nArtefacts found include Roman coins and pottery from the Iron and Bronze Ages.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fascinating to learn about the history we uncover,\u201d said Daniel Wilson of Essex and Suffolk Water.\nOne of the coins discovered is believed to depict the Roman Emperor Valentinian I, who ruled from 364 to 375 AD.\nThe team from Oxford Archaeology have also found evidence of farmsteads and settlements, including large rectangular enclosures evidenced by clear crop marks.\nThe remains of several structures were unearthed, along with large deposits of oyster shell and industrial residue.\nThe finds are all logged, photographed and evidenced, before construction of the pipeline is allowed to continue.\n\u201cArchaeology is the record of what\u2019s happened over time,\u201d said Tim Haines, senior archaeologist from engineering and design consultancy firm Stantec.\n\u201cThe very putting of a pipeline here will become archaeology by its very nature.\u201d\nMr Haines told the BBC the discoveries \u201care a lot more interesting to me than things like Stonehenge \u2013 this is how people are actually using their landscape over time\u201d.\nHe said they showed Essex had \u201ca continually changing landscape\u201d.\nThe unearthed pottery, which can be linked to regions in France, meant Essex was likely to have been involved in international trade.\n\u201cWe forget how much trade there was across the North Sea,\u201d said Mr Haines.\n\u201cOn the Essex coast, you\u2019ve got all of these little estuaries so people would be trading from the continent up and down them - it\u2019s a very dynamic, very international landscape.\u201d\nArchaeologists started researching the history of the pipeline\u2019s route more than two years ago, but digging only started in early 2024.\nThe archaeological work has taken place in collaboration with Essex County Council and Colchester City Council.\nEssex & Suffolk Water is building the pipeline from Layer de la Haye to Langford, near Maldon.\nWhen complete, it will carry 20 million litres of pressurised water every day, which the water company said would improve the resilience of supply for 370,000 customers.\nIt is scheduled to be complete by autumn 2024.\nMr Wilson said information about the discoveries would be made publicly available.\nIt is hoped that some of the artefacts will eventually end up in local museums.\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The parents of missing Jack O'Sullivan say they have lodged a formal complaint against the police over its handling of his disappearance.\nIt is now 100 days since Bristol student Jack - who was 22 at the time - vanished after a night out in the city.\nHis parents say their ordeal has been made much worse by Avon and Somerset Police, which is responsible for finding Jack, and they have lost all faith in officers' attempts to locate him.\nAvon and Somerset Police said it \"fully recognises the distress and anguish\" his family are going through, and officers are \"determined to do all that we possibly can\".\nThe force added the family's complaint has been recorded and is being assessed, and the family will be updated.\nJack's family say that mistakes were made early on in the search for him and say that CCTV footage, placing him in a different location - at a different time - was initially missed. \nIt was only found by Jack's Mum Catherine, when she was allowed to view some of it for herself.\n\"To have footage of my son in their possession the day after he was missing and for someone not to see that is just ludicrous,\" she said.\n\"And we have to live with that...thinking what would have possibly been different here if on that second day, the whole world knew that he was there - and we could have appealed to people.\"\nJack went to school in Bristol, before studying and graduating from Exeter University then returning to Bristol to continue his studies.\nHe was living with his parents and close to his older brother Ben at the time of his disappearance.\nThe night Jack went missing, he had been at a house party with friends from his course. He had left in the early hours of the morning.\nData shows that his phone was still in use hours after he was last seen on CCTV. But despite repeated requests by his family to try and find out more about what it was being used for - they say, the police have drawn a blank.\nBen O'Sullivan says this is a real issue.\n\"We've been told for weeks and weeks that there is the possibility of the National Crime Agency helping and providing their resources, but despite asking...there still has been no progress.\n\"I've been trying my best to help - but I'm the first to admit, I'm not a tech expert. And you would hope that Avon & Somerset would have the resources for me not to be involved.\"\nThe family was also distraught to find out last week, that an administrative error within the police force, meant Jack had not been added to the national Missing People's Register until he had been missing for more than two months.\n\"The errors that have cast so much doubt in our mind about what was done, when it was done and whether it continues to be done has caused us untold damage\" says Catherine O'Sullivan.\n\"I wouldn't want anyone on earth to be faced with what we've dealt with in the last 100 days, because it is horrific.\n\"We have to live with the fact that Jack's not here, but to find that the people who could have been looking for him haven't done it properly is just devastating\"\nAn Avon and Somerset Police spokesperson said: \"This investigation has included reviewing and re-reviewing more than 100 hours of CCTV footage, carrying out expert-led searches by land and water involving multiple teams, including the dog unit, drone unit and specialist dive team, proactively seeking and acting on advice from national policing specialists, and issuing multiple appeals to the public and media for information.\n\"Sadly, despite these efforts we\u2019ve been unable to find Jack to date. \n\"We fully recognise the distress and anguish this has had on Jack\u2019s family and our thoughts remain very much with them,\" they added.\n\"We\u2019re determined to do all that we possibly can to find the answers they so desperately need.\"",
    "One of the starkest dividing lines between the two main parties at Westminster is over climate - or at least that\u2019s what both sides would have you believe.\nRemember when rain-soaked Rishi Sunak fired the starting gun on the election standing outside No 10? He boasted about how his government had \u201cprioritised energy security and your family finances over environmental dogma and our approach to net zero\u201d.\nSir Keir Starmer, by contrast, talked about \u201charnessing Great British Energy to cut your bills for good\u201d with the \u201clargest investment in clean energy in our history\u201d.\nThe smaller parties lay claim to having serious green credentials - the Lib Dems say tackling climate change is at the heart of a new industrial strategy, and the SNP says it is \u201cproud to have the most ambitious legal framework for emissions reduction in the world\u201d. The Greens and Plaid Cymru say climate is at the centre of their proposals and have promised to hold Labour to account if it wins the election.\n\nLabour has built much of its vision for the future around its energy plans. It claims the initial \u00a38bn of public cash over five years it has pledged to its Great British Energy company will kick-start a process of industrial renewal, reviving the economy in the loosely termed Red Wall constituencies to deliver jobs as well as secure supplies of energy and lower bills.\nThe Tories have been attempting to characterise this as a return to state control. It is the job of entrepreneurs to take risks and pick winners, they say; when politicians try, it ends up costing ordinary people dear. \nYou can trust us to keep your energy bills low and protect the country from the whims of tyrants like Putin with new oil and gas from the North Sea, is the message from the Conservatives.\nIt sounds like there is an ocean of difference between the two main parties. But dig down into the detail of their policies and it\u2019s a different story.\nThe core agenda on climate - getting the UK to net zero emissions by 2050 \u2013 has always been very much a cross-party project.\nLabour introduced the Climate Change Bill in 2008 to make it a legal obligation for future governments to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. Both parties wholeheartedly supported the proposal - just five MPs voted against it.\nIt was Theresa May\u2019s government in 2019 that upped the target to 100% of emissions - net zero - supported again by a whopping cross-party majority. That is something that Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho must have forgotten when she warned against Labour\u2019s \u201creckless net zero targets\u201d in recent days. She was not yet an MP at the time of that 2019 vote.  \nMs Coutinho has also been very critical of what she has called Labour\u2019s \u201cmad plans\u201d to decarbonise the grid by 2030.  Rishi Sunak has described the policy as \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d.  Yet the Conservatives aim to ensure 95% of UK electricity will be low-carbon by 2030, with full decarbonisation following five years later. Squeezing out those last few percentage points of fossil fuel power will undoubtedly be the hardest, but these aren\u2019t hugely different agendas.\nAnd how about our vehicles? In September Rishi Sunak announced with great fanfare that his government was going to push the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars back from 2030 to 2035. He made much less noise about the fact his government would be retaining the obligation on manufacturers to ensure 80% of car sales are electric by then. In that context, Labour\u2019s plan to revert back to a 2030 ban doesn\u2019t look that drastic.  \nOn oil and gas, the Tories approved drilling on the controversial oil field, Rosebank, back in September. It is reckoned to be last large untapped field in the North Sea. The party claims that its plans to license other new oil and gas projects will help guarantee energy security \u2013 though Ms Coutinho conceded on BBC Breakfast back in November that it won\u2019t necessarily lower bills.\nLabour has said it won\u2019t approve any new projects in the North Sea - an important symbolic gesture for the UK - but it has promised to honour all existing oil and gas licenses, including Rosebank. In Aberdeen last week, Starmer was at pains to emphasise that, under Labour, oil and gas will be part of the UK\u2019s energy mix \u201cfor decades to come\u201d.\nAnd the list goes on. Both parties back a windfall tax on oil and gas companies until at least 2029, though the rates might differ by a few percentage points. Both parties say they support a massive expansion of solar power - the Tories want 70 gigawatts (GW) by 2035, Labour 50GW by 2030. Both parties want to see offshore wind continue to grow - the Tories want 50GW more by 2030, Labour 60GW, including 5GW of floating offshore wind.\nThere are some standout policy differences, however. A Labour government will not allow a proposed new coal mine in Cumbria to go ahead, for example. It says it will double the cash commitment to insulating the UK\u2019s draughty homes \u2013 making our homes more energy efficient is one of the toughest ",

    "A mental health nurse has been struck off after he took several patients outside a secure facility to wash his car as part of their \"therapy\".\nIan Brown had been working at Foxhall House in Ipswich, a low-secure unit for male offenders who have a mental illness.\nA Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) misconduct hearing investigated several claims about Mr Brown's behaviour in 2019.\nThe Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT) said it had followed \"appropriate and necessary internal proceedings\".\nA report from the hearing stated Mr Brown had said washing his car was part of \"therapy\" for the patients. \nMr Brown joined the NMC register in February 2018 and began working at Foxhall House in February 2019.\nHe had previously worked at the Suffolk Rehabilitation and Recovery Service where concerns around \"unprofessional behaviour towards colleagues and patients\" were raised before he was redeployed to Foxhall House.\nIn August 2019 it was alleged Mr Brown took four residents, one of whom did not have authorisation to leave, outside to wash his car.\nA colleague who gave evidence to the panel said Mr Brown had described it as \"therapy\" for the patients.\nThe hearing was told Mr Brown said in response to the allegations: \"I believe it's more constructive to wash a car than sit outside smoking.\"\nIn September 2019 it was alleged Mr Brown opened a secure gate in a garden that resulted in a patient absconding.\nMr Brown said he had been following a brief to clear some wood from the area and \"unfortunately mistakes happen\".\nMr Brown resigned in October 2019 but an investigation review meeting a year later found he \"would have been dismissed on the grounds of misconduct\" if he had remained employed by Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, which manages Foxhall House.\nThe panel ultimately found Mr Brown's actions fell \"significantly short of the standards expected of a registered nurse\" and that they \"amounted to numerous breaches\".\n\"We consider the misconduct serious because Mr Brown\u2019s actions amount to a number of serious breaches, falling far below the standards expected in the circumstances, which would be found deplorable by a fellow nursing professional,\" the NMC added in the report. \nThe report said striking Mr Brown off the NMC register was \"necessary\" for public safety as well as sending a \"clear message about the standard of behaviour required of a registered nurse\". \nAn NSFT spokesperson said: \"There is nothing more important than the safety of the people under our care.\n\"Ian Brown let down his patients and his nursing profession and acted against the values of our trust and the NHS.\n\"As a consequence of Mr Brown\u2019s actions we made sure to follow the appropriate and necessary internal proceedings and Mr Brown was referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council.\u201d\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Hunter Biden has been found guilty of illegal possession of a gun and lying about his drug use when it was bought. The verdict leaves the US president's son facing a prison term.\nHe is the first child of a sitting US leader to be convicted of a federal crime, but he will be back in court in September to face tax charges in a separate trial.\nIt had looked far different last summer, when the 54-year-old looked set to resolve the trials and avoid prison time in a plea agreement with prosecutors.\nBut the deal unravelled in court, and the prosecutor leading the federal inquiry later went ahead with the gun charges.\nIn December, a second indictment alleged Hunter had failed to pay at least $1.4m (\u00a31.1m) in federal taxes that he owed for tax years 2016-19.\nCongressional Republicans have conducted impeachment hearings into President Biden to investigate alleged influence-peddling by his son. The months-long inquiry has not appeared to uncover any wrongdoing, however.\nMeanwhile, Hunter's personal struggles - from alcohol and drug abuse, to relationship strife - have spilled into full public view.\nSo what more do we know about Hunter Biden? \nBorn in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1970 to Joe Biden and his first wife Neilia, Hunter was given his mother's maiden name as his first name.\nHe was only two years old in December 1972 when - less than six weeks after his father's election to the US Senate - a truck rammed into the family car.\nThe accident took the lives of his mother and his baby sister Naomi, while leaving him with a fractured skull and his older brother Beau with a broken leg.\nJoe Biden - who was not in the car - took his oath of office by their bedside in hospital.\nHunter later attended Georgetown University and Yale Law School, graduating in 1996.\nBetween the two degrees, he joined the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, a Catholic group that serves marginalised communities.\nThere, he met his first wife, Kathleen Buhle, a lawyer, and they wed in 1993. They have three children - Naomi, Finnegan and Maisy - but the pair split in 2017.\nHis father is teetotal, but Hunter started drinking as a teenager and has acknowledged abusing cocaine as a college student. He has been in and out of rehab.\nIn 2013, he signed up for the US Navy Reserve and was sworn in before his father - then the vice-president - in a White House ceremony.\nBut on his very first day at the naval base, he tested positive for cocaine use and was discharged.\nAccording to the New Yorker, he drank excessively after the death of his older brother, Beau, from brain cancer in 2015, sometimes only leaving the house to buy vodka.\n\"He and Beau were one,\" his daughter, Naomi, once wrote on Twitter. \"One heart, one soul, one mind.\"\nDuring their acrimonious divorce, Ms Buhle accused Hunter of \"spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he had sexual relations) while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills\".\nBreaking her silence last year on how the 24-year marriage unravelled, she told Good Morning America: \"He was struggling under a massive drug addiction, and that's heart-breaking and painful and that wasn't who I was married to.\"\nIn his 2021 memoir Beautiful Things, Hunter concedes that his infidelity was the final straw in their marriage.\nA DNA test in 2019 found he was \"the biological and legal father\" of a child born to Lunden Alexis Roberts, an exotic dancer from Arkansas.\nHunter claimed to have \"no recollection\" of their encounter in his memoir, but he has settled a paternity suit with Ms Roberts and pays her child support.\nNone of the Bidens appear to have ever met Navy Roberts, now four years old. But amid a media pressure campaign, President Biden was last summer forced to acknowledge his seventh grandchild.\nBefore he finalised his split from Ms Buhle, Hunter entered into a relationship with his brother's widow, Hallie Biden.\nDuring a two-year relationship, the pair bonded over their shared and \"very specific grief\" as a result of Beau Biden's death, he told the New Yorker.\nTaking the stand at his Delaware trial, Hallie Biden testified that the president's son had introduced her to crack cocaine and bought drugs in her presence. She also said his frequent use left him \"agitated\" and \"high-strung\".\nTwo months after a stint in rehab in 2018, Hunter Biden purchased a handgun - what his defence team maintains was an impulse buy, under pressure from a pushy gun store owner.\nProsecutors said he lied on the firearm application form by claiming that he was not using drugs at the time. Hunter Biden's attorneys argued he did not consider himself an addict and had been clean at that time.\nHallie Biden, who told the court she had confronted Hunter Biden over his drug use, found the weapon and ammunition as she again cleared \"remnants of crack cocaine and [drug] paraphernalia\" from his vehicle.\nShe described how, in a moment of panic, she stuffed the gun in a shopping bag and",
    "Hospital porters, cleaners and catering staff have launched a 48-hour strike after missing out on a one-off bonus for health workers which recognised the pressure they faced during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe GMB union said its members at the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen hospitals missed out on the \u00a31,600 lump sum because they were not employed directly by the NHS on 31 March 2023.\nStaff told the BBC their contracts were all transferred from a private firm on 1 April, meaning they missed out on the payment by one day. \nLiverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs both hospitals, said the dispute was between the union members and their \"previous employer\".\nPorter Terry Neary told BBC Radio Merseyside those affected had performed \"exactly the same\" roles as their NHS colleagues during the pandemic, but had officially been employed by facilities firm ISS. \n\"We feel undervalued,\" he said.\n\"All together here, we've worked right through Covid, seen things we should never have seen [and] at times, no PPE for us.\n\"We've joined from ISS to the NHS, which is saying we're all under the same umbrella, we're all one family.\n\"We're definitely not all one family, I don't feel anyway.\"\nFellow porter Karen O'Hare said some office-based staff had received the award despite not having regular face-to-face contact with patients. \n\"We were enclosed in lifts, taking patients up to wards, transferring them everywhere,\" she said.\n\"We were directly with patients and yet it's just like we're not even good enough to have the money.\"\nGMB senior organiser Kerry Nash said some members were considering leaving their jobs as a result of what had happened. \n\"They do the same work as many who have received the payment,\" she said.\n\"The only difference is a name on their uniform or payslip.\n\"Their work is vital to the safe running of our hospitals [and] the least they deserve is fair treatment.\"\nA trust representative said it had \"followed national guidelines for non-consolidated pay awards\". \nThey added that the trust's \"estates and facilities team has business continuity plans in place to ensure the safe delivery of care and people should attend their hospital appointments as planned\".\nISS have been approached for comment.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "New parking restrictions at Oxford United's Kassam Stadium have been criticised by supporters for being unclear and unfair.\nCar park management company Parkingeye was brought in to reduce over-stays and unwanted parking from people not using the stadium and leisure park.\nBut fans using the club shop have said the signs at the site are not visible enough, leading to unnecessary fines.\nParkingeye insisted the car park featured \"prominent and highly-visible signs\".\nThe new restrictions, which were introduced by landowner The Firoka Group of Companies, came into force in March.\nSupporters visiting the ticket office or club shop are supposed to have a 20-minute grace period, which can be extended to up to four hours if vehicles are registered via a QR code.\nSeason ticket holder Denise Moss said she popped into the shop to buy bucket hats ahead of last month's Wembley Stadium match.\nShe said she was prompted by the staff to register her vehicle, which she then attempted to do, but this appeared later not to have worked.\nMs Moss was then \"shocked\" to receive a parking fine two days later \"for being 19 seconds over the 20-minute grace period\".\nShe appealed the decision, providing photos of her purchases and the receipt, but was refused.\n\"I feel a little bit upset,\" she said. \"Nineteen seconds isn\u2019t a lot of time. Basically they don\u2019t care.\n\"The signage needs to be a lot better.\"\n'Silly fines'\nAnother fan who received a ticket described the scheme as a \"ridiculous and total money-making scam\".\nA representative for the Oxford United Fans Page on Facebook told the BBC: \"The amount of people who have said they\u2019ve had problems is amazing... we want to encourage fans to come to the games, support Oxford, and buy the merchandise, but not be turned away because they\u2019re getting these silly fines for attending.\" \nA Parkingeye spokesperson said: \"The car park at Kassam Stadium and leisure centre features prominent and highly-visible signs throughout providing information on how to use the car park responsibly.\n\"This includes guidance on how all motorists must enter their vehicle registration into the terminal or via a QR code at one of the onsite premises, in order to obtain a four-hour permit.\"\nIt said it operated a British Parking Association audited appeals process, and it encouraged people with mitigating circumstances \"to highlight this by appealing and providing any supporting evidence\".\nOxford United, and The Firoka Group of Companies, have been contacted for comment.\nThe Kassam Stadium has been the home of Oxford United since 2001.

    "With China accused of selling electric cars at artificially low prices, the European Union is widely expected to hit them with tariffs this week.\nThe BYD Seagull is a tiny, cheap, neatly styled electric vehicle (EV). An urban runabout that won\u2019t break any speed records, but nor will it break the bank.\nIn China, it has a starting price of 69,800 yuan ($9,600; \u00a37,500). If it comes to Europe, it is expected to cost at least double that figure due to safety regulations. But that would still be, by electric car standards, very cheap.\nFor European manufacturers that is a worrying prospect. They fear the little Seagull will become an invasive species, one of a number of Chinese-built models poised to colonise their own markets at the expense of indigenous vehicles.\nChina\u2019s domestic auto industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades. Its development, along with that of the battery sector, was a major component of the \u201cMade In China 2025\u201d strategy, a 10-year industrial policy launched by the Communist Party in Beijing in 2015.\nThe result has been the breakneck development of companies like BYD, now vying with Tesla for the title of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of electric vehicles. Established giants such as SAIC, the owner of the MG brand, and Volvo\u2019s owner Geely, have also become big players in the EV market.\nLast year, more than eight million electric vehicles were sold in China \u2013 about 60% of the global total, according to the International Energy Agency\u2019s annual Global EV Outlook.\nFor policymakers in Europe and the US, however, this is a cause for concern. With Chinese brands having plenty of surplus capacity and moving into international markets, they fear their own companies will be unable to compete. They claim hefty subsidies for domestic production allow Chinese firms to keep prices at a level other firms will struggle to match.\nAccording to a report by the Swiss bank UBS, published in September, the Chinese advantage is real. It suggested that BYD could produce cars at some 25% lower cost than the best of the legacy global carmakers.\nIt said BYD and other Chinese firms were \u201cset to conquer the world market with high-tech, low-cost EVs for the masses\u201d.\nMeanwhile, earlier this year, the Alliance for American Manufacturing warned that the introduction of cheap Chinese cars  could be an \u201cextinction-level event\u201d for the US auto industry. It called for a \u201cdedicated and concerted effort to turn those imports back\u201d, concluding that there was \u201cno time to lose\u201d.\nLast month, the US took decisive action. The Biden administration raised its tariff on imports of Chinese battery-powered cars from 25% to 100%. Sales of Chinese-made EVs in the US are currently negligible; with the new tariffs, they are likely to stay that way.\nThe move was part of a wider package of measures targeting imports from China that has been condemned by Beijing as \"naked protectionism\".\nAt the same time, the US is subsidising its own car industry, through tax incentives that make domestically-produced vehicles cheaper to buy.\nThe EU appears to be taking a more moderate approach, despite tough rhetoric.\nIn her state of the Union address in September last year, the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced an investigation into Chinese imports.\n\u201cGlobal markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars,\" she said.\n\u201cTheir price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market.\u201d\nThe initial results of that investigation are now imminent.\nIt is widely expected that the Commission will provisionally raise duties on EVs imported from China, from the standard level of 10% for third country imports to between 20 and 25%.\nAccording to Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research, this would be a rather more proportionate response than the US move.\n\u201cThe 100% tariff is just pure protectionism, regressive and stifles innovation, and prevents a competitive landscape for the consumer,\" he says.\n\u201cIf the EU imposes tariffs of no more than 25%, it will be more about levelling the playing field, and evening out the 30% cost advantage Chinese manufacturers have.\"\nNevertheless, tariffs could hurt European companies as well as helping them.\nFirstly, they would not just affect Chinese brands. For example, BMW\u2019s iX3 electric SUV is built at a factory in Dadong and exported to Europe. The company also intends to import large quantities of Chinese-made electric Minis.\nBoth models would be subject to the tariffs, leaving the manufacturer to absorb the extra cost, or raise prices. The US manufacturer Tesla would also be affected, as it builds cars in Shanghai for export to Europe.\nSecondly, although European makers have invested heavily in production in China in recent years, in partnership with local manufacturers, a number of them still export high-value models to Chinese markets.\nIf China wanted to retaliate by imposing its own hefty tariffs, these shipments could be targeted.\nSmall wonder then, tha",
    "Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has said he will resign after the general election. \nIt follows a row over Mr Ross standing as a candidate for Aberdeenshire North and Moray East instead of David Duguid, who has been in hospital and was in effect de-selected.\nDouglas Ross has led the Scottish Tories since August 2020 following the surprise resignation of Jackson Carlaw after just six months in the job.\nHe was an MP at Westminster at the time but not an MSP so for the first nine months of his leadership Ruth Davidson led the party in the Scottish Parliament.\nRoss, who is still only 41, was born in Aberdeen and attended Forres Academy before going to the Scottish Agricultural College.\nBefore his move into politics, he worked as a dairyman at local farms.\nHe was first elected to Moray Council in 2007, at the age of 24, and became part of the Independent/Conservative administration. \nHe stood unsuccessfully for the Moray seat at the general elections in 2010 and 2015 but he was elected to the Scottish Parliament as a regional list MSP in 2016.\nHowever, he stood down from Holyrood the following year when he was finally elected to the House of Commons, unseating SNP stalwart Angus Robertson who had held the seat for 16 years.\nDespite having opposed Brexit, Douglas Ross was initially seen as an ally of Boris Johnson, and served as a junior Scotland office minister for six months. \nBut he resigned his ministerial role  in early 2020 in protest at Dominic Cummings' refusal to stand down as the PM's adviser, despite breaking Covid lockdown rules.\nTwo years later, when details of Downing Street parties during lockdown emerged, he called on Boris Johnson to resign - but later reversed that position, arguing he should remain in power as the UK responded to the war in Ukraine. \nHe returned to Holyrood when he became a list MSP for the Highlands and Islands  in 2021. \nWhile serving in both the Scottish and Westminster parliaments, he has donated his Scottish parliamentary salary to charity.  \nAway from politics, Ross is also a qualified top-level assistant football referee.\nHe was one of the officials for the 2015 Scottish Cup Final, assisting Willie Collum, and the 2018 Scottish Cup Final, assisting Kevin Clancy.\nHe has also been involved in European and International fixtures.\nHis sideline as a football official has caused some controversy. \nHe was criticised by both the SNP and Labour for missing a parliamentary debate on Universal Credit in 2017 due to his refereeing commitments.\nIn August 2020, he apologised for missing a VJ Day event because he had already agreed to officiate at a Scottish Premiership fixture between Kilmarnock and St Johnstone.\nMr Ross referred himself to the Westminster parliamentary watchdog in November 2021 after it emerged he had failed to record his earnings - some \u00a328,000 - as an assistant referee in his registers of interest. He subsequently apologised.\nAnd just this weekend he faced allegations that he used Westminster expenses to travel in his role as a football linesman.\nMr Ross said the expenses were approved by independent parliamentary body IPSA and he would have \"no issue\" with the expenses being examined for a second time.\nIn 2015 he married police sergeant Krystle Ross. The couple have two young sons, one born in 2019 and the other in 2021.\nIan Bailey - Liberal Democrats\nAndy Brown - Labour\nJo Hart - Reform UK\nSeamus Logan - Scottish National Party\nDouglas Ross - Conservative",
    "South Korean soldiers fired warning shots after North Korean troops crossed the border by mistake, Seoul's military said on Tuesday.\nThe incident at the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) on Sunday comes as tensions continue to rise between the two Koreas.\nA small group of North Korean soldiers carrying field tools including pickaxes entered South Korea at 12:30 local time (05:30 GMT), Seoul's military said. They were among 20 who were in the border area at that time.\nThey retreated immediately after the South Koreans fired the warning shots.\nIn recent weeks, the North has flown hundreds of rubbish-filled balloons to border towns in the South. \nSeoul has responded by broadcasting propaganda and K-pop music to the North using loudspeakers. Activists have also flown propaganda balloons into the North.\nThere was no notable movement from the North in the DMZ after its troops retreated on Sunday, Seoul's military said.\n\u201cInside [the border area] the vegetation is overgrown, and the border markers are hidden. There are no paths, and they were wading through the overgrowth,\u201d it said.\nOn Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, threatened the South with \u201cnew counteractions\u201d if it continues loudspeaker broadcasts and does not stop activists from sending balloons.\nLast December, Mr Kim ended all efforts at a peaceful unification with the South, accusing Seoul of \u201chostility\u201d towards the North.\nSince then, the North demolished a highly symbolic unification monument in Pyongyang and ended all communication with the South.\nEarlier this month, South Korea suspended what remained of its 2018 military agreement with the North, which will allow it to resume drills and propaganda activities such as loudspeaker broadcasts.\nSouth Korea had partially suspended the agreement last November, following the North's launch of a spy satellite.\nIn recent months, Seoul detected North Korean soldiers planting landmines along the border and disconnecting railways to the South. North Korean soldiers were also seen installing guard posts within the DMZ.",
    "The experiences of a group of residents in a supported living complex in Telford illustrate the challenges facing the NHS at the moment. Many report difficulties accessing GPs, while others face long waits for hospital treatment.\nThe \u201cknit and natter\u201d mornings at the Lawley Bank Court supported living complex are noisy affairs. One resident tries to start a sing-song, belting out Ring of Fire, and though a couple of colourful blankets are on display, there is much more nattering than knitting.\nConversations vary, but there is one topic that everyone seems to have an opinion on, namely the difficulty of getting a GP appointment.\n\u201cYou\u2019re afraid to be ill,\u201d says Brenda Stretton. \u201cI was number 24 in the queue last week - I only got to number 19 before I was cut off. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\nA forceful, energetic, 90-year-old, Ms Stretton had been having some eye problems but, try as she might, she couldn\u2019t get an appointment.\nAnother resident, 96-year-old Gwendolyn Higgs, was similarly exasperated. A pharmacist had recommended she visit a doctor following a bout of earache.\n\u201cI went over to the receptionist last week. And she said, we're not making appointments,\u201d recalled the cancer survivor.\n\u201cSo I said, \u2018what do I have to do then to get one?\u2019 She said, \u2018ring up at eight o'clock in the morning\u2019. So I rang up the following morning. They said they haven't got any appointments.\n\u201cSomebody said to do it online. But they were only doing it for blood tests, not for appointments. It's five years since I've been to the doctor for anything. And I still can't get an appointment.\u201d\nWhat further exasperates the residents of the complex is that there is a GP surgery less than 100m from their building. Some are said to have moved in specifically because a doctor was nearby. \nEven when they can get an appointment however, there is no guarantee it will be in the local practice. The surgery is part of a larger group of six surgeries, and people can be sent anywhere depending on availability. \u201cI don\u2019t drive,\u201d said Ms Stretton. \u201cSo how do I get there - taxis? At \u00a310 each?\u201d\nThe cause of their frustration - as for many people around Telford - is Teldoc, a GP federation created in 2018.\n\u201cI had a case this morning, an 86-year-old lady we've been trying to get an appointment for, for over a week,\u201d says Julie Vernon, who runs a company, Extra Help, that supports people with services such as cleaning and shopping.\n\u201cWe phoned the GP again this morning at eight o'clock. Fully booked. So they asked us to phone 111. Phoned 111 and they called out an ambulance. The ambulance came, did an assessment and said, \u2018you need a GP\u2019. They phoned [the GP] and got one tomorrow. So that's how many services have been involved just to get a GP appointment.\u201d\nTeldoc told us that since it was set up, there had been a large increase in the population of the town, as several housing estates had been constructed. However, it said there had been no funding to expand its services.\n\u201cAccess to general practice is a national issue, and Telford is no exception,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe acknowledge that access to appointments can sometimes fall short of people\u2019s expectations. However, we have and will continue our work to make improvements where necessary to enhance patient access to our services.\u201d\nPolling suggests that most people think public services have deteriorated nationally in recent years. This article is the third of three focusing on the town of Telford, which a BBC News analysis has identified as facing particular challenges across its courts, schools and health services. Similar problems to those found in Telford are widespread, however.\nThe problems across the NHS don\u2019t simply impact the sick. The difficulty of getting appointments means schools have started letting teachers take time off during the day, forcing them to find cover in classrooms. The long delays in the back of ambulances waiting to get into A&E has led to care homes giving food parcels to residents who need to go to hospital.\n\u201cI think the NHS is broken nationally,\u201d says Debbie Price, chief executive of Coverage Care Services, which operates 11 care homes across Shropshire. \u201cI've been involved in conversations with the hospital for many years and they're the same conversations I was having 20 years ago. Things haven't really moved on.\nShe believes the way health and social care is funded needs to change. \u201cThere's been a lot of talk about pooling resources, looking at the individual and having funding available for the individual. \n\"Most professional meetings are focused on solving the hospital issues though, whereas I think that social care providers - domiciliary as well as residential and nursing - can provide solutions that they just don't consider.\u201d\nBack at Lawley Bank Court, Joyce is tending to her mother, as she does every day. Margaret, 69, has dementia and recently had a seizure that necessitated her having to go to hospital. \u201cShe was in that ambulance for nine hours,\u201d recalls Joyce. ",
    "Iran\u2019s Guardian Council has approved six candidates to run in this month's presidential election.\nAlmost all of them are Islamic hardliners close to the thinking of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nThe constitutional body vetted the 80 people who registered to stand on 28 June according to their religious and revolutionary credentials.\nIt appears to have approved candidates with a view to setting up hardliners to hold on to the presidency following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\nOne front-runner is Saeed Jalili, a former secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and nuclear negotiator who is thought to be the favourite of Ayatollah Khamenei.\nIn his time as head of Iran\u2019s nuclear negotiating team, Mr Jalili repeatedly stonewalled the talks with five world powers while Iran advanced its nuclear programme.\nHe is seen by many as a largely tedious, hard-line Islamist ideologue with no executive experience.\nThe present Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, is another candidate with a good chance.\nHe is a regime insider and former general of the Revolutionary Guards who has also served as the country\u2019s police chief and mayor of Tehran.\nOne of that pair might decide to leave the race at the last minute in order not to divide the votes.\nThree other candidates - Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani, Vice-President Amirhossein Qazizadeh Hashemi and Mostafa Pourmohammadi - are also hardliners of various shades.\nMr Pourmohammadi is a former justice and interior minister who, along with Ebrahim Raisi, was a member of the so-called \u201cDeath Committee\u201d that approved the execution of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s.\nAn exception to the hardliners is Massoud Pezeshkian, the member of parliament for Tabriz. A relative moderate, he has an outside chance of winning if turnout is very low.\nMr Pezeshkian could win the votes of many otherwise reluctant voters who may see a vote of him is a vote against the hardliners. He is also ethnically Azeri, and is thought to have the votes of the some in the north-east of Iran, where the bulk of the population are Turkish-speaking Azeris. \nLeaving him in the mix might be a ploy to push up a turnout that otherwise could be historically low.\nTwo big names that have been denied a chance to run are the hard-line former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and Ali Larijani, a three-time speaker of parliament hailing from a deeply conservative religious background.\nTheir rejection shows how narrow the choices have become in the elections where the voters will have little choice but select among the few hardliners with whom the supreme leader feels he can work.\nWith such choice of candidates, it is unlikely that the election will generate much excitement among Iranians.\nThey will see this as another occasion where the supreme leader has engineered the elections to produce an outcome he desires - another hard-line president and complete control of the levers of powers.",
    "Singapore Airlines has offered to pay compensation to those who were injured on a London to Singapore flight that encountered severe turbulence.\nThe airline said it will pay $10,000 (\u00a37,800) to those who sustained minor injuries, in a Facebook post.\nFor passengers with more serious injuries, the airline is providing \"an advance payment of $25,000 to address their immediate needs\" and further discussions to meet \"their specific circumstances\".\nA 73-year-old British passenger died and dozens more were injured when flight SQ 321 encountered turbulence over Myanmar and was diverted to Thailand in May.\nSingapore Airlines has not yet responded to a BBC News request for further information on how many people will be entitled to the payments.\nMore than a hundred people who had been on SQ 321 were treated in Bangkok hospital after the incident.\nEarly investigations showed that the plane accelerated rapidly up and down, and dropped around 178ft (54m) over 4.6 seconds. \nPassengers described how crew and those not wearing seatbelts were sent flying and slammed into the cabin ceiling.\nA hospital in Bangkok where passengers are being treated said there were spinal cord, head and muscle injuries.\nThere were 211 passengers - including many Britons, Australians and Singaporeans - and 18 crew on board the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft at the time of the incident.\nThe company said it would offer a full fare refund to all passengers on the flight, including those who did not suffer any injuries.\nOn top of this, Singapore Airlines said passengers will received delay compensation in accordance with European Union or United Kingdom regulations.\nThe airline also offered S$1,000 ($739; \u00a3580) to all passengers to cover immediate expenses and it arranged for loved ones to fly to the Thai capital where requested.\nUnder international regulations, airlines must offer compensation when passengers are injured or die while on a plane.\nThe incident brought attention to seatbelt practices, as airlines usually allow passengers to undo their belts during normal cruise conditions.",

    "The Scottish government has turned down a request for a public inquiry into two fires at the Glasgow School of Art (GSA).\nThe former culture committee said a number of issues required further examination. But culture secretary Angus Robertson said he did not support the recommendation. \nOn 23 May 2014, a fire caused extensive damage to the A-listed Mackintosh building - designed by architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\nAn even more devastating blaze broke out near the end of a \u00a335m restoration project in June 2018. A report in 2022 failed to find a cause. \nMr Robertson said that the Scottish government \"has long recognised the cultural and historical significance of the Mackintosh building\".\nHowever, he told MSPs on the Scottish Parliament's culture committee that the government \"does not support\" a call for a public inquiry into the blazes.\nThe committee had previously recommended that an inquiry, with judicial powers, should be set up to examine the risks posed by fire in historic buildings and the ability of building custodians to manage such properties.\nBut Mr Robertson said while ministers had looked at the feasibility of holding a review of fire safety in A-listed buildings, most of these properties - including the Mackintosh building - are privately owned.\nHe said that neither the Scottish government nor Historic Environment Scotland had the \"necessary frameworks or regulations currently in place to implement such a comprehensive review\".\nIn a letter to MSPs, Mr Robertson said he believed the \"resources required, not just financially but in terms of expertise and personnel, would be extensive\".\nHe wrote: \"Given the current financial landscape, it is difficult to identify a way that this could funded, or justified, given the protections already given to historic buildings in fire safety and construction legislation, and the progress already made since the 2018 fire.\"\nThe culture secretary said the \"extensive damage\" suffered in the 2018 fire had meant the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service had been \"unable to determine its likely origin and cause\".\nProf Alan Dunlop, whose paintings depicting the fire at the art school were shortlisted for an international prize, said he was \"disappointed but not surprised\". \nProf Dunlop has been a persistent critic of GSA management's handling of the two fires and ran for chair of the board in 2022.\n\"A public inquiry would have shone light into the darker ineptitudes of governance and leadership - past and present,\" he said.\n\"Communication between the school of art and those interested in the future of the Mackintosh building has been consistently poor. \n\"The Garnethill Community have been treated shamefully as have generations of art students. No inquiry means no accountability and no justice.\"\nGSA previously said it was committed to a faithful reinstatement of the building and planned to eventually use it as a working part of the art school.\nThe school said work to date, totalling about \u00a318m, had been funded by interim payments from the insurers.\nRestoration plans have faced delays due to disputes with insurers.",
    "\"We demand a vote of confidence and new elections,\" Alice Weidel, leader of Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), told journalists on Monday. \"People have had enough.\"\nGermany\u2019s far-right is jubilant after beating German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s centre-left SPD to second place in the European Parliament elections with 16%.\nThe AfD\u2019s results are better than expected. Their election campaign was hit by a string of scandals, with allegations of money laundering, cash from the Kremlin and spying for China. \nIn the end the AfD even had to campaign without their two lead candidates, Maximilian Krah and Petr Bystron, who were being investigating for links to Russia and China. \nThe final straw for Mr Krah came when he downplayed the crimes of the Nazis, musing that not all SS officers were criminals. \nThe AfD became too toxic even for France\u2019s hard-right leader Marine Le Pen, who threw the AfD out of the right-wing European parliamentary group Identity and Democracy. \nMs Weidel clearly wants to make up with far-right allies in Europe: to clean up the party\u2019s image, she has excluded Mr Krah from the AfD\u2019s EU delegation.\nThe party\u2019s leaders call the scandals a \"media campaign\". \nJudges who rule against the AfD in court, or intelligence services who investigate the party, are condemned as politically motivated. \nThis narrative of victimisation appears to have worked. \nWhile the government\u2019s high-minded election campaign talked about \"defending democracy\", the AfD poured resources into TikTok videos, snappy slogans and simple-sounding solutions. \n\"We have real problems in this country which need to be resolved, instead of insulting us,\" said AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla. \"It doesn\u2019t work with voters.\" \nHe may be right. In eastern Germany, where the AfD is particularly extreme but often leads in the polls, the far-right won the most votes. \nAnd the party managed to up its share among young voters, who possibly enjoyed rebelling against mainstream German norms of acceptability. \nPerhaps the AfD did well, not in spite of the scandals, but because of them.\nThe governing coalition is in turmoil, trying to figure out what went wrong. \nOn Monday, one SPD leader called the results a \"painful humiliation\". \nThe conservatives are certainly satisfied with their lead result of 30%. But given how unpopular the government is, this is hardly a stunning result. \nThey came second to the AfD in eastern Germany, where key regional elections will be held in September. \nAnd in a national parliament election, these numbers would make it hard to cobble together a stable coalition. \nThe result will give CDU leader Friedrich Merz a boost in his attempt to drag his party into a more conservative post-Merkel era, and it lays the groundwork for his bid to become Germany\u2019s next chancellor next year. \nBut the only real winners in Germany this week are the populists.",
    "Firefighters are battling wildfires in Brazil's Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland. \nThe Pantanal is home to jaguars, giant anteaters and giant river otters.\nClose to 32,000 hectares have already been destroyed by the fires in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, local media report.\nClimate experts say this year's wildfire season has started earlier and is more intense than in previous years.\nFirefighters said their efforts to extinguish the flames were being hampered by high winds over the weekend.\nThe region has also seen less rain than in other years, which has made it easier for the fires to spread.\nThe number of fires from the start of the year up to 9 June has been 935% higher than in the same period last year, according to figures from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE).\nThe rise is particularly worrying as the high season for wildfires is not due to start until July. \nMato Grosso do Sul state authorities declared an environmental state of emergency in April, saying low levels of rainfall were creating ideal conditions for wildfires.\nThe number of fires so far in 2024 is the highest since 2020, which was the worst year on record in terms of Pantanal fires.\nIn that year, about 30% of the Pantanal was consumed by fire. \nThe difference in the number of fire outbreaks so far this year compared to last year is already staggering. \nBetween 1 January and 9 June 2023, 127 fires had been reported. In the same period this year, that number was 1,315.   \nVinicius Silgueiro from local NGO Instituto Centro da Vida told Reuters news agency that \"what is most worrying is that even in the rainy season, we had this increase in fires\".\nMr Silgueiro warned that the situation would probably deteriorate further at the peak of the dry season in August and September. \n Last week, Brazil's federal government announced it would work together with the state governments of Mato Grosso do Sul as well as those in the Amazon region to combat wildfires. \nEnvironment Minister Marina Silva said it was key to respond to fires more quickly while also doing more to prevent them from breaking out in the first place.\n",

    "The chief executive of Birmingham Airport has said he is \"very disappointed\" with changes to rules for liquids in carry-on baggage.\nSince Sunday, following government stipulation, passengers at all UK airports have been allowed to carry no more than 100ml in liquids, pastes and gels in their hand luggage.\nBirmingham had spent \u00a360m to upgrade its security desks and introduce hi-tech scanners known as Next Generation Security Checkpoints (NGSC), which would have allowed passengers there in the future to carry up to two litres.\nNick Barton said the situation passengers found themselves in was \"not what we planned to give them\". \nThe new scanning tech had meant that some UK airports with the provision had already relaxed liquid limits.\nWhile Birmingham Airport had upgraded to the equipment, the site had kept to 100ml, putting it down to \u201can outstanding regulatory approval\" on the new screening machines. \nBut on Friday, the government announced a return to rules predating the tech.\nIt said the 100ml restriction was being reintroduced at the six regional sites that had relaxed the rule to \"enable further improvements to be made to the new checkpoint systems\".\nThe move was not in response to a specific threat, it added.\nMr Barton told the BBC the airport had to plan for the government's direction to remain in place \"for the next few days\".\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper said the reintroduction of restrictions was to allow \u201cchanges\u201d to be made to the scanning equipment.\n\u201cIt's a temporary measure and we\u2019ll set out when that can be reversed in due course,\u201d he told the BBC.\nMr Barton said the government had told major airports to have the improved security technology installed by 1 June.\nHe called it a \"fantastic bit of infrastructure\" that should result in \"huge benefits to speed\".\nOnce fully operational, he said it would allow passengers to leave containers carrying up to two litres in their bags.\nHe added that in the meantime, about one in six passengers going through security in Birmingham were generally not following procedures over liquids and that slowed down the checking process and led to longer queues.\nHe said he was asking all passengers to \"help themselves\" by ensuring there were no bottles of 100ml or more inside their cabin bags.\nThe bottles or containers can remain inside their bags, though, and do not have to be removed.\nTo cope with delays he said the airport had \"deployed a huge amount of human resource in the terminal\" to speed up the security process.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Leeds Bradford Airport passengers no longer need to remove small liquids from their luggage after new security rules came into force at the terminal.\nThe airport has scrapped strict restrictions on liquids after introducing new, high-tech scanners.\nPreviously, 100ml bottles and electronic equipment had to be placed in a see-through bag to pass through security checks.\nNow, although containers must still not exceed 100ml in size, they can remain in a passenger's luggage during the check-in process and each person can carry an unlimited number of bottles.\n\n\nThe new scanners provide staff with a much clearer view of the contents of bags.\nThe 100ml rule was introduced in 2006 due to fears over the terrorist threat from liquid bombs.\nPassengers had been told they could take liquids in containers larger than 100ml in their carry-on bags - but the rules changed again on Sunday. \nLeeds Bradford Airport Chief Executive Vincent Hodder said the alteration came after the government had issued a \"change of direction\". \nHe said: \"With the new technology that we\u2019ve been permitted, it now means that customers can now leave their electronics and their electrical items in the bag, and they can also leave their liquids in the bag. \n\"It avoids that process of having to stop, and have to sort it out separately,\" he added. \n\"It also avoids the re-packing at the other end of the security experience.\"\n\nBBC Look North spoke to passengers who were positive about the changes. \nOne said: \"We just went straight through, it's so much simpler.

    "Former Scotland cricket international John Blain has criticised delays to the publication of a report that he says clears him of racism.\nJohn Blain says he was told by Cricket Scotland's then-chief executive Pete Fitzboydon in January that the allegations against him were unfounded\nIt followed claims - some made by all-time leading wicket-taker Majid Haq - of racism and discrimination.\nCricket Scotland had appointed an independent legal team who specialise in discrimination to carry out the review.\nBlain, one of Scotland's all-time leading wicket-takers, says he was asked to remain quiet until the complainants had been informed of the outcome.\nBut he now feels that five months is too long to wait - and has called for an inquiry into the actions of the sport's governing body.\nBlain, who was capped 118 times for his country, said he believed that by not publishing the report sooner, Cricket Scotland was \"running scared\".\n\"My life has been on hold for too long,\" he added.\nBlain has now made public the letter which he says Cricket Scotland sent him.\nIn it, former CEO Pete Fitzboydon says: \"Further to recent discussion I write to confirm the conclusion of the ongoing investigation into allegations made against you.\n\"As advised, these allegations have not been founded, and there is not any case to answer, and so this matter is now considered closed.\"\nCricket Scotland said it had \"engaged extensively with all parties throughout a complex, challenging and emotive independent investigative process\".\nIt added: \"This has included offering appropriate support to both complainants and respondents.\n\"We will comment further upon the conclusion of the independent investigative process, whilst continuing to offer support to all those involved.\"\nMajid Haq represented Scotland on more than 200 occasions but did not play again after being sent home from the 2015 World Cup.\nAt the time he hinted he felt victimised on grounds of race.\nHis former Scotland teammate Qasim Sheikh also spoke openly about being racially abused.\nIn July 2022, a report commissioned by funding body SportScotland found that there was evidence of institutional racism in Scottish cricket.\nThe \"Changing the Boundaries\" review highlighted 448 examples.\nCricket Scotland's entire board resigned a day ahead of the report's publication.\nFollowing a separate investigation by the English cricket's ruling body the ECB in March 2023, John Blain was one of six players found guilty of racism at Yorkshire County Cricket Club.\nIt followed accusations made by former England international Azeem Rafiq.\nBlain, Gary Ballance, Tim Bresnan, Matthew Hoggard, Andrew Gale and Richard Pyrah were all found to have used racist slurs.\nThey were fined sums of between \u00a32,500 sand \u00a36,000.\nJohn Blain said: \"The fact that the year-long Scottish investigation has completely exonerated me fatally undermines the ECB process and must force them to reconsider their unjust verdict and clear my name.\"\nAn ECB spokesperson said the Cricket Discipline Commission had upheld the charge against John Blain for using racist language at Yorkshire in or around 2010 and 2011 after considering all the evidence before it.\nThis included John Blain's defence \"and a number of supporting witness statements filed by him (through his then legal team) before he withdrew from the process\".\nThe spokesperson added: \"What happens in the future is now a matter for the Cricket Regulator.

They should be 21 metres (69ft) away under planning guidelines and they're less than 10 metres (33ft) away.\n\u201cIf they'd built 72 houses which is in the LDP, I'd have no issue. \n\"I\u2019m not someone who says 'not in my back yard'.\u201d\nHe claimed they would no longer be used for Ukrainian refugees.\n\u201cNobody has been able to challenge this,\" he said. \u201cI volunteered to host a Ukrainian family, so we didn't have an issue at first.\n\u201cNow our concern is this won't be for housing Ukrainians, and it'll become housing stock and won't be temporary.\n\u201cIf there was a bad way to do something the Vale of Glamorgan council have chosen the worst possible way to do it.\"\nThe council's planning committee was expected to consider the application for the site next month, but it was delayed until July due to the general election.\nResidents opposing the development set up an action group and raised more than \u00a37,000 in days to secure legal support.\n\u201cIt looks like a prison, and it feels like a prison,\u201d said Dave Thomas, 61,  from the action group.\nMr Thomas, who has lived on Pembroke Place, next to the site, for 29 years with his family, said: \u201cHow can planning make a fair decision now, it feels pre-determined as they've already spent \u00a325m on this.\n\u201cThey are not going to take them away after spending that much money on them.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought it was going to help people fleeing their country and would be temporary.\u201d\n\u201cIt looks like a prison, and it feels like a prison. And yet it was meant to be a welcoming place for refugees.\u201d\n\u201cIt's the least welcoming place.\u201d\nThe council said the units were temporary for five years and they could be easily removed and reused.\nA spokesman said: \u201cDevelopment of the site commenced on 3 June 2023 and permitted development rights would be applicable for 12 months from this date. After this the development would be considered 'unauthorised.\"\nIt said it was \"standard procedure in these circumstances is to wait for the outcome of the planning application before deciding next steps\".\nThe council said it was \"only right that in circumstances such as this elected members have the benefit of a comprehensive and detailed report with references to all material considerations and the views and opinions of adjoining residents before reaching a decision.\n\u201cNo families will move into the temporary homes until a decision has been made, and then only if planning approval is granted.\u201d\nConservative Alun Cairns said there had been \"no consultation or engagement with the local community\" and it was \"a scandal they took the decision to develop this a week before Christmas in 2022 and told residents they\u2019d use emergency powers to develop the site for Ukrainian refugees\".\nLabour's Kanishka Narayan said he had listened closely to residents' concerns on planning issues. He said he would be \"a strong champion for our community and will put these concerns first when engaging with the council planning committee on the issue\".\nPlaid Cymru's Ian Johnson said he supported Wales being \"a nation of sanctuary\" and the application for the site would be decided by councillor after \"a site visit and a full and frank debate as to whether the development is in line with planning regulations\u201d.\nLiberal Democrat Steven Rajam said new developments had to be considered due to their impact on the community. But he said \"sadly it appears as though the Labour-dominated council have instead decided to go full steam ahead with reckless haste, leaving locals to pick up the pieces\".\nReform's Toby Rhodes-Matthews, said he was\" deeply disgusted with how the Eagleswell Site development has been handled\", leading to \"significant financial losses for local residents and has destroyed the harmony of what was once a happy and coherent neighbourhood\".\nStuart Field, of Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, said: \"Nobody ever consults the people who have to live there it is just done behind closed doors. It\u2019s about time the Welsh Senedd governed for the people of Wales rather than helping everybody else in the world.\"\nThe Greens were also asked to comment.",

    "A 1960s Bungalow in East Dunbartonshire has been crowned Scotland\u2019s Home of the Year in the finale of the popular BBC Scotland series.\nThe house in Milngavie - described by the show's judges as electrically eclectic - is home to Anna McClelland, her partner Harry Kinloch and their children Lexie and Marley.\nAnna and Harry \u2013 who are both Glasgow School of Art graduates \u2013 said they were thrilled and genuinely shocked to win.\n\"Our home is distinctive and unique because it\u2019s like the inside of our heads and that\u2019s also what makes it homely to us - but maybe not for lots of other people,\" Anna said.\nShe said taking part in the show had been amazing and it had also meant her partner Harry had finally finish doing the DIY.\nThe Scotland\u2019s Home of the Year (SHOTY) judges \u2013 interior designers Anna Campbell-Jones and Banjo Beale and architect Danny Campbell - picked the winner from a shortlist of six finalists found across Scotland.\nThe 1960s Bungalow has been extended twice and the judges loved its clever decorating techniques and the use of reclaimed materials including the flooring from a school, complete with colourful markers.\nMs Campbell Jones said it was a very worthy winner.\n\u201cThis electrically eclectic creative home exemplifies what it means to truly make your home unique to you,\" she said. \n\"It was fun and playful - an absolute dream family home to spark children\u2019s imaginations and keep that same feeling alive in any adult who has the good fortune to experience it first-hand.\u201d\nShe said she was impressed by the ingenious use of \"normal\" things in extraordinary ways, such as patterns made with electrical tape, inexpensive Zebra carpet which gave a new cool context to the house as well as colourful decals on plain tiles and light switches.\nSHOTY judge Banjo Beale said it was unlike any home he had ever stepped foot in.\nHe said it was a work of art and a living canvas for its creative owners. \n\"The home was bold, brave and unapologetically 100% them,\" he said. \n\"The owners created this home just for themselves. \n\"When you walked in, you really got a sense of who they were. From the duct tape art to a smiling loo, it didn\u2019t take itself too seriously. It is a home for big and little kids alike.\"\nArchitect and judge Danny Campbell said: \u201cThe carefree abandon to which the homeowners had turned their home into their family curated artwork, but also, how cleverly they remodelled it. \n\"This one had it all - there were double front and rear dormers, a split-level kitchen and reconfigured internal layout, a large rear extension and landscaped garden \u2013 I was in architectural heaven. \n\"The new spaces they created were elevated by the commitment they had to their vision and how expertly every detail had been turned into artwork.\nThe 2024 series of Scotland\u2019s Home of the Year visited 18 properties across the length and breadth of Scotland and chose the winner from six finalists. \nFor winners Anna and Harry, a real highlight was meeting the other finalists. \nHarry said the stories behind how everyone\u2019s home developed were really interesting. \n\"I actually asked the owners of Earth House [winners of Ep3 Highlands and Islands] if they\u2019d consider a house swap - they said no,\u201d he joked.\nThe seventh series of Scotland\u2019s Home of the Year will begin filming over the summer. \nApplications are open until 5 July.",
    "The first week of June in Scotland has been marked by chilly temperatures - and a dusting of snow on the highest mountains.\nBut why is it so cold, and when might it warm up?\n\"The reason is because we have been drawing our air all the way from Greenland down across Iceland then feeding in over Scotland,\" says BBC Scotland weather presenter Judith Ralston. \n\"This has now been the case for the first week of June. \n\"The reason for this is because we have a stuck weather pattern at the moment caused by high pressure in the Atlantic and low pressure over Scandinavia which has resulted in a consistent feed of air coming in from the cold north or north-west.\"\nJudith adds: \"This has resulted in coverings of snow across the mountains of Scotland, which in itself is not unusual for June, but to see seven consecutive days of snow falling over the highest peaks is very unusual.\"\nOvernight temperatures in towns and cities at times last week dropped to between 3C and 6C.\nBut the wind chill factor, what the Met Office describes as the \"feels like\" temperature,  made it feel much colder high up on Scotland's mountains.\nThe Mountain Weather Information Service forecast warned of a wind chill of -10C.\nScottish weather forecaster Kirsty McCabe says there could be a touch of overnight frost in sheltered spots this week.\nThe US singer Taylor Swift reportedly wore gloves during her performance at Murrayfield Stadium on Saturday because she was feeling the cold.\nSwift - whose hits include Cruel Summer, Love Story - and Cardigan - performed three sold-out gigs in the capital over the weekend.\nSaturday's weather had a bigger impact on Scottish Hill Runners' Two Mamores race in the Highlands.\nBad weather forced organisers to remove the route's two mountain summit sections. Participants were also encouraged to take with them a long-sleeved extra layer of clothing.\nThe chilly June weather has also meant some people sticking on the heating at home, at a time it would typically be off until at least September.\nIs this ever going to end?.\nWell, there's some better news in the forecast - eventually.\nForecaster Judith Ralston explains: \"More of the same to come over the next few days, the change takes place later this week as the winds becoming more southerly, finally cutting of that cold air during Thursday.\"",
    "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has visited Cairo and Jerusalem as he attempts to build regional support for a draft Gaza peace deal recently unveiled by President Joe Biden.\nThe top American diplomat met with foreign leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on his eighth visit to the Middle East since the start of the war in Gaza. \nMr Blinken said his message to leaders in the region was: \"If you want a ceasefire, press Hamas to say, yes.\"\nMediators from Qatar, Egypt and the US have been attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas for months.\nBut Mr Netanyahu has not endorsed the US proposal yet, either.\nA readout of Mr Blinken's meeting with Mr Netanyahu says that the American diplomat emphasised the importance of a post-conflict plan for Gaza and of preventing the conflict from spreading.\n\"He reiterated that the proposal on the table would unlock the possibility of calm along Israel's northern border and further integration with countries in the region,\" the State Department said.\nIsrael's prime minister has vowed to resist any such deal until Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities are destroyed and all hostages are released.\nOn Saturday, Israel's forces, backed by air strikes, freed four more captives after fighting intense gun battles with Hamas in and around the Nuseirat refugee camp.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said the raid killed 274 people, including children and other civilians. Israel says fewer than 100 people died in the operation.\nAfter the offensive, Hamas's political leader said the group would not agree to a ceasefire deal unless it achieved security for Palestinians.\nMr Blinken is using his trip to argue that Hamas is the sole obstacle to the agreement of the ceasefire-for-hostage release deal that the US desperately seeks.\n\"Does Hamas want to end this conflict, end this war that it started, or not? We\u2019ll find out,\" he said.\n\"But it\u2019s clear that virtually the entire world has come together in support of the proposal.\"\nThe three-phase plan set out 10 days ago by Mr Biden would involve a six-week ceasefire that would become permanent, and the rebuilding of Gaza with international assistance.\nThe president called it Israel\u2019s proposal, in an attempt to effectively bounce the two sides into progress, and his administration claims the text is \u201cnearly identical\u201d to one endorsed by Hamas last month.\nHamas is likely to demand guarantees the plan would lead to a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Its political leadership in Doha has yet to formally respond to the proposal, according to US and Israeli officials, so it remains to be seen whether indirect negotiations can resume.\nDuring its 7 October attacks in southern Israel, Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took some 251 people hostage.\nSome 116 remain in the Palestinian territory, including 41 the army says are dead.\nA deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 37,000.\nWhile Mr Biden presented the peace initiative as an Israeli one, the US also knows Israel\u2019s own fractious ruling coalition is approaching the plan with much reluctance.\nThis extends to outright opposition by some far-right ministers who are threatening to trigger a collapse of the government if the deal progresses.\nAmerica\u2019s chief diplomat is therefore flying into the thick of a political storm in Israel with few signs of a breakthrough on the truce proposal. The resignation of former general Benny Gantz from the war cabinet on Sunday has deepened the sense of instability around Prime Minister Netanyahu, with whom the White House has become exasperated over the course of the war.\nFor officials in Washington, Mr Gantz had become a preferred point of contact. He quit after giving Mr Netanyahu an 8 June deadline to meet his demands. Many of his objections to Mr Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war - including over a lack of any meaningful governance plan for a post-Hamas Gaza - closely mirrored those of the Biden administration.\nOn Sunday, Mr Gantz accused the prime minister of putting his political survival ahead of the national interest, keeping Israel \u201cfrom achieving real victory\u201d. Mr Netanyahu fired back that this was not a time for colleagues to quit but to \u201cjoin forces\u201d.\nMr Gantz's resignation pulls the Israeli government\u2019s centre of gravity back towards the far-right, although it remains unclear how his move will affect the pressure Washington can bring to bear on Mr Netanyahu, with its chief goal still being to build backing for the truce agreement.\nIn Cairo, Mr Blinken met President Sisi, whose mediators he said had been in touch with Hamas only hours before their conversation.\nA statement from the president's office stressed the need to lift obstacles to humanitarian aid for Gazans.\n\"Deal\u00a0or\u00a0no\u00a0deal,\u00a0it\u00a0remains\u00a0absolu",
    "An inquest jury has concluded a six-month-old baby who died with chicken pox should never have been sent home from hospital.\nHunter Martin was later mistakenly given an overdose of antibiotics - ten times the prescribed amount, on five separate occasions.\nHowever, the Derbyshire coroner ruled there was not enough evidence the drugs blunder contributed more than minimally to Hunter's death.\nBosses at Chesterfield Royal Hospital say it is now looking at 23 different areas of improving its care.\nFollowing an inquest at Chesterfield Coroner's Court, a jury concluded Hunter died due to sepsis and Group A Streptococcus infection linked to chicken pox.\nIn addition, it was found his death was contributed to by the decision to discharge him from hospital on 4 March 2023.\nThe inquest identified two occasions where Hunter's condition could have been escalated sooner to critical care.\nHe was eventually transferred to Sheffield Children's Hospital two days after his parents, from New Whittington, first took their son to Chesterfield Royal Hospital Accident and Emergency. Hunter died after suffering three cardiac arrests.\nHe had been mistakenly given an overdose of antibiotics, ten times the prescribed amount on five occasions when he was brought back to Chesterfield by his worried parents - the day after he had initially been discharged.\nThe jury heard instead of the recommended dose of 94mg of Clindamycin, Hunter received 940mg.\nCoroner Peter Nieto directed the jury there was not enough evidence to show that mistake more than \"minimally\" contributed to Hunters death.\nSpeaking after the inquest, his parents said they felt \"massively let down\" by the hospital over their son's death.\nHunter's father Alex Martin said: \"We are always going to be left wondering what impact this [antibiotic] actually had, because we've not had any solid answer on that. It's what if?\"\nHis mother Jade Smith said: \"It's heartbreaking, and to relive it all for a week, just to find out what we already knew.\"\nIn a statement read during the proceedings, Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said ibuprofen had been given to Hunter, which went against its guidelines for treating chicken pox.\nIt admitted this \"probably masked the early signs of his infection\", adding that Hunter should have had a clinical review and remained under observation for longer.\nThe trust's statement added that this \"false reassurance\" led to a missed diagnosis of Group A Streptococcal infection on Hunter's first admission.\nIt added: \"It is admitted that, on the balance of probabilities, had the bacterial infection been suspected and treated with IV antibiotics by 14:30 on 4 March, Hunter would have survived.\n\"However, it is accepted in hindsight that there were later missed opportunities to recognise worsening features of sepsis and escalate care to tertiary intensive care, this is due to the mixed picture of Hunter's observations and clinical status.\"\nThe trust offered a \"profound\" apology to Mr Martin and Ms Smith, adding it had \"identified areas that required improvement\" to prevent similar incidents in the future.\nThe family is working to raise awareness of sepsis and recently held a fundraising event in their home village.\nThey have also liaised with local hospitals for posters featuring Hunter to be placed in A&E and paediatric departments urging people to look for the symptoms.\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Girls have been sent home from a school over the length of their skirts. \nPupils at Caldicot School in Monmouthshire say they have had their skirt length measured, with one parent claiming up to 200 pupils were denied entry to class.\nGirls have also been handed face wipes to remove make-up and clippers to cut nails, it is claimed.\nOne 14-year-old said she was ordered to have her skirt measured by a male teacher as part of the strict new dress rules. \nWhen she refused, she was sent to a room where other pupils were being held and prevented from attending lessons, before eventually being sent home for wearing false eyelashes.\nMonmouthshire council insisted all matters relating to girls\u2019 uniforms were being dealt with by female members of staff.\nA letter sent to parents last week said skirts would have to be \u201cto the knee\u201d.\nActing headteacher Alun Ebenezer said: \"Students will not be allowed to walk around school if these guidelines are not followed.\u201d\nPreviously interim head teacher at The Deepings School in Lincolnshire, Mr Ebenezer faced similar criticism in 2022 when parents claimed pupils there were excluded from lessons for wearing the wrong socks and trousers. \nAnd as part of a trust in charge of Haven High Academy in the same county, Mr Ebenezer was a key player in enforcing a \"no nonsense\" approach towards disruptive students earlier this year.\nThat clampdown on bad behaviour and non-regulation appearance in May saw 86 children excluded in just two days. \nAt Caldicot school, another girl, aged 13, said she was also told she could not attend lessons because of how she looked.\n\u201cWhen I got to school there were two teachers on the front door and they said: \u2018you\u2019ve got eyelashes on\u2019,\" she said.\n\"They took me to a room and there were literally about 50 girls in there.\u201d\nShe also claimed a female teacher attempted to pull her friend\u2019s skirt down, seemingly to stretch it, which briefly exposed the shorts she wore underneath.\nHer mum, who came to collect her, said: \u201cThey\u2019ve got all these girls in so-called 'holding rooms' before sending them home.\n\"It is unfair and targeting girls - they don\u2019t even want to teach them.\u201d\nOne father, who asked not to be named, said his 15-year-old son was sent home because his shirt was untucked, while his 13-year-old daughter was singled out due to the length of her skirt.\nHe said they have been threatened with exclusion from the school as a result, calling the move  \"totally pathetic\".\nAnother parent, Kevin Price, said up to 200 pupils had been denied entry to classes, leaving both students and parents in tears.\nHe demanded the school provide him, in writing, the reason his daughter was being denied an education and accused staff of causing \"emotional harm\".\nCouncillor Rachel Garrick, who represents Caldicot, said she was concerned.\n\u201cI always get concerned at a list of reasons to remove education from children that appears focused on gender,\" she said. \n\"It feels very much like girls' bodies are being considered more than their right to an education.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Monmouthshire council said: \u201cWe are aware that Caldicot School staff have been more rigorous in implementing the school\u2019s uniform policy as published on the school\u2019s website.\n\u201cThe acting headteacher wrote to all parents and carers last week setting out that this would be the case as of Monday.\n\u201cWith regards to the specific question regarding the length of skirts in school; all matters relating to girls\u2019 uniforms are being dealt with by female members of staff.\u201d\nLast year teachers at the school staged strike action claiming its leadership had failed to address verbal and physical abuse they faced from pupils.",
    "A 46-year-old man has been sentenced to 17 years in prison following the murder of his friend.\nMichael Beach, of Ruspidge Road in Cinderford, stabbed Scott Hopkins, 36, at a flat on the High Street of the Forest of Dean town, on 8 December last year.\nJurors at Gloucester Crown Court took just four hours and 18 minutes on Friday to find Beach guilty of murder.\nHe was jailed earlier for 17 years, minus the 182 days he has already spent on remand.\nIn a statement following the sentencing, Mr Hopkins' family said they wanted everyone to know the 6ft 1\" father and husband \"had a heart as big as him\".\n\"He will be eternally missed, forever loved and consistently remembered,\" they said.\n\"Nothing will ever bring Scott back, but this result goes some small way to bringing peace to us all.\"\nDuring the trial Beach claimed he stabbed Mr Hopkins by accident after they had been out drinking with another friend, Phillip Parry, at the Upper Bilson Inn in Cinderford.\nThe group - who often socialised together - had been at the pub for five hours, leaving at about 20:00 after Beach drank \"five or six cans of lager\".\nThe men were at Mr Parry's flat when Mr Hopkins followed Beach into the kitchen.\nBeach claimed he had picked up a kitchen knife to chop up some cannabis, but when he turned around, Mr Hopkins \"walked straight into the knife\".\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know Mr Hopkins was behind me,\" he said.\n\"I think he was going to cuddle me, but we ended up face to face.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want a hug so I pushed him away, so I could pass.\"\nBeach said he then saw blood on the floor and the knife, adding that Mr Hopkins let out a \"loud gasp\".\nParamedics arrived at the flat to find Mr Hopkins with a large knife wound that had \"nicked his heart and lung\".\nThey stopped CPR at 23:00 and Mr Hopkins was declared dead eight minutes later.\nBeach denied murder, but admitted manslaughter, maintaining Mr Hopkins' death was \"a freak accident\".\nMr Hopkins' family thanked those who had supported them as the investigation was carried out.\nThey added that families \"on both sides of this case have young children who now have to move on with their lives that have changed forever\".\nDuring the sentencing the judge told Beach that he had \"cruelly robbed\" Mr Hopkins' family of him.\n\"The highly distressing nature of this case is accentuated by the fact that we simply do not know why you did what you did,\" he said.\n\"It may be you do not know either, what we do know is that there was absolutely no need for it.\n\"[Hopkins] was a joker and is described as the life and soul, he brought so much happiness and joy to family life.\n\"His death has caused emotional and financial devastation for the family.\"\nThe judge added that, by murdering Mr Hopkins, Beach bears \"the heaviest burden of responsibility for stealing a lovely husband and father from his family\".\n\"People will ask, rightly, 'How could you do this to your friend?',\" he said.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The two biggest government parties are far out in front of their rivals with a handful of seats left to declare.\nFianna F\u00e1il have 246 seats, ahead of Fine Gael on 245. Independent candidates are faring well - they have secured 185 council seats. \nThe main opposition party, Sinn F\u00e9in, has won 102 seats so far, well below its own target of 200. The Labour Party has 56 seats and the Social Democrats 35.\nIreland has three EU constituencies which send 14 MEPs to Brussels, and Fine Gael's Se\u00e1n Kelly is the first elected, topping the poll in Ireland South.\nSinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald admitted she was \"disappointed\" by her party's council election performance but confirmed she has no plans to step down as party leader.\nIn total there are 949 council seats to be filled across 31 local authorities.\nThe Green Party has 23 seats so far, People Before Profit-Solidarity has 13 and Aont\u00fa eight.\nThe current Irish government has been in place since June 2020, when Fine Gael, Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green Party voted to enter a coalition together. \nCounting is also ongoing for the European parliament elections. \nFianna F\u00e1il MEP Barry Andrews told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster that the local election results so far show there is \"momentum for the government parties\".\n\"It tells you there is a broad satisfaction with what the government are doing,\" he said.\n\"The fact that the centre held strongly is good news, especially when you look at what's happening across the EU where there\u2019s been a massive growth in the far right.\"\nFine Gael senator Emer Currie added that it was a \"good night for the party\".\n\"We\u2019re offering stability, showing how important the centre and centrist politics is. We are investing in communities and people are seeing that.\n\"There is enough room in the centre for Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael.\"\nMeanwhile, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan told the BBC that the government parties in general have had \"a successful campaign\".\nHowever he added that the Green Party will lose \u201ca good number of seats\" in the local elections compared to its 2019 performance.\n\u201cWe expected that because 2019 was really a high water mark for environmental politics right across Europe,\" he said.\n\"But by holding our own in a lot of constituencies, and with a chance of winning two seats possibly in the European elections, we\u2019re still very strong.\"\nBy mid-morning on Monday, the Greens had won 21 council seats. \nSinn F\u00e9in expected to have more councillors elected to local authorities than at the previous local election, but so far it has not secured as many as it wanted.\nCommentators have suggested the party ran too many candidates which spread its votes too thinly.\nThere are also internal concerns Sinn F\u00e9in failed to make its policy on immigration sufficiently clear to the electorate. \nIts leader Ms McDonald has said she will lead a full review into Sinn F\u00e9in's performance.\nSinn Fein TD Padraig MacLochlainn emphasised that the party has \u201cgained seats all around the state but not at the level we would have hoped for\u201d.\n\u201cThe last local elections in 2019 pretty disastrous for Sinn Fein,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThis election was always about catch up. We didn\u2019t regain the amount of ground we would have liked.\u201d\nOutside of the main parties, single issues have brought some new politicians to the fore.\nIn County Donegal, the newly-formed 100% Redress Party fielded six candidates as part of its campaign to secure compensation for victims of the mica scandal.\nIt fights on behalf of homeowners whose houses are crumbling because they were built with defective concrete blocks containing high levels of the mineral, mica.\nSo far the party has won four council seats. \nImmigration was a big issue on the doorsteps during canvassing and in Dublin, two prominent anti-immigration protestors won seats on the city council.\nIndependent candidate Malachy Steenson, who campaigned against the housing of asylum seekers at a former office block in Dublin's East Wall area, was elected to represent the North Inner City. \nGavin Pepper, who has protested at several sites which were proposed for migrant accommodation, has been elected in the Ballymun-Finglas ward.\nIn Ireland, the more things change, the more things stay the same.\nThe current government party Fine Gael are now the largest party in local government, taking over from their partners in government Fianna F\u00e1il. \nAs counting continues, the big story from Ireland is the success of independent candidates. \nNon-party representatives from all stripes have swept the boards, in both rural and urban areas.  In Europe, a similar story has emerged.\nFianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, both centrist parties, are likely to be the first announced MEPs to return to Brussels. \nSinn F\u00e9in, who were at one point tipped to shake up the Irish political scene, have failed in their bid to take over local councils but may return to Europe with one MEP.\nThe party, who were once uncatchable in political polling, have plummeted as the party has struggled to confir",
    "A football club has come under fire after it dropped its entire women's section.\nThornaby FC's committee announced on Sunday it had voted to continue without its female teams, leaving 100 players without a club. It said its future was in doubt after a \"difficult year\" and progressing without the women was the only way to continue.\nFirst team manager Abbey Lyle said players had been \"floored\" by the decision, while England player Beth Mead said she was \"disgusted\".\nBoard member Philip Genery, who voted against the decision along with chairman Garry Morris, told the BBC six other board members had now stepped down and a new \"more diverse\" board would be established, including representatives from the women's team.\nLioness Mead, who grew up near Whitby, North Yorkshire, was among those to offer support.\n\"The women's game is on the up but we still have committees making these horrible decisions,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"It's not good enough, these women deserve better.\"\nAll of the Teesside-based club's female teams - from the under-7s up to its women's team - are affected by the decision, which was announced following an emergency meeting.\nA statement from Thornaby FC, posted on Facebook, said the future of the club had been discussed following \"events of the last 12 months\" and highlighted \"very low\" staffing levels.\nMs Lyle told the BBC there had been an outpouring of support for the women and girls following the announcement, with sponsorship and new clubs offered.\n\"Our main focus is trying to keep these teams together, we don't want to split them up,\" she said.\n\"It's been a tough few days and we did warn of the potential backlash.\"\nShe said the women's teams were self-sufficient and had sponsors, adding any suggestion of the club's decision being financially motivated was a \"cop out\".\n\"We've got girls who have really progressed this season, we were looking forward to presentation night but now we don't have a venue to host it at as we're not allowed to go to the ground,\" she added.\nThornaby FC's chairman Garry Morris, said he and another member of the committee had voted against the decision.\nMr Morris said he had asked the club to reconsider and to \"consider their positions on the board as patrons and trustees of the football club\".\nHe said: \"We are empowered by the fans of the club to make the right decisions for the future of the club, and all those who show their unwavering support to both the male and female teams of all age groups deserve better. \n\"I firmly believe this decision made yesterday does not do that, and will be making this clear to the remaining members of the board.\"\nThe BBC has attempted to contact the club's committee for further comment.\nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

This has always come from a place of love and wanting to win - for me and my dance partners.\"\nThe Italian star was paired with Sherlock actress Amanda Abbington last year. She withdrew from the competition citing \"personal reasons\".\nIt was widely reported that Abbington had experienced difficulties with Pernice, but she has not confirmed this to BBC News.\n\nDowden said on Monday she was \"so happy and grateful to be back\", in a post on Instagram.\nShe was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer after she discovered a lump in April 2023.\nAfter undergoing a mastectomy, she was told the tumours had spread and another type of cancer was discovered in July last year.\nAlthough she was unable to take up her usual role as one of the show's pros last autumn, Dowden made a surprise appearance back on the show when she read the show's terms and conditions for voting in October.\nThe 33-year-old, from Caerphilly, then took part in the show's grand final.\nDowden had said earlier this year that she hoped to get back to the Strictly dancefloor as soon as possible, after a health check showed \"no evidence of disease\".\n\n\nThe other professional dancers confirmed to be taking part in the next series of Strictly are: Dianne Buswell, Nadiya Bychkova, Graziano Di Prima, Karen Hauer, Katya Jones, Neil Jones, Nikita Kuzmin, Gorka Marquez, Luba Mushtuk, Jowita Przystal, Johannes Radebe, Kai Widdrington, Nancy Xu, Carlos Gu, Lauren Oakley, Michelle Tsiakkas and Vito Coppola, who won last year's competition.\nThe show marks its 20th anniversary this year, with the BBC promising \"a spectacular series of glitz, glamour and unforgettable performances\".\nThere will also be a one-off programme detailing 20 years of the show featuring famous performances and interviews with past celebrity stars, professional dancers and judges.\nShirley Ballas, Motsi Mabuse, Craig Revel-Horwood and Anton Du Beke will all return as judges.\nPernice is currently on tour with Du Beke. \nThe pair, who have hosted a travel show together, will next appear on stage at the Beck Theatre in Hayes later this week.",
    "Many of those paying tribute to Dr Michael Mosley after his death at the age of 67 never had the chance to meet him. \nBut the impact the medical expert had on their lives - speaking to them through his radio and television programmes, podcasts and books - mean his loss is being mourned around the world.\nFans of the TV medic, who pioneered the 5:2 diet and highlighted the benefits of intermittent fasting, have been contacting BBC News with their thoughts. \nPilates teacher Gillian Burn, from Hampshire, said: \"Over the last few years, I have incorporated Michael's amazing health messages in a fun way into my classes, including the value of regular squatting, balancing on one leg and breathing exercises. \n\"We were not so keen on taking cold showers, though do advocate power naps, eating dark chocolate and green tea!\n\"We are committed to keeping his legacy going during our exercise classes and will continue to promote healthy living in everything we do.\n\"His messages have brought us many laughs and smiles.\" \nShe added that during her most recent class - on Monday morning - each exercise was \"a tribute to the amazing Michael Mosley\". \n\nJennifer Clark, from Wagga Wagga, Australia, said the TV presenter had become \"a fixture\" in her life.\n\"Dr Mosley was passionate, vulnerable and always brought a smile. He was human and I could identify with him,\" she said.\n\"When I carry out my sleep plan, wake at 3am, do my deep breathing exercises, perhaps take melatonin - I feel Dr Mosley has been here before.\" \nGlenis Shaw, from New Zealand, said: \"He was my absolute hero. He taught me how to eat properly, how to lose weight, which I had been accumulating all my life. \n\"He taught me how to be healthy. I owe him so very much. We have all lost someone very special.\"  \nDr Mosley had reversed his own type 2 diabetes through diet and exercise - with others choosing to follow his example. \nClaire Yates, from Buxton, Derbyshire, said Dr Mosley saved her life - she lost both parents within 24 hours in 2018 and \"didn't want to die young\". \nHaving been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, she said she struggled to maintain her blood sugar levels and \"was awake all the time\". \nIt was while awake at midnight that she found his blood sugar diet book. \n\"Within weeks, my blood sugars had dramatically improved. I lost 33lb in eight weeks and came off all medication,\" said Claire, who now follows his maintenance plan. \nThe 48-year-old met Dr Mosley twice on his tours, most recently in February. \n \"I thanked him for everything he had done,\" she said. \"He was an amazing man, with so much knowledge.\n\"He made everything accessible, and not at all daunting. I'm 50 now and I'm healthier than when I was turning 40.\"\nShe described him as a \"legend of a man\", adding: \"I feel like I knew him, even though I didn't. He had so much work left to do and so much life to live - it's a tragedy.\"\n\nLesley Cottrell, from North Somerset, said: \"I was diagnosed as being on the verge of type 2 diabetes but then I found Michael's book the 800 diet and it changed my life.\n\"So much so that my GP was astounded and wanted to use me as a role model for others in my situation.\n\"Ever since I\u2019ve followed everything he\u2019s done related to health and have all his books.

He was willing to experiment and be so relatable to so many of us.\" \n\nSimon Strutt from Holmer Green, Buckinghamshire, said Dr Mosley and his wife Clare Bailey Mosley had \"quite probably saved me from something serious\" with their books. \nPreparing to undertake Dr Mosley's fasting plan, he bought a blood pressure monitor, as advised in the accompanying book - and found his levels were so high, he was advised to call an ambulance. \n\"Thank the Lord and Michael and his book for the BP machine purchase,\" he said, explaining his readings had come down after 10 days of the diet. \"I've recommended the books and a BP machine to all my family and friends.\" \nOne reader, Charles, said: \"Although we never knew him personally, his death is like losing a perceptive, utterly honest and reliable friend. \n\"He understood our shared human weaknesses and never shied away from describing them truthfully, but he was always gentle as he reflected our frailties back to us, so we could take control of them. \n\"I genuinely feel as if I have lost a friend.\"  \nMay East, from Edinburgh, wrote: \"Dr Mosley's Just One Thing podcast changed my life in so many ways. \n\"I drink more water than ev",

    "Oil giant BP has tightened rules on workplace relationships after its former boss was dismissed for failing to disclose details about his personal relationships with colleagues.\nSenior managers must now report any intimate relationships that have taken place with colleagues in the last three years.\nAny employees who fail to adhere to the new rules may face disciplinary action.\nBP said the update to its conflict of interest policy was scheduled for review this year.\nAbout 4,500 staff at managerial level have been asked to submit any reports in the next three months \"whether or not they feel they represent a conflict of interest\", the firm said.\nIt comes after its former chief executive Bernard Looney was found to have committed \"serious misconduct\" in failing to disclose workplace relationships.\nIn December, he was dismissed without notice and had to forfeit millions of pounds in share allowances and bonuses.\nThe firm said that Mr Looney had given \"inaccurate and incomplete assurances\" as part of an investigation into the relationships in 2022.\nMr Looney said in a statement in December 2023 that he was \"disappointed with the way this situation has been handled\".\nBP first launched a review of Mr Looney's relationships with colleagues in 2022 following an anonymous tip-off.\nAt the time, the company said Mr Looney disclosed \"a small number of historical relationships with colleagues prior to becoming [chief executive]\" and it found no breach of company conduct.\nMr Looney gave assurances then about disclosing the past relationships, as well as his future behaviour.\nThe board later said it had, however, received similar allegations, prompting another review.\nOn Monday, the company said that it had updated its conflict of interest policy after looking at comparable organisations and good industry practice.\nPreviously, employees were only required to disclose and record family or intimate relationships at work if they felt there could be a conflict of interest.\nThe new policy came into effect at the beginning of June and the changes reflect \"the influence that leaders have\",  BP added.\nRachel Suff, wellbeing and employee relations adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), said that formal policies on relationships are more common in the US than in the UK.\nMany employers will take a \"common-sense approach\", but she said that any relationships between managers and employees would be a clear conflict of interest and should be reported as they could create risks around confidentiality and fairness.\nMr Looney had spent his career at BP, which he joined in 1991 as a drilling engineer.\nBorn in Ireland and raised on a farm, he became a member of its executive team in 2010.\nHe had presented himself as more approachable, posting pictures of smiling employees on Instagram when he took over as chief executive in 2020.\nHowever, he faced scrutiny for watering down targets on cutting net carbon emissions.\nHis departure from BP also came at a time when executives at high-profile organisations such as the CBI faced questions over their personal behaviour.\nFor senior managers in particular, \"it's vital that their behaviour is respectful and professional at all times\", Ms Suff added.",
    "Energy creation and transportation has been a talking point in Suffolk for many years and it's an issue the political parties are having to address. \nThere are many plans to build infrastructure in the county, including new nuclear power, offshore wind, pylons and cables.\nSome local communities were unhappy about the potential impacts. \nHow big an issue is it for those who live there and what do the politicians have to say about it?\nPat Dorsey lives in Sizewell, close to where a new nuclear power station is planned. \nShe said more planning was needed from the government, and added: \"They are rushing through to try and get to net zero, they're going to completely to ruin the whole of Suffolk and Norfolk.\"\nShe wanted to see an offshore grid that connected to brownfield sites closer to London.\nRufus and Reet Gilday said they supported renewable energy in principle but were worried about onshore infrastructure, particularly a new planned substation at the village of Friston.\nMr Gilday said: \"It's going to be the size of aircraft hangar in the middle of a farmer's field.\"\nBarry Spivack of Rendlesham said the UK should focus on developing renewable energy technologies to \"minimise fossil fuels, create jobs and also sell them to other countries\".\nJoseph Sander, who also lives in Rendlesham, said he was generally in favour of nuclear power but \"new construction is going to be really expensive and take a while, so I'd rather more wind and solar energy\".\nConservative candidate Therese Coffey, said she was \"happy for Sizewell C to go ahead\".\nShe added: \"I want to see the connections that are being made, particularly for the offshore wind and interconnectors, to be closer to London. \n\"I know it matters because we need to make sure we keep our greenfields when there are brownfields elsewhere; it will cost more money for the developers but I think it matters so much.\" \nJulian Cusack is standing for Green Party. He said: \"I'm hugely in favour of the development of North Sea offshore wind -  I do think that we need to see more onshore wind as well and community energy schemes.\"\nOn bringing energy onshore, Mr Cusack said: \"I'm convinced, from what I've read, that there is an offshore solution.\n\"I think pausing and having another rethink about it is what we're calling for.\"\nJenny Riddell-Carpenter is the Labour candidate for Suffolk Coastal. She said: \"We need to listen to the community and that it's brownfield first, not greenfield first; I think it's common sense\n\"With the projects that are moving ahead, Sizewell C, the decision has been made, we can't be complacent about where that investment goes, where the community fund goes.\n\"The benefit must be focussed on what's needed.\"\nJulia Ewart, standing for the Liberal Democrats, said communities in Suffolk had been taken advantage of.\nShe added: \"We live in a place that's not particularly demonstrative, they haven't got the skillset as a community because they're very kind and accommodating but this accommodation is too much.\" \nMs Ewart said Sizewell C was \"too expensive, carbon=heavy and nobody wants to pay for it.\"\nMatt Jackson is standing for Reform UK in the Suffolk Coastal constituency.\nHe was approached for his comments on energy infrastructure but has not yet replied. \nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Young musicians are being recruited to a town band to try to ensure its future is as successful as its past.\nPontardulais Town Band, in Swansea, is proud of its history, but is also aware of the importance of planning for the years ahead.\nThe band has set up an academy for brass players of all standards and ages to learn and make music.\nCornet player Charlotte, 11, has a message to other youngsters who may be thinking of joining a band: \"Just do it and try it. It's fun!\"\nJoseph, 14, a drummer in the academy, said: \"I want to carry on playing, and hopefully one day to get to the senior band.\"\nNeil Palmer, who has played with the band for more than 50 years, said: \"We're looking ahead.\n\u201cWe've got a lot of history, but we also want to make sure we have a great future.\"\nFormed in the late 19th century by workers in the tin, steel and coal industries, the band competes against the best at championship level in the UK.\nIn the band room the trophies and certificates are on display alongside photographs showing the early pioneers of brass band playing.\nBut there is also an effort to develop new players.\nRehearsal sessions are led by a team of experienced musicians and teachers and players are encouraged to attend summer schools and weekend workshops.\nThe academy started in 2022 and Alison Gent, director of Brass@bont Academy said there were now four bands, including beginners who play in the Funtastic band.\n\"It's all down to team work,\" she said.\n\"We are really lucky that some many of our senior players help us and the young people here on their musical journey by either coming along to play during practice, or to sit next to them and help with one-to-one tuition.\"\nWhile the big names in the Welsh band community such as Tredegar and the Cory Band have dominated the world rankings for the past decade, there is concern about a decline in bands playing in the lower sections.\nBrass band commentator and player Iwan Fox, who edits the website 4barsrest said: \"Section four is the foundation on which banding is based. It's like the apprenticeship.\n\u201cIf we don't invest in that the foundations will collapse.\"\nThe Welsh Regional Championships are one of eight regional qualifying competitions for the finals of the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain with about 40 bands competing across five sections.\nBut this year there was concern about a lack of entries in the fourth section when just three bands competed, leading to an urgent appeal for action.\nThis is what inspired Ms Gent to think of setting up a new band so \"we could start building a fourth section band for 2026 so that our young players have got somewhere to aspire to\".\nThe Welsh government has introduced a new music service offering children the opportunity to learn how to play instruments.\nA spokesman said its \"\u00a313m National Music Service gives every three to 16-year-old the opportunity to play a musical instrument. \nIt added: \"The service\u2019s work also includes supporting community music and strengthening engagement with the national youth ensembles.\n\u201cWe fund the arts through the Arts Council of Wales, who support organisations that help people get involved with making music, such as National Youth Arts Wales and T\u0177 Cerdd.\"\n",
    "Planning officials have recommended that a Highland cottage once owned by paedophile TV presenter Jimmy Savile be demolished and replaced.\nAllt-na-Reigh in Glen Coe has been repeatedly vandalised since Savile's death in his Leeds flat in 2011, and his years of exploiting hundreds of people, mostly vulnerable young women, came to light.\nThe property was one of a number he had owned.\nHighland Council planning officers have recommended granting permission for the site to be redeveloped when councillors meet to consider the application next week. \nThe site's new owner is the family of Harris Aslam, boss of Kirkcaldy-based convenience stores business Greens Retail Ltd.\nThey have said the redevelopment of Allt-na-Reigh would include honouring another of the cottage's former owners - the celebrated Scottish climber and inventor Dr Hamish MacInnes.\nDr MacInnes, who died in 2020, invented ice axes and also a stretcher that is used by mountain rescue teams all over the world.\nOutbuildings where the climber worked on his creations are to be redeveloped as an ancillary dwelling and named Hamish House.\nSavile owned the cottage for about 13 years, but some have expressed disappointment that his relatively short association with the property has overshadowed its longer history. \nThe little house is dwarfed by the spectacular scenery including the nearby Three Sisters ridges of the 1,150m (3,773ft) mountain Biden nam Bian.\nIts name, Allt-na-Reigh, roughly translates from its mangled Gaelic as \"burn of the slope\", a reference to the stream that rushes close by and down under a bridge on the A82.\nOver the years, the cottage was on a working croft, a small farm with a few cows.\nIt also served as a roadman's cottage with its occupant keeping the nearby road safe for travellers.\nBut Allt-na-Reigh is in a sorry state today.\nGraffiti covers the walls, the windows are smashed and a bicycle wheel has been thrown on to the roof.\nThe roof itself is damaged with tiles having been deliberately ripped off it.\nHighland Council's south planning applications committee will consider the proposed redevelopment on Tuesday 18 June.\nIt has been proposed to demolish the existing single storey house and replace it with a new four-bedroom one-and-a-half storey house, with a two storey rear section.\nThe two buildings would be linked by a single storey section with a flat grass roof.\nExternal materials to be used include natural stone walling with dark timber cladding and a grey zinc roof. \nThe outbuilding alteration also uses similar external finishes and retains some of the white walls.",
    "A woman who lost her cliff-edge bungalow to a tidal surge said she feared for her new home after it was battered by strong winds. \nThe Met Office issued a warning about \"unseasonably\" strong winds of up 50mph (80km/h) in north and east Norfolk and east Suffolk on Monday morning.\nThey caused power cuts in some villages near North Walsham, and has delayed the departure of a tall ship from Great Yarmouth.\nBryony Nierop-Reading, whose previous home in Happisburgh, Norfolk, was demolished in 2013, said: \"I've suffered from the sea, but not by a wind like this before. It just hurled everything around.\"\nShe described hearing a \"terrific blast of wind and a crash\" as she lay in bed in her current home in the village, about 20m (65ft) from the cliff.\n\"The wind had blown one of my bathroom windows open and knocked all the plants over on to the floor,\" she said.\n\"I was battling to get it shut and then I noticed my sun lounge outside was blowing about.\n\"It had ripped the door off and blown the window out and the chicken house was being lifted up and down and it's got chickens in it.\"\nEleven years ago, she and her cat had moved to safety on the night a third of her bungalow was left teetering over the cliff edge. It was knocked down a week later.\n\"I expected to live here safely to the end of my life but the wind and the sea combined are endangering this house now, and the council has said they may want to demolish this one and the one next door, before Christmas,\" she said. \n\"We hope not, but it's imminent.\n\"It's never been this bad at this time of year. It's just worry, all the time.\"\nShe said 10m (32ft) of nearby cliff had been lost in the past 18 months, with the village setting up a Save Happisburgh group to push for rock coastal defences.  \nElswhere, homes affected by power cuts had the service restored by mid morning.\nThe Spanish tall ship Gale\u00f3n Andaluc\u00eda, which has been visiting Great Yarmouth, postpone its departure to Tuesday because of the weather. \nThe Met Office said the winds could disrupt some travel, with delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes. \nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The family of a boy who was thrown from the 10th floor of London's Tate Modern art gallery have said they are \"proud of his progress\".\nThe French youngster was six when he was thrown from a balcony by teenager Jonty Bravery, then 17.\nThe boy, who was on holiday with his parents in August 2019 when he was attacked, survived a 100ft (30m) fall but suffered life-changing injuries, including a bleed on the brain and broken bones.\nHis family, who call him \"notre petit chevalier\" - our little knight - said in an update posted on a GoFundMe page that he had \"begun to choose activities for himself\".\nThe boy, who spent months in intensive care, is said to be gaining independence.\n\"He can go play in the garden with the dog, sit down to draw, build with his Legos, take a board game or read in his room,\" his family said.\n\"He is more careful in his movements and in his actions in general, which allows him to start helping in the house by feeding the dog, for example, or clearing his plate.\n\"He is very proud now to be able to open his shutters by himself and above all to finally access the refrigerator to serve himself his dessert.\"\nThe boy has gained strength on his left side, making him more stable when standing, his family said.\nThey said he had to work a lot harder than the other children in his class at school to keep up with lessons, but is continuing to \"progress\" and \"learn new concepts\".\nThe family added: \"His memory has greatly improved.

    "Guernsey Disability Alliance has called for the States to obtain the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and to make it a priority for the next term.\nThe UNCRPD is an international treaty which promotes, protects and ensures the rights of disabled people through legislation and the monitoring of government.\nThe convention's monitoring process is every four-to-five years and means that someone outside Guernsey's government can look at the island's policies and legislation. \nCarol Le Page, Social Policy Director at Guernsey Disability Alliance, said the convention would \"hold the government to account\".\nAindre Reece-Sheerin, an activist and professional disability access consultant, was involved in a road traffic accident almost 30 years ago, which left him a wheelchair user. \nMr Reece-Sheerin described the convention as a \"tick-box exercise\" which ensured that the island had met all of the requirements set out by the UN Convention. \nHe said if the island obtained the convention, it \"would be the final piece of the jigsaw after a very, very long battle\". \nMr Reece-Sheerin said it would give Guernsey international recognition and would be proof that the island DID comply with world standards on rights for disabled people. \nThe States of Guernsey said it \"continues to progress workstreams that deliver on [the convention's] objectives for the community and will help enable the extension of these conventions to Guernsey\".\nIt added: \"The next milestones this political term are the full implementation of Phase 1 of the legislative framework established in the States\u2019 Disability & Inclusion Strategy and proposals coming to the States\u2019 Assembly for Phase 2a.\"\nDeputy Peter Roffey, President of the Committee for Employment and Social Security (CfESS), said he would push for the next CfESS to consider the convention at the beginning of the next assembly.\nMr Roffey added: \"At that time, the CfESS will recommend a work programme under its mandate for 2026-2029\".\nMs Le Page said the UK government must be satisfied with the island's current Disability, Equality and Inclusion Strategy before extending the convention to Guernsey. \nThe island's first discrimination legislation was introduced in 2023.\nThe law criminalises discrimination on the grounds of disability, carer status, race, religion or belief and sexual orientation.\nIt covers areas including employment, the provision of goods and services, accommodation and membership of clubs and associations.\nShe said that the fundamentals of the convention were in place, but other aspects of the strategy needed to be implemented before the island was eligible for the convention. \nMs Le Page said the convention would ensure the on-the-ground work of the disability strategy continues to progress.\nShe said UNCPRD would make sure laws did not change and that \"policies don't discriminate\".\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "A few weeks ago, Douglas Ross was in his happy place - making life as difficult as possible for the SNP and the then first minister, Humza Yousaf.\nMr Yousaf badly miscalculated when he abruptly ended his party\u2019s formal power-sharing deal with the Greens.\nHe assumed they\u2019d still prop him up in government. He assumed incorrectly.\nThat soon became clear when Douglas Ross proposed a no confidence vote in Humza Yousaf and the Greens indicated they would not save the first minister.\nThe Scottish Tory leader had previously tried and failed to use this approach to oust Nicola Sturgeon. This time he claimed victory.\nPolitical fortunes can quickly shift and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened to Mr Ross. \nNow it is he who has hit the self-destruct button.\nHis miscalculation was to assume that he could abandon his pledge to leave Westminster at this election and focus on Holyrood and the 2026 campaign.\nHe made an 11th hour decision to become an election candidate and called it \u201cleading from the front\u201d. It turned out to be anything but.\nIn truth, it infuriated many of his Holyrood colleagues who believe their Scottish party leader must be primarily focused on the Scottish Parliament.\nSome are also very unhappy by the way David Duguid (who is seriously unwell) was unceremoniously dropped as the candidate in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East, making it possible for Douglas Ross to stand.\nA weekend row about the Scottish Tory leader\u2019s UK parliament travel expenses - over which he insists he has done nothing wrong - is unlikely to have strengthened his position.\nIf he\u2019s successful in securing what is notionally a Conservative seat (the constituency has been newly created in a boundary review) he has said he will stand down as an MSP.\nWhat if he is unsuccessful in the election? It is hard to see how he could credibly claim to be a committed Highland list MSP when he seems so relaxed about giving up that position.\nRoss previously quit Holyrood for Westminster in 2017 and now appears to be gambling all on retaining a Westminster seat.\nUntil this election he was MP for Moray, having ousted the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson in 2017 and holding the seat in 2019.\nTogether with duties at Holyrood and as an accredited football linesman - he became known as \u201cthree jobs\u201d.\nIn truth, Douglas Ross has always seemed more comfortable in the UK parliament where for a time he served as a Scotland office minister under Boris Johnson.\nHe quit the Johnson government over the prime minister\u2019s refusal to sack the special adviser Dominic Cummings for his infamous Covid trip to Barnard Castle.\nThat seems like a lifetime ago. \nHe would later call on Boris Johnson to resign over his lack of candour about Covid parties in Downing Street.\nThat demand was temporarily withdrawn because of the outbreak of war in Ukraine.\nHe was teased by political opponents about his flip-flopping over his position on Johnson, just as they will tease him now for flip-flopping over which parliament he really wants to serve in.\nThe mess the Scottish Tories are in is a gift to their opponents.\nIt is a much weaker position than he might have imagined being in ahead of BBC Scotland\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate on Tuesday.\nHe is now the very temporary leader of the party from Scotland with the second largest number of seats at Westminster.\nHe has also given the party he most loves to hammer - the SNP - an unexpected gift.\nAll this distracts attention from the SNP\u2019s own difficulties in a campaign where they are under huge pressure from a revived Labour party.",

That would have been on pure natural ability \u2013 it wasn\u2019t my doing, it wasn\u2019t that I had trained her.\"\nShe said the school community is \"delighted\" after Ciara's success.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t start out as an athlete \u2013 she was a camogie player and we didn\u2019t know where that would go, but she\u2019s coachable,\" she added.\n\"She has had this great success that everybody can see and that will inspire lo",
    "A family left homeless after a fire destroyed their property said they have \"lost everything\".\nThe fire broke out at about 15:19 BST on Sunday on Buckingham Drive in Chapel St Leonards.\nTwo of McCorley Booth and Chelsea Moore's three young children were playing in the conservatory when they realised their home was on fire.\nAccording to Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, the incident was caused accidentally from materials in a neighbour's garden.\nMr Booth said the family had no contents insurance and the experience was \"heart-wrenching\".\nA crowdfunding campaign has raised nearly \u00a33,000 in under 24 hours.\n\"It's heart-wrenching.

    "Maureen Crossan has been caring for her husband Patrick since he was diagnosed with Parkinson's at the age of 50.\n\"Being a carer isn't something I would have seen myself being at such a young age,\u201d she said.\n\"You're constantly looking out for any new symptoms as things progress so differently for different people and that can be stressful\".\nShe was speaking after a report indicated those caring for people with Parkinson\u2019s are struggling to look after them properly.\nThe Parkinson's: Who Cares? report found that carers were \"fighting against the tide\" and \"mentally and physically tired\".\nThe Department of Health said it recognised the \"crucial role\" that unpaid carers have and acknowledged the \"importance of supporting carers to look after their mental health and wellbeing\".\nMaureen Crossan told BBC News NI that being a carer means \"always being on alert\".\nShe believes that \"greater flexibility and education about Parkinson's\" and an \"understanding from the health minister\" is needed in Northern Ireland.\nShe told the BBC that Patrick hasn't been able to meet his consultant this year and that while there are specialist nurses throughout Northern Ireland, they can be \"difficult to get an appointment with\".\nThe 'Parkinson's: Who Cares?' report was launched to mark the start of Carers Week at Stormont. \nParkinson's UK has said the report makes for \"difficult reading\" and that the \"depth of difficulties\" faced everyday by carers is \"stark\". \nParkinson's is a degenerative condition which affects how your brain communicates with the muscles in the body.\nThe three main symptoms of Parkinson's are a tremor, slowness of movement and muscle stiffness. \nA person with Parkinson's can also experience a wide range of psychological problems.\nIn the UK, about 153,000 people are already living with the illness.\nIn 2023, it was estimated that more than 4,000 of those were in Northern Ireland.\nSarah McCully Russell, of Parkinson\u2019s UK in Northern Ireland, said: \"Time and time again, we heard that carers wanted people living with Parkinson\u2019s to have access to an improved health care system.\n\"This would help the person they care for to live well with their condition, which would in turn reduce the stress and pressure faced by carers.\n\u201cDespite their daily tasks and frustrations, it was their loved ones who were firmly in their minds.\"\nParkinson's UK has asked for a plan to support the implementation of the review's recommendations, alongside the financial commitment required.\nThe charity has also called on the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure the Regional Review of Neurology is completed as soon as possible.\nThe Department of Health said that a \"wide range of issues relating to carers\" were highlighted in the Reform of Adult Social Care consultation and that \"several actions were proposed to address these issues\".\nThe department added that mental health services in Northern Ireland are provided \"in line with the regional stepped care model\" and are \"available to everyone\".\n\"All who need care and treatment, including carers, will be provided with services that are clinically appropriate\".\nGoing forward, Maureen said it would be helpful to make it easier to contact GPs. \n\"You have to ring before 10 o\u2019clock in the morning just to get an appointment,\" she said.\n\"Often with somebody with Parkinson\u2019s, you\u2019re getting them up, you\u2019re getting their medication, you\u2019re looking after them and you\u2019re having to sit with a phone and try and get through to a doctor.\"\nShe is also having difficulty getting prescriptions, and said that the lack of medication is \"stressful\" and \"mentally exhausting\".\n\u201cYou\u2019re now really having to go four times to the pharmacist because they can\u2019t get the medication in, so you\u2019re backwards and forwards. \n\"If medication stops for a person with Parkinson\u2019s, it\u2019s detrimental to their condition and then to the person who is looking after them.\" \n\u201cYou know it\u2019s not enough now to say there\u2019s delays with medication. Why are there delays? What are they going to do about it?\".",
    "Scottish prisons are in crisis and risk breaching inmates' human rights, according to a new official report. \nHolyrood's Public Audit Committee has called on the government to carry out an urgent review of the prison system.\nIt follows recent warnings from within the service about overcrowding and a crumbling estate.\nAbout 550 prisoners are to be released at the end of June to help release pressure on Scotland's jails. \nIn the 46-page report, the auditor general said the Scottish government and prison service could face financial risk from legal challenges by prisoners as a result of the poor conditions.\nThe committee heard from Scottish Prison Service (SPS) chief executive Teresa Medhurst that seven prisons were \"on the brink\" and at \"red status\" because of overcrowding.\nShe said HMP Barlinnie, which was designed to house 987 inmates, was relied on for \u201csurge capacity\u201d and as of 13 November 2023 its population was 1,406.\nGiving evidence for the report, the chief inspector of prisons said Barlinnie was \"at risk of catastrophic failure\" and although HMP Greenock was one of the best prisons and had many \"wonderful\" aspects, the buildings \"should be bulldozed\".\n\"The committee is extremely concerned at the continued deterioration of significant parts of the prison estate since its predecessor committee published its report in 2020,\" the report said. \n\"We ask that the Scottish government urgently sets out a clear timetable for addressing those parts of the prison estate that are no longer fit for purpose.\"\nIt said there were concerns about how human rights issues could \"present a live risk for the Scottish government and the Scottish Prison Service, as well as a future financial risk\" and recommended that a review should be a carried out. \nLooking at the GEOAmey prisoner transfer contract, the committee found there was no single factor responsible for recent failings - which have seen prisoners miss court appearances and medical appointments\nIt said  \"staffing issues, an increasing prison population with more complex health needs and an increased court capacity aimed at addressing court backlogs\" had all contributed to the problems. \nThe report also raised concerns about how the prisons could meet the needs of an ageing prison population and whether \"elderly and infirm prisoners who are of limited risk to society due to their deteriorating health\" should remain in prison.\nAmong other concerns, it noted that Scotland's newest prison, HMP Stirling, does not have any cells with doors wide enough for a bariatric wheelchair, a heavy-duty type of chair used for obese inmates.\nThe union representing Prison Officers said they had been raising many of the issues  highlighted in the report for years.\nPhil Fairlie, assistant secretary of the Prison Officers Association, said they were pleased to see the \"powerful report\". \n\"Scotland\u2019s prisons are dangerously overcrowded, understaffed and as the chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service has said, some are not fit for purpose and on the brink,\" he said. \n\"This is placing huge pressures and strains on our members and has the capacity to compromise the human rights of prisoners.\"\nMr Fairlie added: \"In absence of a dramatic change to sentencing policy, or the purpose of prisons in this country, then what we need is sustained investment to provide additional staffing and capital investment, to ensure the prison estate can meet the needs of society.\"\nJim Watson, a lecturer in criminal justice at the University of the West of Scotland, said overcrowding was a long-term problem and could lead to re-offending. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland, he said: \"Politicians are very good at identifying problems but the thing about the Public Audit Committee report is there was no solutions put forward.\"\nHe said this was a \"sticking plaster approach\" to the prison service's problems and there should be a re-think about the \"fundamental reasons behind the reason why this is happening\". \n\"It's not as strategic as it could have been - they have been very restrained in what they are proposing and it's not going to achieve a lot before they are back in the same position again,\" he said. \nHe said that Scotland could end up with a service that is \"more restrictive and more coercive, and actually causes more harm to individuals going through it\". \nHe added: \"We move away from that rehabilitation that needs to be the core of what prison is about.\" \nA spokesman for the Scottish government said it was \"committed to ensuring that the human rights of the people in our prisons are respected, protected and fulfilled\".\nHe said: \"Whilst the Scottish Prison Service is managing a high and complex prison population under considerable pressure, the Scottish government and SPS work closely together to address any issues.\"\nA spokesman for the SPS said: \"We fully recognise the importance of ensuring prison infrastructure is fit for purpose and meets the rights and needs of all those who live and w",
    "There are calls for the cap on the amount people can earn while getting carers' allowance in Guernsey to be reduced.\nCarers Guernsey director Peter Harwood said the household cap of \u00a3113,000 is \"too high\". \nSuzette March who cares for her parents and husband said that, because she shares caring responsibilities with her sister, she did not qualify for the allowance. \nThe Employment and Social Security (ESS) President Peter Roffey said he was \"happy to discuss the idea\".\nMrs March said at times being a carer had been \"overwhelming\" and the support of Carers Guernsey was \"invaluable\".\nThree years ago, Mrs March's father had a stroke and her stepmother Mary had bladder cancer, which led to her leg being amputated. \n\"Being a carer is a big commitment, it's meant going to the hospital in Southampton, going to London for three weeks, working with my sister and brother.\" \nHer stepmother died in April and recently Suzette's father had moved into a care home. \nShe turned to Carers Guernsey in January when she was \"desperate\". \n\"It's hard, I don't think people know how hard it is to look after two people, and then go home to someone else who needs looking after as they have Parkinson's disease.\n\"There was too much going on and the support I received from Carers Guernsey has been invaluable.\"\nFormer Chief Minister Peter Harwood believed there needed to be a grown-up discussion about how carers are financially supported locally. \nBut he was concerned this assembly was not mature enough to make what he described as \"extremely difficult and unpopular decisions\".\nOn the issue of changing the cap for carers' allowance, he said: \"I don't know why it is capped so high, but we certainly don't want to go down to where the UK is.\"\nAlongside the calls from Carers Guernsey, Mr Roffey was keen to stress the need for changes to how long-term care of the elderly was funded. \nMr Roffey is part of group of politicians looking at how long-term care insurance can be funded moving forward, with people locally living longer.\n\"This is such a big social issue. Frankly, if we flunk it, we ought to be ashamed,\" he said.\n\"If this assembly kicks it onto the next one, it leads to an exhausted long-term care insurance fund, and people paying in for decades and nothing being left. That's just not acceptable.\"\nHe said he was concerned that, without a decision by the States on how long-term care would be funded, there would not be enough investment in care homes locally.\nIt's becoming increasingly clear a sustainable decision on funding for people's long-term care is unlikely to be made this political term. \nWith almost a year until the Guernsey's general election on 18 June 2025, there's a row behind the scenes between the three committees involved about how the proposals should be put forward.\nThere's an acceptance that taking a percentage of people's properties to pay for long-term care will be incredibly unpopular, which is why some States members want nothing to do with the idea. \nIt means it's likely this issue, which was effectively punted into the long grass in 2020, could be forced into the next assembly's in-tray.\nIt's why it's arguably quite politically brave of Carers Guernsey to talk about possibly stopping some carers from receiving an allowance, in an effort to redistribute that money to others who they believe may need it more. \nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "A court in the United States has found multinational fruit company Chiquita Brands International liable for financing a Colombian paramilitary group.\nThe group, the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), was designated by the US as a terrorist organisation at the time.\nFollowing a civil case brought by eight Colombian families whose relatives were killed by the AUC, Chiquita has been ordered to pay $38.3m (\u00a330m) in damages to the families.\nChiquita said in a statement that it intended to appeal against the jury's verdict, arguing that there was \"no legal basis for the claims\".\nThe jury in the case, which was heard in a federal court in South Florida, found Chiquita responsible for the wrongful deaths of eight men killed by the AUC.\nThe AUC engaged in widespread human rights abuses in Colombia, including murdering people it suspected of links with left-wing rebels.\nThe victims ranged from trade unionists to banana workers.\nThe case was brought by the families after Chiquita pleaded guilty in 2007 to making payments to the AUC. \nDuring the 2007 trial, it was revealed that Chiquita had made payments amounting to more than $1.7m to the AUC in the six years from 1997 to 2004.\nThe banana giant said that it began making the payments after the leader of the AUC at the time, Carlos Casta\u00f1o, implied that staff and property belonging to Chiquita's subsidiary in Colombia could be harmed if the money was not forthcoming.\nLawyers for Chiquita argued that the company had no choice but to pay the AUC to protect its Colombian employees from violence.\nBut the plaintiffs argued that the company formed \"an unholy alliance with the AUC\" at a time when Chiquita was expanding its presence in regions controlled by the AUC.\nThe regular payments continued even after the AUC was designated by the US as a foreign terrorist organisation in 2001. \nWhile the AUC claimed to have been created to defend landowners from attacks and extortion attempts by left-wing rebels, the paramilitary group more often acted as a death squad for drug traffickers.\nAt its height, it had an estimated 30,000 members who engaged in intimidation, drug trafficking, extortion, forced displacement and killings. \nIt also launched brutal attacks on villagers they suspected of supporting left-wing rebels.\nThe group demobilised in 2006 after reaching a peace deal with the government, but some of its members went on to form new splinter groups which continue to be active. \nThe class-action lawsuit against Chiquita which ended on Monday focussed on nine cases, which were chosen out of hundreds of claims against the banana company. \nThe jury found that the AUC was responsible for eight of the nine murders examined as part of the lawsuit.\nThe jury also ruled that Chiquita had knowingly provided substantial assistance to the AUC, to a degree sufficient to create a foreseeable risk of harm.\nChiquita said in a statement released after the verdict that the situation in Colombia was \"tragic for so many, including those directly affected by the violence there, and our thoughts remain with them and their families\".\n\"However, that does not change our belief that there is no legal basis for these claims,\" it added. \nThe company said it remained confident that its legal position would ultimately prevail. \nAgnieszka Fryszman, one of the leading lawyers for the plaintiffs, meanwhile praised the families she represented, saying that they had \"risked their lives to come forward to hold Chiquita to account, putting their faith in the United States justice system\".\nShe added that \"the verdict does not bring back the husbands and sons who were killed, but it sets the record straight and places accountability for funding terrorism where it belongs: at Chiquita's doorstep\".\nAnother lawyer for the Colombian families, Leslie Kroeger, said that \u201cafter a long 17 years against a well-funded defence, justice was finally served\u201d.\nA second case against Chiquita brought by another group of plaintiffs is due to start on 15 July.

    "A Thai film about a young man caring for his dying grandmother as he vies for her fortune has struck a chord in South East Asia, where TikTokers' teary responses are going viral. \nHow to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies has topped box offices across the region since it was released in April.\nThe film follows M, who is plotting to win an inheritance from his cancer-stricken grandmother, but begins to question his motives as he grows closer to her. \nThe story appears to have deeply resonated with moviegoers, who have been sharing emotional videos of themselves before and after watching the film. \n\"Running over to hug my grandma now! Exceptionally touching film... This movie hit even harder because it reminded me of my own relationship with my grandma,\" wrote a TikTok user ianjeevan.\nYoung people have posted online about how they were especially moved by scenes where the grandmother was in pain and kept calling out for her late parents to \u201ctake [me] with them\u201d. \n\"I cried so much that all of my make up was gone after the movie,\" one TikToker said, referring to those scenes. \nAnother, diariesofswan, said: \"After the movie, cry. Just cry, when you miss someone, whom you can't even hug or hear their voice anymore.\"\nThe movie was inspired by scriptwriter Thodsapon Thiptinnakorn's relationship with his grandmother. And it is director Pat Boonnitipat's first feature film. He told the BBC he was \"really surprised\" by the overwhelming response, and that the movie's appeal lay in its ability to tap into the \"conflicted\" nature of family relationships.  \nPart-dark comedy and part-tear-jerker, the story revolves around a dysfunctional family that uses the matriarch\u2019s diagnosis to scheme for her fortune.\nM, played by 24-year-old singer-actor Putthipong Assaratanakul, is one of them. The college dropout moves in with his ailing grandmother, ostensibly to help care for her. \nWell aware of her family's intentions, the matriarch \u2013 M\u2019s grandmother, played by  Usha Seamkhum \u2013 nevertheless loves and accepts her children. \nMs Seamkhum, 78, has recieved rave reviews for her acting debut. Film critic James Marsh called her \u201cabsolutely sensational\u201d as the \u201cfigurehead of this morally questionable rabble\u201d.\nOther than her, the characters are far from likeable - Mr Marsh described them as \"loathsome\" even. Yet this tale of scheming family versus loveable grandmother appears to have touched many. \n\"We love them, we also hate them, but we also have to live with them. And sometimes we neglect them. Perhaps this movie reflects the many, many angles of that complexity of a big family,\" director Pat Boonnitipat said.\nSome of those who watched the film said it reminded them to spend time with their loved ones, while others said it rekindled memories of their grandparents or parents who had died. \nOne TikTok user advised people to \"bring many boxes of tissue if you are going to watch this movie\". Some clips online show staff handing out tissues to moviegoers as they walk into the cinema. \nMalaysia's largest cinema GSC has marketed the film as a must-watch for people who \"need a good cry\", while SM Cinema in the Philippines had staff giving out tissues outside theatres showing the film. \nTicket sales in Thailand crossed 250m baht ($6.9m, \u00a35.3m) in the first 14 days of its release, making it 11th highest grossing Thai film. \nIt has also become the most successful Asian movie to hit screens in Indonesia, and the highest-grossing Thai movie in Singapore and Malaysia.",
    "The US has lifted its long-standing ban on weapons supplies and training to Ukraine's Azov brigade, whose origins were mired in controversy over alleged links to far-right groups.\nA state department spokesman told the BBC a vetting process \"found no evidence of gross violations of human rights\" by the brigade. \nThe Azov brigade, now a unit within Ukraine's National Guard, hailed the move, saying Russia's \"lies... received a devastating blow\".\nMoscow condemned the decision, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the US was \"even prepared to flirt with neo-Nazis\" to suppress Russia.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made false claims about a \"neo-Nazi regime\" in Kyiv to try to justify first the annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula and backing of pro-Moscow fighters in the east in 2014, and then his full-scale invasion launched in 2022.\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity, the state department spokesman told the BBC that Washington applied a vetting process to the National Guard of Ukraine's 12th Special Forces Azov Brigade and \"found no evidence of gross violations of human rights committed\".\n\"Russian disinformation attempts to conflate Ukraine's National Guard Unit of 12th Special Forces Brigade Azov with a militia formed to defend Ukraine against Russia's invasion in 2014, called the 'Azov Battalion',\" the spokesman added.\nUnder America's \"Leahy Law\", sponsored in 1997 by then-Senator Patrick Leahy, a finding that a foreign military unit has committed gross violations of human rights means it can be cut off from US military assistance.\nThe US government says it considers torture, extrajudicial killing, enforced disappearance and rape as such types of violations when implementing the law.\nReacting to the US decision, the Azov brigade said in a statement: \"The lies about Azov, which the Kremlin regime have been spreading in the West for years, received a devastating blow today.\n\"Receiving Western weapons and training from the US will not only increase the combat capability of Azov, but most importantly, will contribute to the preservation of the lives and health of the personnel of the brigade.\"\nA volunteer militia battalion called Azov was originally set up in May 2014 to fight Russian-backed forces in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Later that year it was briefly incorporated as a separate regiment in Ukraine's interior ministry before being transferred to the National Guard. \nSome members of the original battalion were reported to have had links to far-right and ultra-nationalist groups at the time - but a number of them, including the first commander, later left the unit. \nThe US banned the regiment from receiving US weapons for the alleged links to the far right. \nIn 2016, a UN report accused the Azov regiment of \"looting of civilian property, leading to displacement\" in eastern Ukraine.\nThe current leadership of the Azov brigade says its members have no ties to far-right organisations or any other extremist groups - a claim that has not been independently verified.\nAzov fighters are seen by many in Ukraine as national heroes for defending for months the southern city of Mariupol from a brutal Russian assault. \nThe port on the Sea of Azov was eventually taken by Moscow in May 2022.\nMany Azov soldiers are still being held by Russia as prisoners of war, amid accusations that the Ukrainians have been subjected to torture in captivity.",

    "President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November.\nThe blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump\u2019s platform.\nOver more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts.\nThe Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April last year, and liberal opposition has been ramping up as opinion polls show a tight race between President Biden, a Democrat, and former President Trump, a Republican.\nIt is common for Washington DC think tanks to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cideas factory\u201d during his presidency.\nBut on Tuesday, California congressman Jared Huffman announced a Stop Project 2025 Task Force.\nMr Huffman said: \u201cProject 2025 is more than an idea, it's a dystopian plot that\u2019s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will.\n\u201cWe need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\nHeritage said Mr Biden\u2019s party was scaremongering with \u201can unserious, mistake-riddled press release\u201d.\n\u201cHouse Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,\u201d said Kevin Roberts, the foundation\u2019s president.\n\u201cUnder the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.\u201d\nThe\u00a0Project 2025 document\u00a0outlines four pillars: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation\u2019s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely.\nIt is one of several policy papers for\u00a0a platform broadly known as Agenda 47\u00a0- so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won.\nHeritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations.\nHere\u2019s an outline of several key proposals.\nProject 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control \u2013 a controversial idea known as \u201cunitary executive theory\u201d.\nIn practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas.\nThe proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees.\nThe document labels the FBI a \u201cbloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization\u201d and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.\n\nIncreased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border \u2013 one of Trump\u2019s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document. \nHowever, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.  \nOther proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium. \nThe document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to \"stop the war on oil and natural gas\u201d. \nCarbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security.\nThe paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports.\nBut the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency.\nProject 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban.\nHowever, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market.\nUnder the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down.\nThe document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls \u201cwoke propaganda\u201d.\nIt proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including \u201csexual orientation\", \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d, \u201cgender equality\u201d, \"abortion\" and \u201creproductive rights\u201d.\nThe Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency.\nSince the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar p",
    "Competitive eating star Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut has been told he cannot join America's premiere hot dog contest after striking a deal with a vegan brand. \nHis removal from next month's Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest in New York came after he agreed sponsorship from Impossible Foods, a vegan hot dog maker in competition with the Nathan's brand.\n\"We are devastated to learn that Joey Chestnut has chosen to represent a rival brand that sells plant-based hot dogs rather than competing in the 2024 Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest,\" Major League Eating (MLE) said on Tuesday.\nMLE added that Mr Chestnut was welcome to rejoin the competition, but only if he dropped his vegan sponsorship.\n\"Joey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at the Nathan\u2019s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest,\" the statement said. \n\"We hope he returns when he is not representing a rival brand.\"\nMr Chestnut has won the Nathan's contest, which is televised in the US, 16 times.\nThe rules of the contest, which is attended by some 40,000 people annually, require competitors to eat as many hot dogs (and buns) as they can in the span of 10 minutes. \nMr Chestnut, 40, holds the world record for hot dog eating, having scoffed a whopping 76 at the 2021 contest. \nHe also holds a variety of other eating records, including downing 141 hard-boiled eggs in eight minutes, 23 meat pies in 10 minutes, 182 chicken wings in 30 minutes, and 25.5 ice cream sandwiches, also known as choc ices, in six minutes.\nMr Chestnut said on social media he was \"gutted\", when he learned of the ban, adding he had \"been training to defend [his] title\". \n\"To set the record straight, I do not have a contract with MLE or Nathans and they are looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with,\" he said. \nMLE said it and Nathan's \"went to great lengths\" to accommodate Joey, but that it seemed he and his managers \"prioritised a new partnership\".\nThe Fourth of July competition has taken place every year since Polish immigrant Nathan Handwerker opened his stand on Coney Island in 1916.\nThe story goes that on 4 July 1916 - the year Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs was founded - four European immigrants were arguing about who among them was more American. They decided to settle it with a hot dog eating contest.\nHowever, the true origins of the contest remain shrouded in mystery.",
    "Campaigners have gathered in a Lincolnshire village to protest against plans for a quarry.\nBreedon is consulting on plans to establish a new sand and gravel quarry near West Deeping, near Market Deeping.\nMore than 100 people took part in the demonstration on Monday amid concerns about the proximity of the site to homes.\nBreedon says the project \u2013 designed to replace a neighbouring quarry \u2013 would benefit the local economy, protect jobs and \"deliver biodiversity gain\".\nGlenn Fuller, chairman of West Deeping Parish Council, claimed that 50% of land in the parish had already been mined and the new quarry would increase that figure to 75%.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not fair to the villagers and their quality of life,\" he said.\n\"We moved down here because we wanted to live in the countryside, and they are turning the countryside into an industrial plant.\u201d\nThe protest coincided with a consultation event at the village hall, but some campaigners claimed they had been denied access, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nBreedon said the event provided an opportunity for people to view and provide feedback on its proposals. However, visitors had been required to register in advance.\nAshley Baxter, the leader of South Kesteven District Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit bizarre that you organise a consultation event... and then you deny them access to the exhibition.\n\u201cLetting in 25 people at a time is mainly about divide and rule so they can manage who has been in and what information is given.\u201d\nAccording to Breedon's consultation website, the benefits of the new quarry would include \"enhanced habitat restoration\" to improve biodiversity, and improved public rights of way.\nThe development would ensure there would be no loss of jobs, including in the supply chain, and it would deliver a \"needed supply of sand and gravel to local markets\", the website said.\nExtraction and restoration schemes would be \"sensitively designed\" and there would be support for local community schemes.\nThe consultation runs until 18 June.\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Ahead of the second series of House of the Dragon, a prequel to Game of Thrones, its stars have been speaking to the BBC about what to expect.\nBased on George RR Martin's epic fantasy novel A Song of Ice and Fire, House of the Dragon stars a collection of British talent, including Matt Smith, Emma D'Arcy and Olivia Cooke.\nThe second season of the HBO prequel picks up just days after the final events of the first season.\nWhile there is promise of more monumental battles and fiery dragon encounters, the new series presents a number of challenging situations, with the characters facing grief and revenge in the aftermath of earlier events.\nSeason two sees Westeros on the brink of a bloody civil war as the Green and Black Councils fight for King Aegon and Queen Rhaenyra respectively.\nThe climatic final events of season one have seen a number of changes to characters' motives in this next instalment.\nD'Arcy, who stars as Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, told BBC News that portraying both a grieving mother and a powerful ruler presented many obstacles, but that they relished the opportunity.\n\"You have no option,\" said D'Arcy. \"You have to have great stamina. It's a marathon. \n\"You come in with colour in your cheeks, and love and joy in your heart. But I love the epic nature of shooting six days a week, for 15 hour days, over six months.\"\nCooke, who plays Queen Alicent Hightower, called the season \"really challenging\". \n\"It's coming to terms with grief and trauma, and how do you play those and sustain that for a seven-month shoot, playing all the complexities within that?\" she said.\n\"She [Alicent] had all this power and then now becoming dowager queen. She's trying to figure out within this backdrop of guilt and shame - who she is if she can't rule from the shadows?\"\nIn House of the Dragon, the franchise's central struggle for power leads characters to do abhorrent things in order to claim the throne - something adored by the loyal fanbase.\nAsked if they thought their characters were terrible people, or good people who have terrible things placed upon them, D'Arcy said: \"I think they're all people trying to sustain themselves in a pretty terrible system.\n\"That system can cause those characters to do pretty awful things.\n\"The thing that I adore about Game of Thrones is you have such a complex, exciting, varied constellation of characters, and you're made to yearn to see those, to watch those collisions take place.\"\nTwo characters who fans will be eager to see back on screens are the mercurial Daemon Targaryen, played by Smith, and villainous Aemond Targaryen, portrayed by Ewan Mitchell.\nSpeaking on the waterlogged red carpet at a rainy UK premiere for season two, Smith said: \"We are delving back into the fractious world of the Targaryens and there is a lot of grief flying around, and that makes people act strange, it makes people vulnerable, it makes people mad.\"\nSmith's Daemon will face a struggle for power while caring for his now shattered family. \n\"He is tipping over into a mythic place of discomfort. He's in for a bit of a wild ride this year,\" Smith said.\nAsked how it felt playing a character so evil, Mitchell said it was \"horrible\", explaining: \"I don't like playing evil.\n\"As a character, Aemond possesses this facade, a shield of armour that he has manufactured over a number of years to hide his insecurities.\"\nBut he added: \"As an actor it is so enjoyable playing a character like Aemond and really dive into his multi-faced complexities.\"\nHouse of the Dragon was one of the few US productions that continued to shoot during last year's Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes.\nFor almost three months in 2023, industry writers and actors walked out in a dispute over fair pay and the use of artificial intelligence in the indsutry.\nBut the House of the Dragon cast did not take part because the show was mainly filmed in the UK under contracts overseen by British union Equity, rather than its striking US counterpart the Screen Actors Guild (SAG).\nThe show's writer Ryan Condal told the BBC it was a \"fraught period\", but a \"great privilege\" to keep the cast and crew employed.\n\"There was lots of labour strife,\" he said. \"We were lucky all of our scripts were done and we were already in production when when the writers' strike happened. \n\"The thing I was happy about was keeping our crew of 2,500 people employed. It was a very fraught time, and a lot of people went through really tough times, so just the fact that our crew could keep working was a real privilege.\"\nOlivia Cooke said the strikes period was \"strange\".\n\"It felt weird. It felt wonky,\" she said. \n\"A bunch of us are members of SAG, but we were under a different union. We sort of had to continue to work, otherwise we'd all get sued.\n\"We didn't feel good, but we were also aware that we were really lucky to be still shooting because a lot of cast and crew really relied on this job. It was really multifaceted and strange.\"\nEarly reviews of season two so far have been stro",
    "The future of the NHS and health was fiercely debated by party leaders in Scotland in Tuesday night's BBC Scotland debate.\nYet health is a devolved issue - meaning Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak will never have the power to deliver on their key promises to reduce waiting times and get the NHS back on track in Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland.\nThe simple reason is polling in Scotland regularly puts the NHS among the top three issues for voters, so parties inevitably put it front and centre as they publish their manifestos.\nYou saw that in the debate, with an audience member recounting her mother's experience of waiting for treatment - and each politician trying to answer what their party would do to improve the NHS.\nIn Scotland, the SNP government at Holyrood will continue to be accountable for the performance and priorities of the NHS after the election on 4 July.\nBut it's not the case that whoever holds the keys to Downing Street will have no role to play in the future of Scotland's health service. Just how far their responsibility extends is a matter of political debate.\nThe Scottish government gets a share of taxpayers' cash collected and then sent back in the form of a lump sum or block grant.\nAny UK government decision to award extra funding - or cuts - to the health service in England automatically sees an equivalent amount channelled north of the border.\nHowever, once the funding arrives in Edinburgh, the Scottish government is free to spend the money as it chooses. In the coming year it has committed nearly \u00a320bn to health and social care.\nThe most recent comparison available suggests Scotland spends 3% more per person than England in this area. This gap is much smaller than 25 years ago, when Scotland spent 22% more per head of population, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nMore money for the NHS may be on offer from Labour or the Conservatives, some of which will come north. But they are both taking aim at the SNP's record in running the health service, as they know First Minister John Swinney's candidates are the ones to beat to make election gains in Scotland.\nScottish ministers are proud to point out that it's the only UK nation to have avoided strike action by healthcare staff. It's a record the Scottish government want to defend. \nWhen nurses, paramedics and physiotherapists took industrial action in England, Northern Ireland and Wales, the Scottish government had already cut a deal costing \u00a3575m with unions that saw staff paid more than in other parts of the UK, with commitments to cut down hours and introduce legislation on safe staffing levels.\nAs England braces itself for another wave of junior doctors' strikes this month, patients in Scotland know they are safe from that, after the Scottish government set aside \u00a360m for a 2023/24 offer.\nDespite avoiding the disruption of strikes, the latest data showed NHS waiting lists in Scotland had reached a record size at the end of March, with 690,000 waits for planned outpatient or inpatient care.  \nAnd in contrast to England, Scotland has failed to fulfil a 2022 pledge to eliminate the longest waits. More than 80,000 procedures or appointments had a waiting time of over 12 months, and 8,000 over two years. \nBut Mark Dayan from the Nuffield Trust says there may be good reasons for this, and that Scotland's waiting times are not the worst in the UK. In fact, he says the NHS in Scotland and England are broadly similar when it comes to average waits for elective care. \nHe said: \"[It] suggests Scotland\u2019s NHS isn\u2019t targeting the longest waiters as aggressively, which may be justifiable as long as it means that the most clinically needy are at the front of the line.\n\"In both Scotland and England, roughly two thirds of patients are reaching the end of their wait for care within the 18 week benchmark. Northern Ireland\u2019s waiting times, despite some recent improvement, remain by far the longest in the UK. The average person waits nearly a year just for an outpatient appointment, whereas in England and Scotland that would be about three months.\u201d\nNeil Gray, the Scottish government's health secretary, has said the struggle with long waits in Scotland was down to a different \"tolerance of engagement\" with the private sector.\nBefore the pandemic, the Scottish government agreed to pay private providers for extra capacity under its Waiting Times Improvement Plan. In 2022/23, NHS Scotland spent \u00a3116m on external providers (0.7% of what it calls the frontline health budget), compared to a bill of \u00a311.5bn for the UK Department of Health (6.5%) -  nine times more, according to a Scottish government spokesman.\nIt's worth noting that members of the public in Scotland who face long waits appear increasingly willing to turn to the private sector. The Nuffield Trust found that the number of people going private for hospital treatment has risen 80% since 2019. In England that figure was up by just 20%, although it still remains highest relative to the size of ",
    "Many papers are leading on the Conservative election manifesto launch, which has promised \u00a317 billion in tax cuts if the party wins the General Election. \nThe Times picks up on Rishi Sunak's warning to wavering Tory voters that opting for Reform UK or the Liberal Democrats would hand power to Labour.  \nBut the paper's opinion column is not enthusiastic about Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's manifesto launch speech at Silverstone. It concludes the attempt to convey a sense of dynamism, by holding the event at a Formula One circuit, was a \"hard sell for a party 14 years in power\".\nThe i says there wasn't much in the speech to appeal to right-wing Conservatives. The paper concludes that \"the lack of any surprises in the document did little to allay concerns within the party that they are failing to make in-roads into Labour's twenty-point lead\".\nThe Sun is more positive, welcoming the launch and declaring that \"the battle lines are drawn\" between a \"Tory party promising tax cuts versus a Labour Party which refuses to do the same\".  The paper also commends Rishi Sunak for being honest about what it calls the Conservatives' \"patchy record\" in government.\nAccording to the Guardian, several think-tanks are questioning the detail of his plan for a \"\u00a317 billion pound tax giveaway\". The paper quotes the Institute For Fiscal Studies think tank stating that the package would be \"paid for by uncertain, unspecific and apparently victimless savings\".\nThe Daily Express highlights the prime minister's pledge that deportation flights to Rwanda would take off within days if the Conservatives were returned to office.  The paper's opinion column suggests that Mr Sunak \"stands alone in his determination to stop the boats\".\nThe Daily Mirror concentrates on the ITV interview which Mr Sunak gave after returning from the D-Day commemorations in France, which will air on Wednesday night. The paper highlights the fact that, when asked if he'd ever gone without anything, he responded that his family didn't have Sky TV when he was growing up.  \nThe Mirror's leader column argues that this is \"more excruciating proof of how he just does not understand the hardships that so many people are having to endure\".\nOn the front page of the Financial Times there are details of how, ahead of the US presidential election in November, Republican and Democrat fundraisers are seeking to woo wealthy Americans in the UK.  It reveals that two rival events are being held in London tonight - with tickets to the Republican one selling for as much as \u00a3100,000.\nThe Daily Mail suggests broadcaster Michael Mosley, who died while on holiday in Greece last week, had been invited to appear on the forthcoming series of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing. The paper thinks that would have been the \"perfect role\" for Michael Mosley who, it says, spoke \"knowledgeably and enthusiastically\" about the health benefits of dancing.\nFinally, the Daily Telegraph reports on new research from the US suggesting astronauts need to eat chocolate and drink red wine.  The paper explains that both contain flavanols, which are substances that can protect against the physical damage caused by space travel. \nThe paper's leader speculates that \"there may be some old space-dog who thinks he drives better after a few glasses of a decent claret\".\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "Football fans facing rising prices for replica England shirts have been buying fake kits online instead.\nThe England men's home shirt, launched in March, costs \u00a385 for adults and \u00a365 for children in the Football Association's official store.\nDan, from London, told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours this is \"heinously overpriced\" and says he has been buying fake shirts for his four children - which cost as little as \u00a311 - for 10 years.\nThe FA told the BBC that kit prices were set by manufacturer Nike. The company has not responded to requests to comment.\nThe BBC was unable to reach any of the fake replica kit manufacturers.\nAhead of the 2002 World Cup, an adult England shirt cost \u00a340. Adjusting for inflation using the Bank of England's calculator, it would cost \u00a371.65 in today\u2019s money. \nCompared to the current price of \u00a385, this is a rise of 18.6%.\nThe children\u2019s version, which cost \u00a330 in 2002, has increased by 21% in real terms.\nAnother version of the adult shirt in the FA's national team store costs \u00a3125.\nDan told the BBC he could get four fake shirts for the cost of one official version.\nHe said: \"If they were reasonably priced, I would 100% buy the genuine article.\n\"The simple fact is that the price of these things is just extortionate. I'm fortunate to be in a position where I can even afford the copies. \n\"I know there are people now who, unfortunately, are probably struggling even to buy those because money is so tight.\"\nThe latest edition of football magazine Mundial features a seller of counterfeit football shirts who used to make \u00a31,000 a week from his \"dirty little secret\".\nThe anonymous writer says an online shop now exists \"that uses my catalogue word for word - a beautifully ironic instance of a counterfeiter counterfeiting a counterfeiter\".\nThe magazine's editor Seb White described newer counterfeits as \"more realistic\" and said football shirts \"are as popular as they ever were\".\nHe said: \"Football shirts are under such demand that they can almost get away with the high price and people will pay it because they want to be seen in the latest thing.\n\"There's almost no limit to it now and, of course, kids put pressure on their parents because they want the latest thing and at the moment the latest thing seems to be the latest football shirt.\"\nAlthough it is not illegal to buy counterfeit goods, the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau advises consumers to avoid buying fake goods because \"you're helping the trader to break the law\".\nThe City of London Police-affiliated organisation urges people to report any instances of fraud.\nThere are often links between counterfeit goods and organised crime, meaning the proceeds of sale are used by gangs both in the UK and abroad to fund other criminal operations - estimated at over \u00a3900m a year - according to the Premier League.

    "Back in 1947, when the Edinburgh Fringe first began, rationing and post war austerity were the main challenges facing performers who wanted to take part.\nThe eight companies that took part were mostly Scottish and set up in any space they could find on the fringes of the new Edinburgh International Festival of the Arts.\nThe Fringe long ago overtook the international festival in terms of size and with its continued growth and success has some problems.\nOrganisers warned last year that there would be a dramatic reduction in accommodation for this year's festival but that hasn\u2019t curtailed the number of performers bringing shows to the Fringe, with 3,317 in the brochure released on Wednesday.\nThese include big names such as Miriam Margoyles, Hannah Gadsby and Lawrence Chaney.\n\u201cIt is that usual Zeitgeist moment,\u201d says Shona McCarthy, CEO of the Fringe Society, the charity which supports the open access festival.\n\u201cThere are shows in there about artificial intelligence, climate action, the geo political situation and then there's just that random eclectic mix of content that you could expect from the Fringe.\u201d\nThat category covers Willy's Candy Spectacular: A Musical Parody (which is inspired by the infamous Willy Wonka Experience in Glasgow earlier this year) and I Wish You Well: The Gwyneth Paltrow Ski-Trial Musical.\nShona McCarthy says the Fringe Society and venues have been working together to mitigate against the squeeze on accommodation caused by a change to short-term let legislation.\nGail Porter and Jason Manford were among the performers who said they\u2019d been unable to secure affordable spaces.\n\u201cEverywhere I go, people approach me to tell me how prohibitive the cost of accommodation in Edinburgh is. It remains a massive issue and the fact that people have found a way round it is not accidental,\" Shona says.\n\"There\u2019s been a huge effort with every single venue, all having to find new and innovative ways to address this problem of both affordable and available accommodation.\u201d\n\u201cThe fundamental principle of the Fringe is to give anyone a stage and everyone a seat. It makes it increasingly difficult if the very basic cost of accommodation is a barrier.\"\nFor the first time the Fringe will run a \"festival campus\" offering accommodation at Queen Margaret University on the eastern outskirts of the city, where rooms are capped at \u00a3269.50 a week.\nThe Fringe Society say they\u2019re gathering data which they will submit to the Scottish government for review after this year\u2019s festival. What they don\u2019t know is how that will impact on audiences, or the length of time anyone stays at the festival.\n\u201cIronically, it was one of the things which made the Fringe sustainable. You weren't encouraging people to travel for short term stays. They were here for three or four weeks contributing to the wider economy of Edinburgh and Scotland.\u201d\nThree nights of concerts by Taylor Swift have just taken place in Edinburgh. Shona says the impact they've had on the city is a sharper, shorter version of what the Fringe brings in August. \nBut the Fringe doesn't get the same level of support or preparation.\n\u201cIf we were a peripatetic event which happened in different parts of the world and Scotland was bidding to host, it would come with a package of millions. Resources, joined up infrastructure and a sense of celebration.\u201d she says.\nThere are other challenges for 2024. \nSummerhall, the University of Edinburgh's former veterinary school beside the Meadows, has been a Fringe venue for 13 years. This could be its last.\nThe two-and-a-half acre site, which houses twelve theatres and twelve art galleries during the festival and is home to more than a hundred businesses the rest of the year, is being sold. The hope is that the existing festival leases will remain intact.\n\u201cWe are tentatively balanced,\u201d says Sam Gough, CEO of Summerhall Management, who oversee cultural business at Summerhall.\n\u201cAll the events that we have on our books for this year\u2019s festival are going ahead as planned but the future is unknown to us at the moment.\u201d\nA petition was launched within days of the announcement, urging the council to step in but Mr Gough says there\u2019s another way for the public to support their work.\n\u201cThe response across the whole cultural landscape has been phenomenal but what people can do to support Summerhall is buy Fringe tickets. Support our programme, come all year round. Come and buy a pint from the pub and use a wonderful place, so that we can remain.\u201d\nWriter and performer Apphia Campbell has worked at Summerhall since she first arrived in Edinburgh from the US, nine years ago.\nThrough the Mud is part of the Made in Scotland showcase, a play about two women and the civil rights movement which she developed with theare company Stellar Quines and the Royal Lyceum Theatre.\n\u201cThe thing is, when you walk into the building it gives off a creative energy and you feel inspired,\u201d she says.\n\u201cDuring the festival there's a buzz in the beer garden and around the building.

    "A member of US soul group the Four Tops is suing a hospital, claiming doctors halted emergency treatment and ordered a psychological evaluation because they did not believe him when he told them he was famous.\nAlexander Morris, who joined the long-running group in 2019, says he went to Ascension Macomb Oakland Hospital, in Detroit, with difficulty breathing and chest pain, in April 2023.\nMr Morris's legal action claims he was racially profiled and doctors assumed he was mentally ill when he told them he was in the Four Tops, instead of treating \"his clear symptoms of cardiac distress\".\nHe was eventually diagnosed with a serious heart condition and pneumonia and suffered three seizures in hospital.\nThe hospital has previously said its \"top priority\" is the health and safety of patients but it is \"unable to provide details on cases under investigation\".\nThe Four Tops are known for classic hits such as 1966's Reach Out I'll Be There and have had a number of line-up changes in recent years.\nIn his legal papers, Mr Morris, 53, claims he had security concerns due to stalkers and fans, so informed a nurse and a hospital guard he was in the pop group.\nHe also told a doctor he had difficulty breathing and chest pain, as well as a history of heart disease - but staff \"wrongfully assumed he was mentally ill, when he revealed his identity as a celebrity figure\".\nThey took him off oxygen, put him in a straitjacket and a guard subjected him to racial discrimination.\nHe continued to struggle to breathe but was denied more oxygen.\nAnd when his his wife tried to persuade a guard he was not delusional, she was ignored. \nStaff realised their mistake only when he played them footage of him performing with the group at the Grammy Awards.\nAnd they offered him a $25 (\u00a320) gift card as an apology, which he refused.\nMr Morris announced last year he was planning to sue.\nAt that time, the hospital said: \"The health, safety and wellbeing of our patients, associates and community members remains our top priority.\n\"We remain committed to honouring human dignity and acting with integrity and compassion for all persons and the community. \n\"We do not condone racial discrimination of any kind.\n\"We are unable to provide details on cases under investigation.\"",
    "The leader of France's right-wing Republicans party, Eric Ciotti, has sparked an outcry after he backed an alliance with the far-right National Rally in snap elections announced by President Emmanuel Macron.\nThe anti-immigration party of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella scored a dramatic victory in European elections on Sunday, prompting Mr Macron to dissolve parliament and call a first round of elections in 19 days' time.\nThe decision has sent shockwaves through French politics, not least among the Republicans party, which won only 7.25% of the vote and has seen many of its voters move to National Rally (RN).\nFor Republicans leader Eric Ciotti the solution was clear: \"We need to have an alliance while remaining ourselves... an alliance with the National Rally and its candidates.\"\nThe snap election has prompted parties on both left and right to consider forming  alliances to stand a greater chance of winning more seats. Left-wing parties have already agreed to abandon their differences to form a \"popular front\".\nBut never before has the traditional right in French politics made any sort of political accord with the far right and Mr Ciotti's remarks set a party that was already struggling to find a voice \"on the verge of implosion\", as Le Monde put it.\nMr Ciotti, who is on the right wing of his party, revealed he had already spoken to Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella. Ms Le Pen immediately praised his \"courageous choice and sense of responsibility\" and looked forward to an end to \"40 years of a pseudo-cordon sanitaire\" disappearing.\nBut his suggestion was immediately greeted with a chorus of derision. Outside party headquarters in Paris, supporters spoke of an act of treachery for a party whose origins lie with the first president of France's current Fifth Republic, Charles de Gaulle.\nA clearly furious Republicans vice-president Florence Portelli said the party would fire Mr Ciotti for suggesting an accord with the far right. \"I think there's a chance he can be made to leave, if he doesn't go by himself, and I have no doubt it'll happen,\" she told France Info TV.\nSenate Republicans leader Bruno Retailleau accused him of disloyalty: \"The Republicans will never form an alliance with the RN, we have deep ideological differences and we have to maintain our independence and integrity.\"\nMany of Mr Ciotti's critics said he was driven by local politics in his home city of Nice. One MP, Vincent Desc\u0153ur, said he was resigning in protest and another, Jean-Yves Bony, said he would too if Mr Ciotti didn't step down in 48 hours.\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy, who led the Republicans in the European elections, said working with RN would merely be doing Mr Macron's work for him.\nPresident Macron has explained his bombshell decision to call elections, saying he could not carry on after the European elections as if nothing had happened and did not want to come across as powerless.\nHe ruled out resigning as president \"whatever the result\" of the elections, which take place over two rounds on 30 June and 7 July, less than three weeks before the Paris Olympics. \n\"It's not the RN who write the constitution, or the spirit of it,\" he told Le Figaro.\nNational Rally won 31.4% of the vote on Sunday, more than double the 14.6% of Mr Macron's Renew alliance, while a resurgent centre left, led by Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, reached 13.8%. \nAnother far-right party, Reconquest, took 5% of the vote, and there had been talk of the two parties forming an alliance for the next election. \nBut Marion Mar\u00e9chal of Reconquest, who is Marine Le Pen's niece, said RN had decided against an alliance because they wanted nothing to do with her party's leader Eric Zemmour.\n\nAt the last parliamentary election, France's notoriously divided left-wing parties formed a group called Nupes, bringing together the Socialists, far-left France Unbowed (LF), Communists and Greens.\nDespite Nupes imploding amid even wider divisions over issues such as the war in Gaza, the left parties have agreed to form a pact to fight the new elections.\nAlthough Mr Macron won a second term two years ago, his party failed to secure a majority in parliament, making it a struggle to pass legislation. \nHe has often had to rely on support from the Republicans to do so, so his decision to call elections is a big risk, especially when he is facing defeat.\nThe first opinion poll taken since Sunday's elections suggests National Rally would win 34% of the vote, ahead of 19% for Mr Macron's party.\nBut until now the two rounds of a parliamentary election have been tricky for National Rally as they have often struggled to win more than 50% of second-round run-off votes because their opponents tend to coalesce against the far right.\nIt is so far unclear whether their dramatic success on Sunday may have changed that.",

    "The unemployment rate has unexpectedly risen to its highest level for two and a half years, official figures show.\nThe rate climbed to 4.4% in the three months to April, the highest since September 2021.\nDespite the increase, wage growth remained strong, with earnings continuing to rise faster than prices.\nThere was another increase in the inactivity rate, bringing it to its highest level in nearly a decade, with more than a fifth of working-age people deemed not to be actively looking for work.\n\"This month's figures continue to show signs that the labour market may be cooling, with the number of vacancies still falling and unemployment rising, though earnings growth remains relatively strong,\" the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nRegular earnings - which exclude bonuses - rose at an annual pace of 6%, the ONS said, unchanged from the previous month.\nHowever, when the impact of inflation is stripped out, pay increased at an annual pace of 2.9%, the highest since August 2021.\nEconomists had been expecting an uptick in pay because of the increase to the National Living Wage in April. For people aged 21 and over, it rose to \u00a311.44 an hour, up 9.8% from last year.\nWhile the ONS has urged caution about the unemployment figures because its survey sample is small, they are backed up by the more recent figures on employers\u2019 payrolls, which show the number of employees dropped by 36,000 between March and April, and continued to drop in May. \nThe number of job vacancies also fell, down by 9,000 to 904,000.\nThe ONS figures showed that 22.3% of working-age adults in the UK are deemed not to be actively looking for work, which is more than nine million people.\nConcerns have been raised over worker shortages affecting the UK economy, and the inactivity rate among adults has remained at a persistently high level in recent years since it first surged during the pandemic.\nThe figure is now at its highest since 2015, with the rise in long-term sickness a key factor. Since 2022, it has become the number one reason why working age people are economically inactive.\nThe latest data will be studied by the Bank of England to help decide in the timing of its  first interest rate cut since the start of the pandemic. \nThe Bank will meet next week to discuss interest rates, but KPMG's chief economist Yael Selfin said the \"mixed\" data was \"unlikely to shift the dial at the Bank of England\", predicting that it would keep rates unchanged this month.\nShe said that the weaker demand for staff had been attributed \"to a lack of roles and firms delaying hiring decisions\".\nAbrdn's deputy chief economist Luke Bartholomew said: \"UK wage growth remains very strong, but with further evidence that the labour market is cooling, this report is unlikely to significantly change the thinking at the Bank of England.\n\"We expect the first rate cut in August, but that is dependent on further progress on bringing down underlying inflation pressure over the next few months,\" he added.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told the BBC the unemployment rate had only increased \u201cslightly\u201d and that it was \u201cstill at a historically, relatively low, level\u201d.\n\u201cOur record on employment is extremely strong,\u201d he added.\nLabour\u2019s shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures confirm that the Tories have no hiding place after 14 years of abject failure.\"\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said: \u201cThis Conservative carousel of chaos has our economy on a rollercoaster ride and the British people are sick and tired of it.\"\nSNP economy spokesperson Drew Hendry said: \"These latest figures show that the Tories have trashed the economy with years of austerity, Brexit and a cost-of-living crisis \u2013 and have no plan to fix it.\"\nA Green Party spokesperson said rising unemployment \u201ccombined with decaying public services [...] is a fitting but tragic testament to a government that is out of touch and out of time\u201d.\nA Plaid Cymru spokesperson noted that Wales had the highest economic inactivity rate and the lowest employment rate, describing it as \"a damning indictment both on the Conservatives at Westminster and Labour in Wales\".\nThe BBC has also approached Reform UK for comment.",

One of them appears to be a takeaway cup.\nAnother video of the incident, from a different angle, appears to show two objects missing Mr Farage, with one hitting the side of the bus.\nSouth Yorkshire Police says it has arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of public order offences.\n\"It is believed that the man threw objects from a nearby construction area,\" police said in a statement. \n\"I will not be bullied or cowed by a violent left-wing mob who hate our country,\" Mr Farage wrote about the incident on X.\n\"These people want to stop my election campaign. That\u2019s never going to happen,\" he added. \nThe video posted on his X account showed a man in a red jacket throwing objects from a building site before being stopped by what appears to be construction workers.\nHe was later detained by police, who said the man remains in custody. \nThe incident happened as a crowd of Stand Up to Racism protestors interrupted Mr Farage as he spoke from the vehicle. \nReform UK supporters and Stand Up to Racism protesters both chanted against each other as crowds formed around the bus in the town centre.\nMr Farage had been warned by police not to get off the bus.\nHe had been touring Barnsley and had just left Hoyland, where he had had a warmer welcome.

    "Jurors who convicted Hunter Biden of gun crimes on Tuesday have said they did not think about his father or politics when reaching their decision.\n\"I was never thinking of President Joe Biden,\" one juror told the BBC shortly after the verdict, adding that their 11 fellow jurors considered it \u201cimportant\u201d to separate the facts of the case from the family.\n\"Out of all the jurors, nobody mentioned anything about political motivations,\u201d the male juror, who asked to remain anonymous, said. \u201cSomehow, you block that out of your mind.\"\nThe verdict has prompted much political reaction, with congressional Republicans who investigated Hunter Biden for years welcoming the decision. Democrats have insisted it will not affect the president\u2019s re-election campaign.\nIn a brief interview, the juror told the BBC he had not considered whether it would impact November\u2019s election.\nTwo other jurors, meanwhile, told CNN that they did not feel any pressure during deliberations, despite the high-profile nature of the trial, during an election year.\nOne of those jurors told CNN she anticipated the panel would be \"at each other's throats because [Biden's] father is the president and because of the political climate\", but after deliberations started, she \"didn't feel pressure\". \nJurors who spoke to other news outlets repeatedly said politics did not sway their decision, but some did have qualms about the case. \nOne juror told CNN the case \"seemed like a waste of taxpayer dollars\", while another juror said the process was \u201ca little bit frustrating because it felt like we couldn\u2019t get the full story\".\nDespite those frustrations, the jury was able to reach a verdict within just three hours of the week-long trial.\nThe juror who spoke to the BBC left the case with some remorse, noting that Mr Biden is not just the US president but also a dad and \"someone just convicted [his son] in federal court\". \nBiden became the first son of a sitting US president to be criminally convicted on Tuesday when the jury found him guilty of lying about his drug use on a federal form when purchasing a handgun in 2018. \nBefore the case went to trial, he pleaded not guilty to the charges, claiming he did not lie on the form because he was in recovery from drug addition at the time. \nBiden was stoic during the verdict reading. He hugged family members and his legal team after he learned his fate. He will be sentenced at some point in the next 120 days, but the judge overseeing the case did not set a date. ",

the maximum he could receive is 25 years in prison, though experts say such a term is very unlikely.\nHere's what we know about the historic case and what happens next. \nIf Biden is given a prison sentence, legal experts said that it is very unlikely he would face the maximum 25 years for the three gun charges.\nEven for the charge of being an illegal drug user in possession of a gun, which carries a maximum 10 year penalty, few believe that Biden will face the full potential punishment. \nSouth Texas College of Law Houston professor Dru Stevenson said it would be \"bizarre and unprecedented\u201d if Biden was to receive anything close to five years.\n\u201cThat\u2019s for people that [are] really dangerous, like someone who had already been on the FBI\u2019s watchlist,\u201d he said.\nProf Stevenson said there was a \u201c50:50 chance\u201d of a prison term, and that he would expect something closer to 20 months.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict, but I think it\u2019s very possible,\u201d he said.\nProf Stevenson said it was also possible that Biden gets probation, rather than prison. \nBiden\u2019s apparent recovery from drug abuse may also be cited by his legal team to merit a lighter sentence.\nHowever, he noted that the judge overseeing the case had declined to give Biden\u2019s lawyers \u201cany breaks\u201d during the trial.\nJudge Maryellen Noreika was tough on Biden\u2019s lawyers during evidentiary hearings, the Texas professor said, and she frequently ruled against defence lawyers\u2019 requests.\nThat could indicate that Biden might face a harsher sentence than most would consider typical. \nJudge Maryellen Noreika is expected to schedule a sentencing hearing in the next few weeks.\nBiden will also meet probation officers for a pre-sentencing report to be used by the judge.\nIn the interim, it is unlikely that he will be held in custody. \nEven in the event of a prison sentence, it is not expected that Biden would have to surrender to authorities immediately. \nRather, he would probably be given a date to turn himself in.\nFormer US Assistant Attorney Neama Rahmani told the BBC that after sentencing, Biden's team will have 30 days to appeal, something Mr Rahmani said was very likely.\n\"This is a case made for appeal,\" he said. \nHe added that sending Biden to prison would be a \"logistical nightmare\" because of the Secret Service protection he gets as the president's son. \nBiden faced three federal charges in the case: two counts of making false statements and one of illegal gun possession. \nThe charges all relate to his purchase of a revolver at a Delaware gun store on 12 October 2018, which he kept for about 11 days.\nBy Biden's own admission, he was deep in the throes of a \"full-blown addiction\" to crack cocaine at the time.\nThe two false statement charges stemmed from allegations that he lied about his drug use on a federally mandated form when he bought the weapon.\nThe third count was related to his possession of a firearm while using drugs.\nBefore the guilty verdict, President Biden said he would not pardon his son. \nWhen asked in an interview with ABC News if he would rule out the option, he said: \"Yes.\"\nAfter the verdict he appears to be sticking to the same message. \nOn Tuesday, he said in a statement: \"I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.\" \nTo convict Mr Biden, prosecutors had to convince jurors that he knowingly made false statements on the form in a bid to deceive the store that sold him the pistol. \nProsecutors relied on deeply personal text messages and other communications made while Mr Biden was in the throes of addiction to prove he was a drug user when he took possession of the gun. \nIn one such message sent to Hallie Biden a day after the gun was purchased, Biden says he was on his way to meet a dealer named Mookie.\nMs Biden, who was called to testify by prosecutors, told the court that the text had meant \"he was buying crack cocaine\".\nOther witnesses called to the stand were Mr Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and ex-girlfriend Zoe Kestan, who both spoke about his addiction. \nProsecutors have also pointed to Biden's own 2021 memoir, in which he detailed his experiences as a drug user who was \"up twenty-four hours a day, smoking every 15 minutes, seven days a week\".\n\"All my energy revolved around smoking drugs and making arrangements to buy drugs - feeding the beast,\" he wrote in the book. \nWhile Biden has himself been quiet about the trial, his lawyers focused on how much he was aware of his addiction at the end of the purchase, and on the quality of the evidence itself.\nWhen questioning Hallie Biden, defence lawyer Abbe Lowell also sought to cast doubt on whether his client was seen using drugs on the day of the purchase or around it.  \nThe third charge, regarding Mr Biden's al",
    "A two-year-old child died from sepsis after she was sent home from hospital by a \"very junior\" doctor, a report revealed.\nSelina Samarina was taken to Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, with symptoms of fever, a rash and irritability on 7 April.\nShe had been discharged but had died after being readmitted two days later, when her parents had brought her back, a prevention-of-future-deaths report said.\nThe Mid and South Essex NHS Hospital Trust said it would provide a full response to the coroner\u2019s report within 56 days.\nIn his report, Stephen Simblet KC, the assistant coroner for Essex, said the \"sufficiency of the staffing arrangements\" that day were a concern.\nSelina received an urgent referral and the sepsis protocol was triggered upon her being presented at hospital, the report said.\nThe coroner stated this should ordinarily have led to an examination by a senior doctor within an hour.\nHowever, a \"very junior doctor was sent over\" due to a \"huge demand\" on the ward service.\nDiagnoses such as sepsis or pneumonia were not addressed before Selina - who had been born with Down's syndrome - was sent home.\nIt was not until two and a half hours after an urgent referral was made that a doctor of appropriate seniority was available to assess Selina.\n\"By which time, as was consistent with the directions from the junior doctor, Selina had gone home with her parents,\" Mr Simblet wrote.\nHis report detailed that there would normally be 12 doctors across the emergency and paediatrics departments, but on that day there were seven.\nSelina was taken back to hospital by her parents on 9 April, but died there later that day.\nAn inquest into her death in May concluded she died from sepsis and pneumonia, with contributory factors of Down\u2019s Syndrome and upper respiratory tract infection.\nIn his latest report, Mr Simblet concluded that an \"increased workload\" played a part in a senior consultant not reviewing Selina's condition.\n\u201cI was told in evidence that the trust has now consolidated the staffing rotas for the emergency department and paediatrics department, so that it is now easier to see any deficit as one deficit across two departments,\" he added.\n\u201cThat does not, however, address the situation of how and why a situation in which only 60 per cent of the doctors are available for these important services.\"\nHe said the hospital trust must provide to him in writing what action it proposed to take.\nAdditional reporting by the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A man who spent his childhood \"being told I was the stupid kid in class\" is now expecting an autism diagnosis more than 50 years later - and said it could finally provide the answers he has been searching for.\nJohn Rawcliffe, 63, has spent most of his life wondering why he is different and has struggled to communicate and understand others.\nThe former salesman, from Lancaster, has been waiting nearly two years for a diagnosis so he can access support, after the NHS admitted a surge in demand for assessments has heaped pressure on services.\nHowever, he has now taken matters into his own hands and set up a support group for those in a similar position while the \"system is swamped\".\nMr Rawcliffe was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of 30, and 20 years later said he found himself identifying with a BBC Breakfast programme on aphantasia \u2013 which leaves some people unable to visualise mental images. \nIt was not until the age of 60 when he began to believe he was autistic.\n\"I struggle to communicate, to understand people and emotions. Getting myself to do something is quite a struggle sometimes,\" he said. \nOn his memory, he added: \"I can tell you about the events that have happened in my lifetime but I don\u2019t always remember them.\"\nGrowing up Mr Rawcliffe said he did not have many friends, which was \"common for those with autism\".\n\"Simple things, rules about how to engage in conversation, when to butt in, when to nod, a lot of autistic people miss those skills - it becomes exhausting, \" he said. \nHis first referral for a diagnosis appointment came in June 2021 before a series of delays, including doctors admitting they had \u201clost his referral\u201d.\nHe believes further delays were prolonged following a growing awareness of autism in mainstream culture - including various TV programmes - leading to more people coming forward.\n\u201cObviously I am not blaming that, but now the doctors can only tell me there is nobody to assess me,\u201d he said. \nProf Sarah O\u2019Brien, chief nursing officer for Lancashire and South Cumbria Integrated Care Board, said demand for assessments across the catchment area had increased by 93 per cent since October 2022 and has remained at an increased level.\nShe said: \u201cThis increase is in line with national demand for autism assessments across England and is putting pressure upon all assessment and diagnostic services.\nShe added that while plans were in place to boost waiting times, \"significant\" investment would \"still not be able to meet demand\".\nMr Rawcliffe said he remembered having \"stims\" as a child - a wide variety of self-stimulating behaviours that people with autism may exhibit when experiencing sensory overload or high levels of anxiety.\n\"For me it was tapping, making strange noises, chewing, blinking a lot, sudden movements,\" he said.\n\"All of those were encouraged out of me, I was constantly told off but I know now they were all ways for me to regulate that energy.\" \nHe said because he went to school in the 1960s and 70s he was told he was \"stupid\".\n\"I was the stupid idiot, put to the back of the class and told we don\u2019t expect anything out of you. So realising there is a reason for that is validating. \n\"It also makes me angry because 60 years of my life I have had a problem that could have been dealt with better if people around me understood me better and if I understood myself better.\"\nHe said he had spent most of his life \"masking\" - hiding his symptoms to \"try and fit in\".\nHe said: \"You get to a point where you can\u2019t cope with it anymore. Masking can be extremely draining. \n\"It is very rare you take the mask off, especially if you\u2019re diagnosed late, because it is ingrained.\"\nMr Rawcliffe said he began to look for local support groups so he could speak to people about his symptoms but struggled.\nHe and a friend then decided to set up Adults with Autism.\nThe group runs fortnightly support sessions at the George and Dragon pub on St George's Quay in Lancaster.\nMr Rawcliffe said: \"It is a safe space where people can talk, about the silly things or the more serious, of how it has affected their life and to understand you are not alone.\n\"No two autistic people are identical but we all share a common theme and this group gives the ability to talk about that.\n\u201cOne of the group members described a late diagnosis as mourning your childhood and I think that's very apt.\u201d\nCarol Chesters uses the group for support for herself and her 34-year-old son.\nThe 66-year-old lives in North Yorkshire but travels to Lancaster for the group. \nShe said: \"I simply wanted to meet ordinary people preferably with autism or in a late diagnosis situation for myself and my son. \n\"As a parent of someone who is late diagnosed it is a very difficult journey. There has been negative press about lots of people coming out now wanting a diagnosis. I sort have imposter syndrome in that the doctor won't believe me due to my age but I am identifying with a lot of people.\"\nJoey Nettleton Burrows, policy and public affairs manager at the",
    "When Graeme Parker started filming himself at work little did he suspect the global phenomenon he would become.\nFrom a beautiful corner of south-west Scotland, he is now regularly greeted by strangers on the street when he visits the United States.\nIt is all due to what would appear to be the most unlikely material to grab social media's imagination.\nAs the Hoof GP, his videos of trimming the hooves of cows are now viewed by more than 100 million people a month.\n\nThe 41-year-old grew up on the family farm in Wigtownshire but - after his father's death when he was a teenager - he ended up going into hospitality and moving around Scotland.\n\"My mother remarried a hoof trimmer, he became ill and I wasn't enjoying the place that I was running,\" he said.\n\"So I came back to look after his business.\"\nIt does not sound all that glamorous a career.\n\"I was freeze branding cows - so basically putting numbers on cows' bums all over Scotland, the Highlands, the islands - I absolutely loved it, I really, really did,\" he said.\n\"My customers would always constantly tell me - you should be hoof trimming because you've got an eye for detail.\"\n\"And I said: 'Who on Earth would want to be at the wrong end of the cow, trimming their feet? It is a dirty job, I'll never, ever trim a cow's foot'.\"\nThings have changed pretty quickly. \n\"Fast forward a few years and I'm now probably the best-known person in the world for trimming cows' feet,\" he said.\n\"It was reluctant to begin with but I absolutely love what I do now.\"\nThe filming was initially meant to share with the local agricultural community.\n\"To begin with, it was nothing to do with the public, it wasn't for public consumption,\" he said.\nHe used to take photos to show his work to farmers but it became clear it would be easier to stick a video on YouTube and share the link.\n\"At the time there were hoof trimming videos on YouTube but they were all of a cow's foot that looked almost perfect being made to look a bit more perfect,\" he said.\n\"Nobody wanted to show lameness and part of that is part of the problem, I think within agriculture, people are scared to show the reality of it.\n\"The reality of it is there are problems, but everybody tries to fix those problems.\"\nHe quickly started to realise that the questions he was being asked online were not coming from the agricultural sector.\n\n\"The videos grew,\" he explained. \"Within the first month we had about 1,000 subscribers - that was five years ago.\n\"Now there are 6.8 million people who follow us religiously across all social media channels, and we get anywhere from 120 to 160 or 170 million views per month.\"\nIt has become a business that employs five people and has a worldwide reach.\n\"Things have got quite big, but I'm still a hoof trimmer who hoof trims and that is my job,\" he said.\n\"All the other stuff, I always think, I just kind of play at.\"\nHe never for a minute imagined it would be so popular and its reach would go so far.\n\"I've met people who have these fantastic stories attached to the Hoof GP who are completely removed from my life,\" he said.\nHe is keen for people to see beyond the image displayed on social media, however, and is now writing a book.\nGraeme also uses his work to promote the south-west of Scotland.\n\"I describe where we live as an island,\" he said.\n\"Clearly it's not an island, but the Machars of Wigtownshire are surrounded on three sides by water and to the north there's a bank of hills which kind of separates you from everybody.\n\"So we've got that kind of island community feel about it with none of the drawbacks, we don't need to get a boat to go anywhere.\"\nAt the heart of it all, is the day job.\n\"It is multi-faceted how good hoof trimming can impact a cow's life and a farmer's life,\" he said.\n\"At the end of the day, I care about these animals. I really care about their health.\n\"I want them to be comfortable.\"\nThat also helps with the bottom line.\n\"But, forgetting all of that, this is an industry that we're working in - it's a commercial industry and these cows are there to make money,\" he added.\n\"The healthier those cows are, the better they are at making money.\n\"It's good for the cow, it's good for us, it's good for the end consumer.\n\"It's just better for everybody if cows' feet are as comfortable as possible.\"",

It's got to be written in stone because we are absolutely at the mercy of a fluctuating market.\n\"The big thing they can offer that will get my vote is just stability. \n\"We want to know that I've got a future in agriculture and farming and the only way they can do that is putting forward a financial plan to produce food.\"\nEngland greener farming payments detail unveiled\nMr Lawton says financial pressures have been compounded this year by the wettest spring he has ever seen.\nHe said: \"We are at the mercy of climate change, but if the government can't help us it's a sad outlook.\"\nMr Lawton has also lost farming subsidies after support was shifted to the environment. \n\"You have got to be able to look after the environment but also produce food\". \n\"You have got to find that natural balance and the next government has got to see that\".\nMr Lawton says he supported Brexit but he would vote against it now.\n\"We didn't realise a lot of farmers in the UK were dependent on EU subsidies and suddenly they were gone.\n\"With Brexit, we have a massive labour shortage in agriculture.

    "About a quarter of people of working-age - nearly 11 million people - do not currently have jobs. \nIn his March Budget, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt set out a series of measures designed to encourage people to find work, or increase their hours.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 4.4% of people were unemployed in the period between February-April 2024 - up from the previous figure of 4.3% and the highest rate since September 2021. \nThat's about 1.5 million people. \nWhile there has been an increase in recent months, unemployment remains relatively low historically.\nBut the unemployed represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people (aged 16-64) who were not in a paid job in 2023. \nAbout 9.4 million of them are not called \"unemployed\". That is because they were not actively looking for work, or available to start a job. \nInstead these people are called \"economically inactive\". \nIn fact, more of them said they wanted a job (1.7 million people) than are officially unemployed (1.44 million). \nIt varies according to age. \nONS figures for 2023 show that most of the 2.7 million \"inactive\" under-25s were students. The majority of them did not want a job. \nYou can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women.\nThings are different in other age groups.\nThe main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s were out of the job market were illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who retired early said they wanted to return to work. \nAmong 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people did not work because of caring responsibilities (about a million of whom are women).\nNearly one million people in this age group were not working because of illness (more evenly split between men and women). \nAround half of people with disabilities did not have a paid job, a rate that is more than double the rest of the working-age population.\nLess than a quarter of those who were sick or caring said they wanted a job. \nMany people have chosen to do something else: studying, caring or retirement.\nBut for others it is not a choice.\nSome people cannot afford childcare if they return to work, others are too sick, or have given up on finding a job.\nAs the chart below shows, sickness and caring responsibilities were the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who actually would like a paid job. \nThe number of people not working has a broader effect.  \nA smaller workforce means less tax to pay for services like the NHS, and greater spending on benefits. \nSince people on benefits generally have less money to spend than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street. \nThat in turn is bad for businesses and how many people they need to employ. \nIn turn, that can affect how many jobs are available for those who are job hunting. \nThe UK's \"inactivity\" rate is back up to the levels seen in 2015.  \nIt is low by historical standards, as each decade more and more women have been joining the workforce. But the recent trend is unusual. \nDuring the Covid pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink. \nBut while the other leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has more people out of its workforce than in 2019 - by over 1% of the working-age population.\nBefore Covid, the UK's inactivity rate was second lowest in the G7 club of leading advanced economies, with only Japan's lower. \nThe increase in inactivity shown above puts the UK fourth out of seven, overtaking Germany and Canada but still below the US, France and Italy. \nThe Office for Budget Responsibility suggests that the drop since the pandemic that distinguishes the UK is due to ill-health being consistently \"a bigger factor\" in the country than in the other advanced economies. \nThe government announced a series of reforms in the Budget to help some people get jobs or increase the hours they work. The measures were particularly aimed at:\nThese included cutting the rate for national insurance contributions,\u202fextending free childcare to ensure single-earner households aren't disadvantaged,\u202fand offering more support to help disabled people find paid employment. \nBroadening the pool of people given support to return to the job market is key, experts argue. \nData visualisation by Callum Thomson, additional reporting by Nicholas Barrett",

I had no hope or expectation left to play again,\u201d he says.\nOn Wednesday, almost a decade later, he will face the Indian cricket team in a T20 World Cup match at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York. \nBut he will do so as part of the US team.\nAs he embarks on his World Cup dream, Netravalkar says the match will be an \"emotional moment\" for a cricketer who once played for India\u2019s Under-19 team.\n\u201cMany of my former team-mates are now playing for India,\u201d he tells the BBC. \nBut he is unfazed about the prospect of facing his friends in a crucial match.\nHe is full of confidence and it showed in his impeccable bowling last week in a super over that led the US to a historic win against Pakistan.\nNetravalkar\u2019s is a story of persistence, a love for cricket and, also, the American dream.\nBorn and raised in Mumbai, Netravalkar began playing cricket when he was just 10.\nHis family lived in Malad, a suburb in the western part of the city. After some remarkable performances as a teenager, he was picked to represent India in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand.\nThe tall, left-arm fast bowler emerged as the leading wicket-taker of the tournament for the Indian team.\nOver the next few years, Netravalkar balanced his pursuit of cricket while studying to become an engineer, graduating in 2013.\nAfter that, the bowler says he decided to concentrate on cricket, giving himself two years. During this time, he attempted to get a spot in the national team as well as the Mumbai cricket team.\n\u201cI got into the [Mumbai] squad too. But I couldn\u2019t cement my place or even get into the Indian Premier League (IPL),\u201d he says.\nA cricketer\u2019s career usually starts at 23. But Netravalkar says he decided to leave the sport at that point.\n\u201cI was in two minds. Should I pursue cricket or concentrate on studies?\u201d he says.\nIn 2015, he started studying in Cornell University in the US for a degree in computer science. \u201cIt was a difficult decision,\u201d he says.\nBut he could never fully let go of his cricket dreams.\nDuring his time as an engineering student in India, he\u2019d already developed CricDeCode, an app to help cricketers analyse their game.\nAt Cornell, Netravalkar saw students play cricket and joined a club to participate in inter-college tournaments.\nSoon after graduating, Netravalkar got a job with software giant Oracle and moved to California.\nIn San Francisco, Netravalkar began playing club cricket. \u201cThey had weekend tournaments. I would work for five days and play on Saturday and Sunday.\u201d\nIt was far from professional cricket, but it was still a chance to play the game.\n\u201cSan Francisco still doesn\u2019t have proper pitches. They play on an artificial pitch that\u2019s more like a synthetic mat,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they had soil pitches in a park in Los Angeles - it\u2019s like the Maidan [a famous park] in Mumbai.\u201d\nEvery Friday evening, he would drive for six hours to Los Angeles to play a match on Saturday. Then he\u2019d drive back to play a match in San Francisco on Sunday.\n\u201cIn the club [in Los Angeles], there were three to four players who were part of the American team,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was then I got to know that America had a cricket team.\u201d\n\u201cOn long weekends, they organised tournaments in the country, mostly in Florida, where even players from the West Indies would participate.\u201d\nThose tournaments provided a good platform, but Netravalkar was still not dreaming of playing for the US national team.\n\u201cI was on a student visa and then a work visa. So there was no question of playing for the team.\u201d\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC), which governs the sport across the world, also had a rule that required Netravalkar to have lived in the US for seven years and be a permanent resident.\nBut the rule changed in 2018 and Netravalkar was picked for the US cricket team. In 2019, the ICC also gave international T20 status to all its associate members, including the US.\n\u201cMany think it\u2019s easier to play for obscure teams that are considered underdogs,\u201d he says. \n\u201cBut the struggle is even harder here. Playing for associate countries is difficult because they lack basic infrastructure,\u201d he explains.\nAll players in the US team also have full-time jobs and juggle family responsibilities. \n\"So we practise indoors from 7-9pm.\u201d\nIn a country like the US, distance adds to the struggle of bringing players from different corners to play together.\nSo the team usually meets 10 days before a tournament to practice.\nThe US overcame these odds to progress from the upper divisions of associate cricket to playing the T20 World Cup this year. They have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup.\n\u201cThe standard of local cricket here has gone up,\u201d Netravalkar says. \n\u201cMajor league and minor league made a huge difference because they gave us a chance to play with top players. There are better grounds being made and pitc",
    "A charity that helps Ukrainian refugees settle in North Yorkshire has issued a plea for new host families to welcome people into their homes.\nThe Scarborough Sunflower Appeal was set up by volunteers from the Salvation Army in 2023, when Ukrainians fleeing war were offered the chance to build a new life in the UK.\nThe group provides support with navigating education and health systems.\nAppeal leader Iryna Kutsemakhina said the supply of hosts had slowed down despite a flow of refugees looking to live in the UK.\n\nShe said: \u201cWhen the war broke out in February 2022, there were a lot of people who wanted to be sponsors, but now I think that life in England is a little more complicated than it was two years ago and of course, people have a lot of their own problems and issues.\n\u201cSo now we are getting a lot of requests from Ukrainians to come over, but we don\u2019t have enough sponsors or families who can help.\n\u201cI understand why but I will always still ask for anyone who can help, especially as it is mostly now mothers who can\u2019t bear their children being part of the war any longer.\u201d\nMs Kutsemakhina, who fled Dnipro with her two children, said she felt \u201cvery privileged\u201d that she was able to find a host soon after the Russian invasion began.\nShe explained that a friend in Scarborough got in touch with her while she was still in Ukraine and told her that a man she knew was looking for a family to sponsor.\nJust 20 days later, the three of them arrived in the town along with her sister, niece and nephew.\nMs Kutsemakhina was contacted by the Salvation Army after helping another group called Sunflowers Will Help Ukraine with translation.\nThe charity told her about its plans to help Ukrainians in North Yorkshire as the government\u2019s Homes for Ukraine scheme was launched.\nShe now has her own flat and is settled in Scarborough.\nShe said: \u201cThis project is the biggest thing a Ukrainian can dream about, not only in England but every foreign country, because the slogan for this project was \u2018from home to home\u2019.\n\u201cNow I realise it is really true, as being in the Salvation Army we can always find part of our home, we can always find a warm atmosphere here, and we can always find help.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity to get all Ukrainians together and to hear our language.\u201d\nAnyone able to offer accommodation to the refugees should contact the Scarborough branch of the Salvation Army,\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter), and\u00a0Instagram.

    "US President Joe Biden has said he will respect a jury\u2019s decision to find his son guilty of gun crimes, after a week-long trial that laid bare a tumultuous time for the family.\nThe 12-person jury found Hunter Biden, 54, guilty of lying about his drug use on a form while purchasing a handgun in 2018. He faces possible jail time following the verdict, which marked the first criminal prosecution of a sitting president\u2019s child.\nHis conviction on all three felony counts comes as President Biden campaigns for re-election in November, and less than two weeks after his election rival Donald Trump was himself convicted of a crime in New York.\nWhile President Biden did not attend the trial in Delaware, many family members including First Lady Jill Biden did so regularly. Hunter Biden\u2019s wife, sister and uncle were all present at times to support him during proceedings.\nPresident Biden flew to Wilmington, Delaware, after the verdict where he greeted and hugged his son on the tarmac.\n\u201cI am the president, but I am also a dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\u201d he said in a statement. Mr Biden added that he would \u201caccept the outcome of this case and\u2026 continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal\u201d.\nPresident Biden earlier ruled out pardoning his son, whose trial aired embarrassing details as prosecutors sought to show he was using crack cocaine at the time he bought the gun. \nJurors heard from his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and a former girlfriend, Zoe Kestan, who described frequent drug binges that took a toll on his friends and family. Text messages detailing his addiction and photographs, some showing a half-naked Hunter Biden, were also shown to the court.\nThe verdict on Tuesday prompted instant political reaction, including from Republicans in Congress who have spent years investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s behaviour and business ties. \nJames Comer, the Republican chair of the House oversight committee, said it marked a \u201cstep toward accountability\u201d, but added that \"everyone involved\" in what he called the \"Bidens\u2019 corrupt influence peddling schemes\u201d should be investigated.\nA statement from the Trump campaign, meanwhile, said the trial had \u201cbeen nothing more than a distraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family\u201d. The former president has often used that description of the family on the campaign trail, referring to allegations of improper conduct made against the president and his son by Republicans.\nDemocrats in Congress accused their Republican colleagues of hypocrisy, and praised the US justice system. \n\u201cCompare and contrast the difference in reaction between the Republicans and the Democrats,\" Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin said in a hearing. \nReferring to Trump's criminal conviction, he said: \"The Republicans are attacking our entire system of justice and the rule of law because they don\u2019t like the way one case came out, whereas the son of the president of the United States is prosecuted and I don\u2019t hear a single Democrat crying foul.\u201d\nMeanwhile, several jurors who convicted Hunter Biden have said politics was not a factor in their decision. \"I was never thinking of President Joe Biden,\" one juror told the BBC.\n\"Out of all the jurors, nobody mentioned anything about political motivations,\" he added.\nAides to President Biden have told US news outlets that the trial and verdict have taken an emotional toll on Mr Biden, who has been closely watching the case.\nPolitico reported that Mr Biden had been \"consumed with the trial for weeks\" and asked family members for updates while he was on a trip to France for D-Day anniversary events.\nThe outlet also said Mr Biden has at times felt guilty about the spotlight that has been placed on his son, and believes his political career has contributed to his son's legal problems. \nAccording to the Washington Post, the president's advisers have often been reluctant to speak to him about his son and some have tried to limit Hunter Biden's public appearances.\nHunter Biden will be sentenced at some point in the next 120 days, but the judge overseeing the case has not set a date for the hearing. He faces up to 25 years in prison, but legal experts say it is highly unlikely the eventual sentence will be close to that given he is a first time, non-violent offender.\nHis legal issues are set to continue throughout the year, and throughout his father's election campaign. In September, he will face trial in California on charges of failing to pay $1.4m (\u00a31.1m) in income taxes.\nIf convicted in that case, Hunter Biden could face up to 17 years in prison.",

Israel's military said fewer than 100 were killed.\nUN spokesman Jeremy Laurence said the action by Israeli forces \u201cseriously calls into question whether the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution... were respected\u201d and could amount to war crimes.\nHe also said Palestinian armed groups could face war crimes charges for continuing to hold hostages in built-up areas and \"putting the lives of Palestinian civilians, as well as the hostages themselves, at added risk\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s mission to the UN in Geneva accused the UN human rights office of \u201cslander\u201d.\n\u201cThe toll of this war on civilians is first and foremost the product of Hamas\u2019s deliberate strategy to maximise civilian harm,\u201d a statement said. \n\u201cThose who continue to shield Hamas terrorists, including [the UN human rights office], are complicit in the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis alike.\u201d\nThe Israeli military has repeatedly said it operates in accordance with international law.\nThere was no immediate comment by Hamas.\nThe four hostages freed on Saturday - Noa Argamani, Almog Meir, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv - were held in two apartment buildings about 200m (656ft) apart in Nuseirat - a historic, urban refugee camp which has seen an influx of displaced people since the start of the war.\nAccording to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the Israeli commandos took Ms Argamani\u2019s Hamas guards by surprise and quickly killed them. But the simultaneous move to free Mr Ziv, Mr Kozlov and Mr Meir from the second building sparked a fierce gun battle with their guards, during which a senior Israeli police officer was fatally wounded.\nAs the commandos evacuated to the coast, they came under fire from fighters armed with machine-guns and rocket-propelled grenades, the IDF said. In response, Israeli aircraft, artillery and naval vessels carried out intense strikes on the area.\nGaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 others were injured during the operation. Its figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\nThe Hamas-run Government Media Office reported that 64 children, 57 women and 37 elderly people were among the dead.\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said its teams, along with medical staff at al-Aqsa hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah and Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, treated hundreds of severely injured patients, many of whom were women and children. \nThe charity also quoted one of its Palestinian doctors, Dr Hazem Maloh, as saying that dozens of men, women and children were killed, including his neighbours, friends or relatives.\nThe director of al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat told BBC Arabic\u2019s Gaza Today programme that 142 dead and 250 injured people were brought to the hospital on Saturday, and that almost a quarter of the fatalities were women and children.\nA senior official from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), meanwhile, said its health centre in Nuseirat treated more than 125 injured people.\nThe IDF's chief spokesman said it was aware of \"under 100\" Palestinian casualties and that it did not know how many of them were \"terrorists\".\nSeveral Nuseirat residents interviewed for BBC Arabic\u2019s Gaza Today programme said they were reluctant to leave the camp in the wake of the operation because nowhere else in Gaza was safe.\n\"They hit the house opposite us with missiles. I thought my family and I would surely die. Another missile also hit the door of our house.

    "An Austrian Airlines plane has been seriously damaged, after it was caught up in an intense hailstorm during a flight on Sunday afternoon. \nThe aircraft, which was flying from Spain to the Austrian capital Vienna, was forced to issue a mayday call and land after hail smashed the cockpit widows and tore off the front nose cone. \nPassengers said the flight rocked heavily throughout the ordeal, with one telling Austrian media that chunks of the destroyed nose cone could be seen flying past the plane.\nIn a statement to the BBC, Austrian Airlines said the incident occurred after the aircraft flew into a thunderstorm \"which was not visible on the weather radar\", adding that no passengers were injured in the saga.\nImages shared online showed heavy damage to the exterior of the Airbus A320 aircraft, with the front nose cone almost entirely blown away. \nOther photos appeared showed dense white cracks across the front windscreen. \nEmmeley Oakley, a passenger on the flight, told ABC News that the plane was on its final approach into Vienna when it was suddenly rocked by the storm. \n\"I think we were about 20 minutes from landing when we got into a cloud of hail and thunderstorm, and the turbulence started,\" she told the broadcaster. \nShe said passengers could \"feel the hail\" as it smashed into the plane, adding that the flight became \"super rocky for a minute\". Several people screamed throughout the incident, Ms Oakley said. She praised the cabin crew - who she said \"did a really good job calming those people down\". \nAnother passenger, identified only as Manuel H, told the Kronen-Zeitung newspaper: \u201cI only realised afterwards that it was parts of the nose cone that I saw flying past.\u201d\nAn Austrian Airlines spokesperson told the BBC that a technical team had been \"tasked with assessing the specific damage to the aircraft\". \n\"As of now, the hail has damaged the two front cockpit windows, the aircraft nose (radome), and some coverings,\" the spokesperson said. \nThe incident comes just weeks after a 73-year-old British man was killed during intense turbulence on a Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore.\nThe airline said it will pay $10,000 (\u00a37,800) to those who sustained minor injuries, in a Facebook post on Friday.  \nFor passengers with more serious injuries, the airline is providing \"an advance payment of $25,000 to address their immediate needs\" and further discussions to meet \"their specific circumstances\".",
    "An invasive species of mosquito has set up home in 13 countries in the EU, including France, Spain and Greece, with experts linking their presence to a rise in dengue fever in Europe.\nClimate change is creating favourable conditions for the tiger mosquito to spread, said the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). \nAs far north as Paris, where the Olympic Games will take place at the end of July, authorities have been monitoring and trapping the insect.\nThe ECDC has warned international travel will further increase the risk of more European outbreaks.\nIt has advised people to remove stagnant water from gardens or balconies, where mosquitoes can breed, and use repellent as well as screens on windows and doors.\nMosquitoes have become a growing threat in Europe over the past two decades.\nThe Asian tiger mosquito, aedes albopictus, which is thought to be the most invasive species of mosquito in the world, is now spreading across Europe from its southern European 'base camp'. \nIt has become established in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, according to the ECDC.\nIt has also been recorded in Belgium, Cyprus, Czechia, the Netherlands and Slovakia.\nTiger mosquitoes spread diseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika virus which, until recently, were typically only present in parts of Africa, Asia and the Americas.\nAnother mosquito, aedes aegypti, which transmits yellow fever, as well as other diseases, has set up home in Cyprus. Experts say its potential for spreading to other parts of Europe is \"concerning\" given its preference for biting humans, and its ability to transmit disease.\nDengue starts with flu-like symptoms but can become serious and, in some cases, fatal.\nMass outbreaks have been rising in recent years. Last year eight incidents of multiple infections were recorded in France, four in Italy and two in Spain.\nMost European cases are imported - a reflection of the international movement of people and trade, with imported cases soaring to nearly 5,000 last year. \nBut locally-acquired infections are also rising: 130 people were affected in 2023, up from 71 the year before.\nWest Nile virus, which is also transmitted by mosquitoes, is now present in more European regions than ever before.\nOne person was reported to be infected by the virus in southern Spain at the start of March, highlighting how climate conditions are creating a suitable environment for mosquitoes even \"very early in the year\", the ECDC said.\n\u201cEurope is already seeing how climate change is creating more favourable conditions for invasive mosquitos to spread into previously unaffected areas and infect more people with diseases such as dengue,\" said ECDC director Andrea Ammon. \n\"Increased international travel from dengue-endemic countries will also increase the risk of imported cases, and inevitably also the risk of local outbreaks.\"\nMs Ammon advises people take \"personal protective measures\", adding that \"early detection of cases, timely surveillance, further research and awareness-raising activities are paramount in those areas in Europe most at risk\u201d.\nDengue fever is endemic in more than 100 countries around the world, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), with more than six million cases and 7,000 deaths reported last year.\nThe highest number of cases occur in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.\nMalaria is the most deadly mosquito-borne disease on the planet. It spreads to people through the bites of infected female mosquitoes called anopheles, which have also been found in Europe. \nThere are concerns incidents of malaria could also spike on the continent in the future, if conditions are right.",
    "The Japanese scientist whose pioneering work led to the creation of statins, the life-saving drugs used by millions, has died at the age of 90. \nAkira Endo's pivotal work has been likened to the discovery of penicillin. \nThe biochemist is said to have been inspired by Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, prompting him to study mould, or fungi, in his quest to find new medicines.\nIn 1973, Prof Endo found the first cholesterol-lowering compound able to reduce the risk of heart disease and strokes.\n\n\nPaying tribute, Prof Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, described the professor as \"a remarkable scientist\". \n\"This really was the forerunner to the development of statin drugs,\" he told BBC News, adding: \"They have absolutely transformed the prevention of heart disease and stroke.\"\n\"There's very few treatments in medicine that have happened in the past few years that have had such a dramatic impact.\"\nUnlike Dr Fleming though, his discovery did not earn the professor a Nobel prize. \n\"Amazingly, the man who began the process of working out how to deal with the problem of cholesterol - and provided a treatment that benefited and saved the lives of many, many millions of people never got the prize,\" said Prof Williams.\n\"I think that's a shame.\"\nDoctors now routinely prescribe statins to people who have had a heart attack, and those who are at high risk of heart disease or stroke. \nThe drugs are estimated to save thousands of lives each year in the UK alone, and even more worldwide.\nCholesterol is a fatty material, chiefly made in the liver, which is carried and transported in the blood. \nPeople need some cholesterol to maintain good health, but too much \"bad\" cholesterol can clog the arteries and interrupt blood flow.\nStatins help lower \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood and keep the vessels clear of any fatty build-up.  \n\nProf Endo was born in rural Japan in 1933, and went on to study biochemistry at Tohoku University. \nIt was while working for the pharmaceutical company, Sankyo, in Tokyo in 1973 that he made his big discovery.\nIt took many years of studying thousands of fungi before finding one that lowered cholesterol. \nFirst attempts at harnessing it proved too toxic to give to patients. Other pharmaceutical companies then began to search for similar compounds. \nAnd in September 1987 the first statin - lovastatin - was approved in the US for clinical use.\nFungi have spawned some of our most important drugs - most famously, the antibiotic penicillin.\nIt was found by chance by Dr Fleming in 1928, when he returned from holiday to find mould growing in a Petri dish containing bacteria. He noticed the mould produced a chemical that appeared to stop the bacteria growing. That substance came to be known as penicillin.\nSimilarly, the fungus-derived cyclosporine has revolutionised transplant medicine since its discovery in the 1970s, helping to prevent donor organs from being rejected by the body. \n",
    "Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction for lying about his drug use on a handgun licence application will be a devastating personal blow for his father, Joe Biden. \nThe US president doubles as the patriarch of a tight-knit family that has seen its share of personal tragedy and trauma.\nNow his surviving son has been found guilty of three federal crimes that carry a potentially lengthy prison term.\nBut Hunter's verdict is unlikely to change how Americans vote in November's election.\nHis father's name will be on the ballot, not his. There's no evidence connecting the president to his son's offences. And there has been scant polling evidence that the  public is following this trial closely.\nAfter the verdict was announced, the president released a statement hinting at the dual obligations demanding his attention.\n\u201cI am the president, but I am also a dad,\u201d he said.\nHe added that he continued to support his son and was proud of the man he is today.\nAt the start of the trial, Joe Biden said he wouldn\u2019t comment on the proceedings, but his son\u2019s courtroom drama has followed him for weeks, as he conducted his official duties and campaigned for re-election. Hunter's yet-to-be determined punishment may be similarly distracting as the president prepares later this month for a pivotal presidential debate.\n\"This will, of course, be a personal distraction for the president, as it would be for any father,\" says Michael LaRosa, who served as press secretary for First Lady Jill Biden during the first two years of the Biden presidency. \"It's not a distraction from his duties as president, but I'm sure it will take an emotional toll on the family.\"\nWhile in France for D-Day commemorations last week, President Biden said that he would not consider using his authority to pardon his son. And he added that he would accept the jury\u2019s verdict \u2013 a contrast from Donald Trump\u2019s rejection of his own conviction as rigged and corrupt.\nThe former president\u2019s response to the Hunter Biden verdict was also markedly different. In a statement released by the campaign, Trump said the trial was \u201cnothing more than a distraction\u201d from what he asserted were more serious crimes committed by the Biden family.\nThat was a sentiment echoed by many other Republicans. Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina said the verdict was just \u201cthe veil of fairness\u201d. \nOthers noted that the trial only went ahead because a federal judge last year rejected what critics saw as a \"sweetheart\" plea deal.\nTrump\u2019s trial became a partisan brawl from start to finish, with Republican officials lining up behind the former president to condemn the proceedings. Hunter\u2019s conviction had a different feel, marking the culmination of a dark period for a Biden family that has known more than its share of turmoil.\nHunter Biden spiralled into drug use around the time that his brother, Beau, died from brain cancer. His battles with addiction and the toll it exacted on his family relationships were presented in painful detail during the trial through excerpts from Hunter\u2019s memoir, his text messages and emails, photographs and testimony from those close to him.\nAll the while, friends and members of Hunter Biden\u2019s family \u2013 including First Lady Jill Biden and his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden \u2013 sat behind him, watched and sometimes hugged him or held his hand during breaks in the trial. His half-sister Ashley cried during the defence attorney\u2019s closing arguments.\n\u201cJill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support,\u201d President Biden\u2019s post-verdict statement concluded. \u201cNothing will ever change that.\u201d\nThe prosecuting attorney during his closing argument said the evidence presented was ugly and personal. He also said that it was overwhelming and it was necessary to show that when Hunter Biden filled out the federal background check application for a handgun, he knowingly lied when he certified that he was not using drugs.\nIn the end, a unanimous jury agreed. This guilty verdict means the president\u2019s son - the only surviving child from his first wife, who was killed along with his infant daughter in a car accident half a century ago \u2013 may face years in prison.\nHunter Biden now awaits sentencing for his conviction, but even after the judge decides his punishment his legal travails will not be over. He is also facing a September trial on charges of failing to pay $1.4m in federal income taxes.\nThat trial, coming less than two months before the election, may not contain the raw emotion on display in the Delaware courtroom, but it could prove more politically damaging for the president. Hunter\u2019s foreign business dealings and his financial ties to the president have been a source of continued scrutiny by Mr Biden\u2019s Republican critics.\nDrug addiction and the consequences of it have touched many American lives. Allegations of financial impropriety and tax fraud, however, may generate less sympathy from the voting public.",
    "Dog walkers are putting lives in danger by using a private runway to exercise their pets, an airfield owner claims. \nColin MacKinnon, who owns Strathaven Airfield in Lanarkshire, issued a safety plea after spotting a couple and their dogs on their traditional grass runway on Monday. \nWhen he approached them, he said that they told him: \"Oh, we were going to move if we saw an aircraft coming in.\"\nSeveral small, personal aircraft land at the airfield every day at speeds of 50-60mph (80-96 km/ph). \nThe airfield includes one of Scotland's only open-air microlight flying schools\n\"I was gobsmacked,\" the 63-year-old told BBC Scotland News. \n\"The engines on the airplanes only control the height - not speed like a car - so when they are landing it's quite quiet,\" he added.\nThe wind can also muffle the sound of the small and light planes as they land. \n\"We like to encourage everyone to come to the airfield, but safety is paramount,\" Mr MacKinnon said.\nThe independent, not-for-profit airfield covers about 50 acres. Its main grass runway is 530m (580 yards) long, and it has two smaller runways.\nMr MacKinnon said he finds pedestrians on the runway every two or three months. \n\"The danger comes especially if you are distracted and you can't hear the plane, but it is even more dangerous for pilots,\" he said.\n\"The most dangerous part of flying is when the pilot feels under pressure. \n\"Accidents start with a chain of events, so by telling people to stay off the runway we break the chain,\" he said.\nMr MacKinnon said that his airfield welcomed visitors and wanted to encourage people to join the aviation industry.\nThe airfield hosts flying lessons and has 32 of its own small aircraft, which mostly fit one or two people.\nThis includes lessons for traditional small aircrafts and open-air microlight planes.\n\"We're happy to show people the airplanes and about the hangars,\" he said.\n\"We have a walking path around the airfield that we started during Covid and a picnic area.\n\"But be sensible if you're going to go anywhere near where planes are going to be - speak to someone at the airport and ask for advice.\"",
    "The band formerly known as Easy Life have changed their name to Hard Life, after a threat of legal action by the brand owners of airline EasyJet.\nLast year, the indie band said EasyGroup was suing them because their name was too similar.\n\"We felt angry and powerless,\" frontman Murray Matravers told BBC News. \"But if our name affects them that much, I'll walk away from it - because it's not worth it.\"\nEasyGroup has said it would have been \"unfair\" to let the band use the Easy brand name without royalty payments.\nThe Leicester band announced their new name - and a new single, Tears - on Tuesday evening.\nThe band, which Matravers formed in 2017, has five members.\nThey found themselves locked in a battle with EasyGroup last year, after the company said the band had promoted their Life's a Beach tour, in 2021 and 2022, with a poster showing a plane in the style of EasyJet's orange livery but substituting the airline's name for their own.\nIn its claim, lodged with the High Court, EasyGroup also said the band had produced T-shirts bearing their name in the company's branded style and their website infringed its trademark with its similarity to EasyJet branding.\nEasyGroup said other companies paid to use its brand name.\n\"We cannot allow others to simply use it free, gratis and for nothing,\" a spokesperson said at the time. \n\"That would be unfair.\"\nIn October, the band said they were going to stop using the name Easy Life, following the legal threat.\nAnd they played their final show under their old name at KoKo, in London, on 13 October.\nIn an exclusive interview, Matravers told BBC News the row was \"the weirdest, most surreal thing\" that had happened to him. \n\"I mean, it's absolutely nuts,\" he said.\n\"We didn't get into music to fight huge corporations in legal battles, obviously.\"\nThe band said they could not afford to take the matter to court - but now, he was \"over it\".\n\"The name doesn't change anything - it doesn't change who I am as an artist,\" Matravers said. \n\"We made our peace with it.\"\nAnd when it came to deciding a new name, there had been no question what to choose.\n\"All of us, unanimously in the group, turned around and said, 'It's got to be Hard Life, surely,'\" Matravers said.\nThe band did brainstorm other names but kept returning to Hard Life.\nIt was similar to when he had inspiration for a song, Matravers said. \n\"I've learnt that the first idea is always the best, so I've kept that same philosophy with the band name,\" he said.\nAnd whenever friends had asked him what the new name was going to be, it had always raised a smile or a laugh. \n\"So it just feels appropriate,\" Matravers said.\n\"I'm a white middle-class man from England - it's not to say I've had a particularly hard life either. \n\"It was more just, in response to what had happened, Hard Life felt like the obvious thing.\n\"It's a great name - I'm really happy with it.\"\nFor a while after the row, Matravers found it hard to work on music - but earlier this year, he found his flow again and wrote Tears.\nAnd the band say the song, \"about growing up - and lawyering up\", marks a new chapter.\nOne lyric makes a reference to EasyGroup owner Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou.\nEasyGroup's lawyers have objected to that lyric, calling it \"disparaging and defamatory\" and claiming it is a breach of the settlement it reached with the band. \nThey said EasyGroup and Sir Stelios were \"disappointed\" Hard Life have \"chosen to needlessly refresh the dispute, which the band chose to settle several months ago\".\nBut Matravers said he wanted to use the music to reflect what the band had gone through.\nSo what's next for Matravers and his bandmates?\n\"We want to tour - we want to get out there, we want to play festivals,\" he said, adding their fans had been \"incredible\".\n\"Everything's brand new - we're hitting the ground running with this new song, who knows where we'll go next?\" Matravers said.\n\"I'm just so excited to be out and about again.\n\"Hopefully, we can put this chapter behind us and move on - and focus on the music again.\"",
    "Police in China have arrested a 55-year-old man after four US university tutors were stabbed at a public park.\nThe Iowa Cornell College instructors were taken to hospital after a \"serious incident\" during the daytime attack in the northern province of Jilin, a college statement said.\nIowa Representative Adam Zabner said his brother, David, was one of the four instructors injured in what he described as a stabbing.\nChina's foreign ministry said that none of those injured were in a life-threatening condition.\nPolice said an assailant with the surname Cui clashed with one of the Americans and then stabbed the person. He went on to injure three other US visitors and a Chinese tourist who tried to come to their rescue.\nMr Zabner said the group of instructors had been visiting a local temple on Monday when they were attacked by a man with a knife.\nHe said his brother had been stabbed in the arm at Beishan Park in Jilin city and was recovering well in hospital.\n\"My family is incredibly grateful that David survived this attack,\" he told the BBC. \n\"We\u2019d like to see David home in Iowa as soon as possible,\" he added. \"We\u2019re deeply thankful to the state department and Iowa\u2019s federal delegation and understand that they are working hard to make that happen.\"\nCornell College said the four instructors had been teaching \"as part of a partnership with a university in China\". The group had been accompanied by a member of Beihua University at the time of their visit to the park on Monday.\nChina's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that police believed the attack was \"an isolated incident\" and that China was \"one of the safest countries in the world\".\n\"We believe this will not damage relations with other countries,\" he added. \nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said on X/Twitter that the US was \"deeply concerned\" by the stabbing. \n\"Our team has been in touch with these Americans and our PRC counterparts to ensure that the victims\u2019 needs are met, and appropriate law enforcement steps are being taken,\" he said. \"We wish them a speedy recovery.\"\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds said that she was in contact with the department about the \u201chorrifying\u201d attack. \n\u201cPlease pray for their full recovery, safe return, and their families here at home,\" she wrote on X/Twitter. \nImages of the incident circulating online appear to show at least three people bleeding and lying on the ground. \nHowever, the pictures appear to have been quickly censored on China's internet. \nOn Tuesday, searches for terms such as \"foreigners Jilin\" produced no results despite the search term trending on Weibo.\nInternet users instead resorted to discussions under adjacent topics while some were also seen asking for more information about the incident.\nOnline commentator Hu Xijin, who is formerly the chief editor of China's Global Times, had earlier posted on Weibo that China has been seeing a growing number of foreign visitors and the Chinese are \"typically friendly\" toward them. He described the incident as a \"chance event\".\nThe post has since been removed.\nThere are also few reports about the incident in Chinese state media.\nMr Zabner said his brother, a Tufts University doctoral student, had visited China before and was on his second trip to the country with Cornell College.\nAccording to a 2018 news release from Cornell, the US school began a partnership with Beihua University that year to provide money for Cornell professors to live in China and teach a part of a course over a two-week period. \nThe partnership focused on computer science, mathematics and physics, Cornell said at the time. \nBeihua University serves 24,000 students in the north-eastern Chinese city of 4.4 million people.\nAmid tense diplomatic relations, Beijing and Washington have sought to re-establish people-to-people exchanges in recent times.\nChinese President Xi Jinping has unveiled a plan to invite 50,000 young Americans to China in the next five years, while Chinese diplomats say a travel advisory by the US State Department has discouraged Americans from going to China.",
    "Scientists have grown \"mini-guts\" in a laboratory to help understand the DNA changes that may play an important role in Crohn's disease. \nThe University of Cambridge researchers said the mini organs could be used to create the best individualised treatment for sufferers.\nOne in about 350 people in the UK have this lifelong form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), according to the university. \nPaediatric gastroenterology professor Matthias Zilbauer said cases have been rising worldwide, particularly in young children, \"but despite decades of research, no-one knows what causes it\".\nArthur, one of the children who took part in the Translational Research in Intestinal Physiology and Pathology study, said: \"I think it's quite cool to be part of the study.\"\nNow aged 11, he was nine when he was diagnosed, having been told he had toddler diarrhoea, dietary intolerances and even abdominal migraines.\nThe condition is characterised by inflammation of the digestive tract.\nSymptoms can have a major impact on quality of life and include stomach pain, diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue, and it can also lead to extensive surgery, inpatient admissions and exposure to toxic drugs.\n\"There are bad days and there are good days, but eventually you'll find the right medicine,\" said Arthur.\n\"Sometimes it can take a really long time, but eventually they'll find the thing that works for you.\"\nProf Zilbauer said: \"The organoids that we've generated are primarily from children and adolescents.\n\"They've essentially given us pieces of their bowel to help with our research.\"\nUsing the mini-guts, the researchers also found that switches, which modify DNA in gut cells, play an important role in the disease and how it presents in patients.\nThese switches are attached to DNA that turn genes on and off - or turn their activity up or down - leaving the DNA itself intact, but changing the way a cell functions.\nThese changes in Crohn's patients correlated with severity of disease.\nThe researchers also discovered the DNA changes are stable, which may explain why a patient appears to be healed but their inflammation has returned - the drugs are treating the symptoms, not the underlying cause.\nThe findings could help patients such as Arthur access effective treatment more quickly.\nThe research was largely supported by the Medical Research Council, in collaboration with the university's Milner Therapeutics Institute.\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    " At least 49 people from the Horn of Africa have died after their boat capsized off the coast of Yemen, according to the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM).\nAmong the dead were six children and 31 women.

    "A humanitarian aid worker, who went out to Ukraine two years ago to give out free pizzas, has been serving them up ever since.\nTom Hughes, from Hinton in Wiltshire, drives a truck with 11 ovens to bake pizzas for communities in the war-torn country.\nHe first travelled to the Poland/Ukraine border in March 2022, intending to stay a fortnight to help refugees fleeing from the Russian invasion.\nHe now manages a fleet of seven vehicles and two teams for the charity, HopeFull, one of which is based in Lviv and the other in eastern Ukraine where Russian bombardment is a daily occurrence.\n\"Most of the places we're working, there's absolutely no hope left,\" Mr Hughes told BBC Wiltshire. \n\"People are stuck in the middle of a horrendous war, feeling very forgotten, and there's nothing to smile about. \n\"The kids, especially, their lives, are ruined. \n\"We turn up and we put on upbeat music from loudspeakers and interact as much as possible to create a happy day,\" he added.\nThe team produce about 3,000 pizzas a day - mainly for women, children and the elderly - as many of the men are involved in defending the country.\nThe charity describes it as baking pizzas to give people a \"slice of hope\", when they need it.\n\"Every day mothers tell me that their child has smiled for the first time since the war began,\" said Mr Hughes.\n\"This to me is the biggest part of our work - combatting the deep trauma from the endless explosions and grief caused by the Russian aggression.\n\"It's a really easy way to get nutrition to places as you can cook a pizza in about a minute. \n\"It's sort of a luxury food. That sounds crazy, but out here it is an aspirational food product.\"\nBy November 2022 the charity was following the Ukrainian Army as it advanced towards the east of the country.\nThe team had to beware of anti-personnel mines scattered by the retreating Russian Army.\nOn one occasion Mr Hughes was working with colleagues in the newly-liberated Kherson, when they came under heavy artillery fire for five days and he said they were \"lucky\" to survive.\nSince then the charity has stayed at least 25 km (16 miles) away from Russian forces to avoid danger.\n\"Every night we listen to missiles coming into every eastern town and, along with the whole population, pray that it isn't going to be our building that gets hit,\" said Mr Hughes.\n\"Every tiny village has a score of fresh graves, and every family is mourning a fallen hero.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The head teacher and founder of an independent school has blamed Conservative and Labour policies for its forthcoming closure after 40 years.\nElizabeth Laffeaty-Sharpe said the number of pupils at Downham Preparatory School in Downham Market, Norfolk, had never recovered to pre-pandemic levels, falling from about 120 to just 40.\nShe said many parents could no longer afford the \u00a37,000 annual fees due to mortgage interest rate rises following the government's 2022 mini-budget, and that many feared rising fees should Labour win the general election.\n\"It's heartbreaking and I'm angry,\" said Mrs Laffeaty-Sharpe.\nShe said some circumstances affecting the school, including the Covid pandemic, were beyond anyone's control.\n\"But some of them, like ridiculous interest rates or having to pay \u00a34,000 a month for electricity - that could have been managed better,\" she said.\nShe said Labour's plans to charge private schools 20% value added tax (VAT), as well as ending business rate relief, were \"the last straw\".\nThe party hopes the moves will raise about \u00a31.7bn, to be invested into state schools.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer previously denied the policy was an attack on the independent sector, but said he wanted state schools to be just as good.\nConservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, meanwhile, has criticised the plans, saying they showed Labour did not understand the aspirations of hard-working families. \nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said he \u201cnever thought, in principle, that VAT should be applied to education\u201d.\nThe school has plans to mark its 40th birthday with a party before shutting this summer. \nThe news has come as a shock to parents including Hannah Doy, who has a child at the school and another in its nursery, which will stay open. \nShe said her son struggled at his state school and ended up at Downham Prep after a number of exclusions. \n\n\"He was a very angry and unhappy child,\" she said.\n\"He's come here and he is absolutely thriving. Academically, he's caught up after a year and a half of being out of the classroom.\n\"He's a happy boy. He has a group of friends, which he didn't have before. It's changed our lives. So we are absolutely devastated that the school is closing.\"\nFreya, nine, said: \"In some schools there are bullies. But in this school there are no bullies at all. It's such a small school - it's just really friendly.\"\nMrs Laffety-Sharpe said many parents of pupils with  had special educational needs and that their parents had turned to private schools because they could not find an appropriate space in a state school. \nNorfolk County Council said \u201ca very small number\u201d of children at the school had special educational needs and it was \u201cconfident\u201d it would find alternative places for them.\nIt said it was processing applications from 25 other families, and would let them know the outcome before the end of June.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "How much influence will TikToks and memes have on this year's general election?\nSpeeches, door knocks and interviews have always been a part of campaigning for political parties in the lead up to elections. \nBut now the battleground has extended to social media - especially to attract young people.\nParties have spent a lot of money on creating short, snappy content, but BBC research shows young people are also being targeted by misinformation. \n\nAccording to Gwenno Jones, who specialises in digital marketing, all parties are using platforms to target people of all ages.\nWith more than 80% of the population of the UK on social media, she believes they are able to use them to reach a majority of people.\n\"On average, we spend one to two hours a day online, so there is an opportunity to reach people frequently throughout the day in a way that's very familiar to them,\" she said. \n\"[You have] Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, and the reason they [the parties] use so many is that each one attracts an audience that's slightly different. TikTok for younger people and Facebook for people a bit older.\"\nBBC Wales put out a request to all parties in Wales to share details of how much they are spending on their campaigns, but none responded.\nAccording to data from Who Targets Me, Labour spent almost \u00a31.4m between the first week of May and June, while the Conservatives spent about \u00a3750,000.\nThe site's figures suggest that the Liberal Democrats spent around \u00a345,000, Reform around \u00a38,000 and Plaid Cymru around \u00a32,500.\nSome platforms such as Facebook allow paid political adverts, while others, like TikTok, do not.\nOwen Alun John worked as an advisor to the former first minister Mark Drakeford and said online campaigning can be as important, if not more important, than door-knocking.\nParties can now pay to advertise a campaign or candidate to a particular demographic, and he added: \"Perhaps people at home now are already seeing some of the candidates in their areas popping up on their [internet] page, Facebook site, even though they don't follow those individuals.\n\"And that's because advertising in political campaigns has been quite a significant part now of campaigning for a while.\n\"I think to some extent, it's more important than knocking doors because you only have so many volunteers, there are only so many hours in a day.\"\nJoin the discussion: Apply to join the BBC Wales election debate audience\nWhat election issues really matter to you?

    "A soldier who was court martialled and jailed for kissing a serviceman in the 1980s has said being among the first gay UK veterans to have their ceremonial cap badges returned has given him \"closure\".\nFormer private Steve Close, 61, spent six months in an Army jail and was placed on the sex offenders register after the kiss at a barracks in Berlin in 1983.\nRestoring cap badges to discharged service personnel was among recommendations made by the government-commissioned LGBTQ independent veterans review last year.\nMr Close, from Salford, Greater Manchester, will receive his badge in a  ceremony on Monday at his regimental headquarters in London.\nMr Close, who served in the Second Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, said: \"I am looking forward to wearing my cap badge next Remembrance Sunday with pride. For years I was too ashamed to attend any ceremonies.\"\nHomosexual relationships were banned in the armed forces until 2000 and any serving personel found to be gay could be jailed and sacked.\nMr Close's conviction by an Army court for gross indecency was pardoned in 2013 - the same year as computer pioneer and code-breaker Alan Turing. The changes came after years of campaigning.\n\"I have had to fight a long time for this,\" the former serviceman told BBC North West Tonight.\n\"My brother was in the Army and kept asking me to go to regimental reunions, but it was too painful.\"\nHe signed up at the age of 17, after being was attracted by the idea of life in the military. But he admitted the move was also because \"I was confused about my sexuality and thought it might help me\".\nHe said he tried to avoid one soldier he found attractive until the pair went out with a group of friends and they ended up together back at the barracks after most of the group had gone home.\nThe pair found a connection and kissed while they thought one of their colleagues was asleep in the room.\n\"He wasn't asleep and went straight to the guardhouse to report us,\" Mr Close said.\nBoth men were court martialled, jailed and then dismissed.\nThe incident also left Mr Close with the shame of being labelled a sex offender and placed on the sex offenders register.\n\"It meant I could not work with children or join the police or fire service,\" he said.\n\"I worked in some jobs where I was sacked without being able to explain what happened when they discovered my Army conviction.\"\nNow, fully employed as a caretaker with a housing association, he said feels he can finally move on with his life.\n\"This has brought real closure,\" he said.\nMore than a thousand veterans gave testimony to last year's review, which was led by the UK's first openly gay judge, Lord Etherton.\nMany described how they had been bullied, physically and sexually assaulted, thrown out of the military and often left without income or pensions.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

He also wrote a column for the Daily Mail.\nHe was an advocate for intermittent fasting diets, including through the 5:2 diet and The Fast 800 diet.\nThe 67-year-old father-of-four was reported missing after he set off for a walk from Agios Nikolaos beach - near where he was staying on the northeast side of the island - at about 13:30 local time (11:30 BST) on Wednesday.\nDespite an extensive search by the Greek authorities, his body was not found near Agia Marina beach until Sunday by local journalists, staff and the mayor.\nThe owner of Agia Marina, Michalis Antoniadis, told the BBC he is still in shock and feels guilt that Dr Mosley was not found sooner.\n\"We did our best,\" he said, adding that he was \"very sorry\" about the outcome. \nIt is thought that Dr Mosley died at around 16:00 (14:00 BST) on Wednesday, the day he went missing.\nPolice said the initial conclusion that he died of natural causes was based on the position his body was found in, as well as a lack of injuries.\nThe BBC has seen CCTV footage, taken near the Agia Marina beach bar, which appears to show Dr Mosley disappear from view as he slowly makes his way down a hillside close to where his body was later found. He then collapses out of view behind a wall.\nNew CCTV seen on Tuesday shows Dr Mosley walking through Pedi.\nHe is seen heading for a trail that leads towards Agia Marina 1.5 miles away, where he died.\nTributes to Dr Mosley have continued to pour in from both his former colleagues and members of the public.\nFriend and fellow broadcaster Dr Hannah Fry told the BBC's One Show about an instance in which Dr Mosley had saved a woman's life.\n\"Somebody collapsed in the BBC offices in the corridors, and he saw them collapse,\" said Dr Fry.\n\"He went over, he performed CPR on them for almost half an hour until the emergency services arrived.\n\"[He] saved her life, she's gone on to have two children.\"\nOne member of the public said that Dr Mosley \"had the ability to reach out to all walks of life\", while another said that she often uses his advice about breathing slowly to calm anxiety.

    "A woman left scarred after her breast implants ruptured is to receive \u00a3250,000 in damages, the High Court has ruled.\nShe was awarded the compensation in a medical negligence claim against the cosmetic surgeon involved in the procedure.\nThe 36-year-old mother of one, who is not being named, said: \u201cMy life has been hell for the last 15 years trying to fix this mess.\u201d\nThe woman, from west Belfast, underwent breast augmentation surgery at a private clinic near Birmingham in England in 2009.\nBut according to her lawyers the inappropriately-sized implants subsequently ruptured, causing wounds which became infected.\nDespite having the implants removed two years later, she suffered further complications and required a number of corrective surgeries between 2012 and 2022.\nShe eventually travelled to Turkey to obtain implants she felt satisfied with.\nMedical experts on behalf of the woman provided evidence about the extensive scarring to both her breasts and the psychiatric adjustment disorder allegedly developed as a consequence of the original procedure.\nLegal action was taken against a private healthcare firm and Dr Marcos Sforza.\nWith the company said to have gone into administration since proceedings started 10 years ago, a claim against the London-based surgeon was pursued.\nThe woman\u2019s solicitor, Brian Archer, said she had previously obtained judgment when no defence was entered.\nAt a further hearing to assess the level of damages, the plaintiff gave evidence about how she had been affected.\nBased on those submissions and medical reports, she was awarded \u00a3250,000.\nThe woman spoke of her ordeal since she had the procedure, aged 21.\n\u201cI was so young, the implants were too big, there was infection and for two years [after they were removed] I had no tissue there,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMy confidence has been knocked so much, I have been trying to fix this for years.\n\u201cIt affected my relationship with my partner and even when I took my son swimming, I didn\u2019t want to wear a bikini.\u201d\nThe woman said that after carrying out research and \u201creaching out\u201d to an English-based model and celebrity, she decided to have further surgery in Turkey two years ago.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still some scarring, but they were the only ones who made me feel that I could live with this,\u201d she added.",

    "Move over Lord Sugar and the apprentices, 18-year-old Joshua and his class at Park Special School in Belfast are after your business.\nJoshua and other pupils have an award-winning company of their own.\nThe company, called Spectrum, was set up by Park School pupils to manufacture and sell suncatchers.\nBut while the pupils have learned so much, their teachers fear a lack of pathways post-19 will leave them with few opportunities.\nThat is because there are no laws in Northern Ireland which set a pathway for young people with Special Educational Needs (SEN) when they leave school.\nIt is a situation the principal of Park School, Bernie Davis, said needs to change.\nSpectrum was awarded the team of the year prize at the Northern Ireland Young Enterprise Awards for their suncatchers work. \nSuncatchers have been described as \"visual wind chimes\" and are popular ornaments.\nThey are pieces of stained glass craft hung in or near a window to collect the daylight, often in the shape of things like butterflies or rainbows.\nJoshua took part in manufacturing and marketing the suncatchers.\n\"The best thing about it was painting, it's very relaxing for me,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"I like to draw myself and it doesn't take a lot of time for me as I'm very quick at what I do.\"\nThe pupils were presented with their award at a ceremony at Belfast City Hall, and Joshua said they have more celebrations planned before the end of the school year.\n\"We got to go to City Hall, that we were very happy about,\" he said.\n\"We're planning to go on trips and stuff with our profit.\"\nNineteen-year-old Joseph took on the job of managing director of Spectrum and learned some important lessons.\n\"In a business, if you have a lot of individuals around you, the most important thing you need is to work together with efficiency included,\" he said.\n\"If I were to go and run a business myself, I'd probably run something similar to start off - something small.\n\"And then if I were to expand in business, maybe look to other products that might profit more and be more eye-catching to customers.\"\nTheir teacher Jillian West said making the suncatchers was very \"labour intensive\".\n\"Every Tuesday they also had a board meeting and students then would discuss what they were going to plan and do that day,\" she said.\n\"A lot of market research went into it and also a lot of actual marketing - making adverts, using the green-screen.\"\nShe said the students had learned \"loads of life skills\".\n\"Their communication is probably key, they've gone out and actually talked to members of the public, the judges at the trade fair, the confidence that they got from that,\" she said.\nLike Jillian West, principal Bernie Davis is \"super proud\" of her students and the business skills they have shown.\nBut she fears for their future careers when they leave school.\nUnlike many of their peers, they can face a \"cliff-edge\" with no straightforward routes into further education, training or work.\n\"Unfortunately with the lack of pathways and options for our children - SEN pupils leaving school at post-19 - the opportunities are not there,\" she said.\n\"In England they have a children and family act and that enables pathways to be put in place for the SEN children leaving.\n\"Unfortunately here there's no legislation and it's something I would love to see.\n\"Once the children come to 19 their statement stops and they're left, unfortunately.\n\"The life skills, the confidence and the self-esteem the children have attained from being part of the Young Enterprise programme, I would hate to see that that would be lost.\n\"Obviously they're forgotten about in society, and they have a lot to give to society and it's a shame to see them left like this.\"\nFor 17-year-old Clarke, the best part of being in the company was \"being with my friends, hard work, and just making sure everything was right and making sure it all goes to plan\".\nAnd like the other pupils, he now has business ambitions for the future.\n\"I would like to do work with people in business like working in shops, or, you know, retail or arts and crafts and stuff, because it's good,\" Clarke said.\n\"You have new friends and you're working with people that love doing the same thing as what you like to do.\"\nJoshua has similar goals.\n\"I'm probably going to put myself out there and see what's out there in the world,\" he said.\n\"I may even start my own business maybe in the future.\"",

    "An ex- footballer has admitted the serious sexual assault of a child and possession of thousands of indecent images of children.\nIan Heddle, 61, originally from Dunfermline, was originally charged after more than 270,000 indecent photos and videos of children were found in his possession.\nA police investigation led to him being further charged with the sexual assault of a child, believed to be around eight, in Thailand.\nHeddle was a midfielder for a number of Scottish clubs in the 1980s and 90s including St Johnstone and Dunfermline Athletic.\nHe pled guilty at the High Court in Glasgow and will be sentenced next month.\nThe court heard the 61-year-old, now living in Thailand, was arrested for the possession of indecent images at Edinburgh Airport in February 2023.\nThe court heard Heddle had been linked to the viewing and uploading of child abuse material from the web.\nThis was said to have been done at a property in Scotland where he stayed at while visiting from the far east.\nProsecutor Tracey Brown told the court: \"He was interviewed and spoke freely. He admitted to the possession of indecent images of children.\n\"He stated that there would be thousands of images and videos in his hard drive and that they were categorised into folders.\"\nMs Brown said there was a total of 272,936 photos as well as 4,001 clips.\nAfter his initial appearance in court he was bailed and ordered to remain in Scotland.\nDuring the police investigation, officers found three videos of him abusing a child as she slept in Chonburi in Thailand in 2019.\nHe was identified by the hair on his fingers and his wedding ring in the clips.\nThe court was told \"facial features\" could not be identified.\n\"However, the hands were relatively chubby with hairs on his fingers and he was wearing a distinct wedding band,\" the prosecutor added.\nHeddle was traced by police to Dunfermline in September 2023 where he had been working as a road cleaner.\nMs Brown: \"During an interview, he verified himself as the person in the pictures and videos carrying out the sexual assault of the child.\"\nMs Brown said further checks of his phone revealed \"contact offending\" involving Heddle and an unknown young female.\nHeddle's KC, Brian McConnachie, said from the very outset he had been \"co-operative\" with police. \nHeddle had been on bail, but Judge John McCormick told him: \"Your status has now changed and you will be remanded in custody.\"\nDet Insp Adrian Ure of Police Scotland's national child abuse investigations unit said: \u201cWe understand how distressing this has been for the girl and her family. We hope that the knowledge that he has now pled guilty will at least provide some comfort to them.\n\"Police Scotland is committed to protecting children and were able to pursue Heddle under legislation which protects children anywhere in the world from sexual abuse by British nationals.\"\nHeddle was also put on the sex offenders register.",
    "Five teenagers - including 16-year-old twins - have been jailed for killing a man in a planned attack.\nJunior Osborne, 50, died from a single stab wound to his neck in Narborough Road, Leicester, in September.\nThe five teenagers - aged 16 to 18 - all had an existing criminal record for carrying a knife and were described as \"a feral pack of youths\".\nAs all five were sentenced at Leicester Crown Court, Mr Justice Neil Calver said it had been a \"brutal, cold-blooded killing\".\nThe group included twins Nero and Nevardo McLean, of Upperton Road, Leicester, who celebrated their 16th birthday the day before the killing.\nDue to the seriousness of the offences, the judge lifted a reporting restriction banning the publication of their names, because of their age.\nMr Osborne - described as a \"much-loved\" brother and father - was stabbed while cycling in the city at 21:30 BST on 27 September.\nHe was taken to the Leicester Royal Infirmary, but died about an hour later.\nThe court heard the group had \"hunted down\" Mr Osborne.\nNero McLean admitted manslaughter, but last month was convicted of murder.\nHis brother Nevardo McLean and three other teenagers - James Williams, 18, of Pelham Way, Leicester; Moises Steiner, 18, of Dovedale Road in Thurmaston; and Theobald Budzwa, 18, of Ash Court, Groby - were convicted of manslaughter.\nNero McLean was given a life sentence, and must serve a minimum of 17 years before being considered for parole. \nNevardo McLean, Williams, Steiner and Budzwa were each given eight-year sentences, which they must serve two thirds of before being released.\nAll five were also convicted of having a bladed article in a public place, but not given any separate penalty.\nMr Justice Calver said: \"I am sure you all met up to plan an attack on Junior Osborne and you assembled with your knives.\n\"All except Nevardo wore face coverings and prior to the attack you filmed yourselves - you were excited and wanted to show off to your friends.\n\"As you went to find Mr Osborne your conversation was picked up on CCTV - you callously talked about stabbing him and stealing drugs and money.\"\nA five-week trial heard Mr Osborne was riding his bike when Nero McLean sprinted across Narborough Road and plunged a knife into his victim's neck, in front of children playing outside a shop.\nThe group then ran off and the murder weapon has never been recovered.\nIn mitigation, Nero McLean's barrister said the teenager had written a letter to the court to express his remorse for the murder.\nIt said: \"I understand the immense pain my actions have caused. Not a day goes by that I wish I could change what happened. I am really truly sorry.\"\nThe judge added: \"A more cruel and heartless killing is hard to imagine.\n\"You took the life of an innocent man. You have destroyed your own lives as well as those who loved Junior Osborne and who love you.\"\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s sentencing, the family of Junior Osborne released a statement which said he had come to the UK in 1997, following the volcanic eruption in Montserrat.\n\"He left his family behind and came to the UK to rebuild his life \u2013 a life that was cruelly taken away from him.\n\"While life wasn\u2019t easy, he had a family and children who loved him. He was a smart person who would go above and beyond to help others and made plenty of friends.\n\"While he wasn\u2019t perfect, he didn\u2019t deserve to die in such a tragic and awful way. He was taken from us in cold blood.\n\"The loss of Junior has left a huge void for all of us and a huge hole in our hearts. He was a much-loved husband, father, brother and stepfather.\"\n\"While we\u2019ve got justice for Junior, no sentence is going to bring him back. However, we hope the streets are a safer place now those who took him from us won\u2019t be able to roam the streets any time soon.\u201d\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A vegetable producer in Lincolnshire has gone into administration, putting about 200 jobs at risk.\nAdministrators have been appointed to QV Realisations Ltd, part of the AH Worth Group, after the company suffered \"significant losses\" in the past two years.\nPaul Meadows, a joint administrator at Teneo Financial Advisory Ltd, said QV Realisations ceased trading on Monday after efforts to find a buyer failed.\nAH Worth Group said its \"fresh and prepared operations\" at premises in Holbeach had been affected, but other businesses, including in Fosdyke, continued to \"trade as normal\".\nDuncan Worth, the group chief executive, said: \u201cThis is a very sad day for our business and especially all our colleagues affected at Holbeach.

    "Doctors are using a portable hand held laser device to treat patients with small bladder cancer tumours, with the patient able to go home on the same day. \nUrology consultants in Somerset started performing the Trans Urethral Laser Ablation procedure (TULA), at Yeovil Hospital last year.\nIt is now being performed at Musgrove Park Hospital.\nDr Sanjit Das, laser treatment lead and urology consultant at Yeovil Hospital, said: \u201cThe TULA device is already making a huge difference to both the experience and recovery after surgery for our patients.\"\nThe treatment is the latest in a series of day case procedures that are being offered to patients by Somerset NHS Foundation Trust.\nIt hopes to improve patient experience and free up beds for those who need a longer stay in hospital.\nPeople with these type of small tumours have traditionally needed to have surgery under general anaesthetic, but the laser procedure allows surgeons to provide treatment in a far less invasive way.\nDr  Das said: \u201cIt reduces the time a patient has to wait to be seen, as if the doctor detects a reoccurrence in a bladder tumour at their regular surveillance cystoscopy appointment, a biopsy will be taken there and then.\n\u201cIf a tumour is detected, then the laser is used to completely remove any abnormal tissue and stop any bleeding. \n\"The laser fibre is extremely thin, and the procedure takes between 10 and 20 minutes.\"\nDr Das said after the treatment the patients receive a single dose of antibiotics before being sent home on the same day. \nHe said it was a \"significant change\" from a previous arrangement. \n\u201cIt also means the patient doesn\u2019t need to come back at a later date for a general anaesthetic and hospital stay, which would understandably cause them to become anxious.\n\u201cAnd patients don\u2019t need any special preparation before coming in for this laser treatment as an outpatient \u2013 they can eat and drink as normal on the day,\u201d he added. \nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "The leaders of Scotland's five biggest political parties went up against one another on Tuesday night. \nHere are my main takeaways from what happened.\nElection campaigns can sometimes be quite a scripted affair, full of \u201clines to take\u201d and pre-prepared remarks delivered at stage-managed events.\nA sure way to crack through that is to introduce the wildcard, which is an ordinary member of the public. So we went with a hundred of them.\nAnd that brought out some of the frustration with the political class that perhaps hasn\u2019t been at the forefront in debates which didn\u2019t have the general public in the driving seat. \nOne particularly fiery exchange was punctuated by the questioner shouting \u201cstop passing the buck!\u201d.\nOne audience member managed to pull up John Swinney for the SNP\u2019s record of delivery on past manifesto promises, while simultaneously criticising Douglas Ross for not backing welfare measures. \nAnother accused Anas Sarwar of \u201cgiving us lie after lie\u201d.\nAnd yet another took the whole panel to task about the treatment of care-experienced people, saying \u201cshame on the lot of you\u201d.\nOne woman raised the striking story of her 93-year-old mother waiting hours for an ambulance.\nThis is the sort of thing John Swinney deals with at First Minister\u2019s Questions every week - but there it comes from the other leaders, not while having to look the member of the public concerned in the eye.\nAnd it allowed those perhaps further from government, like Alex Cole-Hamilton of the Lib Dems, to join in with the pox-on-all-your-houses theme by saying both administrations have been in power for \u201cfar too long\u201d, and that \u201cthe people are not buying it\u201d.\nThere hasn\u2019t been a huge amount of discussion of independence during this campaign so far.\nThe SNP seems to have landed on a strategy of emphasising it when speaking to its own base - its conference-style campaign launch was thick with talk of the constitution.\nBut when facing the electorate at large, the topic has been buried. It was barely mentioned in either of the previous TV debates.\nHere, things were different - thanks to the audience, who posed a direct question. And the answers were revealing.\nLorna Slater actually seemed more on the front foot - she was the one who raised independence first, and she was the one who was chasing the other party leaders on the topic.\nJohn Swinney did come in to offer his own support for independence - no surprises there - but for the most part he physically stood back to let Ms Slater make the running.\nThis is fascinating when you consider the extent to which the Scottish Greens are targeting pro-independence parties who have been almost uniformly coralled by the SNP in the past.\nDouglas Ross\u2019s response was reasonably predictable, given the way his party has carved out a recovery in Scotland by cloaking itself in the Union flag. \nThe Lib Dems also stuck to a \u201ccan\u2019t we talk about something else\u201d position.\nAnas Sarwar, meanwhile, is pivoting Scottish Labour\u2019s standpoint from one of hard opposition to independence to a more agnostic position. \nHe says he doesn\u2019t care how people feel about independence, as long as they will come with him \u201con this part of the journey\u201d for this election.\nHow that might work in the Holyrood campaign in 2026 is a much more difficult question, but he seems happy to cross that bridge later.\nThis was a debate between party leaders but the past few months have seen a bit of a crisis of leadership in Scottish politics.\nDouglas Ross was the only one who is actually standing in this particular election. But his decision to stand has proved so controversial with his colleagues that he\u2019s already announced his resignation as Scottish party leader.\nHe will be relieved that there was relatively little reference to that from his rivals, despite it seeming like a bit of an open goal.\nPerhaps John Swinney demurred because it has only been six weeks since his SNP predecessor Humza Yousaf self-destructed in similarly spectacular fashion.\nAnd Anas Sarwar was perhaps too busy going after Mr Swinney and the record of the Scottish government, given Labour\u2019s target seats are all SNP defences.\nYes, there are key marginal seats which are contests between the SNP and the Conservatives and indeed the Lib Dems.\nBut increasingly Mr Swinney and Mr Sarwar only have eyes for each other in these debates. As he prepares to exit the stage, they may have judged that Mr Ross simply isn\u2019t worth their time now.\nThis is a UK election, but matters which are fully devolved to Holyrood are increasingly prominent in the campaign.\nAs noted, one question was directly about the state of the NHS; Douglas Ross acknowledged that \u201cit is devolved, but it is the issue people are most passionate about on the doorsteps\u201d during the election campaign.\nIt was notable in the seven-way UK debate last week that the SNP\u2019s Stephen Flynn was able to launch attacks on other leaders without facing a tremendous amount of scrutiny of his party\u2019s record in government in return.\nHere, it",
    "Convicted sex offender Gary Glitter has been ordered to pay at least \u00a3508,000 to a victim he abused when she was 12 years old.\nA High Court judge ruled that the disgraced pop star - whose real name is Paul Gadd - subjected the claimant \"to sexual abuse of the most serious kind\".\nThe woman brought her claim after Gadd was convicted in 2015 of abusing her and two other young people between 1975 and 1980.\nGadd, 80, was jailed for 16 years and released in February last year after serving half his sentence. He was returned to prison six weeks later after it was found he had breached his licence conditions by allegedly viewing downloaded images of children.\nIn a 13-page ruling released on Tuesday, High Court judge Mrs Justice Tipples said the woman was entitled to damages of \u00a3508,800 - but there will be a further decision on adding interest to that sum. Gadd may also have to pay his victim's legal costs. \n\"There is no doubt that the claimant was subject to sexual abuse of the most serious kind by the defendant when she was only 12 years old and that has had very significant adverse impact on the rest of her life,\" Mrs Justice Tipples said.\nThe sum Gadd has been ordered to pay includes \u00a3381,000 in lost earnings and \u00a37,800 for future therapy and treatment.\nThe court was told that as a result of his abuse the woman who brought the claim - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been unable to work for decades.\nHer barrister Jonathan Metzer said her experiences had a \"dramatic and terrible impact\" on her education, work and personal relationships.\nIn her ruling, Mrs Justice Tipples said that Gadd had failed to even acknowledge the compensation claim had been lodged against him - meaning he had lost the case by default - and had not responded to an offer to speak to the court on a prison video link when it came to deciding the exact amount he should pay.\nThe judge said that the sexual assault and rape began when Gadd had plied both the victim and her mother with champagne, after meeting them backstage at a concert, and then separating the 12-year-old.\nFollowing the assaults, the girl\u2019s behaviour rapidly deteriorated and she dropped out of school aged 13.\nThe mental scarring had been so deep, said the judge, that the victim had changed her identity to try to scrub from her memory Gadd saying her name.\n\u201cShe has great difficulty sleeping, suffered nightmares, intrusive flashbacks and memories, together with panic attacks and depression,\u201d said the judge.\n\u201cThe claimant has ground her teeth down to the point of breaking them... The claimant has no self- confidence and, at times, she has felt suicidal and has taken overdoses.\n\u201cShe is plagued by thoughts of shame and self- blame, which despite an understanding of the nature of the abuse, she finds she cannot shake off.\u201d\nMrs Justice Tipples awarded almost \u00a38,000 to the victim to pay for complex psychological therapy and treatment - and said that a further \u00a3381,000 of the damages specifically covered the victim\u2019s loss of earnings.\n\u201cI am quite satisfied that the claimant has been unable to obtain any meaningful employment throughout her life as a result of the consequences of the serious sexual abuse she suffered by the defendant at such a young age.\n\u201cHer education was ruined and she has suffered severe psychiatric injury for the rest of her life.\u201d",
    "Staff at a bookshop say they have been sworn at and verbally abused because of a window display celebrating LGBTQ+ Pride month.\nBrowsers Bookshop in High Street, in Porthmadog, Gwynedd decorated its two front windows with Pride rainbow flags and books about the gay community at the start of June.\nStaff said most people have been supportive, but a small number have shouted abuse at the owner and called her a \u201cdisgrace\u201d.\nSian Cowper said she would not change the display, and is determined to show that the shop is a safe space where all are welcome.\nThe display went up for the start of Pride month, which runs for the whole of June.\nBut four days later she said she was sworn at by people who had seen it while passing.\n\u201cI was tidying shelves near the window and could hear two men talking loudly about how they were going to come in and give me a piece of their mind.\n\u201cI went out to them \u2013 next thing, they were swearing and shouting abuse at me and calling me a disgrace.\n\u201cThey were so loud that a gay couple who were in the cafe next door heard them, and came over to check I was all right.\n\u201cIt left me quite shocked and tearful for a good hour afterwards.\n\u201cI was brought up to believe that a man shouldn\u2019t shout swear words in the face of a woman.\n\u201cIt was quite an insight into the prejudice that people in the LGBTQ+ community have to live with.\u201d\nStaff said it was the first of three incidents that day, and they have continued to hear comments from people passing the shop over the past week.\nBut they stressed that the comments and abuse have come from a minority of people, with no pattern of whether they were local or visitors to Porthmadog.\nMrs Cowper added: \u201cThere is a bigger picture here \u2013 we put all sorts of things in our window displays, sometimes controversial, often not.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had books on mental health and women\u2019s health to local history and local authors.\n\u201cIn a few weeks\u2019 time, the books in the window will go back onto the shelves - but anyone who\u2019s suffered homophobic abuse can\u2019t just put that experience back into a box.\n\u201cWe are a small independent bookshop, part of our community and I want people to know that we\u2019re open and welcoming to everyone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a relief that the majority of people have been very supportive \u2013 over the last few days the messages of support have outnumbered the negative comments.\u201d",
    "On 4 July people in Somerset will vote in all-new constituencies with boundaries having been redrawn to even out the number of voters. Here is all you need to know about the new seat of Taunton and Wellington.\nThe new constituency of Taunton and Wellington effectively splits the former seat of Taunton Deane in half.\nThe focus is now more firmly on the county town and the neighbouring market town of Wellington.\nIt's because the western and entirely rural portion of the old constituency has become part of a new Tiverton and Minehead seat.\nAll in all, the new Taunton and Wellington constituency is more urban than its predecessor, and geographically about half the size.\nThere are lots of public sector workers in Taunton and Wellington with big employers including Musgrove Park Hospital, the UK Hydrographic Office, and one of Somerset's biggest employers - Somerset Council.\nThis means the NHS is likely to be a big issue for local voters, as well as education.\nIn recent years, small-scale industry has been growing in the area, as has house building.\nThat's also the case in Wellington which has seen lots of new homes built and where a new train station is due to open next year.\nWater quality and pollution has also been widely discussed in the area, with part of the River Tone recently being awarded Bathing Water Status by the Environment Agency.\nGideon Amos grew up in Somerset and lives in Taunton with his wife and four children. \nHe is a chartered architect and town planner by trade, and has worked on renewable energy projects around the UK including offshore windfarms. \nMr Amos was awarded an OBE for services to sustainable development.\nHe told BBC Somerset his top three priorities are the NHS, cost of living and the environment. \n\"The Conservatives have failed to build the new hospital in Taunton they promised people at the last election and it\u2019s now increasingly difficult to access GPs and dentists,\" he said.\n\"Lib Dems would start to recruit and train 8,000 more GPs so everyone can get an appointment within seven days.\"\n\nCharles Hansard lives in Wellington with his wife and three children.\nHe served in the Army for 12 years before going on to work in industrial recycling  and on combustion projects on oil refineries and coal fired power stations.\nMr Hansard told BBC Somerset his top three priorities are local roads being well-maintained, the lack of NHS dentists and school funding.\n\"There is a crisis in education. A head teacher approached me only last week about the financial issues in her school,\" the Reform UK candidate said.\n\"If the next government is Labour, the state schools in Taunton and Wellington will see a flood of pupils and there are certainly not enough places in some Taunton schools \u2013 only making the situation worse.\u201d\nRebecca Pow was elected Conservative MP for Taunton Deane in 2015 and is also a minister for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\nShe is a scientist and a former journalist who has lived in the area for more than 35 years bringing up three children with her late husband.\nMs Pow told BBC Somerset her top three priorities are: \"the full upgrade of Musgrove Park Hospital by 2030 with the new maternity unit coming first; the delivery of Wellington Rail station; the new Selworthy Special School rebuild\".\n\"I will also deliver the clear plan that is seeing the economy improve following the pressures of the pandemic, the Ukraine War and the energy crisis which means we can now continue to lower your taxes leaving you with more money in your pockets,\" she added.\nRyan Trower is a photographer and works at Bridgwater and Taunton College.\nHe has lived in Bathpool on the eastern edge of Taunton for seven years.\nThe Green candidate said his top three priorities are the NHS, affordable housing and \"pushing for water companies to be brought back into public ownership\".\n\"Defending the NHS: keeping it fully public, and and properly funded through taxing the super wealthy is my most important priority,\" he said.\nBrenda Weston was born in Taunton and joined the local Labour Party in 1980.\nShe has worked in social policy research and political activism, as well as serving as a local councillor and deputy mayor of Taunton.\nMs Weston told BBC Somerset her top three priorities were affordable housing, integrating the NHS and social care and enhancing children and family centres.\n\"The most important is a decent, affordable home to give every child a secure start in life,\" she said.\nMs Weston said she also wanted to see \"a 10-year house-building, renovation and eco-friendly programme, providing decent, affordable homes for everyone\".\nRochelle Russell, the Communist Party candidate, lives in Wellington.\nShe said she has lived and worked all over the country including in hospitality, youth work and adult social care, and has been a local councillor.\nMs Russell said her top priority is \"the provision of high-quality health and social care for all, particularly dentistry, which is responsive ",

    "Two former directors of BHS have been ordered to pay at least \u00a318m to creditors over their role in the collapse of the retailer eight years ago.\nA court found Lennart Henningson and Dominic Chandler liable for wrongful trading, misfeasance trading and misfeasance over their management of the High Street chain.\nBHS made headlines when it fell into administration with a billion pounds worth of trading liabilities and pension debts in 2016.\nIt came after retail tycoon Sir Philip Green sold the ailing business to Dominic Chappell, a former racing driver with no retail experience, for \u00a31 in March 2015.\nJust over a year into his ownership the chain went under, resulting in 11,000 job losses and a \u00a3571m pensions shortfall.\nSir Philip Green was heavily criticised at the time for agreeing to the deal, and later agreed a \u00a3363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap in the pension scheme.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Justice Leech ruled that Mr Henningson and Mr Chandler, who worked for Mr Chappell\u2019s company Retail Acquisitions, had breached their corporate duties by continuing to trade despite knowing there was no reasonable chance that BHS could avoid insolvency.\nEach must pay \u00a36.5m for wrongful trading and \u00a35.6m between them for the charges of misfeasance.\nThe men could face additional fines of up to \u00a3133.5m for misfeasance trading alongside Mr Chappell who himself faces claims from creditors. \nJustice Leech will make a further ruling on what more Mr Henningson and Mr Chandler owe later in June.\nFRP Advisory, the company acting as liquidator to BHS, brought the case against the directors on behalf of creditors owed money following the retailer\u2019s collapse.

    "This article contains minor spoilers for series 3 of Bridgerton.\nThe majestic world of Bridgerton has thrust a number of budding couples into the limelight over its three seasons.\nDaphne Bridgerton and the Duke of Hastings, Kate Sharma and Anthony Bridgerton and, now, Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton.\nWhile Penelope and Colin\u2019s love story is the focus of season three, there's another couple who've been there from the start: Will and Alice Mondrich.\nTheirs is a rare, established relationship in the Bridgerton world, and the two are long-married with three children.\n\"It\u2019s nice to know there is evolution to the character, and a whole roundness,\" Martins Imhangbe, who plays Will, tells BBC Newsbeat.\n\"They\u2019ve done excellent in carving these characters and these lives.\"\nWill and Alice (played by Emma Naomi) were first seen as friends of the Duke, then as owners of their own business and in season three they're living on a grand estate after a significant inheritance, becoming a part of high society known as \"the ton\".\n\"There's something about the working-class hero that people love,\" says Martins.\n\"About not wanting to be a part of society and being OK with that.\"\nMartins says the Mondrich family go on a \"complex journey\" navigating their new-found wealth and status.\n\"You see the scepticism and hesitation to be involved in high society, the pros and cons at the same time,\" he says.\n\"You can see the struggle that it\u2019s not as straightforward as \u2013 \u2018OK, now we\u2019re rich\u2019 and we\u2019re going to have a great time.\"\nMartins says the Mondriches aren't in Julia Quinn's series of Bridgerton novels, and as an actor the roles were \"almost a gift\".\nHe also says \"the complexities of having a bigger plot in the show\" mirrored the characters' journeys.\n\"It's almost like they're now the celebrities and don't know how to navigate that,\" says Martins.\n\"It was similar for us, we didn't know exactly how to navigate our new roles.\"\nBridgerton's been praised for the diversity of its cast and storylines, and Martins says representation is an opportunity that comes with a sense of responsibility.\n\"I feel very proud, being able to give that space and shine a light on that narrative,\" he says.\n\"Because we don't often see it, especially in period dramas - you hardly see a non-toxic, healthy, beautiful black family at the forefront.\n\"It feels like there's a responsibility to tell that narrative, to put in the work and be mindful of all the sensitivities and the nuances.\"\nBut he says he views it as a positive type of pressure.\n\"I don't see it as a burden,\" he says. \"I don't see it as like I have to be the spokesperson\u2026 the face for blackness.\n\"But I do feel a sense of honouring.\"\nThat\u2019s particularly true, he says, when Martins considers the inspiration for his character, Bill Richmond, a British boxer born into slavery, and thought to be the first black boxing entrepreneur in London.\n\"It fills me with pride to be able to honour these people, because oftentimes, these people are erased from history. I didn't know about Bill Richmond until I got the audition.\"\nRichmond is widely considered a boxing trailblazer who paved the way for Jack Johnson - the first black world heavyweight champion and an inspiration for Muhammad Ali.\n\"I think it\u2019s important that we do not erase history. And I think Bridgerton makes a strong appeal for that,\" says Martins.\n\"That's why it resonates with a lot of people because they can see themselves within it and they feel honoured.\"\nMartins relates more than you might think to the boxing role, having trained in real life.\nBut modern boxing is very different, he admits, to the Bridgerton time period.\n\"Now people do it because they enjoy the sport and it's a chance to exercise,\" he says.\n\"But in those days either you used boxing as a way to get out of your financial crisis or to put yourself in a better position for your family.\"\nMartins admits the physical side was a challenge too.\n\"I didn't know that you had to hold your hand a particular way. And the moves were a lot more robotic.\n\"I had to adopt that kind of posture, that kind of physicality. But I always try to bring a bit of flair, a bit of enjoyment and charisma.\"\nIf you look online, Martins' name has at points been linked with the prestigious James Bond role.\n\"I'll be thrilled\u2026 it's very flattering to be in that conversation,\" he says.\n\"I do love action films but I guess then you\u2019ve got to do the work [the role demands].\"\nIn true covert 007 style though, he doesn\u2019t give much away for what will come in the second part of season three.\n\"You can expect to see some tough decisions being made,\" he says.\nThe second part of Bridgerton's third season will be released on Netflix on 13 June.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "A glimpse of a mystery animal in a Wolverhampton canal has been confirmed to be a rare sighting of a beaver.\nPhotos and videos from excited onlookers on Wednesday and Thursday sparked an online debate as to whether the animal was an otter or a beaver - a mammal hunted to extinction in the UK hundreds of years ago.\nHowever, Harvey Tweats, a wildlife ranger at Trentham Estate in Stoke-on-Trent, ruled \"100% beaver\" on the sighting, adding the footage was \"remarkable\".\nBeavers - hunted in the early 16th Century for their fur, scent glands and meat - were reintroduced to selected sites in the UK some years ago, with Trentham among them.\nThere were at least two sightings last week, one in the canal and another in Smestow Brook.\nIn 2009, the Scottish government authorised the release of beavers from Norway in Argyll\u2019s Knapdale Forest, which Rewilding Britain said was Britain\u2019s first official reintroduction of a mammal species to the wild.\nSites in England followed, although it is currently illegal in the country to release beavers into the wild without a licence from Natural England.\nMr Tweats said: \"The wild population of beavers in England probably exceeds 1,000 animals, which are living in a range of habitats, with wild population centres in the south-west and Kent. \n\"Observation from European cities, such as Munich and Berlin, demonstrates that beavers can surprisingly thrive in urban environments \u2013 already wild beavers in England are living within cities, such as Exeter and Frome.\"\nHe added: \"I\u2019ve noticed in my work how accustomed beavers can become to the presence of people.\"\nBeavers are often referred to as ecosystem engineers due to their ability to shape natural environments to benefit other species, as well as slowing the flow of water which can help reduce the risk of flooding.\nA family of beavers was released at the Trentham Estate in March 2023, in one of the largest enclosures in the UK.\nMr Tweats said all of Trentham's beavers were safe and accounted for.\n\"Our beaver project has reintroduced beavers into a managed environment where the public can observe their activities, learn about their ecological benefits, and imagine a future where humans and beavers coexist harmoniously,\" he said.\n\u201cI advise members of the public to refer to the Beaver Trust\u2019s Beaver Code if they spot one, and maintain distance.\n\u201cAt Trentham we hope for a future where these fascinating creatures can be safely and legally reintroduced into their natural habitats across the Midlands.\u201d\nFollow BBC Wolverhampton & Black Country on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The Conservatives have vowed to reverse Wales's 20mph speed limit policy, should they win the general election.\nTories say they will pass a law in Westminster to override the decision of Labour Welsh government ministers in Cardiff.\nThe party's manifesto said \"local consent\" would be required for 20mph zones.\nFirst Minister Vaughan Gething accused the Conservatives of threatening an \"enormous assault\" on devolution.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said the party would try to seek the agreement of the Senedd for the legislation.\nConservatives also promised match funding for major road projects, such as the M4 relief road, should the Welsh government reconsider them.\nWales has had a 20mph speed limit in largely built-up areas since September last year.\nThe limit, imposed by the former first minister Mark Drakeford's government, sparked the largest petition the Senedd has ever received.\nChanges have been promised how the limit works by Vaughan Gething's government.\nRecent figures showed the number of people injured on 20 and 30mph roads fell by almost a third in the final quarter of last year.\nSpeed limits in Wales are devolved, and the Senedd can pass regulations to change them. The Senedd can also create offences in areas that are devolved - i.e. controlled from Cardiff.\nThe Conservative manifesto says the party would use a Westminster bill to effectively reverse a decision of the Senedd and the Welsh government, through a \"Backing Drivers Bill\".\nIt said local communities would be given a \"legal right to challenge existing zones\".\nIf it happened it would be the first time a Westminster bill would be used to repeal a significant Welsh law.\nParliament is still able to make law in Wales but there is a convention that this is done with the agreement of the Senedd.\nOther plans in the manifesto include a promise to cut national insurance by 2p by April 2027.\nThe Welsh Secretary David TC Davies rejected that the plan would undermine devolution.\nSpeaking to S4C's Y Byd yn ei Le programme, Mr Davies said law and order is not devolved \"so we have the right, in my opinion, to look at what the Welsh government is doing and ask if that's something that's part of their responsibilities\".\n\"The Welsh government must listen to the voice of the people in Wales - half of a million of whom have said they're unhappy\", Mr Davies said, referring to the petition.\n\"I would suggest that the Welsh government is trespassing into reserved areas - for example, law and order and justice,\" adding, \"I don't accept that this undermines devolution\".\nIn first minister's questions in the Senedd, Welsh Labour leader Vaughan Gething told the Senedd that the manifesto \"represents an an enormous assault on devolution in the drivers bill\".\n\"It is an absolute disgrace,\" he said.\nA Welsh Labour spokesperson said: \"Our Welsh Labour Government has shown its commitment to listening to people on 20mph by reopening the consultation process, and just last week, we saw that collision rates in 20- and 30mph zones have fallen.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: \"The UK government has no power over speed limits in Wales. \n\u201cThe wheels are coming off Rishi Sunak\u2019s campaign and he\u2019s hoping that this latest populist tactic will get him back on track. It won\u2019t.\"\nThe manifesto also promised match funding to the Welsh government to reconsider the axed M4 Relief Road motorway upgrade around Newport, the third Menai crossing and wider improvements to the A55 and the A483 around Wrexham.\nMajor road projects were scrapped in Wales as part of the Welsh government's roads review under Mark Drakeford.\nSince Vaughan Gething has become first minister, Transport Minister Ken Skates has suggested that a third crossing could be considered,.\nThe Conservatives promised to fund rail upgrades at Padeswood to \"unlock the potential for the wider improvements on the Borderlands line\" and facilitate the electrification of the North Wales Main Line.\nThe manifesto says the party would deliver a nuclear power station at Wylfa. \nThe Welsh Conservatives said they would seek the consent of the Senedd to pass the law, should they return to power.\nThe Westminster Parliament can technically pass any legislation to amend laws in Wales, although doing so could prove politically difficult.\nThe Senedd has a process where it agrees a motion whenever Westminster passes laws that impact its powers.\nBut it is not legally binding and the UK Parliament is not required to oblige when a motion is rejected. \nA Welsh Conservative spokesperson said: \"Labour's 20mph speed limit will hit the Welsh economy by billions when we should be taking bold action to kickstart the economy and create jobs.\n\"The UK government will work with the Senedd to pass a motion to show their support for the bill to apply to Wales, reversing Labour's damaging 20mph speed limit and devolving power further down to local people who know their communities best.\"\nControl over speed limits was devolved to Wales in 2017.\nBy Da",
    "A mother whose baby's life was drastically improved by a liver transplant has encouraged people to \"have a chat\" with loved ones about organ donation.\nJen said without his donor and a medical team at Birmingham Children's Hospital, Henry, now one, \"wouldn't be here\".\nHe was diagnosed with biliary atresia shortly after birth, which occurs when ducts which carry bile from the liver to the gall bladder become blocked.\nJen, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, said the conversation about donation \"could save someone's life\".\nHenry was sent for tests after newborn jaundice failed to clear and transferred to the hospital's specialist liver unit when he was three weeks old.\n\"He was quickly seen by lots of specialists and doctors,\" Jen said. \"It was quite overwhelming. I was so upset and worried.\"\nA medical procedure to help the bile drain from his liver into the gut only worked temporarily and doctors decided Henry needed a transplant.\n\"It felt like a very long wait, though in hindsight, we weren't waiting too long,\" his mum said. \n\"We were just very anxious waiting for that phone call which we knew we could receive at any time.\"\nWhen it came, Henry had a seven-hour transplant operation the day after the call.\nJen said the improvement was immediate and \"we couldn't believe it was working so quickly\". \nNow home, Henry is thriving and recently enjoyed his first family holiday.\nJen described his medical team as \"incredible\" and \"part of our family\".\n\"We are just so grateful to our donor. It's such a selfless thing for them and their family to do,\" she added.\n\"Thanks to them, he is happy and living as a one-year-old should.\"\nShe encouraged people to \"have the chat about organ donation\" with loved ones.\n\"That conversation could save someone's life, just like Henry\u2019s,\" she added.\nKylie Martin, a liver nurse specialist at Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital, said Henry was \"an amazing young boy\".\n\"To see him now with his smile and character lights up our day,\" she added.\nThe hospital said there were currently more than 7,600 people in the UK waiting for a transplant. \nFollow BBC Birmingham on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Ahead of the upcoming general election on 4 July, BBC South is taking its red sofa out and about to key constituencies across the region to hear what matters most to voters.  \nThe thoughts and concerns voiced by the public will then be put to the candidates standing in that seat.\nThis week, the sofa was in Aldershot, Hampshire - a seat that has voted Conservative at every election since it was formed in 1918. \nLeo Docherty held the seat for the Tories in 2019 with a majority of 16,000 votes.\nBut it is now seen as one of Labour's key targets, after the party took control of the area's council for the first time following the local elections in May.\nMaria, who has lived in the town most of her life, said the upcoming election was \"desperately important\".\nShe highlighted policing and anti-social behaviour as issues she would be voting on\n\"I've been up to the police station and there's no one there and you get put through to Southampton, and that's not on,\" she said.\nMaria said there needed to be \"some [police] presence in Aldershot\", adding that there was \"no one for miles\" - after another nearby station in Farnborough closed down.\nMatthew, who lives in Aldershot and works as a floor layer, labelled the election \"the most important one in my lifetime\".\nHe said regenerating high streets, particularly Aldershot's, was a key issue for him.\n\"The whole place just wants a bit of money spent on it, tidying up, regenerate the place, get the shops back open again, lower the prices of the shop rents and get people in there.\"\nOn what he would like to ask the candidates standing, he said: \"I'd like to know what they're going to do for local businesses, local towns and people that were brought up in the area.\"\nDawda is a part-time teacher, and originally from the Gambia in West Africa.\nHe said he wanted a \"stronger government\" with \"confidence\" that would \"help people more\" - especially single parents.\n\"The government should do more to help single mum and dads, and give them special grants rather than alienate them through universal credit - which is extremely tough and frustrating,\" he said. \nHe also said education was a key issue for him.\n\"An educated economy is a prosperous one,\" he said. \nHaving heard from the people of Aldershot, we posed their questions to the candidates vying to represent the town as its MP come the 5 July.\nWe moved the sofa somewhere a bit more private, and put the questions to four of the six candidates standing in the seat.\nIncumbent Conservative candidate Leo Docherty said: \"We've got to ensure town centres are vibrant places of light.\"\nHe highlighted ongoing work to regenerate Aldershot town centre and said it needed a \"high degree\" of residential buildings right in the middle of the town, meaning \"those local people can then use shops in the town centre, so that those shops are kept busy\".\nOn policing and anti-social behaviour, Mr Docherty said the government had to ensure \"there are more police on the beat\".\nHe added: \"We are delivering more police, ensuring high streets and town centres are safe and I'm working with the Police and Crime Commissioner, Donna Jones, to deliver that.\"\nLabour candidate Alex Baker said: \"I feel our community has been taken for granted over the last five years of Conservative government - we've got to change our approach.\"\nShe said as a local resident herself, she had been \"really frustrated by how run-down the town centres are\" and highlighted Labour plans to \"bring town centres back to life\".\nIn answer to questions about policing and anti-social behaviour, she referenced Labour's plans to hire 13,000 new police officers across the country.\nShe added that she would \"fight to make sure\" that Aldershot got its \"fair share\" of those proposed new officers.\nPaul Harris, who is standing for the Liberal Democrats, said improved public services were \"what we need across the whole country\".\n\"They've been neglected for years,\" he said. \nHe said the number of community police officers had \"dramatically reduced\", and needed to be \"substantially increased\" as they were \"very valuable\".\nOn how he would help to restore confidence in government, Mr Harris said: \"Tell the truth - that would restore confidence.\"\nOn the issue of high streets, Reform UK candidate Trevor Lloyd-Jones said the party planned to introduce a 4% online sales tax on big internet retailers.\nHe said they would \"use that to fund a cut in business rates for small businesses on the high street\".\nHe also referenced a party pledge to recruit 40,000 police officers over a five-year period.\n\"The police force needs to be freed from a lot of bureaucracy, and form filling that they do right now, and to put more powers in the hands of  experienced local police officers to deal with all those low level crime issues,\" he added.\nGreen party candidate Ed Neville and Hampshire Independents' Steve James-Bailey are both also standing in the constituency.\nA full list of candidates standing in Aldershot, as well as in every seat ",
    "A new campaign has been launched to save the Eriskay pony, once used on crofts throughout the Western Isles.  \nThe mid-sized ponies were used to carry baskets of peat and harvested seaweed - or  even children on journeys to school. \nDeclines in their numbers started when other breeds and then tractors replaced the Eriskay before World War Two. By the early 1970s only about 20 survived.\nNumbers have recovered to about 400 today, but Eriskay Pony Society said more help was needed to ensure its survival.\nEriskay lies between South Uist and Barra towards the southern end of the Western Isles' island chain on Scotland's Atlantic coast.\nThe isle is famous for the grounding of the ship SS Politician and its cargo of 250,000 bottles of whisky, on 5 February 1941.\nEriskay ponies were used for transporting whisky salvaged from the wreck.\nAuthor Compton MacKenzie used the SS Politician as the basis of his book Whisky Galore in 1947. \nAn Ealing comedy of the same name followed in 1949. The film was remade in 2016.\nSteve McMinn, of Eriskay Pony Society, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the ponies were a hardy and clever breed.\nHe said: \"They are absolutely fantastic.\n\"They really like having something to do. They are very quick to learn, with a great temperament.\n\"Every croft had to have something to do the work before tractors took over.\n\"By the 1970s they were down to about 20 left on Eriskay and some on Barra.\"\nThe society is working with Rare Breeds Survival Trust and genetics experts to identify suitable matches between mares and stallions for breeding.\nMr McMinn said: \"With such a small population there is a risk of increasing the inbreeding.\n\"Getting the numbers up is a slow process.\"\nMr McMinn said the society was also talking to the National Pony Society about having Eriskays added to its list of recognised breeds.\nHe said: \"The NPS list is used by a number of folk as being the definitive list.\n\"It is really quite important its seen as a native breed.\"\nNPS said it had recently set up a working group to discuss the Eriskay pony.\nThe Eriskay is described as a mid-sized pony.\nFoals are born a dark colour and as they grow older their coats turn grey and later white.",
    "Plans to host events potentially attended by thousands in a quiet village have been approved. \nSouth Gloucestershire Council's licensing sub-committee has given the green light to an annual series of summer events at Severn Beach on the outskirts of Bristol. \nThe plans allow for outdoor concerts, plays, dance performances and a pop-up bar to all take place on the seafront at Promenade Gardens.\nPilning & Severn Beach Parish Council chairman Nick Davies, of Severnside Events, which submitted the application, said it would create a \"vibrant front\" for the community. \nThe plans were devised by a group of locals aiming to revitalise the once-thriving seaside resort next to the M4 Prince of Wales Bridge.\nPlanned events also include a classic car show and the annual Severnside Festival, which is relocating this year from the village hall recreation ground so organisers can manage it better.\nOne resident wrote in support of the application for a premises licence while two neighbours objected with concerns that parking was already a problem, the village was not big enough for a festival and that its peaceful nature would be ruined.\nBut Mr Davies told the panel that the festival had been running for many years and that a local farmer had agreed to allow a field to be used for parking, which would actually ease the issue compared with normal days despite an increase in vehicles.\nHe said that many visitors would not arrive by car because there were half-hourly trains and a bus route that stopped at Promenade Gardens.\nMr Davies said: \u201cWe want to showcase the seafront and our front garden \u2013 it\u2019s why Severn Beach exists. It remains a resort.\u201d\nHe said added that amplified live and recorded music would be located away from people\u2019s homes, while acoustic performances would take place in Frances Barr Walk.\nMr said that although the capacity would be for 5,000 people, it was more realistic that 1,000 to 1,500 would attend even the largest event.\nThe sub-committee granted a licence for up to 12 events a year, with no more than three per month, with music and alcohol sales from midday to 10pm from Friday to Sunday \u2013 an hour earlier than requested \u2013 and music performances restricted to three hours a day following a request from environmental health.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A student has created a clothing range which is designed to baffle artificial intelligence and protect its wearer\u2019s identity.\nKirsty Love, 23, from Bradeley in Stoke-on-Trent, studies knitwear fashion at Nottingham Trent University.\nShe said she designed the garments after researching similar clothing technology which has been used to help celebrities avoid being caught in paparazzi photographs by returning the glare from their camera flashes.\nMs Love said she intended to pursue a career in fashion technologies in the future.\nHer clothing range prevents artificial intelligence and digital profiling systems by using distorted images of bodies, faces and hands, she said.\nThe idea is that systems will struggle to distinguish the images on the garments from the physical features of the wearer.\n\u201cIt prevents it from digitally profiling the wearer and allows the wearer to have some anonymity when they\u2019re wearing the garment,\u201d she said, describing it as a kind of urban camouflage.\nWhen viewed by human eyes the clothes just look like ordinary garments.\nMs Love said she was alarmed by the ability of websites that can identify people with a photograph of their face and instantly provide a range of other details about who they are.\nShe used reflective yarn and special patterning to create a prototype range that includes a skirt, jumper and hat.\nShe did not believe it was something people could use to avoid detection, she added.\n\"It\u2019s different distorted images placed on top of one another.

    "Families at the centre of a major investigation into a Hull funeral directors say waiting for a decision on whether to bring charges is adding to their distress.\nHumberside Police began investigating Legacy Independent Funeral Directors on 6 March after receiving a report of \"concern for care of the deceased\".\nIn an update on Tuesday, the force said formal identification of 35 bodies and a quantity of ashes removed from the firm's premises on Hessle Road in Hull \"has now concluded\".\nAssistant Chief Constable Thom McLoughlin said the investigation was \"multifaceted and extremely complex\".\nHe added that two suspects - a 46-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman - remained on bail.\nBoth were arrested at Heathrow Airport after returning from a trip to the US, on suspicion of prevention of a lawful and decent burial, fraud by false representation and fraud by abuse of position. \nMr McLoughlin said: \"I want to offer my utmost assurance we remain committed to thoroughly, and sensitively, investigating, and working with our partner agencies to ensure the families and those affected receive the help and support they need.\nHe added: \u201cInvestigations into allegations of suspected financial and fraudulent activity are continuing, with dedicated, specialist investigation teams conducting various lines of enquiry and following up on numerous leads and information.\"\nPeter Welburn said he paid \u00a31,900 to Legacy for his wife Shirley's funeral and received what he thought were her ashes on 23 December.\nHowever, the former trawlerman said he was then informed Mrs Welburn, 72, was not cremated until 16 January.\nSpeaking about the delays in bringing charges, Mr Welburn said: \"How long is it going to go on for?

    "The Crown Estate has taken responsibility for a mill that was destroyed in an arson attack under ancient property laws.\nDalton Mills in Keighley has been derelict since a major fire in 2022, and there have been several other fires at the insecure site since.\nThe Crown took over the Victorian building, which is Grade II-listed, after the previous owner went bankrupt and a restoration project collapsed.\nYet the town's Civic Society has called for more security measures to be installed at the \"death trap\" mill to prevent further trespass and arson incidents.\nTwo teenage boys have been charged with arson in relation to the 2022 fire and are due to stand trial at Bradford Magistrates' Court in August.\nKeighley Civic Society secretary Jane Lee said: \"It is a death trap, it has been for some time. I'm not suggesting it will fall down on anybody.\n\"But if there were another fire started accidentally, or on purpose, then anybody who happened to be on that site would find it very difficult to get out.       \n\"There have been a number of fires now and our concern is that the site as a whole now is a danger to health, safety and life. \"\nThe BBC has established that the two title deeds for the site were \"disclaimed\" by the Treasury Solicitor in 2023.\nUnder the English and Welsh legal system, the freehold is now subject to an unusual and ancient process known as \"escheat\".\nThe mill was transferred into the custodianship of the Crown Estate, which is an independent, commercial business whose profits go to the Treasury.\nThat organisation says it cannot undertake any action that might be construed as an act of \"management, possession or ownership\".\nBut if someone offers to buy the land the Crown Estate can set up new deeds and keep the money from the sale.\nLocal authorities have powers under the Building Act 1984 to make dangerous buildings and structures safe.\nA Bradford Council spokeswoman said it did not own any of the complex but that the Crown Estate was \"aware of the current situation\".\n\"While the council does not have a duty to keep the site secure, it is recognised that the current threat level of further theft, vandalism and risk to the public\u2019s health and safety is significant. \n\"The council has been working in partnership with Historic England to agree the installation of some additional site security measures and these works will be carried out as soon as possible.\n\"We will continue to work with all parties to try preserve such an important heritage asset to Keighley and the whole district.\u201d\nA developer bought Dalton Mills in 2013 after it had been disused since the 1980s.

    "The US military says a Greek-owned ship in the Red Sea has been hit by an unmanned surface vessel launched by the Houthis in Yemen, causing severe flooding and damage to the engine room.\nThe Royal Navy\u2019s UK\u2019s Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) office said it received reports of a ship being struck on the stern about 66 nautical miles southwest of the rebel-held port of Hodeida in Yemen on Wednesday.\nThe vessel was taking on water, and not under the command of the crew, UKMTO stated. No casualties were reported.\nThe Iranian-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had targeted a Liberian-flagged vessel named Tutor using a sea drone.\nThe Houthis have been attacking shipping in the Red Sea in support of the Palestinians in Gaza, causing significant disruption to world trade.\nIn a statement, a Houthi military spokesman said the ship was attacked \"using an unmanned surface boat, number of drones, and ballistic missiles\", adding that the ship was \"seriously damaged, vulnerable to sinking\".\nThe ship was targeted \"because the company that owns the ship has violated the decision to ban entry into the ports of occupied Palestine\", the statement said.\nUS Central Command (CentCom) reported that \"one Iranian-backed Houthi unmanned surface vessel (USV)\" struck the Tutor, which it said was most recently docked in Russia.\nThe impact \"caused severe flooding and damage to the engine room\", it posted on X.\nCentCom added that its forces had \"successfully destroyed\" three anti-ship cruise missile launchers in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen in the past 24 hours, as well as one drone launched from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen over the Red Sea.\n\"This continued malign and reckless behavior by the Iranian-backed Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,\" it said.\nThe armed Houthi group sees itself as part of an Iranian-led \"axis of resistance\" against Israel, the US and the wider West, and has declared its support for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\nSince November, the rebel group has been carrying out attacks on ships they say are linked to Israel in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying their actions are in support of the Palestinians.\nThe US and the UK have carried out a series of attacks on Houthi targets inside Yemen in response, leading the Houthis to retaliate against ships it believes are linked to those countries.\nThe rebels' attacks on merchant vessels in the Red Sea prompted many shipping companies to stop using the waterway, through which about 12% of global seaborne trade passes.\nSeparately, the UN has said Houthis in Yemen have detained two more of its employees, bringing the total number of personnel seized by the group in the past week to 13.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said one of its staff members was among those detained. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X he was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about the situation.",
    "She played a clean-cut schoolgirl in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, then reinvented herself as a pop star with racy chart-topping hits.\nNow, two decades later, Holly Valance has become the UK poster girl for Donald Trump's bid to retake the White House.\nOn Wednesday, she hosted an exclusive fundraiser in London, where ticket prices started at $10,000 (\u00a37,800) and dinner cost $50,000.\n\"It's a Holly party,\" Nigel Farage, a fellow Trump supporter and friend of Valance, told the London Times before the fundraising event near the Chelsea Embankment. \"You can guarantee it\u2019s going to be enormous fun.\"\nIt is quite the public transformation for Valance, whose re-emergence as a political surrogate may surprise those in Britain and Australia who remember her as Felicity \"Flick\" Scully in Neighbours, or for her 2002 hit Kiss Kiss.\nBorn Holly Rachel Vukadinovic to Serb-British parents in Melbourne, Australia, in 1983, Valance attended a strict Catholic school where, she once said, wearing a hem too high could result in detention.\nShe began modelling for supermarket catalogues and ad campaigns by the age of 14.\nTelevision stardom came soon after, before she embarked on a heady - if brief - career as a pop star with one album that scored three top 10 hits, before she returned to acting, starring as Nina Volek in hit US drama Prison Break.\nHer politics, she has said, changed as she matured.\nValance, 41, who now lives in the UK with her billionaire property developer and Tory Party donor husband Nick Candy, told GB News earlier this year that \"everyone starts as a lefty\", but \"wakes up... then realise what crap ideas they all are\u201d.\n\"And then you go to the right.\u201d\nIn other interviews with the channel, she has expressed her dismay at \"woke-ism\" and the \"Nanny state\".\n\"The Australia I grew up in was unreal. It was so fun and we didn't seem to have all these problems... the woke stuff's really gone big in Australia,\" she said.\nOn sex education for children, she said: \"I don't think sexuality and children should be in the same sentence.\"\nOn climate change, she has called Greta Thunberg a \"demonic little gremlin\", who is celebrated despite \"giving children no hope\".\nClimate change is \"not a crisis... the air is better than when I was growing up\", she has said.\n\"Cleaner, cheaper energy is what we need... we can have it... but when you are putting all these restrictions on normal people trying to go about their business - it's just insanity.\"\nHer support for Trump, specifically, has firmed up as she has grown closer to Mr Farage. The veteran Brexit politician, who now leads the Reform Party, told the London Times that Valance had \"kept quiet for many years\".\nMr Farage invited Valance and her husband to Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s home in Florida, in April 2022.\nThe picture of the meeting, posted on X, formerly Twitter, cemented Valance's place  inside the Trump camp.\nAnd so to Wednesday night in west London, where Valance was the star of arguably the biggest election fundraising event for Trump outside the US, attended by the former president's son Don Jr, Mr Farage and some very wealthy American expats.\nBut her political influence does not stop there.\nValance has suggested that she had some influence in persuading Mr Farage to contest the Clacton constituency in the British election in July.\n\"I have been whispering in his ear for a long time,\u201d she told GB News.\nShe has also suggested that she would campaign for Mr Farage.\n\"If he asks me, then probably,\" she said.\nHowever, she wondered whether \"anyone wants to see me knocking on their doors anymore... Maybe 20 years ago\".",
    "US officials have played down Wednesday's arrival of four Russian naval vessels in Cuba for military drills. \nThe visit of the vessels - which include a nuclear-powered submarine and a frigate -  have been seen as a show of force amid Moscow's tensions with the West over the war in Ukraine. \nThey are anchored at the Havana Bay - some 90 miles (145km) from the US state of Florida. \n\"We of course take it seriously, but these exercises don't pose a threat to the United States,\" the Pentagon said.\nThe Russian moves were consistent with \"routine naval visits that we've seen under different administrations,\" press secretary Sabrina Singh added.\nRussia's defence ministry says the Admiral Gorshkov frigate and the Kazan submarine are both carriers of advanced weapons, including hypersonic missiles Zircon. They earlier conducted missile drills in the Atlantic.\nBut Cuba's foreign ministry says none of the vessels has nuclear arms on board, and their five-day visit does not pose a threat to the region.\nUS officials say they are closely monitoring the visit. The US Navy also used sea drones to shadow the Russian vessels as they got close to Cuba, BBC's US partner CBS reports.\nEarly on a grey and overcast morning, the Russian vessels entered Havana Bay, flanked by smaller support vessels, to a 21-gun salute. \nIn a statement, Russia's defence minister said the visit was unofficial, allowing the vessels' crews to \"rest and get acquainted with local attractions\".\nRussia has sent warships to Cuba in the past and the two nations are long-standing allies - but the timing of these particular exercises stands out. \nComing amid growing tensions over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022,  the operation is being interpreted by some as sabre-rattling by Moscow. \nCertainly, it appears to send a pretty clear message from the Kremlin to Washington about what they consider to be meddling in their backyard. \nThe visit is an important symbol of support to the communist-run government in Cuba and its socialist ally, Venezuela, where the warships may sail to next after they finish in Havana. \nIn essence, while the visit may be considered broadly routine, the context of wider global hostilities in which it is taking place is anything but.",
    "Thousands of Taylor Swift fans made the earth move by cheering and dancing at her three Edinburgh concerts last weekend.\nFans took the singer's encouragement to Shake It Off literally, with monitoring stations detecting seismic activity from 6km (3.73 miles) away.\nThe energetic Swifties made the biggest commotion during three songs: Cruel Summer, Ready For It? and Champagne Problems.\nAnd it seems the 73,000-strong Friday night crowd danced, cheered and stomped the loudest of the three gigs.\nIt marked the first of 17 UK dates for Swift, which will culminate in a record-breaking eight-night run at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium.\nThe 152-date stadium tour is on track to make more than $2bn (\u00a31.56bn) by the time it wraps up in December, making it the most lucrative concert tour in music history.\nDuring her three Murrayfield performances, Swift played to 200,000 fans who came from all over the world to see her career-spanning, three-hour show.\nThe Friday night concert was the most energetic by a small margin with fans making the ground move a maximum of 23.4 nanometres (nm), compared to 22.8nm and 23.3nm on the Saturday and Sunday respectively.\nThe seismic activity was mainly caused by dancing and reached its peak at 160bpm during Ready For It?\nThe Swifties created approximately 80kW of power during the song.\nShake It Off and Cruel Summer made the ground move, but detectors even shook during a four-minute long applause for Champagne Problems.\nSwift's previous tour dates in Seattle and Los Angeles registered similar events, with her Seattle gig generating activity equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.\nThe British Geological Survey (BGS) is the UK's national earthquake monitoring agency and its detectors are sensitive enough to pick up the smallest seismic activity miles away.\nCallum Harrison, BGS seismologist, said: \"It\u2019s amazing that we\u2019ve been able to measure the reaction of thousands of concert goers remotely through our data. \n\"The opportunity to explore a seismic activity created by a different kind of phenomenon has been a thrill.\n\"Clearly Scotland\u2019s reputation for providing some of the most enthusiastic audiences remains well intact!\"\nThe movement was detected at two monitoring stations, the furthest of which was 6km (three and a half miles) away, at the BGS office at Heriot Watt University.\nHowever experts said the movement generated by the concert was unlikely to have been felt by anyone other than those in the immediate vicinity.",
    "The US has broadened its sanctions on Russia, including a fresh crackdown on banks dealing with sanctioned entities.\nIt expands a December programme to target foreign banks deemed to be aiding Russia's war effort in Ukraine.\nThe US also placed sanctions on the Moscow stock exchange, leading to it halting trading in dollars and euros.\nIt also moved to try to restrict Russia's use of technology, including chips and software.\nUS President Joe Biden signed an executive order in December that imposed sanctions on banks dealing with about 1,200 individuals and companies deemed to be helping Russia's war machine.\nThose measures, which expose banks to the risk of being cut off from the US financial system, have now been expanded to about 4,500 entities.\nThe US will also target gold-laundering.\nPeter Harrell, a former White House senior director for international economics, told the Reuters news agency that the US \"is shifting towards something that begins to look like an effort to set up a global financial embargo on Russia\".\nAs part of this effort, the US Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on parts of Russia's financial system, including the Moscow Exchange, which is one of Russia's main stock exchanges.\nThe stock exchange, which is Russia's largest foreign exchange market, said the sanctions had forced it to stop trading in dollars and euros.\nThe US also focused on technology. Chips and other technology made in the US have been found in downed Russian equipment on Ukraine battlefields, including drones, radios, missiles and armoured vehicles.\nThe sanctions aim to make it more difficult for companies to supply that tech.\nThe US will target shell firms in Hong Kong selling chips to Russia.\nIn addition, software and IT services will also be restricted, although the US said its actions \"are not intended to disrupt civil society and civil telecommunications\".\nDespite the wave of sanctions brought against Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the International Monetary Fund predicts that the country will record economic growth of 3.2% this year. \nBut analysts said the measures will eventually make it harder for Moscow to wage its war, and over time weaken Russia's economy.\n\u201cRussia\u2019s war economy is deeply isolated from the international financial system, leaving the Kremlin\u2019s military desperate for access to the outside world,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\u201cToday\u2019s actions strike at their remaining avenues for international materials and equipment, including their reliance on critical supplies from third countries,\" she added.\nThe US announced the decision as Mr Biden prepared for a G7 summit in southern Italy with the leaders of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan.\nOne of the G7 leaders' priorities is boosting support for Ukraine, which is now into its third year of resisting Russia's invasion.",
    "Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah movement has fired multiple barrages of rockets into northern Israel in retaliation for an Israeli strike which killed one of its senior commanders.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reportedly identified more than 200 projectiles that crossed the border on Wednesday. Some triggered fires, but no casualties were reported.\nIt came as a top Hezbollah official vowed that the Iran-backed group would increase the intensity, force and quantity of its attacks.\nHe was speaking at the funeral of Taleb Sami Abdullah, the field commander targeted in a strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday night.\nThere have been exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border almost every day since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October.\nHezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group. Both are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries.\nMore than 375 people have been killed in Lebanon, including at least 88 civilians, according to Lebanese authorities and the UN, while the Israeli military says 18 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed in Israel.\nThe hostilities have also displaced tens of thousands of people from border communities in northern Israel and southern Lebanon.\nIsraeli media described Hezbollah's rocket and missile fire on Wednesday as \"unprecedented\" since the escalation in the conflict eight months ago.\nSirens sounded across northern Israel throughout the morning, when more than 170 projectiles were identified as crossing from Lebanon, according to the IDF.\nSome of the projectiles were intercepted and others fell in several areas of northern Israel, causing fires to break out in some locations, it said.\nThe IDF said its aircraft and artillery responded by striking launchers in the southern Lebanese border areas of Yaroun and Hanine, as well as \"terrorist infrastructure sites\" in Yater.\nThey struck Yater again in the afternoon, as well Taybeh, Markaba, Rachaya al-Foukhar and Tallouseh, following new launches towards northern Israel, it added.\nLebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency reported that Israeli air strikes destroyed a house in Yater, injuring one person. It also said warplanes and drones targeted Markaba and that phosphorous shells were fired towards Odaisseh.\nBy the late afternoon, the total number of projectiles launched from Lebanon had reached 215, Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper reported.\nIt also cited Israel\u2019s Fire and Rescue Authority as saying that the fires sparked by the rockets had endangered \"strategic sites and facilities\".\nFire-fighters, volunteers, park rangers and soldiers were close to gaining control over blazes in the northern communities of Biriya, Kadita, Ein Zeitim, and Tziv'on, it added.\nHezbollah said it had carried out at least 17 operations against Israel on Wednesday, including eight in response to the \"assassination\" of Taleb Abdullah and three other fighters.\nAmong the targets were Israeli military headquarters in Ein Zeitim and Ami'ad, a military air surveillance station in Meron, and a \"military factory\" in Sasa, according to the group.\nThe head of Hezbollah's Executive Council, Hashem Safieddine, told hundreds of mourners at Abdullah\u2019s funeral in Beirut that Israel had \"not learned the experiences of the past\".\n\"Experience has proven that the more leaders are martyred, the more stable and entrenched the resistance becomes,\" he added. \"We will increase our operations in intensity, strength, quantity and quality.\"\nThe IDF said Abdullah and three other Hezbollah operatives were killed in a strike on a Hezbollah command-and-control centre in the village of Jouaiyya on Tuesday night.\nIt described Abdullah as \"one of Hezbollah\u2019s most senior commanders in southern Lebanon\u201d and accused him of planning and carrying out \u201ca large number of terror attacks against Israeli civilians\".\nSecurity sources in Lebanon told Reuters news agency that Abdullah was Hezbollah\u2019s commander for the central region of the southern border strip and that he was more senior than Wissam Tawil, a commander of the elite Radwan Force who was killed in an Israeli strike in January.\nLast week, after rocket fire sparked wildfires that burned through 3,500 acres of land in northern Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government was prepared for \"a very strong action in the north\". \n\"One way or another we will restore security,\" he added.\nThe IDF\u2019s chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, meanwhile said his forces were \"ready to move to an offensive\" against Hezbollah.",
    "A thousand BTS fans will queue in Seoul on Thursday for a hug from Jin, who is back to his role as K-pop idol after 18 months of military service. \nThe three-hour marathon is his first public event since being discharged from the army on Wednesday. \nThe 1,000 who will be embraced were chosen in a raffle - although Jin has said he had suggested hugging up to 3,000 fans.  \n\"I\u2019m so happy now that I will meet Jin,\" says Ms Park who learned last weekend that she had won a spot in Thursday's \"hugathon\". \n\"I didn\u2019t expect to win. I couldn\u2019t believe it so all weekend I kept checking over and over again,\" says the 32-year-old  who did not wish to reveal her first name. \nShe said it started to \"feel real\" only when she started packing to travel to the capital. \nJin, 31, who is the oldest member of the hit boy band, was drafted in December 2022. He served as an assistant drill instructor at a training centre for the South Korean military, which requires all able-bodied men to serve.  \nJin is the first BTS member to be discharged from duty. The other six - J-Hope, V, RM, Jimin, Jung Kook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025. \nBut the others took time off on Wednesday to celebrate Jin's return - fans are already agog over images of their brief reunion on Wednesday. \nJin kicked off his return to the music scene with a livestream where he spoke to fans: \"Thank you for waiting for me, I love you. I will try to express my feelings tomorrow.\" \nThursday's hugs will be followed by another event, with 3,000 others, where Jin will perform songs on request and share messages with fans. \nVanessa May Leuterio, 25, didn't get lucky in the raffle but she made it to the second round - and flew from the Philippines to attend. \n\"I cried [when I learned the result] since I prayed very hard for a winning slot,\" she said. \"It was definitely hard to win since it was me versus thousands of ARMYs [BTS fan group] who wanted to join.\"\nMs Park, on the other hand, is both excited and worried. \n\"Hugging a thousand people for three hours is difficult even if Jin became more fit in the military,\" she says. \nShe said many fans wanted HYBE, the band's manager which is also behind the event, to invite fewer fans for hugs. They also wanted them to vet the attendees.    \n\"Someone could approach him pretending to be a fan. We fans are constantly worried for the artist\u2019s health and safety,\" Ms Park says.\nThe event also drew backlash for its qualification rules, which required fans to join  ARMY, which reportedly has more than 25 million members. They also had to buy BTS albums on a designated website to enter the raffle - the more albums they bought, the higher their chances of being hugged. \nBut this caused an uproar and HYBE was accused of using the event to sell unsold albums. The agency eventually apologised and loosened the criteria to allow anyone who had ever purchased certain BTS albums. \nJin addressed the controversy in his livestream on Wednesday: \"This is something that the company and I prepared in good intention, so please understand.\" \nTo fans, Jin's return is also the beginning of BTS' return from a forced hiatus. But the question industry insiders are asking is whether the world's most famous boy band can be as successful after a pause?  \n\"BTS will be perceived as older,\" says music critic Lim Hee-yun. But he doesn't think that will necessarily hurt the band's image.\n\"BTS has been active for more than a decade. They will not attract new, young fans who will find them fresh, but their existing fan base will go with them.

    "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told Hamas that it is \"time for the haggling to stop\", after its leaders proposed \"numerous changes\" to a plan for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.\nHe told reporters in Doha that some of the changes were \"workable\" and others were not, but that the US and mediators Qatar and Egypt would \"try to close this deal\".\nHamas said on Tuesday that it was ready to \"deal positively\" with the process but stressed the need for Israel to agree to a permanent ceasefire and full withdrawal from Gaza.\nThe Israeli government did not comment, but an anonymous official said the Palestinian armed group\u2019s response amounted to a rejection.\nIsrael\u2019s prime minister has not yet publicly endorsed the proposal, which US President Joe Biden said had been offered by the country when he outlined it 12 days ago.\nBut Mr Blinken said Benjamin Netanyahu had \"reaffirmed his commitment\" during a meeting in Jerusalem on Monday.\nThe UN Security Council also passed a resolution supporting the proposal that day, adding to the diplomatic pressure that Washington is exerting.\nThe BBC is part of the travelling press pool on the US secretary of state\u2019s visit to Qatar - a glittering Gulf location that belies the sense of regional crisis he is attempting to solve with a diplomatic tour taking place at breakneck speed.\nThere was an embrace and smiles Mr Blinken met the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani.\nHis country is a key player in this crisis, having hosted the political offices of Hamas for more than a decade and been a conduit for negotiations with Israel.\nMr Blinken seemed exasperated as he told a joint news conference that they had been discussing the changes requested by Hamas to the US-backed ceasefire proposal.\n\"A deal was on the table that was virtually identical to a proposal that Hamas put forward on 6 May - a deal that the entire world is behind, that Israel has accepted, and Hamas could have answered with a single word: 'yes',\" he said.\n\"Instead, Hamas waited nearly two weeks and then proposed more changes, a number of which go beyond positions that it had previously taken and accepted. As a result, the war that Hamas started\u2026 will go on, more people will suffer, Palestinians will suffer, more Israelis will suffer.\"\nMr Blinken did not clarify what changes he said Hamas was demanding, nor did a brief statement issued by the group itself on Tuesday evening.\nThe statement did, however, reiterate a demand for what Hamas called \"a complete halt of the ongoing aggression against Gaza\" and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\nA member of Hamas's political bureau, Izzat al-Rishq, said the response was \"responsible, serious and positive\" and that it opened up \"a wide pathway\" to reach an agreement.\nThe Israeli prime minister\u2019s office did not release an on-record reply.\nBut a statement was issued by an anonymous Israeli official, who said that Hamas had \"changed all of the main and most meaningful parameters\" and \"rejected the proposal for a hostage release that was presented by President Biden\".\nIn a later statement on Wednesday, cited by Reuters news agency, Hamas said it had shown \"full positivity\" in its efforts to reach an agreement, adding that it had urged Mr Blinken to put \"direct pressure\" on Israel.\nDespite the setbacks, Mr Blinken said the US, along with Qatar and Egypt, would \"try to close this deal\".\n\"I believe those gaps are bridgeable. But that doesn't mean they will be bridged because, ultimately, Hamas has to decide.\"\nSheikh Mohammed said both Hamas and Israel needed to make some concessions.\n\"We are witnessing a shift in this conflict in the recent period and there is a clear and firm call to end this war,\" he noted.\nMr Blinken also said it was crucial to develop plans for the \u201cday after the conflict\u201d in Gaza as soon as possible in order to achieve an enduring end to the war.\n\"In the coming weeks, we will put forward proposals for key elements of a 'day after plan', including concrete ideas for how to manage governance, security, reconstruction,\" he added.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 37,200 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nA deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 116 hostages are still being held, 41 of whom are presumed dead.\nMr Biden said the new proposal involved three phases.\nThe first would involve an initial six-week ceasefire, when Hamas would release some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - in exchange for Israel releasing an undefined number of Palestinian prisoners. There would also be a withdrawal of",
    "Wreck hunters have found the ship on which the famous polar explorer Ernest Shackleton made his final voyage.\nThe vessel, called \"Quest\", has been located on the seafloor off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.\nShackleton suffered a fatal heart attack on board on 5 January 1922 while trying to reach the Antarctic.\nAnd although Quest continued in service until it sank in 1962, the earlier link with the explorer gives it great historic significance.\nThe British-Irish adventurer is celebrated for his exploits in Antarctica at a time when very few people had visited the frozen wilderness.\n\"His final voyage kind of ended that Heroic Age of Exploration, of polar exploration, certainly in the south,\" said renowned shipwreck hunter David Mearns, who directed the successful search operation.\n\"Afterwards, it was what you would call the scientific age. In the pantheon of polar ships, Quest is definitely an icon,\" he told BBC News.\nThe remains of the ship, a 38m-long schooner-rigged steamship, were discovered at the bottom of the Labrador Sea on Sunday by a team led by The Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS).\nSonar equipment found it in 390m (1,280ft) of water. The wreck is sitting almost upright on a seafloor that has been scoured at some point in the past by the passing of icebergs.\nThe main mast is broken and hanging over the port side, but otherwise the ship appears to be broadly intact.\nQuest was being used by Norwegian sealers in its last days. Its sinking was caused by thick sea-ice, which pierced the hull and sent it to the deep.\nThe irony, of course, is this was the exact same damage inflicted on Shackleton's Endurance - the ship he used on his ill-fated Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914\u20131917.\nFortunately, the crews of both Endurance, in 1915, and Quest, in 1962, survived.\nIndeed, many of the men who escaped the Endurance sinking signed up for Shackleton's last polar mission in 1921-1922, using Quest.\nHis original plan had been to explore the Arctic, north of Alaska, but when the Canadian government withdrew financial support, the expedition headed south in Quest to the Antarctic.\nThe new goal was to map Antarctic islands, collect specimens and look for places to install infrastructure, such as weather stations.\nShackleton never made it, however, struck down by heart failure in the Port of Grytviken on the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia, the last stop before reaching the White Continent. He was just 47 years old.\nAfter his death, Quest was involved in other important expeditions, including the 1930-31 British Arctic Air Route Expedition led by British explorer Gino Watkins, who himself tragically died aged 25 while exploring Greenland.\nQuest was also employed in Arctic rescues and served in the Royal Canadian Navy during WWII, before being turned over to the sealers.\nThe RCGS team members carried out extensive research to find Quest's last resting place. Information was gathered from ships' logs, navigation records, photographs, and documents from the inquiry into her loss.\nThe calculated sinking location in the Labrador Sea was pretty much spot on, although the exact co-ordinates are being held back for the time being.\nA second visit to the wreck, possibly later this year, will do a more complete investigation.\n\"Right now, we don't intend to touch the wreck. It actually lies in an already protected area for wildlife, so nobody should be touching it,\" associate search director Antoine Normandin said. \"But we do hope to go back and photograph it with a remotely operated vehicle, to really understand its state.\"\nAlexandra Shackleton is the explorer's grand-daughter, and was patron to the RCGS survey.\n\"I was thrilled, really excited to hear the news; I have relief and happiness and a huge admiration for the members of the team,\" she told BBC News.\n\"For me, this represents the last discovery in the Shackleton story. It completes the circle.\"\nThe explorer continues to spark interest more than a century after his death.\nHundreds of people visit his grave on South Georgia every year to pay their respects to the man known by his crews simply as \"The Boss\".\n\"Shackleton will live forever as one of the greatest explorers of all time, not just because of what he achieved in exploration but for the way he did it, and the way he looked after his men,\" said David Mearns.\n\"His story is timeless and will be told again and again; and I'm just one of many disciples who'll keep telling it for as long as I can.\"\nAdditional reporting by Rebecca Morelle and Alison Francis",

    "Like the bosses of many food companies, Jeremy Bunch is worried about the impact of climate change on his business.\n\u201cWeather and the climate are maybe the number one risk to our company,\u201d says the boss of US flour firm Shepherd\u2019s Grain.\nBased in Idaho, the business sources wheat from farmers across the US Pacific northwest.\nAs weather patterns become more unpredictable, Mr Bunch says: \u201cI need to have a plan B, and plan C, in case plan A fails.\u201d\nTo help strengthen these plans, Mr Bunch\u2019s company is now using an AI-powered software system called ClimateAi.\nUsing current and past data, such as from satellite imagery and temperature and rainfall readings, and combining that with future projections, ClimateAi aims to give farmers the most accurate possible, locally-tailored weather forecasts, from one hour to six months ahead.\nIt then advises on exactly when to plant and harvest particular crops, and predicts their yields.\nShepherd\u2019s Grain only started using ClimateAi last year, but already most of its 40 plus farmers are now being guided by the app.\n\u201cThey\u2019re beginning to look at ClimateAi to help them plan for crop management decisions in their wheat crops, the primary crop grown in the region,\u201d says Mr Bunch.\n\u201cA forward look at the weather helps our growers decide which crops to plant. The platform knows when to plant, and when the crop will start flowering and producing seed.\u201d\nOne of the biggest problems facing the seed industry is how to launch climate resilient seeds to market faster and cheaper, says Himanshu Gupta, chief executive of San Francisco-based ClimateAi.\n\u201cBy the time some seed companies do this, in say 10 to 15 years, the climate has already changed,\u201d says Mr Gupta. \u201cWe are running against time to launch new seed varieties.\u201d\nHe says that ClimateAi helps these firms to see how specific test seeds have performed in a particular region or locality. \u201cThis can help seed companies figure out the optimal locations for growing seeds.\u201d\nLast year, a study published in scientific journal Nature warned of the potentially dire consequences of numerous crop failures happening at the same time around the world, as a result of the impact of climate change.\n\u201cSimultaneous harvest failures across major crop-producing regions are a threat to global food security,\u201d said the report, which was led by climate scientist Kai Kornhuber from Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.\nThis warning comes as the world population is expected to reach 10 billion people by 2050, up from eight billion currently, according to the United Nations.\nWith increased pressure on crops, at the same time as the global population continues to grow, could AI be key to developing new varieties that can better cope with extremes of weather?\nIn the city of Arusha in Tanzania, David Guerena, agricultural scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, is leading a project called Artemis.\nFunded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, this is using AI to help breed more resilient crops. Specifically the AI is helping speed up work called phenotyping.\nThis is the visual studying of new crop varieties based on observations of their characteristics, such as how many flowers, pods or leaves that a plant has.\n\u201cTraditionally it takes around 10 years to develop a new crop variety,\u201d explains Mr Guerena. \u201cBut given the pace of climate change, this timeframe is no longer viable.\"\nHe adds that the phenotyping work traditionally relied on the human eye. \u201cBut humans are just not doing this consistently, with the high levels of precision necessary, to make subtle, yet important, plant selections,\u201d says Mr Guerena.\n\u201cIt can be over 30\u02daC in the field. It\u2019s just tiring, and fatigue affects data quality.\u201d\nInstead, growers involved in the project are taking photos of their crops through an app on a smartphone.  The trained AI can then quickly analyses, records, and reports what it sees.\n\u201cComputers can count every flower or pod, from every plant, every day without getting tired,\u201d says Mr Guerena. \u201cThis is really important as the number of flowers in bean plants correlate to the number of pods which directly influence yields.\n\u201cData can be so complicated, to understand what\u2019s happening, but AI can be used to make sense of that complicated data and pick up patterns, show where we need resources, show recommendations.\n\u201cOur plant breeders estimate that with the better data from the AI computer vision they may be able to shorten the breeding cycle to only a few years.\u201d\n\nIn North Carolina, Avalo is an agriculture technology or \u201cagri-tech\u201d business also working to create climate-resilient crops. It does this by using AI to help study a crop\u2019s genetics.\n\u201cOur process starts with genomic data about crops, for example, the sequences of various varieties,\u201d says Rebecca White, Avalo\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\u201cFor example, with different tomatoes, there\u2019s some small differences in genomes that give them different traits, for example different flavour",
    "The owner of Steam - the largest digital distribution platform for PC games in the world - is being sued for \u00a3656m.\nValve Corporation is being accused of using its market dominance to overcharge 14 million people in the UK.\n\"Valve is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers,\" said digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt, who is bringing the case.\nValve has been contacted for comment.\nThe claim - which has been filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, in London - accuses Valve of \"shutting out\" competition in the PC gaming market.\nIt says Valve \"forces\" game publishers to sign up to so-called price parity obligations, preventing titles being sold at cheaper prices on rival platforms. \nMs Shotbolt says this has enabled Steam to charge an \"excessive commission of up to 30%\", making UK consumers pay too much for purchasing PC games and add-on content.\nThe case is what is known as a collective action claim, which means that one person goes to court on behalf of a much larger group of people. \nMs Shotbolt - who accuses Valve of breaching UK competition law for at least six years - says she is bringing the claim \"to stop this unlawful conduct and help people get back what they are owed.\"\nSteam is a PC gaming platform where players can buy games and purchase in-game extras.\nAccording to VG Insights, it had record-breaking sales in 2023, generating over $9bn (\u00a37.1bn) in global revenue. \nThis was driven by 580m games sold and 14,000 new games released.\nHowever, the market is extremely concentrated, with the top 10 bestselling games making up 61% of all sales.\nThe top 100 games account for 91% of total sales.\nThe claim is backed by legal firm Milberg London LLP, which brings group action cases against large companies. \n\"Competition law is there to protect consumers and ensure that markets work properly,\" said Natasha Pearman, a partner at the law firm. \n\"When they don\u2019t work properly and consumers are harmed, collective actions of this kind provide consumers with a voice and a way of holding big companies, like Valve, to account.\"\nIt is the latest in a series of collective action legal cases against big tech.\nOther claims lodged at the Competition Appeal Tribunal have sought compensation from Facebook, Google and Sony.

    "The sequel to hit film Inside Out has brought some critics joy, but others felt a different emotion, which has become familiar from watching much of Pixar's recent output - disappointment.\nInside Out 2 revisits the emotions that controlled young Riley in the 2016 original - and that are now joined by new, powerful feelings after she hits puberty.\nThe sequel is \"a triumphant creative return for Pixar\", according to Variety, while the Independent declared that the \"cynicism-free sequel might just save Pixar\".\nHowever, other reviewers disagreed. IndieWire said \"no Pixar movie has ever provoked so little sense of wonder\", and Vulture called it \"another product of the Pixar slump\".\nThe first film won an Oscar and numerous fans for the way it showed Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger as characters vying for control inside the mind of 11-year-old Riley.\nVariety's critic Owen Gleiberman said it was \"the last great Pixar movie\", adding that the sequel \"comes close to matching the high of Inside Out\".\nIn the follow-up, Riley is now 13, and is dealing with a range of new emotions led by Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke.\n\"Inside Out 2 can\u2019t shock us with its out-of-the-box imaginative daring the way Inside Out did,\" Gleiberman wrote.\nBut its director and writers \"build on the earlier film\u2019s playful brilliance and come about as close as we could have hoped for to matching it\", he added.\nThe Telegraph agreed that Inside Out 2 \"proves Pixar\u2019s still a force to be reckoned with\".\nChief film critic Robbie Collin said it \"gets Pixar back to doing what they always did best: juggling big concepts in fun and ingenious but also surprisingly wise and moving ways\".\n\"It\u2019s also ironically well-suited to a studio weathering an awkward transition out of its young-hotshot years.\"\nIn a four-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey wrote that the sequel \"expands on its predecessor without redefining it\".\n\"It's a lovely sequel, without a trace of cynicism to it, that also by necessity lacks a little of the freshness and originality of 2022's Turning Red or 2021's Luca.\"\nShe added: \"Inside Out 2 is interested more in expanding than redefining its predecessor, but it's impressive how well even the film's more familiar elements still work.\"\nThe new film, she concluded, \"proves that it's ludicrous, at this point, to accuse the studio of having run out of ideas\".\nUSA Today's Brian Truitt was also a fan, saying the film \"hits like an amusing, profound wrecking ball\".\n\"Inside Out 2 frontloads the funny bits and then wallops you in the final act, which ambitiously depicts the desperate hopelessness when anxiety has a hold and won't let go,\" he wrote.\nBut he added: \"The middle is where it loses focus, as Joy's group goes on a mission to set Riley right before it's too late.\n\"The original movie took a similar tack but did it better, and the sequel misses a real chance to flesh out the intriguing new emotions more.\"\nThe Guardian's Peter Bradshaw had mixed emotions, awarding the film three stars. \n\"There are some laughs, but it sees the teen transition in terms of a moral crisis, of abandoning and then reclaiming the niceness of childhood innocence; it\u2019s a little bit convoluted and repetitive and, in its sanitised, Disneyfied way, this film can\u2019t quite bring itself to mention the most important new teen emotion of all.\"\nThe Washington Post's Amy Nicholson also noticed some missing characters.\n\"Disappointingly, the film\u2019s PG rating keeps the two sensations we\u2019d be most curious to see get a dusting of Disney magic - PMS and Libido - from crashing Riley\u2019s hormonal rager.\n\"Instead, screenwriters Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein clutter the screen with redundant feelings - Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser) - who don\u2019t add much to the saga of Riley\u2019s three disastrous days at an all-girls hockey camp.\"\nPixar had underwhelming responses to a number of recent releases including Elemental, Onward and Toy Story spin-off Lightyear.\nVulture Alison Willmore wrote that Turning Red was a better film \"about the messiness of adolescence\".\n\"What stops Inside Out 2 from matching that film\u2019s insights is its own format, which its subject matter has outgrown,\" she wrote.\nAnd IndieWire's David Ehrlich lamented that the film feels artificial and formulaic - \"more like a corporate spreadsheet than a glimpse into a real person's brain\".\n\"It\u2019s a story about the universal chaos of adolescence told by a studio that once prided itself on being original, but now - after suffering a little public embarrassment - shares every teenager\u2019s mortal fear of being different,\" he wrote.\n\"Like Riley, Pixar seems determined to forget what made it so special in the first place.

    "Swiss women who won a historic ruling on climate change at the European Court of Human Rights say they feel shocked and betrayed by their parliament\u2019s decision not to comply with it.\nThe women, known as \"climate seniors\", previously took their case to the court in Strasbourg, France, arguing the Swiss government\u2019s inadequate response to climate change - and in particular extreme heat events linked to global warming - was damaging their right to health and life. \nThe court agreed in April and ordered Switzerland, which has so far failed to meet is targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to do more.\nThe court\u2019s rulings are binding for member states, and this decision was unprecedented.\nClimate activists had hoped it would send a signal to other governments that human rights law could be used to defend citizens who believe their health is being harmed by worsening environmental factors.\nHowever Switzerland\u2019s parliament voted on Wednesday to reject the ECHR\u2019s ruling, suggesting it was not \"ignoring\" it, as some critics have claimed, but rather that Switzerland did not need to react as it already had an effective climate change strategy.\nThe debate in parliament was at times emotional, with right-wing politicians criticising what they saw as an overreach by \"foreign judges\", and Green Party members describing the tone of the discussion as \"shameful\" and \"populist\".\nSwitzerland is currently not on course to reach its Paris Climate Agreement goals \u2013 which seek to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 and opinion polls show many Swiss are worried about this. \nThe Alpine climate is especially sensitive to global warming, and studies show that their glaciers, which are crucial to Europe\u2019s water supply, could be gone by the end of the century if temperatures continue to rise.\nBut the Swiss are also very proud of their system of direct democracy. They are used to making decisions themselves, and the \"foreign judges\" jibe resonates with them. \nLast weekend, voters backed government proposals to generate more electricity from renewables. Despite environmental groups\u2019 claims that the measures are still not enough to meet climate goals, opinion polls show a majority of voters reject the ECHR\u2019s involvement, and think Switzerland is already doing enough to protect the environment.\nOther countries \u2013 notably the United Kingdom \u2013 will be looking closely at Switzerland\u2019s rebuff of the rights court. The UK government's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda has led to pushback from the Strasbourg court, and some British voters now say the UK should leave the body.\nIn Switzerland, such a move is very definitely not on the cards \u2013 or not yet. \nAlthough parliament has suggested compliance with the ECHR's climate ruling is not necessary, the final decision on whether to abide by it is up to the Swiss government, which is expected to announce its verdict in August.\nThe ECHR did not tell Switzerland exactly what it had to do to tackle climate change, it simply said it had to do more. \nIt is possible that, in the good Swiss tradition of compromise, the government will offer the court in Strasbourg a list of all the measures it has taken since the climate seniors first started building their case, and hope that is accepted.\nIf it is not, the Swiss climate seniors say they may return to court.",
    "Judges have heard an appeal by Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes against her conviction for defrauding those who invested in her blood-testing company.\nAn appeal was also entered in the San Francisco federal court on Tuesday for the startup's president, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, who is also Holmes's former partner.\nThe pair were tried separately in 2022, and both received jail terms for their roles in the Silicon Valley scam.\nHolmes's lawyer told judges that her client believed she was telling the truth when touting blood-testing devices to receive investment.\nTheranos was founded after Holmes dropped out of Stanford University, and went on to be valued at $9bn (\u00a37bn). \nThe entrepreneur herself was said to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire, who had attracted investment from high-profile figures such as Rupert Murdoch.\nThings unravelled in 2018 after investigations revealed the tech did not work. Holmes and Balwani were accused of hiding poor results from Theranos devices - which had been promoted as being able to test for hundreds of diseases from just a few drops of blood. \nThe company's crash was documented in a TV series, an HBO documentary and a podcast.\nHolmes was jailed for more than 11 years over the scandal, and is currently serving time in a Texas prison. Balwani was given a sentence of more than 12 years. \nNeither of them attended Tuesday's hearing, during which Holmes's lawyer questioned the testimony of a former Theranos employee and argued that Holmes should have had a greater chance to pick holes in the evidence of another key prosecution witness.\nThe lawyer portrayed the case, which resulted in a split verdict, as having been close. This was disputed by the prosecution, which has described the evidence against Holmes overwhelming. \nMeanwhile, a lawyer for Balwani argued that prosecutors had introduced evidence that overstepped the 2018 indictment against his client. \nUS media reported that the trio of judges hearing the case gave few signals over when or how they might rule, other than to indicate that the non-contested evidence had been strong.",

The hum of generators reverberates though the city, while at night streets are now often coated in darkness. \nFamilies with young children living on the top floors of apartment blocks have been left without working lifts, leaving them to walk up dozens of flights of stairs.\nUkraine is buying energy from the European Union to try to cover its shortfall. Its energy ministry said it was planning on Wednesday to import its largest amount of power to date. However, this is not enough to make up its deficit, meaning nationwide power cuts have been planned during an eight-hour window, from 3pm to 11pm, in order to protect critical infrastructure such a hospitals and military facilities.\nThe situation is expected to worsen as summer temperatures climb and people turn on their air-conditioning units. \nIf Russia continues to attack power plants, the worst-case scenario is that come winter Ukrainians could be spending up to 20 hours a day without power and heating, according to Ukraine's largest private energy company DTEK. Part of the issue is that Ukraine\u2019s thermal and hydroelectric power stations are difficult and expensive to fix. \n\u201cSome will take years to repair, and others might never be brought back online\u201d said Maria Tsaturian from Ukrenergo, Ukraine\u2019s national energy operator.\nOvernight, Russia launched missile and drone attacks across Ukraine, including on the capital Kyiv, where the blasting sound of air defences could be heard in the early hours of the morning. \nThe head of Kyiv\u2019s military, Serhiy Popko, said nothing had got past the city\u2019s air defence systems. However, an energy facility in the north-eastern Sumy region was damaged in the attack.\nOleg Strilka, from Sumy\u2019s State Emergency Service, told the BBC that one of the effects of such prolonged power cuts was that people were plugging in all their electrical devices at the same time once the electricity returned, causing fires. \u201cOver the past month we have been rescuing children and the elderly from smoke-filled homes,\u201d he said.\nMr Zelensky has told Western countries he needs another seven sophisticated air defence systems, called Patriots, in order to protect Ukraine\u2019s cities and energy infrastructure. According to US media, Washington has agreed to send another such system to Ukraine in the coming days.\nThe Ukrainian government is preparing for a global peace summit being held in Switzerland this weekend, which aims to bring together as many countries as possible in support of its 10-point peace plan, which hinges around Russia withdrawing from all Ukrainian territory. Critically Russia has not been invited, and influential counties including China, and possibly Brazil and South Africa, will not be attending.\nRecognising the limitations of the conference, President Zelensky\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said yesterday that Ukraine hoped to first build a broad platform of support, before then exploring the possibility of holding a second summit, which Russia would be invited to.",
    "One of France's best-loved singer-songwriters, Fran\u00e7oise Hardy, has died at the age of 80.\n\"Mum is gone,\" her son, Thomas Dutronc,  who is also a musician, wrote on social media.\nHardy burst on to the music scene in 1962 and became a cultural icon who inspired the likes of Mick Jagger and Bob Dylan. Known for her melancholy ballads, she  symbolised France's Y\u00e9-y\u00e9 (yeah yeah) pop movement, so-called because of its nod to English music. \nHer most famous songs included All the Girls and Boys (Tous les gar\u00e7ons et les filles), It Hurts to Say Goodbye (Comment te dire adieu) and My Friend the Rose (Mon amie la rose).\nHer biggest UK hit was All Over The World, an English-language version of her song Dans le monde entier, which reached number 16 in the charts in June 1965.\n\nHardy was born in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1944 and raised by her mother. \nLike many girls at the time, she grew up listening to Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard and other American and British stars on Radio Luxembourg and she signed her first record deal at just 17.\nHer breakout as a musician came in 1962 with the simple, plaintive song, Tous les gar\u00e7ons et les filles, when she sang of all the boys and girls walking hand in hand, while \"I walk alone through the streets, my heart aching\". It was an instant hit in France and even broke through in the UK charts.\nHer style captivated fashion designers, becoming a model for the likes of Yves Saint Laurent and Paco Rabanne, who designed a minidress out of gold plates for her.\nRolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger once famously called her the \"ideal woman\", while fellow singer-songwriter Bob Dylan penned several love letters to her. \nHe addressed her in a poem on the back of his 1964 album Another Side of Bob Dylan. \nOne of her most memorable performances came in 1968 with Comment te dire adieu, a French adaptation by Serge Gainsbourg of a song originally in English. But the Gainsbourg song has since been covered many times, with its painful goodbye to a man with a \"heart of pyrex\".\nShe collaborated with a number of artists, including Blur and Iggy Pop.\nHardy was also an actor - appearing in films by directors including Jean-Luc Godard, Roger Vadim and John Frankenheimer - as well as a writer of fiction and non-fiction.\nAmong the topics she wrote about was astrology, which she developed a love for during the 1970s. \nShe was married once, to the singer Jacques Dutronc, with whom she had her son Thomas. They separated in the late 1980s, but she would often refer to her ex-husband as the love of her life.\nHardy had been ill for some time before her death, revealing in 2004 that she had been diagnosed with lymphoma.\nIn 2015, she was placed in an induced coma for weeks following a fall and in 2021, she said she had cancer in one of her ears and felt \"close to the end\" of her life.\nHer career spanned more than five decades, during which she released nearly 30 albums. Hardy's last album, Personne D'Autre (Nobody Else), was released in 2018. \nRolling Stone ranked her at number 162 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time in 2023. \nAmong those to pay tribute to Hardy following news of her death was France's Culture Minister, Rachida Dati, who wrote on social media: \"How to say goodbye to her? Eternal Fran\u00e7oise Hardy, legend of French song, who entered, through her sensitivity and her melodies, into the heart of an entire country.\"",
    "France's Republicans party has dumped its leader, Eric Ciotti, after he called for a political alliance with the far-right National Rally in snap elections at the end of this month.\nThe right-wing party's political chiefs made the decision little more than 24 hours after Mr Ciotti's plan sparked uproar among Republican politicians.\nThe apparent implosion at the heart of France's mainstream conservative party comes hot on the heels of National Rally's stinging victory in Sunday's European elections - and President Emmanuel Macron's quick decision to call a national vote.\nMr Ciotti hit back at his colleagues, accusing them of a \"flagrant violation\" of party rules and insisting he was going nowhere.\nElected party leader in December 2022, Mr Ciotti has always been seen as more hardline than most leading Republicans. \nBut when he went on TV on Tuesday to announce Republicans \"need to have an alliance while remaining ourselves... an alliance with the RN [National Rally] and its candidates\", leading party figures said he had only spoken for himself in proposing a pact.\nNational Rally leader Jordan Bardella then confirmed there was a deal and that his party would be supporting \"dozens\" of Republican candidates.\nHighly respected Senate speaker G\u00e9rard Larcher said he would never swallow a pact with the RN, and other colleagues openly called for Mr Ciotti's immediate dismissal ahead of two rounds of parliamentary elections on 30 June and 7 July.\nMr Macron weighed in on Wednesday, accusing Mr Ciotti of turning his back on a party that owed its heritage to former Presidents Charles de Gaulle, Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy.\nThe Republicans have suffered at the polls in recent years, unable to counter the rise of either Mr Macron's centrist party, now called Renaissance, or National Rally. In Sunday's election they could only manage 7.25%.\nAlthough an estimated half of grassroots Republicans back an alliance with National Rally, the vast majority of party leaders have rejected it out of hand. \nIn an apparent bid to halt his dismissal at an emergency meeting of party leaders on Wednesday, Mr Ciotti ordered the doors of party headquarters in Paris be locked, citing a security risk. \nHe later asserted that \"none of the decisions taken at this meeting carry legal consequences. They may have criminal repercussions\". He later told French TV that \"about 80\" candidates would fight for the Republicans with National Rally backing.\nThe Republicans have now appointed their lead candidate in Sunday's vote, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy, as interim leader. \"Forces of chaos are today threatening our country... We have a line to hold,\" he told reporters.\nHours earlier, Mr Macron defended his bombshell decision to dissolve parliament and call elections, urging French voters to come together and \"say no to the extremes\".\nThe French president denied he wanted to hand the far right the keys to power, arguing that a national vote was the only republican option. \nHe said that a broad range of political groups who \"cannot identify with this extremist fever\" should unite against it. \nHis remarks did not just reflect Mr Ciotti's overtures towards the leaders of National Rally, Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella. \nHe was also reacting to the mainstream centre left's decision to agree a pact with the far left, which he accused of espousing antisemitic and anti-parliamentary attitudes.\nOn Sunday, Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann led the centre left to third place with a campaign that attracted voters alienated by the more extreme France Unbowed of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon.\nMr Macron suggested that the masks of both mainstream forces had slipped and the battle for values had burst into the daylight.  \nMr M\u00e9lenchon accused the president of diving into a strategy of chaos and of drowning in a flood of insults towards \"those who don't share his opinion\".\nMr Macron has been widely criticised for an apparently spontaneous decision to call elections, an hour after his party polled below 15% while National Rally achieved almost 31.5% in the European vote.\nTwo years into his second term as president, his party is without a majority in France's National Assembly - so every piece of legislation requires support from political allies. \nMr Macron argued that the system had become jammed, leaving the government unable to act.\nHe said that, as president, he would not get involved in campaigning and would leave that to Prime Minister Gabriel Attal - though his speech on Wednesday sounded very much like the launch of his party's campaign.\nAsked by a reporter whether he had handed the keys of France to the far right, Mr Macron said that doing nothing was not an option and asking the people to decide was a principle of democracy. \nVoters who had backed National Rally on Sunday had expressed their anger, he said, adding: \"Message received.\"",
    "More than a decade after a mass shooting in a quiet Connecticut suburb, a group of survivors from Sandy Hook Elementary School are graduating from high school.\nTwenty students and six staff members were killed in the shooting on 14 December 2012.\nThe youngest among them were six years old.\nA private ceremony was held on Wednesday evening at Newtown High School, which around 60 survivors attended.\nGraduating students spoke of complex emotions surrounding the milestone.\n\"The shooter actually came into my classroom. So I had to, like, watch all my friends and teachers get killed, and I had to run for my life at six years old,\" Emma Ehrens told CBS News, the BBC\u2019s US partner.\n\"Just growing up with having the fear, and the what-ifs of what could have happened if I stayed?\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I was, like, I was going to be next.\"\nAnother survivor, Lilly Wasilnak, said: \u201cYou wait for this day for your whole life, since you're in kindergarten. You just can't wait to graduate. And it felt so far away for such a long time\u2026 but I think we can't forget about that there is a whole chunk of our class missing.\u201d\nA number of the survivors have volunteered for gun control groups and several met Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House last week.\nThe mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary was carried out by a 20-year-old armed with two rifles and a handgun. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot as police arrived on the scene.\nThe US president at the time, Barack Obama, later called it \u201cthe single darkest day of my presidency\u201d.\nFollowing the murders, Mr Obama proposed a large raft of new laws designed to curb gun violence. \nAlthough he implemented a series of reforms to the US background check system using executive orders, two major pieces of legislation failed to pass Congress.\nThe laws would have banned assault rifles and instituted background checks on most private gun sales. They had bipartisan support, but most Republican senators along with a number of Democrats voted against the measures.\nThe Sandy Hook shooting remains the deadliest ever at a US primary school. \nSince the attack, there have been more than 4,200 mass shootings in the United States, including several dozen at schools, CBS reported.",
    "Legendary songwriter Mark James, who penned enduring hits like Elvis Presley's Suspicious Minds, has died at the age of 83.\nThe Texas-born musician scored a US number one with the song Hooked On A Feeling and also wrote Presley's Always On My Mind.\nOver the course of his career, his compositions were recorded or covered by artists including Willie Nelson, Bill Withers, Brenda Lee, Jay-Z, Pet Shop Boys and Michael Bubl\u00e9.\nIn 2000, he was named one of the top songwriters of the 20th Century alongside Paul McCartney, Elton John and Holland-Dozier-Holland.\nHe died at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, on 8 June. \nIn a statement, James's family said \"his larger-than-life personality filled any room he was in, and his smile lit it up\". \n\"He was a captivating storyteller who had the sweetest smile, the most infectious laugh and a twinkle in his eye that never dimmed,\" they said.\nNews of his death was first reported by the Houston Chronicle.\nJames was born Francis Zambon in Houston in 1940 and gravitated towards music at a young age. By 1959, he was performing locally and had recorded a single called Jive Note. \nHis career was put on hold when he was drafted into the army to fight in the Vietnam War.\nOn his return, he signed to a Memphis music publishing company, where he helped write songs for fellow Houston native BJ Thomas - including his breakout hit The Eyes Of A New York Woman.\nThe partnership also produced Hooked On A Feeling and It\u2019s Only Love, but James still had ambitions to become an artist in his own right.\nHe recorded his own version of Suspicious Minds in 1968, with the lyrics inspired by his own relationship. James was married but still had feelings for his childhood sweetheart - who was also married. \n\"It was a confusing time for me,\" he later told the Wall Street Journal. \"I felt as though all three of us were all caught in this trap that we couldn't walk out of.\"\nThe record label was confident that James's recording would be a smash, but it failed to chart.\nA year later, Elvis was booked into the studio where James worked, and the star was looking for new material to record. Suspicious Minds was suggested, and the star went \"crazy about it\".\n\"He wanted to hear the song over and over again, and learned it on the spot,\" said producer Chips Moman.\nUsing almost exactly the same arrangement as James's original, Elvis took the song to number one in 1969 - rejuvenating his career.\nElvis would return to James for further hits, including It\u2019s Only Love, Moody Blue and Raised on Rock. \nBut perhaps their best-known collaboration is Always On My Mind.\nFirst recorded by Brenda Lee, then Gwen McCrae, the ballad was co-written by James alongside Johnny Christopher and Wayne Carson in 1971.\nElvis covered it two years later, initially issuing the song as the B-side of Separate Ways. In the UK, it was promoted to A-side status and reached number nine in the charts.\nSince then, it has been recorded by more than 300 other acts. Willie Nelson's version topped the US country charts in 1982, and earned James a Grammy Award for song of the year.\nThe Pet Shop Boys also covered it in 1987, turning the winsome melody into a hi-NRG disco stomper. It became a Christmas number one single in the UK, and was later named the best cover of all time in a poll conducted by the BBC.\nIt's not the only one of James's songs to be revived by a cover version. In 1974, Swedish group Blue Swede recorded a pop version of Hooked on a Feeling and scored a US number one. \nThe song gained another lease of life when it featured in Quentin Tarantino's film Reservoir Dogs, and Blue Swede singer Bj\u00f6rn Skifs performed it at the opening of this year's Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo.\nJames's songs Sunday Sunrise and Raised on Rock have also been recorded by multiple artists, and the Fine Young Cannibals released a hit version of Suspicious Minds in 1986.\nThe musician continued to write hits throughout the 1970s, as well as releasing music with his own band, The Mark James Trio.\nIn later years, he became more interested in film scores, and studied the discipline at UCLA and the American Film Institute. The 2001 short film Trade Day has a score by him, under his birth name.\nHe was inducted to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014, and was also entered into the Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame, the New York Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\nSpeaking in 2021, James looked back at his career and said he was \"thankful\" that his songs were \"still being embraced by new generations of listeners around the world\".\nBJ Thomas once said his friend had a gift for \"telling stories in a concise way\".\n\"They get to the point. They\u2019re relatable. They\u2019re familiar.\"\nJames is survived by his wife of 53 years, Karen Zambon; his daughters Sammie and Dana Zambon; grandchildren and extended family.\nIn a statement, they said: \"Mark\u2019s legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him, and through his timeless lyrics and mel",
    "What's in a number? \nDespite being nothing more than superstition, the continuing belief in 13's malign influence is so baked into our culture that even a down-to-earth profession like building is affected by it.\nEagle-eyed commuters stepping off the train in Cardiff have noticed that a construction site in the centre of the capital has a glaring omission.\nOne of the inner supporting towers being built for the Central Quay development on the old Brain's brewery site has numbers displayed on every floor of the unfinished building - except the 13th.\nThis is more common than you might think in the 21st Century. Some buildings, including apartment blocks and hotels, skip 13 entirely.\nThe 13th floor may be named 12A, or used to house infrastructure the building needs rather than apartments or offices.\nOthers, like one of the taller hotels in Cardiff, jump straight from 12 to 14.\nHouses numbered 13 are usually cheaper while in the past some councils have actually banned new housing developments from using the number because residents do not like living there.\nA survey of people in Britain suggested 14% of them believed the number 13 was inherently unlucky, while a further 9% don't know.\nSarah Thomas from Grangetown in Cardiff spotted the tower on the Brains site when she was coming out of her offices at Network Rail nearby.\n\"It piqued my curiosity when I saw it was missing,\" she said.\n\"I did assume it was down to superstition, but I Googled to confirm and only then realised how widely practised it is. Quite a few friends have said they've been in buildings or lifts where the number 13 is missing - clearly I need to visit some taller structures.\"\nShe describes herself as not superstitious but feels some habits stem from common sense, adding: \"I'd rather not walk under a ladder if possible, to avoid the risk of injury.\n\"I do find the history behind superstitions interesting as they give us an insight into how people connected specific events with more day-to-day activities.\"\nSome of the most high-profile structures in the UK retain the superstition.\nWhen London's Canary Wharf was redeveloped and the distinctive One Canada Square tower was built in 1990 - at the time the tallest building in the UK - it opened its doors minus a floor 13 and remains the same today.\nAnd if you want to take a spin on one of the London Eye's 32 pods, you may be surprised to learn you can book number 33. Which, naturally, replaces the missing number 13.\nConventional wisdom has blamed a number of sources for 13's supposed bad luck.\nOne is linked to Christianity - there were 13 people at Jesus Christ's last supper which happened just before he was betrayed by Judas Iscariot, the 13th to be seated, and arrested for blasphemy.\nSimilarly in Norse mythology, Loki, the god of mischief and deception, is the 13th guest at a dinner of the gods where he tricks one of Odin's sons into killing another.\nThe fear of 13 - officially called triskaidekaphobia - goes into overdrive when coupled with Friday, which is also loosely associated with bad luck because it was the day Christ died on.\nBut why do people in supposedly enlightened societies still cling to such a belief? \nPerhaps because, surprisingly, it is a pretty modern belief and not one with centuries of tradition behind it after all, according to Cardiff University lecturer Dr Juliette Wood, an expert in mythology and folklore.\n\"It isn't folklore in the sense that it's not an old tradition. It has nothing to do with the fact there were 13 people at the last supper,\" she said.\nInstead, she believes it is essentially a media creation which became popular around the turn of the 20th Century, which has become a kind of modern folklore in its own right and is reinforced through media, including films such as Friday the 13th.\nSearches back beyond this time have not produced references to unlucky number 13.\nBut people look back for stories that fit the creation of a myth, and have latched on to the most famous examples.\n\"It kind of makes so much sense, particularly because of the last supper link, that it's stuck,\" Dr Wood explains.\nThe idea of Loki as a source is likely to be even more recent.\nShe added: \"This notion of Norse mythology as a kind of touchstone for culture is actually quite recent. \n\"It goes back to the interest that you find in Britain in the 19th Century in finding our Germanic heritage and a number of British scholars translated the Nordic myths for the first time.\n\"And now of course since the Marvel films, Loki is a hero. So you get reasons to focus on a particular figure and you get this kind of transference.\"\nThe idea of unlucky days is indeed a much older convention - think of the Roman Ides of March (the 15th) which was reinforced in Roman belief following the assassination of Julius Caesar on that day, and popularised by the Shakespearean tragedy telling his story.\nDr Wood said: \"We love superstitions. We love to be able to say in this highly mechanistic, highly uncertain world '",

    "The US House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\nThe Republican-controlled chamber passed its resolution by a 216-207 vote, with only one Republican siding with the united Democratic opposition.\nMr Garland refused to turn over interview tapes from a justice department probe of President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents.\nReacting to the contempt vote, he said House Republicans had \u201cturned a serious congressional authority into a partisan weapon\".\n\"Today\u2019s vote disregards the constitutional separation of powers, the Justice Department\u2019s need to protect its investigations, and the substantial amount of information we have provided to the Committees,\" he wrote in a statement.\nAmerica's top law enforcement officer now becomes only the third attorney general in US history, and fourth sitting cabinet member overall, to be held in contempt of Congress.\nThe contempt resolution recommends that the justice department make a decision on whether or not to criminally prosecute Mr Garland.\nUnder federal law, contempt is a misdemeanour charge punishable by up to one year in jail and a $100,000 (\u00a378,000) fine. Steve Bannon, an ally of former President Donald Trump, faces four months behind bars over a contempt citation, while former Trump aide Peter Navarro is already serving time on his own charge.  \nBut Wednesday\u2019s vote functions as a partisan exercise given that a justice department prosecutor would almost certainly not pursue criminal charges against the head of their own agency.\nAttorneys General William Barr and Eric Holder, who respectively served the preceding Republican and Democratic administrations, also were held in contempt of Congress along partisan lines. Neither faced criminal charges.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, however, described the vote as \"a significant step in maintaining the integrity of our oversight processes and responsibilities\".\nModerate Ohio lawmaker David Joyce was the lone Republican to oppose the resolution, as did all 206 Democrats present for the vote.\n\u201cAs a former prosecutor, I cannot in good conscience support a resolution that would further politicize our judicial system to score political points,\" he said in a statement.\nThe push to hold Mr Garland in contempt follows a year-long inquiry by Special Counsel Robert Hur into Mr Biden's retention of classified documents after he served as vice-president.\nMr Biden was vice-president from 2009-17 in Barack Obama's administration.\nIn a lengthy report released in February, Mr Hur concluded that no criminal charges were warranted, though Mr Biden appeared to have \"willfully\" retained classified materials as a private citizen.\nThe Garland-appointed prosecutor noted he believed prosecutors would struggle to secure a conviction against Mr Biden, as jurors likely would view him as a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\".\nThat characterisation came after the president sat for five hours of interviews, spanning two days last October, with Mr Hur's team.\nHe said that Mr Biden was unable to recall certain details relevant to the investigation, as well as milestones in his own life such as the years of his vice-presidency and when his oldest son, Beau, died from cancer.\nThe report's release sparked a political firestorm, highlighting for critics one of the president's biggest weaknesses - voter concerns about his age and lucidity - in the midst of his bid for re-election.\nLawyers for Mr Biden disputed descriptions of the interview, accusing Mr Hur of using \"highly prejudicial language to describe a commonplace occurrence among witnesses: a lack of recall of years-old events\u201d.\nIn March, Mr Garland provided congressional Republicans with a full transcript of the interview - but he has resisted their subpoenas demanding audio recordings of the conversation.\nOn his advice, the president last month invoked \"executive privilege\" to block congressional Republicans from accessing tapes of the interview. The legal doctrine grants presidents the right to withhold executive branch information from the other two branches of government.\nMr Garland argued that turning them over could \u201cchill cooperation with the department in future investigations\u201d.\nIn testimony before Congress last week, he slammed Republicans' contempt measure as \"only the most recent in a long line of attacks\" on his agency's work.\nRepublicans claim the Biden administration has \"weaponised\" the justice department against its political opponents - largely a reference to the criminal prosecutions of former President Donald Trump.\nThis is despite the fact Mr Garland's justice department has also prosecuted Mr Biden's son, Hunter, and two sitting Democratic members of Congress.\nIn a Washington Post opinion piece on Tuesday, the attorney general wrote that \"the Justice Department is under attack like never before\".\nHe cited a rise in \"conspiracy theories, falsehoods, violence and threats of violence\" towards departme",

    "The United Nations has added Israel's military, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad's armed wing for the first time to its list of offenders for violating children\u2019s rights.\nThe three entities, along with Sudan's warring parties, have been singled out for the killing and maiming of children.\n\u201cChildren were killed and maimed in unprecedented numbers\", the Children in Armed Conflict report said.\nThe annual report - seen by the BBC and due to be released on Thursday - is meant to shame parties so that they commit to measures outlined by the UN to protect children.\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the conflict between Israel and Palestinian groups has led to grave violations on an unprecedented scale and intensity, notably in Gaza.\n\"Children bore the brunt of multiplying and escalating crises that were marked by a complete disregard for child rights, notably the inherent right to life,\" the report said.\nThe report said the conflict in Gaza has led to a 155% increase in what it categorised as \"grave violations\" against children.\nThe UN verified more than 8,000 grave violations against 4,247 Palestinian children and 113 Israeli children in 2023, the report said.\nBut verification is ongoing with thousands of reports about children dead and injured still needing to be checked.\n\"Most incidents were caused by the use of explosive weapons in populated areas by Israeli armed and security forces,\" the report states. \nIsrael's UN envoy Gilad Erdan said last week he had been notified that Israel's military had been added to the list, saying he was \"shocked and disgusted by this shameful decision\".\nHamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were also put on the list for killing, injuring and abducting children.\nThe two groups \u2013 which are designated as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries - are yet to comment on the report.\nIsrael launched its offensive after Hamas attacked communities near Gaza on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people including 38 children and taking 251 hostages including 42 children, according to Israel's National Council for the Child.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 36,731 people have since been killed by Israeli bombardment and ground attacks.\nSudan's warring factions were also mentioned prominently.\nThe report placed the Sudanese army as well as the rival Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the blacklist for \"the killing and maiming of children, and for attacks on schools and hospitals\". \nThe two parties have been embroiled in a civil war for more than 14 months.\nThe UN said it has seen a \"staggering\" 480% increase \"in grave violations against children\" in Sudan. \nThe RSF paramilitary force was listed for recruiting children and for \"rape and other forms of sexual violence against children\".\nWhile the Sudanese Armed Forces were singled out for the killing and maiming of children \"at unprecedented levels\", including through \"the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects, including in highly-populated areas\".\nThe Russian military and \"affiliated armed groups\" remained on the blacklist for killing 80 children in Ukraine in 2023 and injuring 339.\nSome of the gravest violations were also verified in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, Somalia, and Nigeria.

    "One of the US college instructors stabbed in China during an attack in a busy park has recounted the horror and shock of the incident.  \nDavid Zabner is one of four instructors from Cornell College in Iowa who was attacked Monday in the north-eastern province of Jilin, where they were working with a local partner university. \nPolice say a 55-year-old man with the surname Cui was arrested in the incident. \nMr Zabner said he and his colleagues went to visit the \"beautiful, green, mountainous\" Beishan Park when a man assaulted them. \n\u201cI turned around to find a man brandishing a knife at me,\" he told Iowa Public Radio from a hospital in China. \"I didn\u2019t immediately realise what was happening.\"\n\u201cThen I looked down at my shoulder and realised, 'I\u2019m bleeding. I\u2019ve been stabbed,'\" he said. \nAs of Tuesday, Mr Zabner and his three colleagues were receiving treatment for non life-threatening injuries in a hospital. A fifth person, a Chinese tourist, was also injured. \nNone of the other victims have been publicly identified. \nPolice have described the attack - a rare occurrence for foreigners in the country - as an isolated incident. \nThey say the assailant clashed with one of the Americans and stabbed them. He went on to injure three other US visitors and a Chinese tourist who tried to come to their rescue.\n\u201cPolice told us that he was unemployed and down on his luck, and that somebody in our group bumped into the man,\u201d Mr Zabner told Iowa Public Radio. \u201cAnd he decided to respond in the way he responded.\"\nImages of the incident circulating online - which showed at least three people bleeding on the ground - appeared to be quickly censored on China's internet. \nMr Zabner was identified as one of the victims by his brother, Iowa Representative Adam Zabner. His brother said David was a Tufts University doctoral student who had visited China before and was on his second trip to the country with Cornell College.\nThe school in Mount Vernon, Iowa, began a partnership with Beihua University in 2018 to provide money for Cornell professors to live in China and teach a part of a course over a two-week period.\nAmid tense diplomatic relations, Beijing and Washington have sought to re-establish people-to-people exchanges in recent times.\nMr Zabner said he first participated in the Cornell-Beihua program in 2019 to teach computer science classes. \nHe said it was cold outside during his first visit to the country and was excited for this trip because it was the summer months, he told Iowa Public Radio.\nMr Zabner's brother, Adam, told the BBC the US State Department and Iowa's federal delegation were working to bring him back. \n\"My family is incredibly grateful that David survived this attack,\" he said. \nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday on X, previously known as Twitter, that the US was \"deeply concerned\" by the stabbing.\nHe said his team had been in touch with their Chinese counterparts and the victims of the attack to ensure they were receiving help and that \"appropriate law enforcement steps are being taken\".

    "The UK economy failed to grow in April after particularly wet weather put off shoppers and slowed down construction.\nThe official data is what most economists had expected and comes after the fastest growth in two years from January to March, ending the recession from the final half of last year.\nThe economy is a key battleground in the run-up to the general election on 4 July, with the main parties debating whether the latest numbers point to a continued recovery or stagnation.\nThe Conservatives argue they show the economy has \"turned a corner\", while Labour say they \"expose the damage done\".\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show spending on services, which includes everything from hairdressers to hospitality, grew for the fourth month in a row.\nHowever, this was off-set by falls in production and in the construction industry.\nThe UK's gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the value of goods and services produced in a country over time, had grown 0.4% in March.\nSome parts of the services industry performed better than others. \nThe information, communication, and scientific sector grew the most, while shop trade fell.\nThe ONS said some retail businesses told them their output was dented because of the wetter weather, with rainfall for the month well above the long-term average.\nHowever, it added that it was \"difficult to quantify the exact impact\" of the rainfall.\nOutput in services for consumers, many of whom are still struggling to cope with the steep rises in the cost of living, fell by 0.7%. \nEconomists do also warn against placing too much weight on shifts in economic activity over one month because they can be affected by factors like the weather or the timing of the Easter holidays. \nOver the three months to April, the economy grew, up by 0.7% from February to April. \nThe Bank of England will look at the figures alongside a range of others next Thursday when it meets to decide what to do about the interest rate.\nMost economists do not believe Wednesday's update will sway the decision much though, as it was broadly in line with expectations.\nMany people are struggling not only with higher energy and food bills, but with higher mortgage payments as interest rates have gone up, which the central bank has increased in a bid to tackle price rises.\nOne person who has seen the impact of price rises first-hand is Mark Breen, who runs the Old Kent Roastery coffee shop in Margate.\nDespite his own costs going up, he has not increased his prices in years because he is worried about scaring away customers.\n\"We get some people, especially in the winter, they come in and have one coffee and sit here all day. It\u2019s the way of life at the moment, people can\u2019t afford to buy things.\n\"I\u2019m lucky, I\u2019ve got a business. We\u2019re surviving but a lot of people are not.\u201d\nThe latest data comes during the third week of a campaigning period where promises around boosting the economy have played a key part.\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said the data showed the economy \"is turning a corner\".\n\"Under the Conservatives, we can keep the economy growing with our clear plan to cut taxes on work, homes and pensions,\" he added.\nHowever, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves focused on the flat reading seen in April, saying that: \"These figures expose the damage done after fourteen years of Conservative chaos.\"\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said: \"As Rishi Sunak's time as prime minister peters out, so does the UK's economic growth.\"\nEconomists had mixed views on what the latest figures mean. Some said it was \"positive\", while others said it was \"underwhelming\".\nAJ Bell's head of financial analysis Danni Hewson said that \"no growth is better than negative growth\", but described the three-month fall in construction as \"worrying\".\n\"There\u2019s little surprise that so much focus has been placed on housebuilding by political parties,\" she added.",
    "Chagos Islanders are sleeping in emergency shelter at a leisure centre in West Sussex after a \"significant number\" arrived from Mauritius at Gatwick Airport. \nIt comes after the government launched a British citizenship route for people of Chagossian descent in November 2022.\nChagossians were forced to leave their homeland when Britain bought the islands in the Indian Ocean in the 1960s. \nThe government said its guidance to Chagossian British citizens moving to the UK sets out that they should make their own accommodation arrangements before travelling.\nIt is understood that a steady stream of people with British passports have travelled to Gatwick since Monday, with dozens now being accommodated by Crawley Borough Council.\nA spokesperson for the council said following the arrival of a \"significant number of people from Mauritius\", it had assessed everyone against its statutory housing duties.\n\"Following the assessment, some were offered emergency accommodation. The remainder did not qualify for accommodation but had nowhere else to go,\" they added.\n\"We therefore had to set up a rest centre to provide shelter\".\nThe UK government granted British passports to Chagossians to recognise the role Britain played in expelling islanders in the 1960s and 1970s in order for a US military base to be built.\nAt the time, most of the population of the islands, which now form the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), was sent to Mauritius. \nMary Douce, 33, is among the group staying at the leisure centre. \nShe said: \"In Mauritius, it's very difficult. There's high inflation. We want to work but there's no opportunity for us.\"\nShe added that those who recognised the islands as being a British territory could be criminalised in the country due to a dispute over its sovereignty.  \nMisley Mandarin, who runs the group BIOT Citizens, claimed families with children were being housed in hotels and that 52 single adults were at the leisure centre.\nCrawley council disputed this figure, saying it was \"lower\", but would not say how many people it was currently accommodating. \nMr Mandarin said that arrivals knew \"that in the UK there's a housing crisis\". \nHe added: \"But what we say is our home is not the UK. Our home is not Mauritius. Our home is being used as the biggest military base for the western world.\" \nThe government said it was working with councils to help them manage new arrivals.\nThe Crawley council spokesperson described the situation as \"a challenge made harder by the housing situation in the town. \n\"In February of this year, the council was the first in England to declare a Housing Emergency. These pressures remain unabated.\u201d\nWest Sussex County Council has been contacted for comment.\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "The future of town centres is a topic of conversation never far from the lips of local people, especially ahead of an election.\nIn Ipswich, big-name retailers including BHS, Debenhams and Wilko have shut up shop in recent years.\nThis week, the town's general election hopefuls offered some solutions, and some complained about anti-social behaviour.\nHowever, residents and traders - including one business which says it can \"revive\" the \"dying\" High Street - see some cause for optimism.\nShopper Carol Smith, 76, from nearby Harkstead village, believes more variety for the older generation could be key to its survival.\n\"It\u2019s not like it used to be and so many shops are shut now, which is a shame,\" she said.\n\"We miss a lot of our shops.

    "On a terraced street in Middlesbrough, a teenager in a mask takes out a long kitchen knife from his trousers and says he\u2019s prepared to use it. \u201cIt\u2019s brutal round here, you have to be prepared, if you don\u2019t stab them, they will stab you.\u201d\nHe is part of a group of young drug dealers, and I have no reason to doubt him. One of them says he was 14 when he started. Why? Money - they talk openly about how much they can make from selling heroin and crack cocaine.\nAs if to emphasise the point, another in the group holds up small bags of white rocks, which he says are crack cocaine. They charge \u00a310 a bag and say they can sell hundreds of bags every week.\n\u201cNo-one is going to change it, the bobbies can\u2019t change it,\u201d one of the dealers says.\nWherever we went in Middlesbrough, people wanted to talk about the impact of drugs. On the Netherfields estate, we met Tony, proud to be from the town.\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you something, we call it the penthouse,\u201d he says excitedly. He shows me a small block of flats where nearly every window has been smashed out or boarded up.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the one - many more homes here have been vandalised and smashed. Tony is incandescent: \u201cIt\u2019s degrading, we feel like a waste of space, like we\u2019re non-existent.\u201d\nThe demand for drugs is high. In 2022, the government estimated that there were more than 300,000 people dependent on heroin and crack cocaine in England. And between them, they were responsible for nearly half of all burglaries, robberies, and other acquisitive crime, like shoplifting.\nThe statistics  show that both the number of crimes recorded and the rate of crime has increased since before the pandemic, even if police say recorded crime (excluding fraud) fell by 1% in 2023 in England and Wales compared with the year before. Separately, the Crime Survey for England and Wales suggests that excluding fraud and computer misuse, crime has been steadily dropping since 2010.\nIt's a complex picture, but contributions to the BBC\u2019s Your Voice, Your Vote project  told us that for many people, crime is a major issue that they want the politicians to fix. So we came to Middlesbrough to hear people\u2019s experience of it here.\nTo many people who live in Middlesbrough, it certainly doesn\u2019t feel like crime is falling. Last year, Cleveland police recorded the highest overall crime rate out of all forces in England and Wales, affecting 137 out of every 1,000 people.\nI spent three days here, and found that crime numbers don\u2019t tell the full story of what\u2019s happening in communities like North Ormesby, who are desperate for help.\nAidan is in his 20s and has a young family to support. He works hard in a restaurant, grabbing every hour offered and he\u2019s also set up his own business as a handyman. He says he sometimes works over 70 hours a week.\nAs we walk and talk, someone shouts \u201cwelcome to Beirut!\u201c Aidan says he\u2019s desperate to succeed but admits to being scared in the place he calls home. He takes us to one street with about 50 homes, and we walk past smashed windows, boarded up windows, and homes with obscenities sprayed on the walls in red paint. He reckons that on this one street, about 20 homes have been burgled over the past four years.\nOfficially, fewer people are being burgled. The Crime Survey for England and Wales suggests that there are less than a fifth of the number of burglaries that there were back in 1995. But in 2023, Cleveland police recorded the second highest rate of theft and the second highest rate of violence against a person.\nWhat Aidan says next explains a lot of the despair that people feel. \u201cWe\u2019ve been burgled, the police never came out, all I got was a crime reference number.\n\u201cI\u2019m paying more council tax, energy bills and rent than ever before but the services I\u2019m getting back have decreased.\u201d\nThe most recent annual Home Office data says that in the year to March 2023, fewer than 4% of burglary offences in England and Wales resulted in a charge, albeit this was up on the previous year. In North Ormesby, the part of Middlesbrough where Aidan lives, around 95 in every 100 crimes last year went unsolved.\nCleveland police say they\u2019ve taken a proactive approach in Netherfields, imposing five dispersal orders and have arrested children as young as 12. CCTV now covers the estate and people here say the anti-social behaviour issues with teenagers is calming down. In North Ormesby and across the region, police say they are working closely with people in the community and working with multiple local agencies.\nBut in late 2022, the UK\u2019s then lead for neighbourhood policing said officers were spending too much time taking care of social problems, and not enough on tackling crime. Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney, now retired, said officers could spend half their shifts working on behalf of other services.\nShe said it meant that victims were being failed and the criminal justice system was in crisis.\nIn North Ormesby we came across a classic example - a police van attending what we thought was an emerg",

Managers of the Leith site said it was \"open for business\".\nVestas' plan is expected to bring hundreds of high-skill jobs to the Edinburgh port.\nIt falls within one of several sites around the Firth of Forth designated as a \"green freeport\", also including Grangemouth, Rosyth and Burntisland. \nThe Rosyth site has been expanded since the proposal was first lodged to include parts of its Royal Navy base.\nThe other green freeport in Scotland is around the Moray and Cromarty Firths, on sites including Invergordon, Nigg, Ardersier and Inverness docks.\nAs well as providing quayside space for the laydown and assembly of offshore wind installations, these sites are being developed for manufacturing. \nUntil now, much of the equipment has been imported. The next phase of Scottish offshore wind development is on condition that a higher proportion of the supply chain is in Scotland.\nThere are only two factories in Britain where blades are made for wind turbines - one on the Isle of Wight, run by Vestas, and the other in Hull, run by the German-Spanish joint venture Siemens Gamesa.\nThe plan for Leith would see it producing Vestas' new design of offshore blade, known as B236, which will be 115 metres (377 ft) long.  \nA turbine with three such blades is rated at 15 megawatts, from which its average output would power roughly 13,000 homes.\nBuilt mainly from composite fibreglass and resin, the process of manufacturing blades is highly-skilled, requiring several hundred workers to produce them at a viable scale.\nBlades are a particularly valuable part of the supply chain for wind turbines, also including the steel towers, the jacket or base and the nascelle, or gearbox.\nAt least one other company, Mingyang Smart Energy, is in the planning and development process for building turbines in Scotland. \nAs it is based in China, that has raised concerns about vulnerability to trade and security tensions between Beijing and the UK.\nVestas and its planning agent lodged a Proposal of Application Notice on Friday, which was published yesterday, starting the planning process with City of Edinburgh Council. The firm intends to consult with the Leith community over summer.\nA spokesman said: \"The UK\u2019s offshore wind sector has strong potential, and Vestas has identified the Port of Leith as a possible location for a wind turbine blade manufacturing facility.\"\n\"A final investment decision has not been made and will be based on several factors including the viability of the business case and the market outlook.\"\nVestas, which operates in more than 80 countries around the world, is seeking clarity on the flow of orders. These depend, in turn, on UK auctions which provide a guaranteed floor price for the power produced, as well as consents to link wind farms to the electricity grid.\nThe potential boom in supplying the offshore renewables industry also depends on the cost of capital, which has risen steeply, on unblocking bottlenecks in the planning process, and on other supplies, including subsea cables.\nForth Green Freeport says applications for investment tax breaks, starting from today, will have to comply with conditions on employment and environment standards.\nDame Susan Rice, chair of the consortium of landowners, said: \u201cThis is it. Forth Green Freeport is officially open for business. It is an important time for the Green Freeport as we move through the business case development phase to delivery for Scotland.\n\u201cThrough innovations in offshore wind manufacturing, assembly and commissioning, alongside innovative shipbuilding, modular assembly and hydrogen manufacture, the country\u2019s net zero targets can be boosted by Forth Green Freeport.\n\u201cThis is a long-term project and one which we know will deliver real benefits to the local communities through economic growth, skills re-training and training and access to high quality, green jobs.\u201d",
    "Airports have criticised the government\u2019s sudden re-introduction of 100ml limits on liquids in hand luggage last weekend.\nThe Airport Operators Association (AOA) said it had left airports \"frustrated\" and created uncertainty and confusion for passengers as the busiest time of year approached.\nAfter installing high-tech new scanning equipment, some regional airports had scrapped liquid restrictions. Major hubs had not yet switched to the new rules, but are rolling out the machines.\nThe transport secretary has insisted the re-imposition of the old limits is \"temporary\u2019\" but it\u2019s unclear how long the situation will last.\nThe government requires all UK airports to upgrade to \"next generation\" security.  \nNew scanners which produce 3D images should mean liquids up to two litres and laptops can be kept in hand luggage to go through security.\nThe likes of Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester were allowed to miss the latest deadline for installing them  \u2013 1 June this year - after various logistical challenges.\nHowever London City, Teesside, Newcastle, Leeds-Bradford, Aberdeen and Southend had complied on time and dropped the old liquids rules \u2013 some as early as Spring last year.  \nBirmingham completed its installation but was told to keep the 100ml limit while waiting for regulatory approval.\nBut on Friday, an unexpected announcement from the Department for Transport (DfT) said that from Sunday, liquids, gels and pastes could once again only be taken through airport security in containers of 100ml or less.\nAt the time, the DfT said it was not in response to a specific threat, but \"to enable further improvements to be made to the new checkpoint systems\".\nThe BBC understands the government department felt it had to move quickly after receiving some new information about the scanners, is working with international partners, and will lift the restrictions once the issue has been resolved.\nThe sudden change caused consternation among airport bosses, who were only informed on the Friday.\nKaren Dee, chief executive of trade body the Airport Operators Association, said hundreds of millions of pounds were being spent on a \"huge\" programme of change, as instructed by the government.\nShe said airports supported decisions on security, but Friday\u2019s \"surprise\" announcement \"was sprung on us with very little time to react\", and this \"created uncertainty for passengers just as airports enter their busiest periods of the year\".\n\"It has also put airport operators in a challenging position, with very limited time to prepare for the additional staffing and wider resources that this will require, and no clear idea of when this issue will be resolved.\"\nAirports who had fully switched the new systems and have trained and rostered their staff accordingly, are most affected, unable to use the expensive, new equipment to its full potential.\nThe change is understood to have led to more items being rejected or confiscated as passengers have turned up expecting to be allowed to take larger containers through.\nSome larger airports who were only part way through their roll-outs had been using the new scanners in some areas so have also had to quickly alter ways of working.\nThirty airport bosses, along with the AOA, have jointly written to the transport secretary, aviation minister and civil servants today in response to Friday\u2019s announcement.\nAmong the questions they want answering are how the decision was taken, what it means for airports who are part-way through their roll-out - with implications for staff training programmes - and how long the reversion to the 100ml limit will last.\nMs Dee said airports were doing all they could to mitigate the impact. She asked passengers to come prepared to comply with the liquid limit until advised otherwise.\nA DfT spokesperson said Friday\u2019s announcement only affected people travelling from six regional airports where Next Generation Security Checkpoints (NGSC) were already in full operation, which it said was around 6% of all UK air passengers.\nThey added security measures would remain unchanged from those in place since 2006 for most passengers, and travellers should continue to check security requirements with their departure airport.\nThe department said it had communicated with airports swiftly upon receiving new information.",
    "The company responsible for a bridge that has not lifted for river traffic since April said the closure was triggered by the bad behaviour of the public when it malfunctioned.\nPeel Ports, which operates the Haven Bridge in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, previously said the bridge was shut due to \"health and safety\" reasons.\nIt has now emerged that when the crossing had a fault in February, frustrated travellers decided to take matters into their own hands and the operators feared it would happen again.\nThe ongoing blockade has infuriated boaters and marine industries that rely on being able to navigate through it to get between the Norfolk Broads and the North Sea.\nIn 2019, the 94-year-old bridge, which carries a major road into Yarmouth across the Yare, suffered a catastrophic failure that led to a \u00a32m rebuild, completed in December. \nThe bridge broke down again on 2 February and was only being opened at 10:00 and 14:00 daily until 9 April, when Peel Ports shut the bridge completely, blaming a \"health and safety concern\", the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nIt has revealed that the refusal to lift the bridge started after some people - who were said to be intoxicated \u2013 tried to direct traffic and others jumped over safety barriers in an attempt to see if they could still cross.\nThe company feared a repeat of the scenes, so has refused to open the bridge, even though it has a statutory duty to open it for river traffic.\nIt is demanding that Norfolk County Council, which owns the crossing, does more to address its health and safety concerns.\n\"We saw people jumping the barriers, walking into the road and even had an intoxicated individual directing traffic \u2013 all on the same day,\" said director Richard Goffin, after the incident.\nHe also claimed staff had been threatened with violence on other occasions.\nA spokesman said more than half a dozen incidents were reported over the course of a few days following the initial flash point on 2 February.\n\"The point is more that they happened rather than the number of them. No-one should be threatened at work,\" he said.\nHe added that the current situation left staff facing \"unacceptable risks\", but discussions with the council to resolve the concerns had failed.\nNorfolk County Council said it had carried out repairs on the bridge following the February incident and it was now fully operational.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A year since his father was stabbed to death by Valdo Calocane, Lee Coates says he is still bearing the trauma of that fateful day.\nThe 37-year-old has told the BBC his mental health was affected by the aftermath of the Nottingham attacks - which also claimed the lives of 19-year-old students Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber.\nThe son says he is still coming to terms with losing his father Ian.\nHe and the families of the other victims have vowed to continue their \"pursuit for justice\" on a day where a number of events are planned across the city to mourn their loss.\n\"I was getting - I don\u2019t know if you call it PTSD - but I\u2019d close my eyes and all I could envision was what happened that night,\" he said.\n\"You can\u2019t help but let that run through your head and how your dad was left lying there.\"\nThe 37-year-old said he thought he could start \"dealing with the grief\" after Calocane's trial but said he \"didn't get any closure\".\n\"I think after that, that\u2019s where it started affecting me a lot more and I could see it really got to my mental health.\" \nCalocane was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. \nThe CPS said medical experts provided \"overwhelming\" evidence that he was suffering from a serious mental health condition at the time of the attacks. \nHis sentence was challenged by the victims' families but judges ruled in May that it was not unduly lenient, after the attorney general referred it to the Court of Appeal for review.\nMr Coates's youngest son said he had been \"very, very angry\" but is now in a better place, adding: \u201cI never thought about my dad every day before. I definitely do think about him everyday now. \n\"So before I leave my apartment, there\u2019s a picture of my dad and I kind of [tell myself] 'I\u2019m going to do you proud', like he did me proud.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Huntingdon Academy in St Ann's, where Mr Coates worked as caretaker, is hosting a special day in his memory. \nHis son said: \"He wouldn\u2019t want his name on anything.

But that's all we knew.\nIt was about seven o\u2019clock in the morning and you could sense something very serious had happened. \nFor a moment it seemed like the clocks had stopped ticking \u2013 with no trams or buses running and rush hour traffic unable to get through.\nEveryone who became stranded in the city centre left on foot, power-walking to work or school.\nThe shocking scenes in our city made national news before we even knew what was really going on - and then the more we learned about it, the worse it got.\nOur shock and worry soon turned into grief, and thousands of us descended to Old Market Square to pay our tributes to Barnaby, Grace and Ian.\nIt\u2019s a day we \u2013 all the people of Nottingham \u2013 will never forget.\nMarking a year on from the Nottingham attacks, the families will walk down Ilkeston Road, where Miss O'Malley-Kumar and Mr Webber were fatally stabbed, and lay flowers. \nA ceremony will also be held at the University of Nottingham. \nShearer West, Vice-Chancellor at the university, said:  \u201cWe came together as a community last year when this terrible event happened and I think it\u2019s really important we come together again. \n\"I\u2019m really proud of the way our university community did come together last year and I think we need to be able to remember our great students Barney and Grace one year on.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the families of the victims say they have accepted the support of legal experts as they await the outcomes of further investigations into the case.\nAfter a review into how the CPS handled the case, the victims' families called for changes to homicide laws, and have maintained the case was poorly handled. \nIn a statement released on Thursday, the families said the anniversary was \"not the day for a fight\", but vowed to continue going forward. \nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating Nottinghamshire Police and Leicestershire Police in relation to their separate involvement with Calocane.\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) is due to publish a further report into inpatient mental health services at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust this summer. \nIn a joint statement on Thursday, the families of the victims said: \"Today we will take time and pause to reflect upon ",
    "A man who rescued an old banger said he had death threats for turning it into a speed record breaker.\nJoel McNally and his father, from Sharnbrook in Bedfordshire, found the run-down 1935 Riley Kestrel in The Netherlands five years ago.\nThey spent months rebuilding the \"Flying Kestrel\" and almost destroyed it during their first record attempt.\nMr McNally said the threats came from people who wanted the car to remain in its original state.\nThe story of the Flying Kestrel began with a tip-off about the shell of an 84-year-old vehicle standing alone and unloved in The Netherlands.\nMr McNally and his father flew over and bought the car.\nSpeaking to BBC Three Counties Radio, he said: \"It was that heat-of-the-moment decision but it was very much with our hearts.\n\"We put the car together and it was meticulously made over the course of six to eight months.\"\nThe project almost came to an abrupt end on its first record attempt.\n\"We crashed the vehicle at 150mph and rolled it five times,\" said Mr McNally.\n\"The driver was OK [and] we rebuilt the car, put it in a wind tunnel and now we're boasting 992 brake horsepower.\"\nIt went on to \"break seven land speed records using only half of its power.\"\nBut not everyone has admired their work. \nMr McNally said: \"I've received death threats over the car from enthusiasts - it's hard to believe, but people are that passionate about keeping the car original. \n\"At the end of the day, it's our car, we can do what we want and if anyone wants to buy it from me, I wouldn't sell it for less than \u00a32m.\"\nThe next goal is to get the octogenarian Riley to break the 200mph barrier, and an attempt takes place on 17 June in Yorkshire.\nThe father and son team have worked to get the vehicle ready for its greatest test yet.\n\"We had a couple of heating issues with the engine, which we've now sorted out, we've introduced nitrous oxide so there's even more power than before,\" Mr McNally said.\n\"The car theoretically can do 230mph so [the 200mph run] is down to the British weather which, this year, is not playing ball.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A man who punched a police officer causing her to lose a tooth has been ordered to pay \u00a38,500.\nJason Garfoot, 51, injured the officer when she was called to his home in Pinder Lane, in Donington, Lincolnshire, on 14 November 2023 after police received reports of a man being aggressive towards a paramedic.\nHe was spared jail at Lincoln Crown Court after admitting assaulting an emergency worker [paramedic] and assault occasioning actual bodily harm to the police officer.\nSentencing him, Judge James House KC said: \"It is apparent there was a reason behind this, he was suffering a mental health breakdown.\" \nThe court heard the officer suffered \"a very violent blow\", which left her with a \"loosened front tooth\" that had to be removed at a cost of \u00a31,500.\nProsecutor Noel Philo said she attended the scene, with another male colleague, and was informed Garfoot had been drinking and \"possibly taken some prescribed medication\".\n\"He came to the door and aggressively barged past the paramedic who was stood in front of him,\" said Mr Philo.\nThe male officer tried to calm the situation by pushing Garfoot with a palm to his chest but the defendant \"reacted [with] a very heavy punch\", which missed him and struck his colleague, who was standing nearby, said Mr Philo.\nThe judge was told Garfoot was \"instantly apologetic\" during his police interview.

    "A US government employee has apologised for her \"tragic mistake\" which resulted in the death of Harry Dunn, an inquest has heard.\nMr Dunn, 19, was hit outside US airbase RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire in 2019 by a car driven by an American woman, Anne Sacoolas.\nSacoolas, who was absent from the inquest, supplied two new statements to Northampton Coroners' Court. The inquest also heard her responses during a police interview two months after the fatal crash and a statement from her lawyers in 2020.\nSacoolas left the country after the crash, claiming diplomatic immunity.\nShe was eventually sentenced, via video link, to eight months in prison, suspended for a year, for causing death by careless driving.\nIn the statement taken during a voluntary interview by Northamptonshire Police in 2019, Sacoolas insisted she was a \"safe driver\".\nThe inquest heard that when asked what she believed had caused the collision, she told Northamptonshire Police officers: \"I drove like an American and drove on the American side of the road.\"\nShe said that the crash is something that will live with her \"every single day for the rest of my life\".\nSacoolas, who gave her employment details to police as an analyst for the US State Department, rejected the coroner's invitation to give live evidence to the inquest.\nResponding to the statements provided to the court by Sacoolas, the Dunn family's spokesman Radd Seiger told the PA news agency: \"We have heard most of that before.\n\"Why on earth is Sacoolas not in court to answer the court's and the family's questions?\"\nA statement given by her lawyers in the US in September 2020 said Sacoolas had been driving on the wrong side of the road for 20 seconds before she hit Mr Dunn outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.\nShe said she had not received any training on driving on UK roads after arriving in the country.\nSacoolas, in her most recent statement to the inquest, said: \"I deeply regret having caused this accident.\n\"I made a tragic mistake that I will live with every single day for the rest of my life.\n\"There is not a single day that goes by that Harry is not on my mind and I am deeply sorry for the pain that I have caused.\"\nSacoolas added: \"Immediately after the accident, I hysterically flagged down a motorist and begged her to get help.\n\"While she called 999, I called my husband to contact the base for help, because we were so close to the base entrance.

    "Sewage pollution levels in the Mersey estuary are as high as they were in the 1980s despite efforts to clean it up, according to researchers.\nA study from Durham University used dried seaweed to compare levels going back 200 years.\nThey found the River Mersey and its estuary remained heavily polluted by nitrogen from sewage and said the \"shocking\" levels required immediate action.\nThe Environment Agency said it was committed to \"protecting and improving water quality\".\nIn the 1980s, the river was said to be the most polluted in western Europe and a public outcry sparked a clean-up campaign.\nA record level of species was found to be living in the River Mersey last year, which the Mersey Rivers Trust hailed as \" the greatest river recovery in Europe \".\nSpecies living in the river include rays, scorpion fish, types of eel and the rare venomous bluemouth rockfish. \nThe study, published in the journal Environmental Science: Advances, by geochemists Freya Alldred and Prof Darren Grocke used herbaria, dried seaweed, from collections which date back to the 1780s at the World Museum Liverpool.\nThey said it was the first time herbaria had been used to show how clean rivers were.\nHerbaria act like time capsules, capturing in its tissues the environmental conditions it was growing in, so it can identify nitrogen pollution changes over the past 200 years. \nProf Grocke said they were \"astonished\" at the \"elevated\" results showing it was \"dominated by sewage\" and called for immediate action to address the issue.\nHe added population growth was the main problem and called for more investment in infrastructure.\nOf the record levels of species being recorded in the River Mersey, he said: \"They're probably sporadic and not living there all the time and just venturing in and out.\"\nHe added: \"Although that conflicts with the evidence we have, if you go round the Liverpool Mersey area you'll see [they] don't have many mussels and other organisms that live on the rocks... and they normally help filter the water.\n\"So if we could even try and get those ecosystems back that will help clean the river up as well.\"\nProfessor of Physical Geography at the University of Manchester, Jamie Woodward, said the estuary was \"a hot-spot for sewage dumping\".\nHe said that was \"unacceptable\" and it was \"a threat to public health\".\nThe Environment Agency said: \u201cWe are committed to protecting and improving water quality.\n\"Our team works tirelessly to enforce regulations, conduct monitoring, and collaborate with stakeholders to address sources of pollution.\u201d\nThe Mersey Rivers Trust said water quality had been improving since the late 1980s with \"significant improvements in sewage treatment\".\n\"As a result we are seeing a lot more different species of fish in the estuary than 40 years ago and the return of shark, dolphin and porpoise.\"\nThe charity said it was working with a range of organisations \"to assess the water quality and ecological health of the Mersey to help determine the further actions required to continue improvements to river health\".  \nIt added: \"The study by Durham University is an interesting additional data contribution and we hope to discuss the work with the authors of the study in the near future.\u201d\nLiverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram has previously said he planned to make the River Mersey sewage free by 2030.",

    "The US Federal Reserve has signalled that it will cut its key interest rate just once this year despite inflation easing.  \nBack in March, the central bank had been expected to reduce borrowing costs three times by the end of 2024.\nHowever, on Wednesday, new forecasts from Fed officials who make decisions on rates pencilled in a single reduction.  \nThe new outlook emerged after the Fed voted to hold interest rates at their current 23-year high even as inflation ticked lower.\nInflation, which measures the pace of price rises, slowed to 3.3% in the year to May. That compares with 3.4% in the 12 months to April.\nHowever, between April and May inflation was unchanged and it remains above the Fed's 2% target.\nJerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said that only \"modest\" progress had been made on hitting the target and the central bank would need to see \"good inflation readings\" before interest rates can be cut.\nUS interest rates were held at 5.25%-5.5%.\nAnastassia Fedyk, assistant professor of finance at Haas Business School at the University of California Berkeley, told the BBC's Today programme: \"We did get some good news in terms of better inflation numbers.\n\"But the Fed is still being pretty cautious so they are signalling that in the future they are going to be doing one, most likely, rate drop and not a very large one at that.\"\nSome analysts suggested that the central bank would backtrack on the number of interest rate cuts this year. \nIan Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that reducing forecasts of interest rate cuts from three to one this year was \"unnecessarily aggressive\".\nWhile economists at Wells Fargo said it would be a \"close call\" between making one or two reductions in 2024.\nOfficials at the US Fed were split over how many interest rate cuts they expected this year. Of the 19 policymakers who gave their outlook, four expected no cut, seven forecasted one reduction while eight thought there would be two.\nForecasts from the US Fed signalled one modest cut to 5%-5.25%. \nMr Powell acknowledged that a reduction of this size would not have a major impact on the US economy.\nBut he said when a cut finally does come it would be \u201ca consequential decision for the economy\u201d which \u201cyou want to get right\".\nWhile inflation eased a little, the US employment market remains robust. Recent data showed that US employers added 272,000 jobs in May - far above the 185,000 expected.\nMs Fedyk said: \"The Fed is trying to react to the data but not overreact to the data.\"\nSome other major economies have cut interest rates, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada.\nBut the US - and the UK - are yet to make a similar move. The Bank of England will meet next week and is widely expected to hold interest rates at 5.25%, their highest level for 16 years.\nThe Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation has slowed significantly in the UK from a high of 11.1% in October 2022 to 2.3% currently.\nHowever, some elements of inflation remain stubbornly high. At the same time, average wage growth in the UK remains strong compared to inflation.\nEarlier this week, Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics said: \"Overall, the stickiness of wage growth may not stop the Bank from cutting interest rates for the first time in August, as we are forecasting, as long as other indicators such as pay settlements data and next week\u2019s CPI inflation release show decent progress.\"",
    "A head teacher says it would be \u201chypocritical\u201d to fell a 150-year-old tree on school land when its pupils are \u201cpassionate\u201d about the environment.\nThe 50-foot (15.24m) oak tree stands on the playing field of Thundersley Primary School, Essex.\nInsurers have told the school to chop the tree down as its roots may have caused cracks in a neighbouring property.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a loss as to how to solve this problem,\u201d head teacher Emma Dawson said.\nThe tree is older than the school itself, which was founded in 1921.\n\u201cLots of our parents and grandparents have talked about the time they spent underneath that tree,\u201d Ms Dawson told the BBC.\nBut cracks have now appeared in the conservatory of a residential property which borders the school\u2019s playing field and the school has been told the tree needs to be felled.\n\u201cWe want to be good neighbours and we don't want to be causing an issue,\u201d Ms Dawson said. \nShe described how the school\u2019s pupils \u201care really passionate about the environment\u201d.\n\u201cFor us to fell this tree seems very hypocritical and I think it would take a long time for those children to forget the sight of a tree disappearing from their grounds,\u201d Ms Dawson added.\nSchool staff said they are also concerned about drainage on the playing field if the tree is removed.\n\u201cThere's parts of this field that we can't really use over the winter because it does get quite boggy,\u201d Mr English said.\nStaff at the school have investigated alternative ways of keeping the tree instead, including installing root barriers under the ground, but say this could cost upwards of \u00a345,000.\n\u201cIt's absolutely impossible for us,\u201d said Simon English, chairman of the school\u2019s board of governors, who said that refusing to fell the tree could result in court action for the school, as reported in the Echo newspaper. \n\u201cWe would like to come to an amicable agreement that works for all parties, but we will fight to keep this tree for us as long as we can.\u201d\n\u201cWe can't justify spending any money on retaining a tree when the educational outcomes of our students have to be our priority,\u201d Mr English added.\nLV insurers for the residential property, told the BBC: \"We care about sustainability and we recognise that this is a highly emotive issue.\n\u201cWe always look for solutions that protect our natural and built environment and are looking into this specific case.\"\nA meeting is due to be held later this week between the school and local councillors to discuss the situation.\nThe BBC has contacted the school\u2019s insurers for comment.\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Football fans from Argentina and Scotland are united in music thanks to a catchy Euros track written by a Scottish postman.\nThe song called \"No Scotland No Party\" has attracted attention from 7,000 miles away because it is sung to the tune of a popular Argentine song about sporting icon  Diego Maradona. \nNick Morgan's Euros song quickly went viral on TikTok with over four million views and has been played by Argentinian TV and radio stations.\nNick, a Kilmarnock fan, said: \"It's been crazy. People thanking me and saying they're now supporting Scotland at the Euros, some people saying they're buying Scotland strips for when they're playing.\n\"It's just surreal to be honest, to think across the globe people in South America are listening to the track and it's been talked about on TV and on radio.\n\"I've been sent loads of articles. It's been big national newspapers, it's not small stations, it's the big time. It is hard to take in.\"\nNick got the idea after seeing a video of Maradona, who captained the 1986 World Cup-winning side, after he died in 2020.\n\"It came about when Maradona passed away and [there were] loads of tributes, \" he said.\n\"I found this clip of Maradona singing in a bar and his whole family is there, and friends, and there's a rock band behind him. \n\"There was just this song...  and as soon as I heard it, I fell in love with it, it's just so catchy.\"\nThe original song called \"La mano de Dios\" or \"The Hand of God\" was released in 2001 by late Argentine singer Rodrigo Bueno as a tribute to Maradona, widely regarded as one of the best footballers of all time.\nIt references the striker's notorious handball goal against England in the 1986 World Cup quarter final in Mexico. \nMaradona, who also starred for Barcelona and Napoli, went on to manage the Argentine national team.\nAnd, ironically, he won his first match in charge against Scotland at Hampden in 2008.\nWhile the original track is popular in Argentina, it was relatively unknown in Scotland until Nick released his tartan-tinted version.\nHe said: \"In this song I pay homage to Argentina.\n\"The theme of the song is basically we know we're not this amazing team, we know we're not Argentina, we're not world champions, but we've got these amazing players and we've got this belief.\"\nNick's track references Scotland's historic successes and losses at major tournaments over the years.\nIn the chorus he chants: \"But we got John McGinn\r, and Robbo out on the wing\r,\" in reference to two of Scotland's star players.\nIt even acknowledges the nations pessimistic excitement after failing to pass the group stages three times.\n\"We never seem to do too well, I guess that time will tell. If we are finally, gonna make it, through the group stage.\"\nNick released his Scottish Euros anthem on 17 May and quickly found support - not just from the Tartan Army, but from South America.\n\"I got a message from an Instagram account and they basically just said we love your track - expect this to blow up in Argentina,\" he told BBC Scotland News.\n\"It said people were going to love this and then I just started getting sent newspaper articles from Argentina, friend requests.\"\nHis YouTube streams shot through the roof.\nWith 200,000 Tartan Army fans expected to arrive in Germany for the Euros, it has been adopted as the unofficial theme song among Scottish supporters.\nAnd it has also been embraced by fans of Argentina, the reigning world and South American champions. \nNick has been delivering acoustic renditions of the song at local primary schools as part of the build up to Euro 2024.\nAnd he has been trying to keep on top of his media fame in between.\nHe explained: \"I am a musician. I work from 09:30 to 15:30 but the last week or two has been crazy so I have been coming straight home, replying to emails, doing interviews.\n\"People are asking for voice messages for their uncle. It's wild.\n\"Fanzones are asking me to do messages, it's hard fitting it all in.\"\n\nPrevious Scotland football songs include Ally's Tartan Army for the 1978 World Cup campaign or We Have a Dream from the 1982 World Cup.\nNick said: \"If it was just this I would be happy.\n\"For an independent artist it's tough getting airplay. \n\"I'd like longevity with the song. I would love in a year or two's time whenever Scotland play the song, it becomes like 'We're on the March with Ally's Army'.\n\"It's tough writing a song for Scotland, it's not my usual genre, but it's a fine line between cheesy-cringey and a nice patriotic song, so you've just got to fit it right in the middle. I think I've managed it.\"\nSteve Clarke\u2019s side kick off Euro 2024 against hosts Germany in Munich at 20:00 on Friday.",
    "For Scotland fans it does not get much better than the possibility, however remote, of upstaging the hosts in the opening match of Euro 2024.\nYet for a small cohort Friday's game against Germany will not be a straightforward binary affair.\nLaw student Alexander Kersting will be something of a walking contradiction in Munich as he sports a kilt and a Germany strip.\nBorn in Munich to a Scottish mother, he has spent most of his life in Germany - apart from two months in Glasgow - lending his accent a distinctly Caledonian twang.\nSomeone who could never be accused of being a glory hunter, Alexander has cheered on Scotland throughout their \"euphoric\" Euros qualifying campaign. \nNow he cannot wait for the showpiece match in Munich.\n\"I\u2019ve never really seen Scotland play a game this big,\" he told BBC Scotland News.\n\"It\u2019s the opening game in Germany, in my home town. It\u2019s going to be pretty emotional.\"\nAlexander said he will have to wait until a ball is kicked to decide who he really wants to win. \nHe added: \"On the one hand, of course, it would be good for Germany to have the three points as they definitely have the better chance of winning the Euros.\n\"On the other hand, Scotland can be proud of what they have achieved and they deserve to win as well, so I can\u2019t make up my mind.\"\nAlexander predicts a 2-1 win for Germany, with John McGinn to score for Scotland.\nHe admitted: \"I do think that Germans think of themselves as superior, but I don't think they think it will be an easy game. So they definitely have respect.\"\nAnd what if Scotland did pull off an astonishing upset? \nAlexander said: \"I think we would think that it would be a disaster.\"\nWhile he conceded his friends would be \"sad and annoyed\" if Scotland won, to put it mildly, the law student said his peers \"like Scotland and its traditions\". \nHe expects a lot of attention when he gets the train from his home in Dusseldorf to Munich. \n\"Bavarians will also find it a bit strange seeing the normally very tidy and unchaotic Munich crowded with Scottish fans,\" Alexander added.\nThe dilemma facing Stuart Kenny, from Edinburgh, is how wildly to celebrate if Scotland do pull off a shock result. \nHe is married to Isabelle, a German who works as an NHS doctor.\nIsabelle unfortunately cannot make the trip, but Stuart is going to seven games at the Euros - including Friday\u2019s opener - with his in-laws.\nHe said: \"I can\u2019t remember being as excited for anything other than my own wedding, to be honest.\"\nThe Hearts fan is attending the game with his schwiegervater (father-in-law), Peter, who has been \"patiently listening to me regale tales of Lawrence Shankland's goals from the past season\". \nHe said anything could happen in the opener - except for him containing his excitement if Steve Clarke's men get a goal. \n\"I won\u2019t be able to prevent myself going wild if Scotland score - but I\u2019ll at least try to not cover Peter in beer.\"\nMax Mackle, 29, is from Stirling but grew up in a bilingual household thanks to his German mother. \nHaving spent many summers in Germany, the doctor described it as his \"second home\" and he is used to supporting the three-time Euro winners in the latter stages of major tournaments. \n\"I\u2019ll be cheering for Scotland in the opening match but Germany is quite a handy back-up team to have,\" Max told BBC Scotland News. \n\"It\u2019s a win-win for me but would be even better if Scotland can show their best.\"\nHe said the Tartan Army could not have wished for a better location for the match.\n\"I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be a brilliant opening game and I can\u2019t wait to soak up the atmosphere in Munich. It's a fantastic city.\"\nMax is predicting a \"tense affair\" but added: \"If we stay in the game anything is possible.\"",
    "The Southern Baptist Convention has approved a resolution opposing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) at its annual convention.\nThe resolution urged its congregants to only support reproductive technologies that affirm the \"unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage\", and criticized IVF.\nA separate proposed measure to only allow men to be pastors narrowly failed in a vote on Wednesday.\nThe Southern Baptist Convention is the largest Protestant denomination in the US. \nThe association includes 47,000 Baptist churches and has nearly 13 million members. They met for their convention in Indianapolis this year. \nThe IVF measure shows the success of a push from a faction of the church to support more conservative measures in the wake of the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v Wade, which had guaranteed women the right to an abortion nationally. \nThe resolution, which is nonbinding, described IVF as \"dehumanising\" and asked the government \"to restrain\" the practice.\nThe SBC describes resolutions as a chance for participants of the convention to \"express a consensus statement on timely public issues\", though they are not enforceable rules. \nThe vote comes on the heels of a February court decision in the state of Alabama that ruled that frozen embryos are considered children.\nAt the time, that led at least three IVF clinics to pause treatment and led to some political pushback for Republicans who supported the effort. \nState lawmakers later passed a bill to protect IVF clinics and doctors from lawsuits and criminal prosecution.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the SBC also voted 61.4% to 38.4% in favour of a ban on women pastors, but a two-thirds majority was required to amend the church's constitution.\nIn a written statement, Meredith Stone, the executive director of Baptist Women in Ministry, said she was \"grieved\" but \"grateful\" for the result of the women pastor vote.\n\"Even though the amendment did not pass, we are also grieved that this vote has ever even taken place,\" she said.\nThe amendment still received a majority vote, a fact that Ms Stone said \"demonstrates that women in ministry are still devalued\".\n\"Millions of women have heard as the incorrect message that they do not have equal value to God.\" \nProponents of the amendment say opposition to women pastors makes the church's  position more clear on liberal issues, such as LGBT rights.\nThe amendment also would have strengthened and hastened the ability to remove woman-led churches. \nHowever, opponents said the process for removal is already fairly efficient. \nOn Tuesday, a church in Virginia that has a female pastor for women and children was expelled after a majority of delegates voted for removal. \nFive other churches with female lead or senior pastors were removed last year.\n\u201cWe have shown that the mechanisms we currently have are sufficient to deal with this question,\u201d Spence Shelton, a North Carolina pastor, said from the floor, opposing the amendment.",
    "Survivors of one of the biggest race massacres in US history have lost their historic legal bid for reparations over the attack.\nThe Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed the suit, filed in 2020 by a trio of survivors, on Wednesday. \nAn estimated 300 black Americans were killed when a white mob razed the Greenwood neighbourhood of Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921.\nOnly two known survivors - Viola Fletcher, 110, and Lessie Benningfield Randle, 109 - remain. The third, Hughes Van Ellis, died last year at 102.\nThe plaintiffs had brought their case under Oklahoma's public nuisance law, arguing that the violence and destruction wrought on the \"Black Wall Street\" area more than a century ago continues to resonate today.\nThe Tulsa County sheriff, county commissioners and the Oklahoma Military Department were named as defendants in the suit. \nIn its Wednesday ruling, the state's top court sided with Tulsa officials in arguing that the plaintiffs' grievances did not entitle them to compensation.\n\u201cWith respect to their public nuisance claim, though Plaintiffs' grievances are legitimate, they do not fall within the scope of our State's public nuisance statute,\u201d the court wrote.\nIn doing so, the nine-judge bench affirmed a lower court judge's identical ruling last July.\nThe judge concluded that \u201csimply being connected to a historical event does not provide a person with unlimited rights to seek compensation\u201d.\nThe city of Tulsa said in a statement that it \u201crespects the court\u2019s decision and affirms the significance of the work the City continues to do in the North Tulsa and Greenwood communities\u201d.\nThe city added that it remains committed \u201cto working with residents and providing resources to support\u201d these communities.\nNo-one has ever been held responsible for the violent events of 31 May 1921.\nIn addition to the 300 estimated deaths, thousands of black residents were assaulted, arrested and left homeless.\nThis case is likely the final opportunity for Ms Fletcher and Ms Randle to receive compensation over the Tulsa Race Massacre.\n\u201cThere is no going to the United States Supreme Court. There is no going to the federal court system. This is it,\u201d their attorney, Damario Solomon-Simmons, previously argued in a legal brief.\nAfter Wednesday's ruling, the legal team representing Ms Fletcher and Ms Randle said they plan to file a petition for the Oklahoma Supreme Court to rehear the case and reconsider their decision.

    "Two accommodation options for this week\u2019s G7 summit in the southern Italian region of Puglia have been on show: one, a sumptuous resort of bougainvillea-clad villas and private pools, where Madonna and the Beckhams have holidayed, and where the singer Justin Timberlake and actress Jessica Biel got married. \nThe other, a giant ship moored off the coast of Brindisi, full of water leaks and broken air conditioning units spewing dirt onto bedsheets.\nThe first, the palatial Borgo Egnazia, is housing the leaders of the world\u2019s largest advanced economies, from Joe Biden to Emmanuel Macron, and Rishi Sunak to Justin Trudeau.\nThe second was brought in to accommodate the 2,600 police officers providing security. It was denounced by their unions as having \u201cinhuman\u201d conditions, resembling those of ancient slave ships. \nReported to have cost the Italian government \u20ac6m (\u00a35.07m), it\u2019s now been impounded, with a fraud investigation under way. \nTwo faces of Italy: the sublime and the shoddy.\nFor the Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, it\u2019s the gleaming first face that she\u2019ll play up this week, as she hosts world leaders, basking not only in the glorious Italian sun but also in her victory at the European elections last weekend. \nHer party - the far-right Brothers of Italy, to some extent softened under her leadership - stormed to a convincing win, making her the only Western European leader strengthened by the vote. \nAmong the other guests, France\u2019s President Macron was resoundingly defeated by the far-right National Rally, prompting him to call fresh parliamentary elections, while Germany\u2019s Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, handed his Social Democrats their worst-ever European election result, beaten into third place by the far-right AfD.\nAs for the other G7 leaders, Rishi Sunak languishes in the polls before the upcoming UK election, as does Justin Trudeau ahead of his electoral fight in Canada next year; and Joe Biden could be booted out of the White House in November by Donald Trump. \nLittle wonder that Ms Meloni boasted that Italy was going into this summit with \u201cthe strongest government of all\u201d.\nWho would have imagined that the country whose notorious political volatility has ushered in almost 70 governments since World War Two would now be seen as the stable one as the others lose their footing?\nThat shaky situation in many G7 countries is contributing to low expectations among some observers.\n\u201cThere are two levels to the G7: what\u2019s the big narrative and what are the concrete deliverables \u2013 and on both counts, it looks like a very unlucky summit,\" says Natalie Tocci, the director of the Italian Institute for International Affairs. \nIn comparison, she says, 2021 marked President Biden\u2019s first G7, in which he re-committed to the multilateral order after the turbulent years of Donald Trump; and the last two years have seen a clear sense of solidarity in the West after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\u201cBut now,\" Ms Tocci warns, \u201cif anything will come out of this summit, it\u2019s the fear of a catastrophe playing out before our eyes,\u201d with the urgency of reaching agreements before the possibility of new governments led by Donald Trump in the US and the far-right in France.\nAnd what of those summit aims? The most likely to be fulfilled is a plan to loan Ukraine $50bn (\u20ac46bn; \u00a339bn) from the interest on frozen Russian assets in the West. \nSome parties, like the US, had mooted seizing the Russian assets altogether, thought to be worth around $300bn. But that was strongly opposed by others such as Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, who argued it could set a dangerous precedent and potentially violate international law. \nThe new proposal, with the assets used as collateral for a loan, looks likely to be backed at this summit, giving cash-starved and war-weary Ukraine another vital lifeline.\nSeparate from these plans, Mr Sunak is set to announce up to \u00a3242m in support for Ukraine's energy and humanitarian needs.\nAhead of travelling to the summit, he said on Wednesday that allies must be \"decisive and creative in our efforts to support Ukraine and end [Russian President Vladimir] Putin\u2019s illegal war at this critical moment\".\nThere will also be sessions on the climate crisis, with participants under pressure to move faster on transitioning to renewable energy; on Africa, as Italy spearheads investment projects there in part to encourage young Africans to stay rather than migrate, often illegally, to Europe; on the Middle East, after the United Nations approved a US-backed plan for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas; and on artificial intelligence, which will be addressed by none other than Pope Francis. \nThe 87-year-old pontiff has called for global regulation of AI, warning of its danger to ethics and human rights. \nIt is the first time that a pope will attend a G7 \u2013 another boon for Giorgia Meloni.\nPartly to combat criticism that the G7 permanent members are an exclusive club, an array of other world leaders have been invi",
    "The SDLP has represented Foyle at Westminster in all but two years of its 41-year history as a parliamentary constituency. \nBut could that change in July?\nFoyle MP, and SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood will face off against Sinn F\u00e9in's Sandra Duffy for the seat.\nAnd while the likes of the DUP, UUP and Alliance are not eyeing up a win, they will be looking for encouraging signs of growing support in the north west. \nHere's a closer look at what could be one of the most intriguing constituencies in Northern Ireland's general election landscape. \nFoyle has been the spiritual home of the SDLP where the late party leader and Nobel Laureate John Hume strode the political canvas like a colossus. \nThe party held the seat for 34 years. \nBut that was rocked to its very foundations in 2017 when Sinn F\u00e9in's Elisha McCallion won it from Mark Durkan by 169 votes. \nColum Eastwood staged a stunning comeback in 2019 with the largest majority in the whole of Northern Ireland at 17,110. \nThat was an 18% swing in its direction. Mr Eastwood had previously faced criticism for leading the party from Westminister, but in 2019 he benefitted from a strong anti-Brexit vote and tactical voting by unionists to keep Sinn F\u00e9in out. \nIt\u2019s now perhaps key to his leadership position and party morale that he wins comfortably in Foyle.\nColum Eastwood is in buoyant form, but he\u2019s not predicting such a huge majority this time around as he battles it out with Sinn F\u00e9in once again. \nHe says he\u2019s not taking anything for granted and that last time out it was a very unique election.\nBut he feels strongly that people in Derry and the north west want to send someone to Westminster, so their voice will be heard.\nThat is in contrast to Sinn F\u00e9in, whose MPs do not take their seats in the House of Commons due to the party's policy of abstentionism.  \nTheir new face in this election is former mayor Sandra Duffy, who enjoyed a highly successful year as first citizen from June 2022. \nShe championed a number of issues during her time as mayor of Derry City and Strabane, including greater investment for jobs and opportunities for the north west, homelessness and the expansion of the Magee campus of Ulster University. \nShe believes Sinn F\u00e9in has a powerful mandate for change given its electoral strength and that every vote matters in what could be a tight race.\nYes and no. Foyle is now losing the villages of Eglinton and Claudy, as well as Ardmore on the outskirts of Derry.\nIt probably won\u2019t affect the overall result, but it could have an impact on parties like Alliance who are trying to rebuild their profile in the second city. \nThey lost their two sitting councillors last year in the local government elections \u2013 it had been the first time they'd had political representation on the Derry council since the 1980s.\nRachael Ferguson was one of those councillors who lost out and she\u2019s now running for the party in this Westminster election. \nShe believes the boundary changes could affect her vote but benefit the party in the neighbouring East Londonderry constituency. \nFor her, its all about developing the Alliance base and creating a stronger presence in the north west. She says the party will be back.\nThis will be a battle royale between the sitting MP Mr Eastwood and Ms Duffy. \nCritics question the SDLP leader's delivery for Derry, but Mr Eastwood has strongly defended his record claiming he\u2019s helped promote massive road and rail improvements and the growth of the Magee campus, as well as funding which has improved the daily lives of many people in the constituency.\nMs Duffy says the overall strength of Sinn F\u00e9in means it can truly deliver change. \nShe points to the commitment of Economy Minister Conor Murphy to meet a target of 10,000 students at Magee, after he set up a taskforce earlier this year, as just one example.\nWithin unionism, the DUP\u2019s Gary Middleton is under huge pressure \u2013 but it\u2019s not on the campaign trail. \nHe and his wife Julie, a DUP councillor on Derry City and Strabane, are expecting their second child and there\u2019s great excitement in the Middleton household \u2013 not least for the couple\u2019s six-year-old son. \nMr Middleton, who acknowledges it would be quite the story if his wife gives birth in the next few weeks, says while he's not going to win the Foyle seat it's important for unionists to come out and vote for a candidate like him. \nHe believes unionist voices are very important in this election and he\u2019s standing on his record as an elected representative over the last 14 years.\nThe Ulster Unionists meanwhile have sitting councillor Janice Montgomery standing in Foyle for the first time. \nThe childminder says she is hearing on the doorsteps huge concerns about access to childcare and cost-of-living pressures, as people struggle to meet their everyday needs. \nShe\u2019s determined that their voices are heard in the corridors of power.\nFor People Before Profit candidate Shaun Harkin, it's an important election. \nHe says it\u2019s an opportunity for people to reg",
    "A university talk on freedom of speech was disrupted by Gaza war protesters.\nMasked protesters interrupted the talk last week at Northumbria University's inaugural Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) conference by chanting and holding baby clothes covered in fake blood.\nA member of staff, who did not wish to be named, said they felt \"personally unsafe\" during the protest.\nNorthumbria University said safety of staff was its \"highest priority\" and action that disrupted the running of the university would not be \"tolerated\".\nThe protests took place on Wednesday during a talk titled \"How freedom of speech and academic freedom influence equality diversity and inclusion\". \nThe protesters entered the room as university deputy vice chancellor Tom Lawson was about to speak, according to a witness.\nVideo footage filmed by an audience member shows the protesters standing at the front of the lecture hall while chanting: \"Your hands are washed with Palestinian blood.\"\nThe protest was carried out by members of the Newcastle Apartheid Off Campus group, which has encamped outside Newcastle University.\nA spokesperson for the demonstrators said: \"As a collective we decided to target and disrupt this event on the basis that these claimed \u2018EDI\u2019 values are incompatible with the university\u2019s relationship with Lockheed Martin - the world's largest weapons manufacturer.\"\nSecurity staff and officers from Northumbria Police attended the scene. The force said no arrests were made during the protest.\nThe witness said there were about 10 protesters present at the event.\n\"They were standing at the doors,\" they said.\n\"They weren't blocking the door but it was unpleasant.\"\nThe talk was halted during the protest and continued in another lecture hall in the university's business school.\nAndy Long, the Northumbria University chief executive, sent an email to attendees the day after the talk offering \"additional support\" to staff members affected by the protest.\nThe email read: \"I know that colleagues may have felt shaken by the events. The aim of the conference was to create a genuinely inclusive space in which colleagues felt free to express themselves and their identities. \n\"That safety was disrupted and disturbed by the protestors and their conduct was the very opposite of the inclusivity which we are striving for.\"\nA Northumbria University spokesperson said: \"We understand the concerns raised on this occasion and have sought to reassure colleagues that their safety and wellbeing is our highest priority. \n\"In this instance our security team were able to resolve the situation swiftly and peacefully. \n\"We will seek to avoid the possibility of similar interruptions to other events of importance to our community - any action that seeks to disrupt the smooth running of the university cannot be tolerated.\"\nThe spokesperson said the university has a legal obligation to promote freedom of speech and supports its members' right to protest.\n\"However, we have guidelines about how to facilitate peaceful protest on our campus and remain clear that no members of our community should be engaged in conduct that seeks to stifle or shut down debate or seeks to intimidate,\" they added.\nFollow BBC Newcastle on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A Georgia man hijacked a commuter bus, held the driver and 17 riders at gunpoint, and led a trail of police cars on a miles-long chase through Atlanta traffic on Tuesday.\nThe suspect, 39-year-old Joseph Grier, was arrested after a Georgia State Patrol officer shot the bus's engine compartment, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said. Police also threw spike strips on the roadway to impede the bus.\nAuthorities said the hijacking occurred after Grier - a convicted felon whose criminal record includes 19 arrests - argued with another bus passenger, who pulled a gun on him. \nGrier then wrestled the firearm away from the man, shot him and ordered the bus driver to flee, according to state investigators. \nThe wounded bus passenger died later at hospital.\nThe suspect is accused of putting \u201ca gun to the head of a bus driver saying, \u2018Don\u2019t stop this bus or else worse will happen\u2019\u201d, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens told reporters.\nAs the bus zig-zagged through streets and rammed into other cars, anxious passengers called and sent text messages to loved ones and authorities pleading for help.\nGrier faces one count of murder, 14 counts of kidnapping, 13 counts of aggravated assault and one count of hijacking a motor vehicle in the first degree. He is also charged with one count each of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and of possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of or attempt to commit certain felonies.\nJohnny Gilbert said his wife called him from the bus and told him Grier had been acting \"kinda crazy\".\nFearing she may be shot, he instructed her to put the phone down and \"just sit still\", Mr Gilbert told CNN.\nPolice said a passenger on the bus made an emergency call and stayed on the line with them, which helped lead to the suspect's arrest. \nDennis Durham, an eyewitness, told news station WSB-TV that the bus's path was chaotic. The bus \"just knocked through a lot of these cars and made them hit each other.  \n\u201cI saw so many police cars in so many different areas my head was swimming.\"\nPolice used several tactics to disable the bus, including positioning an armoured vehicle next to it to limit the bus's ability to maneuver, police said.\nEventually, the bus came to a halt in Atlanta suburb Stone Mountain.\nPassengers climbed out of the bus and Mr Grier was arrested. \nPolice said a joint investigation will be conducted by the Atlanta Police Department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.\nThe hijacking incident was the second violent shooting in Atlanta on Tuesday.\nHours earlier, a man shot and wounded three people in a popular food court.\nGrier, who was outside the food court at the time, was interviewed about the shooting by reporters, mentioning his criminal history and mental health, the Associated Press reported. \nHe appeared agitated and described himself as a \"snitch\" for explaining what he witnessed. \n\u201cI\u2019m bipolar, I\u2019m gonna tell you all that, and I\u2019m off my medication for like two weeks,\u201d he said, according to the news agency.

    "The founder of Bristol's only toy library has said they want to help recycle and re-use toys in the community and alleviate costs for families. \nStarted in 2015 by Annie Berry, South Bristol's toy library aims to reduce waste and allow more children access to more - and sometimes expensive - toys.\nThe library moved to Bedminster in March this year and currently has more than 1,400 toys available.\nMs Berry said: \"It can be really hard being a parent, so having a place that's effectively a giant toy shop in your community can be simple but life changing at times\".\nThe library was set up by Ms Berry after she returned from living in New Zealand, where toy libraries are common.\nShe received funding from Bristol European Green Capital 2015, to buy micro scooters, which parents could rent out and return ready for the next person.\n\"The scooters were quite expensive to buy, so it was a handy way for parents to see if their children got on with them,\" she said.\nWorking from her house, they soon raised enough money from the scheme to hire a venue on West Street, Bristol for a bigger library. \nMs Berry partnered with the St Philips recycling centre on a pilot project to rescue items back from landfill, bringing more toys into the library.\n\"It showed us that there's a massive amount of resources going into landfill,\" Ms Berry said. \n\"Some of those toys are still in circulation at the library now.\"\nSince then the library's main cause has been to inspire parents and carers to reuse and recycle toys.\nThe library currently has 688 children using the toys, with 140 active members and 260 loans since January this year.\nOn average the team said it will see 50 parents and children attending each session.\nStacy Yelland, who oversees the library after Ms Berry stepped back in 2019, said people use it to support the environment, take out toys that they might not have the space for at home or be able to afford, and allow children to pick non-gender specific toys.\nLibrary volunteer Ava Lorenc, a member of climate group 'Mum's rebellion', added: \"It amazes me that more people don't use libraries in general - they're free.\n\"And we need to stop buying plastic toys.\"\nThe toy library is open every other Saturday from 10:00 until 12:00 at St Michael\u2019s and All Angels Church.\nMembership per family is \u00a315 for the year, with the library offering reduced prices if required.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Competitors in a triathlon have told the BBC they have suffered from vomiting and diarrhoea after swimming in the River Thames.\nRebecca Norman, from Reading, said she had to go to A&E after feeling sick 24 hours after the Royal Windsor Triathlon on Sunday.\nThe 21-year-old shared her experience on social media and had seen several other people also report being seriously ill since the race.\nOrganisers Human Race said it conducted water tests in the weeks leading up to the event and on the day which \"met the standards set by the British Triathlon Federation (BTF)\".\nIt added the \"handful of reports of illness we have received are consistent with previous\" runnings of the event.\nThames Water said people would be \"misinformed to automatically conclude\" the issues were caused by its activities and said its nearest sewage treatment works in Slough had not discharged since early April.\nMiss Norman told BBC News: \"I was throwing up blood, feeling faint, had a fever, exhaustion and the worst stomach cramps I have ever experienced.\"\n\"I specifically emailed the race organisers before the event about my concerns of the water and they promised to sample the water a week before,\" she said.\nMiss Norman shared the message from Human Race with the BBC which said: \"Absolutely no risks are taken regarding the conditions and your safety.\n\"We usually send several samples of water from the Royal Windsor Triathlon swim section for tests in a lab the week leading up to the event.\"\nHuman Race said it would cancel the swim if there were concerns.\nDan Rosam, 35, a civil engineer from Surbiton, said 40 hours after he took part in the event - his first triathlon - he started to feel unwell.\nHe noticed on social media other competitors were also feeling sick and he claimed it was \"too much of a coincidence\".\nMr Rosam admitted he was \"apprehensive about swimming in the water beforehand\".\n\"I had faith in the organisers who said they had tested the water and would cancel it if it was unsafe,\" he said.\n\"I feel a bit let down by them and it's put me off doing it again.\"\nLast month, The Boulter's to Bray Swim in Maidenhead was cancelled because of fears about sewage in the River Thames.\nMr Rosam, who has been off work ill, blamed pollution in the water, adding: \"It's disgusting that the water companies are taking money and passing it on to their shareholders but they're not putting any of it into fixing the infrastructure.\"\nConnie Wright, 32, from south-west London, said she woke up on Tuesday morning with a \"severe stomach bug\".\n\"Given the number of people affected, it seems likely the water may have been compromised,\" she said.\nA spokesperson from Human Race said: \"As part of our procedures, we conduct water quality tests in the weeks leading up to the Royal Windsor Triathlon.

    "Israel and Hamas have been accused of committing a litany of war crimes and human rights abuses since 7 October in a new independent report to the UN Human Rights Council. \nThe damning accusations, compiled by investigators from the UN's Commission of Inquiry, accused both sides of war crimes for mounting attacks against civilian populations and \"murder or wilful killings\". \nThe report, which covers the period up to the end of 2023, specifically accused Israel of crimes against humanity for torture, \"extermination\" and \"gender persecution targeting Palestinian men and boys\".\nIsrael rejected the report's findings and accused the commission of pursuing \"a narrow-led political agenda\" against it.\nInvestigators compiled the report, which will be submitted to the UN's human rights council next week, through hours of interviews with victims and witnesses, medical reports and open source information. \nThe panel, led by former UN human rights chief Navi Pillay, said Israel's use of heavy weapons in populated areas constituted a war crime as it was a direct attack on civilian populations which intended to cause \"maximum damage, disregarding the principles of distinction, proportionality and adequate precautions\". \nIsrael was also accused of several other war crimes, including starvation, arbitrary detention, and the killing and maiming of \u201ctens of thousands of children\u201d. The report also said Israel had weaponised a \"total siege\" which limited power, food and water to civilians, which it said amounted to \"collective punishment\". \nOther crimes against humanity committed by Israel, the authors said, included the \"extermination, murder, gender persecution targeting Palestinian men and boys, forcible transfer of the population, torture, and inhuman and cruel treatment\".\nHamas was also accused of a host of abuses during its 7 October attacks, which saw 1,200 people killed and 251 more kidnapped. The report said there was evidence of widespread sexual violence committed against Israeli women and a pattern of mass killings in public shelters.\n\u201cMany abductions were carried out with significant physical, mental and sexual violence and degrading and humiliating treatment, including in some cases parading the abductees,\u201d the report said. \u201cWomen and women\u2019s bodies were used as victory trophies by male perpetrators.\u201d\nIsraeli forces were also accused of sexual violence for public stripping of Palestinians, which the investigators said was intended \"to humiliate the community at large and accentuate the subordination of an occupied people\". \nIsrael - which refused to co-operate with the investigation - was quick to reject the report, accusing it of \u201csystematic anti-Israeli discrimination\". \nMeirav Eilon Shahar, its ambassador to the UN in Geneva, accused the commission of seeking to draw a false equivalence between Hamas and the Israeli military in relation to sexual violence.\nHamas has yet to comment on the allegations. \nThe report itself does not carry any penalties, but it could be used in a potential future prosecution of Israeli and Hamas leaders. \nMichael Becker, a professor of international human rights law at Trinity College Dublin, told the BBC that the International Criminal Court (ICC) - which has issued warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders - would likely rely on the report to find new lines of inquiry it can pursue in its investigation, but that it was unlikely to serve as \"direct evidence\" in the case. \nHe added that there was \"no question\" that South Africa would direct the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to the report as part of its separate case which accuses Israel of genocide in Gaza.\nHe noted that the ICJ \"often refers to these kind of reports in its decision,\" but warned that South Africa would have to convince judges that the report is \"methodologically sound\". \nSpeaking after the publication of the report, Ms Pillay said it was \"imperative\" that anyone accused of committing crimes in the conflict \"be held accountable\". \n\u201cThe only way to stop the recurring cycles of violence, including aggression and retribution by both sides, is to ensure strict adherence to international law,\" she added. \nHamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri and Ismail Haniyeh are already subject to an arrest warrant issued by the ICC for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nIsraeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant are also subject to similar warrants. Wednesday's report specifically attacked the rhetoric used by some unnamed Israeli officials, which it said could amount to \"incitement\" and may constitute \"other serious international crimes\". \nMore than 37,120 people have been killed in Gaza since the conflict began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. \nMeanwhile, the UN is set to add Israel's military, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad's armed wing to its list of offenders for violating children\u2019s rights for the first time.\nThe annual report - seen by the BBC",
    "Artist Anya Gallaccio has been chosen to design London's first permanent Aids memorial - just metres from the site of the UK's first specialist HIV ward, opened by Diana, Princess of Wales.\nThe princess was credited with a shift in public attitudes towards the disease after she helped dispel the myth it could be transmitted by touch, by shaking hands with patients on the former Middlesex Hospital ward in Fitzrovia.\nThe Aids Memory UK project aims to raise awareness of the impact of the virus on four key groups of people, including gay and bisexual men and those affected by the infected blood scandal.\nAnd campaigners say Wednesday's announcement represents a \"major milestone\" in battling the stigma that still surrounds HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and Aids (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).\nA panel of representatives from the groups affected chose Gallaccio's design from a short list featuring five London artists.\nAnd she said it was important her design \"reflected all experiences of HIV and Aids\".\n\"There was and is no singular experience of HIV and Aids,\" Gallaccio told BBC News.\n\"So for me, it was about slightly redrawing that narrative to be more inclusive of those individuals and communities that may have been overlooked - 52% of people worldwide are women and girls of reproductive age and I think that's something we don't think about enough.\"\nGallaccio's design features the rings of a tree trunk placed upright, with its  remaining hollow space laid out into a seating area, which she hopes will \"invite visitors to interact and engage with the memorial\".\nHer art rose to prominence in the 1980s, when she participated in Damien Hirst's Freeze exhibition, along with others who became known as the Young British Artists.\nAnd in 2003, she was short-listed for the Turner Prize.\nOne of the UK's longest-surviving HIV patients, Jonathan Blake, said the central London site chosen for the memorial was of great significance to those stigmatised for having the disease.\n\"What Diana did - that was a complete game-changer,\" he told BBC News.\n\"She undoubtedly changed peoples perceptions of HIV/Aids - and it was a real turning point.\n\"Bit by bit, people started to feel OK to talk about it - and I hope that the memorial continues that, because it really is so important.\n\"The Middlesex Hospital was my comfort blanket when I was first diagnosed - and it's touching to know that the memorial will be nearby.\"\nThe campaign to build the memorial began in 2016.\nAids Memory UK founder Ash Kotak told BBC News it was an important part of ensuring the virus's impact was not forgotten.\n\"We have to show that this was something that changed us forever - it informed us,\" he said.\n\"Ultimately, what the Aids Memorial is doing is trying to find meaning for the last 45 years of Aids, because people aren't really talking about that- and that's something we can encourage people to do with this memorial.\"\nAids Memory UK will now put on a series of events to help further develop the design and fundraise for its creation.\nThe unveiling of the final memorial is planned for 2027.",
    "A new rail link connecting communities such as Fraserburgh and Peterhead with Aberdeen could bring major economic and safety benefits, a study has found.\nThe Buchan area of Aberdeenshire has not had a train service for more than 50 years.\nBut new research concluded a rail connection could boost job opportunities in the area, assist access to healthcare and reduce serious road accidents.\nIt was commissioned by the Campaign for North East Rail (CNER) and Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce (AGCC).\nThe Buchan Sustainable Transport Study, which was commissioned last year, used data analysis and surveys with hundreds of residents.\nIt was funded through the Scottish government's Just Transition Fund.\nThe option of a passenger and freight rail line between Aberdeen city centre and Fraserburgh via Peterhead could also stop at Dyce, Newmachar, Ellon, Cruden Bay and St Fergus.\nThe cost of such a project has still to be fully determined.\nThe report found that opening the new link could reduce 75% of fatal or serious accidents on the A90/A952 by 75% by 2037-2041, compared to during the period 2014-2019.\nIt said rail could connect workers to renewable energy opportunities centred around ports and harbours across the region.\nAnd Buchan\u2019s existing long-term industries such as food, drink and tourism could also benefit.\nFishing and seafood processing are key sectors in Fraserburgh and Peterhead.\nJordan Jack, general secretary of CNER, said extending the East Coast Line northwards would be \"transformative\" for the north east of Scotland.\n\"Fraserburgh and Peterhead are among the most deprived settlements in Aberdeenshire, and reconnection to the rail network will drastically improve people's economic fortunes, health outcomes, education and social inclusion,\" he said.\n\"Poor transport links are stifling our potential, damaging access to healthcare, and limiting job opportunities in the region.\"\nRussell Borthwick, the AGCC chief executive of the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said the \"scale of what\u2019s possible\" was shown by the study.\n\"This link could reverse economic inequality and deliver a boost to Buchan, turbocharging its net zero, food and drink and tourism offerings,\" he added.\n\"In addition, it could drastically reduce emissions from passenger and freight transport.\"\nThe Scottish government said: \"We look forward to hearing how businesses and the local community engage with the findings of the report and any further research the Campaign for North East Rail may produce with the support of local stakeholders.\"",

    "Time is \"running out\" to save Lough Neagh, the Minister for Agriculture Andrew Muir has said. \nIt is understood that significant investment is needed to tackle the environmental issues facing the lough. \nA new report was commissioned after blue-green algae bloomed at unprecedented levels last year.\nThe report, outlining more than 30 recommendations, was due to be agreed on Thursday, but an agreement was not reached. \nIt's understood the Mr Muir will bring the Lough Neagh report back before the Executive on 27 June.\nPollution in the lough and catchment area is the main cause of the blue-green algae, which is extremely toxic to animals and can cause illness in humans.\nSome of the suggested actions are already planned, including the Farming with Nature scheme and several training programmes for farmers.\nBut money will need to be found for others, such as an initiative to research potential solutions, additional water quality Inspectors and a centralised resource for science around Lough Neagh.\nMost of the report's proposals are thought to fall to DAERA.\nA smaller number, mostly concerning enforcement and regulation, are expected to involve the infrastructure and justice departments.\nMr Muir told the assembly in April that Lough Neagh is a \"priority\" and called on assembly members to \"get real\" about the problems.\nHe is expected to reverse an instruction from his predecessor Edwin Poots, which placed a cap on fines for repeated negligent failures to comply with environmental, health and animal welfare rules.\nOwnership of Lough Neagh is not believed to form part of the report.\nMany of its elements are also part of the overdue legally-required Environmental Improvement Plan, which has been awaiting executive approval since March.\nLough Neagh is the largest body of fresh water in the British Isles.\nThe ownership has been in the Earl of Shaftesbury's estate since the 1800s.\nThe rights to the lough were given a price tag of \u00a36m 10 years ago, but civil servants at the time advised the government not to go ahead with the sale.

    "An exhibition in Guernsey celebrating 19th Century French artist Renoir welcomed 15,775 visitors, its organisers have said. \nDavid Ummels, founder of project organiser Art for Guernsey, said at a Chamber of Commerce presentation that the project enriched the cultural life of the island and provided a \"quality experience\" for tourists.\nOf those visiting, 30.49% came from overseas and a third of those visitors made the trip specifically to see it, he added.\nThat group alone brought more than \u00a32.8m to the local economy, Mr Ummels said.\nPierre-Auguste Renoir visited the island in 1883 and was known for his impressionist work.\nThe exhibition ran from September to December 2023 in Art for Guernsey's centre in Mill Street.\nThe project also involved running workshops with Year 3 pupils from local primary schools, with the aim of encouraging them to think outside the box.\nMr Ummels said: \"For us, it matters a lot that through art, we create curriculum value. \n\"Art can play a key role to develop critical thinking and stimulate their level of tolerance.\"\nData collected after the close of the exhibition showed that visitors came from the Channel Islands, the USA, the UK and six other European countries.\nThose who visited with the sole purpose of seeing the exhibition stayed on-island for an average of five-and-a-half nights.\nThat group spent an estimated \u00a32.8m overall on travel costs, hospitality and other entertainment.\nMr Ummels said the key to the success of the project lay in Art for Guernsey's ethos - the organisation defines itself \"not as an art organisation, but as a charity that applies art for the greater good of the community\". \nHe also thanked their partners for the generous support and said this project \"makes a case for cultural tourism and proves that it does work\".\n\"I think the key lessons are: one, it's doable, two, you have to do it by certain standards if you want to convince an economically-affluent audience abroad to travel to visit your event,\" said Mr Ummels.\n\"I think credibility has been created, at least for us in the visual arts space.\"\nArt for Guernsey said it plans to run a similar project celebrating J.M.W.

    "The next prime minister of the United Kingdom will be Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of Plaid Cymru has said.\nIn a Panorama interview with Nick Robinson, Rhun ap Iorwerth predicted that Labour will win the election regardless of how Wales votes.\nHe asked Welsh voters to back the pro-independence party to prevent Labour from having a \"huge majority\" that would allow them to act with \"impunity\".\nIt comes after Conservative Grant Shapps warned Labour could win a \"supermajority\".\nMr ap Iorwerth also claimed that \u201ctax is a good thing\u201d when asked how Plaid Cymru would handle the economy.\nLive: Follow the latest news about the UK general election\nPoll tracker: How do parties compare?\nVoting: Who can I vote for in the general election?\nGeneral election 2024: All Welsh politics stories\nPlaid Cymru had won four MPs at the last election. Following the boundary re-organisation to 32 seats it could be difficult for the party to repeat that performance. \nMr ap Iorwerth has previously said the election will be difficult for the party. The former BBC Wales political journalist has been in charge of Plaid Cymru since last year.\nIn the interview, Mr ap Iorwerth said he would like Wales to be able to set \"visa numbers to get more people into work\" in health and social care.\nThe party leader said people's anxieties on migration were being exploited, and said they should not be blamed for cuts to public services.\n\"Keir Starmer is going to be prime minister in four weeks time,\" Mr ap Iorwerth said.\n\"I think the evidence points in that direction.\n\"He will become prime minister regardless of how Wales votes. That's a key factor for people to consider in Wales.\"\n\"Would you like a huge Labour majority, that allows them to act with impunity and allows them to continue what they are doing now which is ignore Wales completely?\"\nHe accused some senior Welsh Labour Westminister figures \"who act as if they have forgotten they are representing Wales\".\nMr ap Iorwerth criticised the shadow Welsh secretary Jo Stevens, who said that Labour could not commit to a share of funding from the HS2 rail project.\nThe scheme is designated as being England and Wales, despite not reaching Wales, meaning Wales does not get extra money as a result from the project.\nThe Plaid Cymru leader said the party had a \"number of proposals for bringing in more tax\" and called for an \"honest debate\" on the issue.\n\"I want us to recognise first of all that tax is a good thing,\" Mr ap Iorwerth told the programme.\nHe said the UK needs \"taxes to be brought in\" to \"pay for public services\".\nThe Member of the Senedd for Ynys M\u00f4n said his party's ideas included \"making sure that those oil and gas companies pay more of a windfall tax\", and that \"those who have huge amounts of wealth are targeted through a wealth tax\".\nBut he said he would not \"add to the burden\" on low and medium income earners.\nIn March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt extended a 35% tax on those companies \u2013 the Energy Profit Levy \u2013 until 2029. \nIt was introduced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor after Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused demand and prices to rise.\nPlaid Cymru wants Wales to be an independent state, but has abandoned a previous pledge for a referendum on independence by 2026.\nMr ap Iorwerth said his job was to \"get people interested, intrigued\" about what independence could mean.\n\"If we are to remove those shackles of child poverty, the economic stagnation that we've suffered in Wales, we have to take the levers of change into our own hands,\" he said. \nBut he said the country was \"not at that point quite yet\". \n\"We're within a UK system, we make a case for fair funding for Wales so we can make the right decisions on public servicers and growing the economy and so on that can lead us on a positive trajectory,\" the Plaid leader added.\nBut he said Wales \"cannot fulfil our potential as a country\" until it is independent.\nAsked if there should be a trading border with England, he said: \"Do I want that kind of barrier? Absolutely not.\"\nPlaid Cymru was in a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government until last month. \nIt had been working with ministers on a group of policies, including expanding free school meals and childcare.\nMr ap Iorwerth had ended the deal early in part because of the row over the first minister's leadership campaign donations.\nHe said when Vaughan Gething became first minister, he \"showed a change of direction, change in attitude towards the kind of radical things that we were trying to bring in through that co-operation agreement\".\nMr ap Iorwerth added: \"When there was a scandal on top of that [there were] too many distractions, it was time to go our separate ways.\"\nHe said the \"right thing to do would be for the first minister to stand down\".\nThe leader rejected suggestions that Plaid Cymru is a party for Welsh speakers.\n\"We're about all of Wales. We speak people's language on health, education and the economy, and that's the key thing,\" he said. \nThe BBC is interviewing al",

    "Parliamentary candidates in the Boston and Skegness constituency have clashed over immigration in a radio debate. \nOn Wednesday, Liberal Democrat Richard Lloyd, Reform UK's Richard Tice and Conservative Matt Warman appeared on BBC Radio Lincolnshire, live from Skegness.\nThe candidates debated issues including immigration, out-of-work benefits and the NHS, fielding questions from listeners.\nDiscussing benefits, Mr Tice accused the Conservative government of \"abandoning young people just to bring in cheap foreign labour\". Mr Warman replied it was \"delusional\" to think people on benefits would \"immediately\" work in agriculture or social care.\n\"There has to be a sensible transition process,\" Mr Warman added.\nWhen asked by a listener how they would reduce migration, Mr Lloyd said the Liberal Democrats favoured a \"skills-based entry\" to ensure people were employed in sectors where there was the most need. \nMr Tice said that there was a need to \"freeze migration\", as \"cheap, low-skilled labour is bad for the economy\".\nMr Warman said the Conservatives had introduced tougher legislation to tackle illegal migration, but that they would need to \"get a grip\" on legal migration and set a cap on it.\nThe BBC has contacted Alex Fawbert, the Labour candidate for Boston and Skegness, for comment. \nThe full debate is available on BBC Sounds here. \nFull list of candidates for the Boston & Skegness constituency:\nDavid Dickason - English Democrats\nAlex Fawbert - Labour Party\nMike Gilbert - Blue Revolution\nRichard Gordon Lloyd - Liberal Democrats\nChris Moore - Green Party\nRichard Tice - Reform UK\nMatt Warman - Conservative \nYou can use the BBC News lookup tool to find out which constituency you are in, who is standing as a candidate in your area and which polling station you can vote at.\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), external, and Instagram.

    "The UN has said the Houthi movement in Yemen has detained two more of its employees, bringing the total number of personnel seized by the group in the past week to 13. \nThe employees were taken in various parts of the conflict-torn country, in what appears to be a co-ordinated crackdown.\nUN spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said last week the world body was pursuing all available channels to secure their safe and unconditional release as rapidly as possible.\nThe armed group sees itself as part of an Iranian-led \"axis of resistance\" against Israel, the US and the wider West, and has declared its support for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Houthis have been targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, triggering retaliatory air strikes by the US and its allies.\nLast week, the UN said the Houthis detained 11 of its personnel.

    "\nGeneral election candidates in the Mid Bedfordshire constituency have gone up against one another in a live debate hosted by BBC Three Counties Radio.\nHere are  some of the key takeaways from the conversation, which you can watch here. \nConservative Blake Stephenson hoped that one day patients would be able to book a GP appointment anywhere in the country and not just at their registered surgery. \nThe Green Party candidate Cade Sibley highlighted the 12,000 vacant roles in the NHS, and said that in his day job as a carer he saw the \"effects of 14 years of austerity on clients he supports\".\nIndependent Gareth Mackey described \"health as wealth\", and that tuition fees for student nurses and doctors should be \"waived\". \nLabour's Maahwish Mirza said her party would attempt to clear the NHS \"backlog and waiting lists\" by putting \u00a31.5bn back into the service. \nLiberal Democrat Stuart Roberts said his party would \"invest heavily in the NHS and social care\". \nDave Holland from Reform UK suggested introducing a voucher system for patients, so that if they did not see a GP in 48 hours, they would qualify for a private appointment. \nThe issue of immigration prompted some of the most fierce debate among the candidates.\nConservative Mr Stephenson insisted he wanted \"overall migration to come down\" but that the NHS needed staff from abroad. \nMr Sibley from the Greens said \"the NHS was propped up by foreign workers\" and that his party would build \"many council houses a year\" to enable migrants to have a roof over their heads.\nIndependent Mr Mackey went further, saying that \"dehumanising debates on immigration took him back to the 1930s\".\nLabour's Ms Mirza wanted a \"sensible approach\" to the issue and promised the party would introduce 1,000 trained professionals to tackle gangs bringing people over the border. \nLib Dem Mr Roberts agreed with Labour's stance on dealing with gangs and told the debate he got involved in politics partly because of the \"hostile language towards migrants\".\nReform UK's Mr Holland claimed the NHS was looking for doctors and nurses from the \"developing world\", rather than training doctors and nurses to \"meet our needs\".\nWhen pressed by Jonathan Vernon-Smith, who was hosting the debate, on whether short-term rises in immigration would be acceptable if it brought more doctors to the UK, Mr Holland told the debate \"that was happening anyway\". \nAll six candidates were keen to stress the ways in which their party would put more money in the pockets of their constituents.\nConservative Mr Stephenson pointed to tax cuts in his party's manifesto as a way forward and blamed \"macroeconomic crisis like Covid\" for the fact that the state was too big. \nGreen candidate Mr Sibley said Labour's energy plans \"didn't go far enough\" as it would only be focusing on an \"electricity generation\". \nIndependent Mr Mackey was \"supportive of nationalised energy solutions\" but said \"runaway privatisation has increased costs dramatically for the everyday working person\".\nLabour's candidate Ms Mirza said her party's promise of a state-owned renewable energy company, which would not rely on fossil fuels, would see bills fall by \"\u00a3300 per household\" over the course of the next Parliament. \nThe Lib Dem candidate Mr Roberts revealed he had been working on a food strategy for his party, so the most vulnerable \"wouldn't have to choose between energy and food\". \nReform's Mr Holland claimed \"as a country we weren't cost efficient\" and were being \"forced to ship gas and coal from overseas\". \nEveryone agreed something needed to change in education policy.\nConservative Mr Stephenson insisted teachers were \"at the centre of everything we do\" and wanted the paperwork they do to be \"stripped away so they can do what they love\". \nGreen Mr Sibley said \"substantial funding\" was needed to avoid \"parents having to save for years to get children into private schools\". \nIndependent Mr Mackey was keen to reduce workload so that teachers could \"enjoy family life again, and not be marking books at 10pm\". \nLabour's Ms Mirza agreed teachers were \"overstretched\" with the party having a plan to recruit 6,000 more into the profession.\nLiberal Democrat Mr Roberts felt that as a country we \"needed to value teachers\", and he promised party investment of \u00a35bn to \"pay teachers more and improve crumbling schools in Mid Beds\". \nMr Holland for Reform UK wanted \"radical reform\" of education so that state schools were on a par with private.\nRichard Brunning, the parliamentary candidate for the Social Democratic Party, was not part of the debate.\nHe told the BBC he was standing for MP \"because of complete disillusionment in the state of politics and politicians in the UK, along with a desire to bring common sense and decency back into the House of Commons\".\nHe said: \"Immigration numbers were having a colossal knock-on effect on our public services, never mind the cost of housing.\n\"Affordable housing and an increase in social provision is a cornerstone of the Social ",

    "Guildford and Reigate, 1906. Spelthorne, 1945. Guildford, 2001. What do those dates have in common?\nWell, they are among the only times that a party other than the Conservatives has won seats in Surrey at a general election. (I\u2019m cheating a bit; Spelthorne\u2019s boundaries were very different and it was considered to be a Middlesex seat until the 1970s.)\nMy point is: this area has historically been a Tory stronghold. \nBut is there a chance that things could be different this time?\nI think if you were to ask people for a part of the country they most associated with the Conservatives, they might well say Surrey. \nThere have been senior cabinet ministers by the bucket load; Geoffrey Howe, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Kwasi Kwarteng, Philip Hammond \u2013 I could go on for a while.\nThe Liberal Democrats think they could have a shot. \nThey are targeting Surrey as part of the so-called \u201cBlue Wall\u201d - Conservative held seats in the south and south west of England that they think they can win - and believe constituencies such as Guildford, Esher and Walton and Godalming and Ash are within their reach. \nTheir success at local council elections, and also in neighbouring parliamentary seats in south-west London, has only increased their confidence.\nLabour has not had much success in the past when it comes to election victories in Surrey, outside of some individual council divisions or wards. \nBut activists in constituencies such as Reigate and Spelthorne have been keen to get in in touch with me to promote the party\u2019s candidates. How they perform remains to be seen.\nThe Green Party (who did well in the local council elections, particularly at Reigate and Banstead) and Reform UK also have someone standing in every seat and there are other parties and independents who will be on the ballot, depending on where people live.\nUltimately it is very difficult to say exactly what might or might not happen. \nFor example, although the Tories have been losing seats on most of the local councils over the last few years, in the election for Surrey\u2019s Police and Crime Commissioner on 2 May, Conservative Lisa Townsend received the highest number of votes.\nBut politicians on all sides have said they think the contests will be close in several constituencies.\nWhatever the result on 4 July, there is going to be a significant change to the political map of Surrey. \nMore than half of the current MPs are standing down, including big names like Michael Gove, so there will be fresh faces, come what may. \nMeanwhile, boundary changes mean that there will 12 rather than 11 seats, as well different names for some constituencies.\nAnd despite its reputation for being safe and prosperous, there are plenty of issues, including affordable housing, protecting the countryside, water supplies, health services, and the cost of living, that matter to voters across the county.",
    "Newham, Barking and Dagenham and Brent have the lowest rate of childcare places in London, new statistics from the Office of National Statistics show.\nAreas with lower levels of access to childcare are generally more likely to have lower household incomes, and a higher proportion of children living in poverty. \nNewham had 16 places available for every 100 children, Tower Hamlets had 22.\nOne nursery in Tower Hamlets earmarked for closure is Westfield nursery at Queen Mary University.\nThere is a petition of 800 signatures to keep the nursery, which is consulting on closure with a view to shut on 16 August, open. \nThe university has said it does not have enough university staff who are using the places. Parents say they were told the nursery is making a deficit.\nOne mum, Jemma Gander, told BBC London: \"They've said it's not making enough money, that's the bottom line.  \n\"Lots of other parents are now looking frantically for other nurseries in the vicinity; one that we had on our list is closing too due to funding being pulled. \n\"So nurseries are closing all over the show, and the ones that are open have waiting lists for month and months. \n\"It might be that some of the age groups can't get a place until 2025. I think of a lot people are going to find themselves very stuck.\n\"We looked around every other local nursery and we chose this one, so it makes us feel really angry that they're treating us like we're just a minor inconvenience in their business plan.\"\nChildcare in London costs nearly double than in the rest of the country, a London Assembly Economy report found.\nIt also found that there has been a year-on-year reduction in the number of childminders operating in London.\nTo help with those costs, in the Spending Review last year the government announced plans to expand the number of free hours available to parents. \nFrom April, working parents with two-year-olds became eligible for 15 hours of free childcare. \nPreviously, 30 hours of free childcare was available to working parents with children aged between three and four, although that was limited to 15 hours a week if one parent earned more than \u00a3100,000. \nIn September, 15 hours of free childcare was to be expanded to youngsters aged between nine months old and two - extending to 30 hours a week from September 2025.\nIn Newham, at Sparkles Nursery in East Ham, director the Rev Claude Halm says the main challenge he faces is the increasing cost of running the place and higher wages for staff.\nDr Halm said he would like to see the next government keep the extension plan and expand it.\nA mother at Sparkles, Laila Matloob, told BBC London: \"I always wanted to carry on my work, because before having my son I was working full time, but after having my son I realised the cost of childcare was very high so I had to leave my job - but 15 hours at a certain age helps me.\n\"I do want to go back but I have certain limitations. At home I don't have any other help as my husband works. I think there should be more hours given.\"\nIn addition to the policy already set in place, the Conservatives further set out in their manifesto for the upcoming general election that they would commit to increasing hourly funding rates over the next two years by an estimated \u00a3500m.\nMunira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesperson, said: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats\u2019 plan would give new parents the choice and flexibility of childcare they need, backed up by a package of proper support.\"\nShe added that the party would review the rates paid to providers for free hours to ensure they cover the costs of delivering childcare, developing a career strategy for nursery staff and replace the three different current registration processes with a single childcare register.\nLabour's Bridget Phillipson said: \u201cThe evidence is clear: school-based nurseries deliver high-quality education, which enables children to achieve and thrive when they are at primary school.\n\u201cThe 3,300 new nurseries will be key to delivering Labour\u2019s mission for half a million more children to hit the early-learning goals by 2030, giving them the firm foundations from which to succeed.\"\nA Queen Mary University of London spokesperson said, on behalf of Westfield nursery: \u201cWe have taken the very difficult decision to close our university nursery. \n\"Since the pandemic, work patterns have changed and the number of children attending the nursery has consistently been significantly below capacity. \n\"Currently, out of a total workforce of over 5,700, only 23 members of staff are using this in-house service, resulting in a running loss of approximately \u00a3250K per year.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The widow of a man killed on a section of smart motorway has put together an exhibition featuring comments from people concerned about the roads' safety.\nClaire Mercer, whose husband Jason died on the M1 near Sheffield in June 2019, said she had wanted to show politicians how unwanted smart motorways were.\nThe screenshots were put on display around the rugby pitch at Rotherham Titans' ground, where Mr Mercer was a season ticket holder.\nMrs Mercer said some of the comments made by contributors highlighted \"many terrifying experiences people had on smart motorways\".\nSmart motorways are stretches of road where technology is used to try to regulate traffic flow and ease congestion.\nThere are currently 193 miles of what is called \"all-lane-running\" motorway - this means the hard shoulder has been permanently removed to provide an extra lane.\nThe hard shoulder is sometimes open to traffic on another 63 miles of smart motorway, while there are a further 140 miles of the network where the hard shoulder has been retained.\nSome parts of the smart motorway network in South Yorkshire, where the hard shoulder has been removed and replaced with a live lane, are having new emergency areas installed in a bid to improve safety.\nMrs Mercer said the exhibition was already planned before the general election was called and it was being put on in a bid to show prospective MPs what messages people had sent to her group, called Smart Motorways Kill.\nMessages pinned to the line included one person calling smart motorways \"madness\", while another called for them to be stopped.\nOther messages mentioned fears over \u201cwho to grab first\u201d in the event of a breakdown and concerns about discrimination against people with disabilities.\nMrs Mercer said the strength of feeling and number of messages about smart motorways had only increased over the years.\nShe said: \u201cI started by flicking through as many emails and messages as possible and picking out common themes. \n\"They ranged from 'boycott the first lane' to details of the many, many terrifying experiences people had on smart motorways.\"\nShe added that she was forced to limit the date range of messages to just the last two years \"because the number of messages sent - and still coming in - would make gathering and displaying of all this impossible\".\nMrs Mercer said she hoped politicians would understand the strength of feeling from drivers, adding: \"This is our day-to-day. People have to use motorways day in, day out for the mundane, normal things.\"\nResponding, a National Highways spokesperson said the organisation's data \"continues to show that, overall, all three types of smart motorway are safer than conventional motorways in terms of deaths or serious injuries.\"\nMeanwhile, a Department for Transport spokesperson said the government had recognised public concerns and had already cancelled plans for all new smart motorway schemes.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter), and\u00a0Instagram.

His killer has still not been found and police renewed their appeal for information.\nDuring the trial, the jury heard that Junior Jah was attacked by Saleh and Burton-Devine as he walked along Coolfin Road in Newham.\nThe defendants - driving a stolen Land Rover Discovery - had set out on a \"ride-out\" looking for anyone they believed might be linked to rival gangs, it was heard.\nA shot was fired from within the vehicle hitting Junior Jah in the chest, causing him to fall backwards and on to the pavement.\nCCTV showed that Saleh got out of the vehicle and stabbed the victim twice using a large knife.\nJudge Dennis said it appeared Junior Jah was either shot \"in a case of mistaken identity\" or that he was \"selected at random\".\n\"I am satisfied this venture has all the hallmarks of serious organised crime in the context of gang-related activity,\" he said.\n\"This was a brutal and cowardly act of wanton violence on a defenceless teenager who was in effect executed as he stood on the pavement of a London street.\"\nIn a victim impact statement Junior's father, Abubakarr Jah, said: \"His life was cut short by a horrific and brutal act of savagery.\n\"I have to live with the fact that my son's final moments were in abject fear and pain.\"\nHe said the defendants were a \"blight to society and a danger to the community\" and that they should be \"ashamed\" of themselves.\nSaleh and Burton-Devine were also given an 18-year concurrent sentence for possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.\nSaleh was also sentenced to 18 months for possession of a bladed article.\nTwo other men - Asad Sharif, 29, from Manor Park, and Dino Hamza, 26, from Plaistow - were sentenced to 39 months and 28 months in prison respectively after pleading guilty to conspiracy to steal.\nDet Insp Gary Harreman, from the Met, said Junior Jah\u2019s family had shown \"great strength\" throughout the investigation.\nHe said police continued to \"fight for justice\" for Ahmed, and detectives were working to find those responsible for his death.\n\"Seven years have passed since his murder but we know people\u2019s allegiances can change over time,\" he said. \nHe urged anyone with information to come forward.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "US banking giant Wells Fargo has sacked a number of employees following claims that staff were faking keyboard activity to fool the company into thinking they were working when they were not. \nIt is not yet clear how the issue was discovered or whether it was specifically related to people working from home. \nThe US bank said staff had been fired or resigned \"after review of allegations involving simulation of keyboard activity creating impression of active work\".\nNew rules recently came into effect in the US which mean that brokers working from home must be inspected every three years. \nA spokeswoman for the firm said: \"Wells Fargo holds employees to the highest standards and does not tolerate unethical behaviour.\"\nIn 2022, Wells Fargo said it had adopted a hybrid flexible working model with staff permitted to work from home some of the time.\nSome large companies have been using increasingly sophisticated tools to monitor employees since remote work expanded during the Covid pandemic.\nSuch services can track keystrokes and eye movements, take screenshots and log which websites are visited.\nBut technology has also evolved to evade the surveillance, including so-called \"mouse jigglers\" which are aimed at making computers appear to be in active use which are widely available.\nAccording to Amazon, where they can be found for less than $10, thousands have been sold in the last month.\nBloomberg, which first reported the move based on a filing Wells Fargo made to the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, said that more than a dozen people had been affected. \nThe BBC has confirmed six instances in which staff had been discharged after review, and one case in which a person resigned voluntarily after being confronted with the claims.\nMany of them had worked for Wells Fargo for less than five years.\nMany firms, especially in the financial industry, are pushing staff to return to the office. \nRemote work has remained popular since the pandemic but numbers have been drifting lower. \nIn the US, just under 27% of paid days last month were work-from-home days, compared with more than 60% at the height of the pandemic in 2020, according to research by professors at the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de M\u00e9xico (ITAM) Business School, Stanford and University of Chicago.\nAs of this spring, about 13% of full-time employees in the US were fully remote, and another 26% enjoyed a hybrid arrangement, according to the researchers.

    "Hamas has pushed back after being criticised by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for not yet accepting a ceasefire proposal, saying it had shown \"positivity\" towards the negotiations.\nThe group said it had \"dealt positively... with the latest proposal and all proposals to reach a ceasefire agreement\".\nIt said, in contrast, \"while Blinken continues to talk about 'Israel\u2019s' approval of the latest proposal, we have not heard any Israeli official voicing approval\".\nMr Blinken has repeatedly said that Israel has accepted a ceasefire proposal outlined by President Biden on 31 May. Israel's government has not officially said so, though an Israeli plan formed the basis for Mr Biden's declaration.\nSpeaking in Qatar on Wednesday, Mr Blinken expressed frustration with Hamas's response to the Israeli ceasefire proposal, which the group delivered on Tuesday.\nThe details of the response have not been made public, though Mr Blinken said Hamas had proposed changes, some of which, he said, were unworkable.\n\"At some point in a negotiation \u2013 and this has gone back and forth for a long time \u2013 you get to a point where if one side continues to change its demands, including making demands and insisting on changes for things that it already accepted, you have to question whether they\u2019re proceeding in good faith or not.\"\nBut in a series of statements on Wednesday night, Hamas questioned whether Israel had actually accepted either the plan or a UN Security Council resolution endorsing it.\n\"The world did not hear any welcome or approval from [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu\" and his government to the resolution, it said. \"Rather they continued to emphasise the rejection of any permanent ceasefire, in clear contradiction with the Security Council resolution and President Biden\u2019s initiative.\"\nHamas said that on the other hand, it had \"clearly expressed its positive position on what was included in US President Joe Biden\u2019s speech\" and on \"what was included\" in the resolution. It also said it had confirmed its \"readiness to co-operate\" with the mediators involved in the ceasefire negotiations.\nAfter a meeting with Mr Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday, Mr Blinken said the prime minister had \"reaffirmed his commitment\" to the ceasefire proposal.\nMr Netanyahu has not publicly endorsed the plan, although the war cabinet which he leads authorised the proposal which was delivered to Hamas on 27 May. That proposal - reportedly lengthier than the summary presented by Mr Biden - has not been made public and it is unclear whether it varies from what the president conveyed in his televised statement at the end of last month.\nOne of the main sticking points between the two sides appears to be their visions for ending the war. Reports say Hamas is insisting first on written guarantees that Israel will end the war before it will sign up to the plan. Mr Netanyahu has said the war will not end until Hamas's \"governing and military capabilities\" have been destroyed and the hostages returned. \nThe war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 37,000 people have been killed in Israel's offensive since then.\n\n \n",
    "Endangered wild horses have returned to the Golden Steppe of Kazakhstan for the first time in at least 200 years after decades-long efforts.\nThe airlifts of seven Przewalski's Horses from Europe to the Central Asian country took place in early June in an operation run by Prague Zoo.\nResearchers told the BBC that the horses are already doing well two weeks in: roaming around the plains and even beginning the mating process.\nZoo officials say it's a triumph of generations of conservation work.\n\"This is an endangered species returning to their ancestral lands, a species which went extinct in the wild in the 1960s, last seen in Mongolia...so it's just marvellous... a miracle,\" said Filip Ma\u0161ek, a spokesman for Prague Zoo.\nWhile the horses have been slowly reintroduced to Mongolia and China in recent decades, this operation marks the first time they are back in Kazakhstan.\nThe Przewalski's Horse is the last wild horse species on the planet, named after Russian explorer Nikolai Przewalski who was the first to identify the horse for the European science community.\nThe species originated millennia ago from the steppes of Central Asia and was taken by researchers to Europe and North America in the 19th and 20th Centuries, where populations were established in zoos.\nSome of them ended up in zoos in Munich and Prague - it's their descendants that have now been reintroduced in Kazakhstan.\nCultural artefacts show people in the country's north were riding and using the horses for food at least 2,000 years before records of domesticated horses in Europe.\nBut by the time of Przewalski's \"discovery\" in 1879, the horses could only be found in a small section of western Mongolia. Competition with humans and livestock, along with changes in the environment led to them dying out.\nRecognising the threat, international efforts were made after World War Two to save the animals. Prague Zoo was entrusted with the \"international studship\" of the breed.\nIt introduced the first contingent back into Kazakhstan  last week- a group consisting of one stallion and six mares. It aims to bring in at least 40 more over the next five years.\n\"This is an event of historical import,\" said the zoo's director Miroslav Bobek in a statement.\n\"The seven horses that we transported here by two Czech Army planes represent the first individuals of this species in central Kazakhstan in hundreds of years.\"\nPrzewalski's horse has long been considered the one true remaining wild horse species- as species such as the American mustang and Australian brumby are feral horses descended from domesticated animals.\nThe Przewalski's horse is shorter and stockier than modern domesticated horses and their genetic differences show that neither species are ancestors of the other.\nPrague Zoo, which has spent the past decade and a half introducing the horses back to Central Asia, mainly in Mongolia, said the Kazakhstan operations had been in the plans since 2022 after signing a deal with the local government. \nLast week saw the culmination of years of work. Prague Zoo selected horses from different programmes around Europe and put them together in the same zoo in Berlin - Tierpark Berlin - for several months to become acquainted before their journey.\nThat then kicked off in early June, with military aeroplanes flying the standing horses in two groups on a 6,000km-route that included stopovers in Turkey and Azerbaijan.\nOnce they touched ground at the Arkalyk Airport in Kazakhstan, they were taken on an eight-hour drive to the plains where they were then finally released onto the Altyn Dala - the Kazakh name for the Golden Steppe.\n\u201c[The mare named] Tessa was the first to run out of the transport box into the pen, then Wespe, followed by Umbra, and Sary brought the foursome to a close,\" Mr Bobek said.\nOn Thursday,  zoo spokesman Mr Ma\u0161ek told the BBC that the horses, after some initial trepidation, had begun to venture further afield.\nIn a \"very good\" development, scientists this week also reported that some of the horses had begun to mate. \nThe group has been moved in early summer so they have time to adapt before winter, which is typically brutal on the plains. They will be kept to a 60 hectare \"acclimatisation\" pen for the first year before being released into the wider grasslands.\nMr Ma\u0161ek said the zoo hoped to emulate the success of its Mongolia programme last decade - where the introduction of 34 horses had helped boost the native population to now well over 850 animals.\nResearchers are optimistic and hopeful, he said. He noted while human activity wasn't the sole reason for the horse's extinction, actions like hunting and breeding the species with domesticated horses accelerated their disappearance.\n\"We are still responsible the fact this wild horse disappeared and now we can sort of reverse that, and give it back to nature.\"\nHe described it as the ultimate goal of a modern zoo: \"To sort of be these Noah's Arks which have all these endangered species.\n\"If it's possible- ",
    "A prominent female #MeToo activist in China has been handed a five-year jail sentence for \"subversion against the state\".\nSophia Huang Xueqin was convicted and sentenced on Friday, nearly 10 months after she went on trial.\nLabour activist Wang Jianbing, who stood trial with Ms Huang, was sentenced to three years and six months in prison. \nMs Huang, 36, had been one of the most prominent voices in China's #MeToo space, reporting ground-breaking stories about sexual abuse victims. \nShe had also spoken out about the misogyny and sexism she faced in Chinese newsrooms.\nChinese authorities have not made it clear how the two stood accused of subversion. The trial was a closed-door hearing.\nBut their supporters say they were detained because they hosted regular meetings and forums for young people to discuss social issues.\nMs Huang had been on her way to take up a UK-government sponsored masters scholarship at the University of Sussex when she was detained at the airport in the city of Guangzhou in 2021.\nMr Wang, 40, was with her at that time.\nSupporters say both have endured months of solitary confinement during their pre-detention custody, which lasted for nearly 1,000 days. Their trial only began in September 2023.\nA BBC Eye investigation in 2022 found that both were being held in solitary confinement, detained in secret locations known as 'black jails'.\nIn 2021, amid Covid lockdowns and growing public anger, Chinese authorities launched a crackdown on several activists working across different fields.\n\"Their efforts and dedication to labour, women's rights, and the broader civil society won't be negated by this unjust trial, nor will society forget their contributions,\" said the campaign group Free Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.\n\"On the contrary, as oppression persists and injustice grows, more activists like them will continue to rise.\"\nAmnesty International on Friday called the convictions \"malicious and totally groundless\".\n\"[They] show just how terrified the Chinese government is of the emerging wave of activists who dare to speak out to protect the rights of others,\" said Amnesty International\u2019s China Director Sarah Brooks.\n\"#MeToo activism has empowered survivors of sexual violence around the world, but in this case, the Chinese authorities have sought to do the exact opposite by stamping it out.\"\nIt is unclear if the time already served by the pair will go towards reducing their sentence.\nPublic reaction to Ms Huang's trial has previously been mixed - with some online decrying the case while others critical of the feminist movement welcomed it.\nMany advocates for gender rights and social causes in China choose to remain anonymous online.\nOften they have been accused of being \"agents of hostile western forces\" by state media and nationalists on the internet.\n",
    "A gym in South Korea has banned misbehaving \"aunties\", reigniting a debate about discrimination against older women in the country. \nThe gym in Incheon city near the capital Seoul put up a sign that read \"off limits to ajummas\" and \"only cultivated and elegant women allowed\".\nAjumma is a catch-all term for older women - typically late-30s onwards - but is also a pejorative for behaviour that is seen as rude or obnoxious. \nLocal reports did not name the gym or its owner, who defended the move, claiming that his company had \"suffered damages\" because of these women and their unruly behaviour. \n\u201c[Some older women customers] would spend an hour or two in the changing room to do their laundry, steal items including towels, soaps, or hair dryers,\u201d he said in a televised interview with South Korean news agency Yonhap.\n\u201cThey would sit in a row and comment and judge other people\u2019s bodies,\u201d he said, adding that some younger women have quit the gym because of these comments, which upset them or made them uncomfortable.\nWhile the move was made by a single gym, it seems to have struck a nerve because in recent years, South Korean businesses have drawn flak for banning children or seniors from certain public places. \nSome of this has been seen as proof of growing intolerance for specific age groups.\nThe gym has also drawn criticism for conflating bad behaviour with women of a certain age. \n\u201cHow did the term 'bad customer' become the same as 'ajumma'?\", read one comment on local social media website instiz.\n\"If you have worked in the service industry, you\u2019d know that it\u2019s not just older women who fall into those categories.\u201d \nAnother comment described the move as a sign of outdated attitudes, calling it \"sentiments of the early 2000s\u201d.  \nThe gym defended itself by pointing to an additional notice that tried to distinguish between ajummas and women. It says that ajummas tend to \"like free stuff regardless of their age\", and that they are \"stingy with their own money but not with other people's money\".\nThe gym's owner also said there may be other business owners who share his sentiments but have not spoken out.\n\"It\u2019s not that I tried to make a hate comment against older women or women in general,\" he told Yonhap. \"I think people who are enraged by [the notice] are in fact the ones with the problem.\"\nThe ban did find support among some people online, who also seemed to associate  ill manners with older or middle-aged women. Some described them as \"territorial\",  while others used insulting language, calling them \"senseless\".  \n\"The ladies are annoying... They take their kids to restaurants and cafes. They are oblivious and abusive,\" read one comment on YouTube. \nThere were multiple references to children, with the main notion being that these women took up a lot of space or attention in public spaces. \nSouth Korean women have long fought for non-traditional choices - from short hair to singledom - in a society that holds them to often unyielding standards. Women say men are rarely judged for similar behaviour.  \nCommentators too have pointed out that there was no need to single out women at all, when older men are just as likely to behave badly. \n\u201cOlder men behave the same,\" psychology professor Park Sang-hee said in an interview with television network JTBC, following the ban. \"Older men also obsess over free stuff and repeat themselves over and over again. Rude behaviours are not exclusive to older women.\"",
    "The G7 has agreed to use frozen Russian assets to raise $50bn (\u00a339bn) for Ukraine to help it fight invading Russian forces.\nUS President Joe Biden said it was another reminder to Russia \"that we're not backing down\", but in Moscow President Vladimir Putin said the move was \"theft\" which would \"not go unpunished\". \nAlso at the G7 summit in Italy,  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Mr Biden signed a 10-year bilateral security deal between Ukraine and the US, hailed by Kyiv as \"historic\". \nThe agreement envisages US military and training aid to Ukraine - but it does not commit Washington to send troops to fight for its ally.\nAccording to the White House, the security deal means Washington and Kyiv will work to build and maintain Ukraine's defence and deterrence capability, bolster the country's defence industrial base, and support economic recovery and energy security.\nThe security deal also means that in the event of a future Russian armed attack against Ukraine, there will be consultation \"at the highest levels to determine appropriate and necessary measures to support Ukraine and impose costs on Russia\", the statement added.\nSeparately, some $325bn worth of assets were frozen by the G7, alongside the EU, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The pot of assets is generating about $3bn a year in interest. \nUnder the G7 plan, that $3bn will be used to pay off the annual interest on the $50bn loan for the Ukrainians, taken out on the international markets. \nThe money is not expected to arrive until the end of the year but is seen as a longer-term solution to support Ukraine's war effort and economy. \nSpeaking at a joint news conference at the summit's venue in Puglia, southern Italy, President Biden said the $50bn loan would \"put that money to work for Ukraine and send another reminder to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin that we're not backing down\".\nThe US leader stressed that Mr Putin \"cannot wait us out, he cannot divide us, and we'll be with Ukraine until they prevail in this war\".\nPresident Zelensky thanked his American and other allies for their unwavering support. \nAnd referring to the new security deal, he said: \"It's a truly historic day and we have signed the strongest agreement within Ukraine and the US since our independence [in 1991]\". \nThe G7 group of rich nations, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and US, have been important financial and military supporters of Ukraine as it battles to contain occupying Russian forces.\nOther G7 leaders also hailed the $50bn loan deal, with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak describing it as \"game changing\".\nThe $50bn loan is a sizeable pot of money, when compared with the $61bn worth of US military aid that was finally agreed in May. \nA senior White House official said the G7-agreed fund will have \"multiple\" uses, which could include \"military support, budget support, humanitarian support, reconstruction support\". \nThere will be \"flexibility in this structure,\" the US official added, as some countries \"prefer to send their money to budget support and to reconstruction\" while others will have funds \"earmarked\" for military support.\nSome of those in Kyiv, who had been pushing for this cash, had wanted the G7 to release the whole frozen fund of $300bn, not merely the interest it is generating. The European Central Bank had ruled that out.\nThe bank's president, Christine Lagarde, has previously warned that such a move risked \"breaking the international order... you would want Russia to respect\". \nUnlike the US aid package, which directly translated into more missiles being sent to the front line, this money will likely not arrive until the end of the year, meaning it will have little impact on the current course of the war. \nElsewhere, Jens Stoltenberg has been hoping to persuade Nato allies to provide Ukraine with guaranteed long-term military support, with a financial package of around $40bn (\u00a331.5bn) a year, but a deal has not yet been agreed.\nNato defence ministers, who are meeting in Brussels, approved a plan which will see the alliance take over the coordination of security assistance and training for Ukraine, much of which has been led by the US.\nMr Stoltenberg said the changes did not make Nato a party to the conflict and showed the alliance supported Ukraine\u2019s right to self defence.\nFor now, Ukraine says it still urgently needs more weapons - primarily air defence systems to blunt Russia\u2019s missile and drone attacks on its cities and power stations, as well as long awaited F-16 fighter jets, which it hopes will start arriving as early as this summer. \nAt the G7 summit, Mr Zelensky said the new security agreement included US shipments of those warplanes.\nThe loan deal is also hugely symbolic for Ukraine. Its aggressor is now being forced to pay, not only to repair the devastation it has wrought - but for Ukraine to defend itself. \nOne of Mr Zelensky's closest advisers has said that the West\u2019s decision to punish Russia in ",
    "An Asian elephant in central Thailand has given birth to a rare set of twins, in what caretakers have described as a miracle.\nThe mother, 36-year-old Chamchuri, was not expected to deliver twins and when she gave birth to a male calf last Friday, staff at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal, had thought the delivery was done.\nBut while cleaning up the first calf and helping it stand on its feet, they heard a loud thud and realised that Chamchuri had given birth to a second calf, a female.\nThe second birth sent the mother into a panic and caretakers had to restrain her to prevent her from stepping on the female calf. One caretaker was hurt in the melee.\nDramatic footage on social media showed a crowd of caretakers - known locally as mahouts - frantically separating the female calf from the mother, with blood from the birth still visible on her hind legs.\nTwins occur in only one percent of elephant births and male-female are even more rare, according to Save the Elephants, a research organisation.\n\"Once we pulled the second baby elephant out, away from the mother, the baby stood up. We were all cheering because it\u2019s a miracle,\" veterinarian Lardthongtare Meepan told the BBC.\n\"We\u2019ve always wanted to see elephant twins but not everyone can see this because it doesn\u2019t happen a lot,\" said Ms Meepan, who grew up at the elephant park, and is herself a mother of twins.\nCharin Somwang, a 31-year-old mahout, broke his leg while restraining the mother. \n\"I was so happy, I couldn\u2019t feel the pain,\" he told the BBC, adding he felt the extent of the injuries only when he was brought to the hospital.\n\"It\u2019s normal that the new mother will always try to kick or push the baby... I was afraid that she might break the baby elephant, so I put myself forward and tried to block the mother from the smaller one,\" said Mr Somwang, who has been working at the park for 15 years.\nElephants are considered sacred in Thailand, where a majority of the population is Buddhist. They are also a national symbol.\nSince the birth, the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal has featured the twins in live streams on social media.\nPark visitors, including children, are also allowed to see the twins, but only after disinfecting their footwear and their hands.\nA sign near the nursery reads: \"Please don't touch the elephant babies\".\nThey will be named seven days after birth in accordance with Thai custom.\nAt 55kg (121lb) the female calf is slightly smaller than usual and has to step on a stool during feeding with her mother. Her brother is heavier at 60kg.\nThe park claims its elephants were rescued from begging on the streets. In 1989, Thailand banned logging in natural forests, leaving mahouts who worked in that industry jobless.\nThis forced them to make elephants perform tricks for tourists in exchange for money. This practice was outlawed in 2010 - though there are still rare cases of this happening. \nIn Ayutthaya, Thailand's former capital, some elephants carry tourists on their backs to temples and historic ruins.\nConservationists oppose elephant riding as they say this stresses the animals out and amounts to abuse.\nAn earlier report by the World Animal Protection (WAP) says that harsh methods are used to get a wild elephant to carry a human on its back. The process starts soon after it is captured. It is often referred to as \"breaking-in\" or \"crush\". \nAside from Ayutthaya, elephants have also become tourist draws in highland villages in Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai in the north, where tourists can feed them with bananas, go walking with them and bathe them with mud.\nThe Asian elephant is an endangered species due to poaching, illegal trade and habitat loss, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nMore elephants are used for tourism in Thailand - over 3,000 - than anywhere else. Unlike other countries with captive populations, those in Thailand are nearly all privately owned.\nCompared to their African counterparts, Asian elephants have smaller ears round and hunched backs.\nMeanwhile, visitors continue to flock to the park in Ayutthaya to see the twin babies, as they await their names.\nThey walk in a small pen covered with hay as they roll their trunks on their mother's leg.\n\"I am always happy when I see elephant gives birth,\" said Mr Somwang, their mahout who is recovering from injury.\n\"It doesn\u2019t need to be twins. Elephant babies always bring joy,\" he said.",
    "The US Supreme Court has unanimously rejected an effort to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone.\nThe decision, which came two years after the court rescinded the nationwide guarantee to an abortion, was welcomed by pro-choice activists.\nThe justices decided the plaintiffs, a group of anti-abortion doctors and activists, did not have a legal right to sue. \nBut they left the door open to other attempts to limit the availability of the drug.\nMifepristone is one of two drugs used in a medication abortion, now the most common method of terminating pregnancies in the US. \nThe plaintiffs, known as the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, had argued that approval for the drug from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be withdrawn. \nBut during arguments on the case in March, several of the court's nine justices sounded sceptical that any of the plaintiffs had suffered harm from the availability of mifepristone - which is necessary to have the legal standing to sue. \n\"The plaintiffs have sincere legal, moral, ideological objections to elective abortion and to FDA's relaxed regulation,\" wrote Justice Brett Kavanaugh for the court, \"but they failed to demonstrate\" any actual injury. \n\"A plaintiff\u2019s desire to make a drug less available for others does not establish standing to sue,\"  he also wrote. \nThe top court overturned Roe v Wade, effectively rescinding a federal right to abortion, in June 2022. Since then, 21 states have moved to restrict abortion earlier in pregnancy than the standard it had set. Seventeen of those have barred the procedure at six weeks or earlier.\nThursday's ruling has no bearing on these laws - medication abortion remains illegal in states that prohibit abortion. But abortion pills have acted as an effective workaround to the bans, with thousands of pills flowing into restrictive states through the mail. \nPro-choice activists were encouraged that access to abortion pills had been preserved, but warned the Supreme Court's decision was a qualified victory.\n At least three states - Missouri, Kansas and Idaho - have also opposed the FDA's approval of the drug in court. The Supreme Court's decision on Thursday does not rule out these future challenges. \n\"This ruling is not a \u2018win\u2019 for abortion, it just maintains the status quo,\" said Nancy Northup, president of the pro-choice Center for Reproductive Rights in a statement. \n\"The attacks on abortion pills will not stop here - the anti-abortion movement sees how critical abortion pills are in this post-Roe world.\"\nIn a statement, President Joe Biden echoed those comments, saying the ruling \"does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues\".\n\"The stakes could not be higher for women across America,\" he said. \nAnti-abortion groups criticised the decision. But these groups, too, indicated the fight would continue.  \n\"It is a sad day for all who value women\u2019s health and unborn children\u2019s lives,\" said Katie Daniel, state policy director for Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America.  \"But the fight to stop dangerous mail-order abortion drugs is not over.\"\nAbortion is expected to be a leading issue at the ballot box this autumn. \nSince Roe v Wade was overturned, it has posed a problem for some Republicans, caught between a base that opposes the abortion, and a general electorate that broadly supports access to the procedure. \nIn recent months, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called for compromise from his party members, suggesting strict bans were politically costly. \nOn Thursday morning, speaking to House Republicans, Trump seemed to advocate for exceptions to anti-abortion laws, saying \"like Ronald Reagan, you have to have three choices: life of the mother, rape and incest\".\nHe added: \"But you have to follow your own heart.\" \nThe two-drug regimen was approved for use up to 10 weeks of pregnancy by the FDA in 2000. A patient is first given mifepristone to induce an abortion and then misoprostol to empty the uterus.\nSince 2016, the FDA has eased access to the drug and allowed doctors to hold virtual appointments with patients and for prescriptions to be sent by mail. Those more recent approvals were at question in this case. \nNearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US now are medication abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports access to the procedure. \nMore than a million pregnancies were terminated in the US last year, the highest number in over a decade, says the institute.\nThroughout two decades of use, the FDA, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists (ACOG) and other mainstream medical organisations have maintained that both mifepristone and misoprostol are safe for women to use. \nUS studies say medication abortion is about 95% effective in ending pregnancy and requires further medical follow-up less than 1% of the time.",
    "Greek officials are searching for a US tourist who went missing after going on a hike alone on the island of Amorgos. \nLocal officials say Albert Calibet, 59, vanished on Tuesday afternoon. His friend reported him missing when he did not return from his hike. \nSeveral agencies are participating in the search for Mr Calibet, including volunteers from the coastguard and teams from the neighbouring islands of Paros and Naxos, according to Greek public broadcaster ERT News. \nHis disappearance comes days after the British television presenter Michael Mosley went missing on the Greek island of Symi, where his body was found four days later. \nThe BBC has contacted the US state department for comment about the search for Mr Calibet. \nOfficials are searching both land and water in an area covering almost a quarter of Amorgos, the island's Mayor Eleftherios Karaiskos told ERT. \nThey have been using a drone to search the northern part of the island and are also attempting to trace Mr Calibet's two mobile phones. Calls to Mr Calibet - who the mayor said had visited the island before - have gone unanswered. \n\"We\u2019re almost on three days here,\" his brother Oliver Calibet told Fox 11 TV in Los Angeles. \"There\u2019s no water\u2026 I\u2019m very distraught.\"\nOliver Calibet and the girlfriend of Mr Calibet are on their way to Greece to help the search effort, ABC News reported. \nThe island's mayor said the hike on which Mr Calibet had embarked was busy and not particularly challenging, which suggested that the American could have deviated from his planned route. \nMr Calibet, described as a retired police officer from Los Angeles County, started a hike on Tuesday morning in the village of Aegiali, according to local news outlets. \nA few minutes later he is thought to have sent a text message with a picture of the sign showing the route he was taking to Katapola, an estimated four hours on foot.\nAbout two hours later, a local woman said she spoke to the missing tourist after he bought drinks from a nearby store. Sofia Liviaki told Mega TV that Mr Calibet had drunk a soft drink, showed her his planned route and took a bottle of water with him for the remainder of his journey.\nMr Calibet's disappearance has shocked the local community on Amorgos, where he has been a regular visitor for a number of years. While the path he chose is well travelled and not difficult, the island has been experiencing a heatwave with temperatures currently as high as 35C (95F).\n\"Temperatures are very high, like all of Greece during the heatwave,\" the island's deputy mayor for tourism, Popi Despotidi, told Greek media. \"We're guessing he felt dizzy...  and collapsed somewhere. It's odd because he's not someone who was walking this route for the first time.\"\n\"Our hope is that we can bring him home safely,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna told ABC News. \"We are actively collaborating with multiple agencies abroad to provide assistance in the search for Deputy Calibet and will use every resource we have available to bring him back to those who love him.\"\nThe search for the missing man comes just days after officials spent days scouring another Greek island, Symi, for Dr Mosley, a famous British TV doctor who vanished after setting out on a walk from a beach. \nHis body was found in a rocky area, and investigators concluded that he died of natural causes the day he went missing.\nA second American tourist, a 55-year-old, has also gone missing in Greece, on the island of Mathraki, north west of Corfu, according to local media. \nAnd a 74-year-old Dutch tourist disappeared on Sunday on the island of Samos.",
    "Donald Trump has returned to Capitol Hill to meet Republicans in his first visit since the riot by supporters of his at Congress three years ago. \nThe presumptive Republican nominee in November's presidential election delivered a message of unity, promising to \"work out\" any lingering differences within the party. \nLater in the day, the former president met with an association of 200 corporate leaders. \nNancy Pelosi, the former Democratic House Speaker, said in a statement that Trump was the \"instigator of an insurrection... returning to the scene of the crime\". \nThe visit comes a fortnight after Trump's criminal conviction for falsifying business records in his hush-money trial in New York. \nHe arrived at a Republican office building near the US Capitol building on Thursday morning, passing a small crowd of protesters holding signs with slogans including \"failed coup\" and \"Democracy Forever, Trump Never\". \nIn a brief news conference early on Thursday afternoon, Trump said there was \"great unity\" in the party, and vowed to stand by fellow Republicans, even those he disagreed with.\n\"I'm with every one of you. I'll be with you always,\" he said. \"If [a relationship] wasn't fantastic, it gets worked out.\n\"We have one thing in mind, and that's making our county great again.\"\nTrump did not take questions, but waved and gave a thumbs up at a small group of supporters shouting \"I love you\". \n\"Thank you,\" he mouthed in response. \nFollowing a meeting between Trump and House Republicans earlier in the day,  House Speaker Mike Johnson said the former president \"brought an extraordinary amount of energy and enthusiasm this morning\". \n\"That is what we're seeing in the party throughout the country,\" Mr Johnson said. \"We believe we are going to win back the White House, and the Senate, and grow the House majority.\"\nMatt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, described Trump's meeting with House Republicans as a \"pep-rally environment\" for the former president. \nMarjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, told reporters she saw nothing but \"overwhelming support for Trump\" among the party rank-and-file. \n\"I am glad to see Republicans here in Washington rallying around President Trump and his candidacy as president,\" she said. \nSenate minority leader Mitch McConnell, who has been openly critical of Trump in the past, called the visit \"really positive\". \n\"He got a lot of standing ovations,\" Mr McConnell added. \nIn addition to Mr McConnell, two other Trump critics within the party - Utah Senator Mitt Romney and Louisiana's Bill Cassidy - were at the meeting. \nSenator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, described Trump as \"extremely gracious\" and \"warm\" to Senate Republicans. \n\"I guess I've just been here five years, and that's probably the warmest meeting that I have been in with senators and Trump,\" he told reporters. \nMr Hawley said that Trump spoke about abortion \"quite a lot\" at the meeting, where he reiterated his stance that voters should be the ones to decide on the issue. \n\nAt the earlier meeting with House Republicans, Trump reportedly described Milwaukee as \"horrible\", a month before the Wisconsin city is due to host the Republican National Convention.\nThat prompted his spokesman to clarify that he was referencing crime in the city rather than the city itself. \nMilwaukee broke its homicide record for three years in a row from 2020-22, though the city's police department statistics show that violent crime, including murder and rape, has fallen significantly over the last two years.\nSeveral lawmakers from the Wisconsin delegation claimed Trump's comments about the city were made in reference to the upcoming election.  \nBut Wisconsin Rep Derrick Van Orden, a Republican, argued Trump's comments about the city were focused on crime.\n\"You're focusing on a two-second comment that's factually correct by the former president of the United States,\" Mr Van Orden told reporters on Capitol Hill. \nBefore the visit, Politico reported that Trump called Mr Johnson to urge him to help reverse his 31 May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying documents in New York. \n\"We have to overturn this,\" Trump reportedly said in an expletive-laden call. \nNew York Republican representative Marcus Molinaro told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that Trump made no mention of the conviction when meeting with House Republicans. \nMore than three years ago, Trump urged supporters to \"fight like hell\" but also to march \"peacefully\" hours before a mob stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 as lawmakers certified Joe Biden's election victory. \nMrs Pelosi said in her statement: \"Donald Trump comes to Capitol Hill today with the same mission of dismantling our democracy.\n\"Make no mistake - Trump has already cemented his legacy of shame in our hallowed halls.\"",

He will be in France tomorrow after a long incarceration in Iran,\" President Emmanuel Mr Macron posted earlier on X.\nThe president thanked Oman for helping to secure his freedom and urged Iran to release three other French prisoners.\nThe three others are teacher C\u00e9cile Kohler and her partner Jacques Paris, and a man identified only by his first name, Olivier.\n\"This evening, I also think of C\u00e9cile, Jacques and Olivier. I am calling on Iran to liberate them without delay,\" Mr Macron said.\nMr Arnaud's family stated in the past that he was celebrating the birthday of one of a group of backpackers he had met on his travels when they were stopped by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. All of the others who were detained, including other foreigners, have since been released.\nHis arrest took place as protests started to sweep across Iran in 2022, sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in custody. \nMr Arnaud was held at the notorious Evin prison in the capital, Tehran, which has long been criticised by rights groups. \nHuman Rights Watch has accused authorities at the prison of using threats of torture and of indefinite imprisonment, as well as lengthy interrogations and denial of medical care for detainees.\nThe release comes as bilateral relations between Paris and Tehran have deteriorated in recent months.\nFrance has said the detention of its citizens are arbitrary arrests equivalent to state hostage taking. It's also increasingly concerned by Iran's activities in the Middle East and the advance of its nuclear programme.",
    "Every major English water company has reported data suggesting they\u2019ve discharged raw sewage when the weather is dry \u2013 a practice which is potentially illegal.\nBBC News has analysed spills data from nine firms, which suggests sewage may have been discharged nearly 6,000 times when it had not been raining in 2022 - including during the country\u2019s record heatwave.\nWater companies can release untreated sewage into rivers and seas when it rains to prevent it flooding homes, but such spills are illegal when it\u2019s dry.\nThe firms say they understand public concerns around dry spilling, but they disagree with the BBC\u2019s findings.\nThey have said the spill data shared with the Environment Agency was \u201cpreliminary\u201d and \u201cunverified\u201d, and also disagree with how the BBC defined a dry spill, which they say differs from the Environment Agency\u2019s approach.\nThe latest findings follow a BBC investigation conducted last year which found 388 instances of possible dry spilling in 2022 by three water companies - Thames, Wessex and Southern - after they shared their data with the BBC.\nThe other six \u2013 Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Severn Trent, South West Water, United Utilities and Yorkshire Water - had refused to share data about when they might be spilling with the BBC. They said it could prejudice an ongoing criminal investigation by the Environment Agency (EA) and Ofwat into their activities.\nThe regulator \u2013 the Environment Agency \u2013 which had the data, disagreed, and in January handed it to the BBC.\nSpeaking to the BBC before the election, Helen Wakeham, head of water at the EA, said the whole point of monitoring was to increase transparency, and they wanted to make the data more publicly available.\nOverflow points where sewage is discharged have monitors which record when spills start and stop.\nThe BBC cross-referenced the companies\u2019 spill data from these overflow points with local Met Office rainfall data. Over 18 months we analysed data from nearly 10,000 monitors which had recorded more than 1.5 million hours of discharges.\nBBC analysis suggests dry spills may have started on more than 200 days in 2022, lasting more than 29,000 hours \u2013 including during the record summer heatwave when people were cooling off in England\u2019s rivers and seas.\n\u201cWe are most concerned about those [spill] events happening in places where people are likely to go in the river,\u201d said Professor Barbara Evans, chair in public health engineering at the University of Leeds.\nConsumption of water contaminated with human or animal faeces exposes people to parasites and bacteria such as cryptosporidium and E.coli, which cause diarrhoea and vomiting, or viruses like hepatitis A which can lead to liver infection.\nThe six water companies who were subject of the latest investigation took issue with the BBC\u2019s analysis, citing the data we used and the methodology.\nEvery year England\u2019s water companies are required to submit an annual report to the EA summarising their discharges. This enables the EA to investigate potential cases of dry spills and to decide whether it will take any action.\nThe BBC has been analysing data behind the 2022 report, but in responding to our findings, the water companies argue that the datasets are unverified and contain errors.\nExamples of potential dry spills in the data were presented to each water company. Anglian Water disagreed with all the examples presented and the remaining five companies disagreed with some.\nThe main reason the companies gave for disputing the examples was that their monitors malfunctioned and incorrectly recorded spills.\nFrom 2025, all water companies have committed to publishing near real-time sewage maps for the public to increase transparency. They will use the data from these monitors to create the maps.\nDavid Henderson, CEO of the industry body, Water UK, told the BBC: \u201cWe are the most transparent industry in the world when it comes to water. No other country in the world publishes this sort of data.\u201d\nIn May, Anglian Water was found guilty of failing to provide data to the Environment Agency for their investigation \u2013 and it will be sentenced in July.\nRegarding the BBC\u2019s methodology, some of the water companies argue it did not take into account that some outlets have large catchment areas and it can take a few days for any rainfall to drain through their systems, i.e. sewage detected on a dry day may be the remnants from an earlier rainy day.\nHowever, the BBC accounted for drain-down time by only considering a discharge a potential dry spill when there had been four consecutive days in the surrounding area without rain.\nHelen Wakeham from the EA says the BBC\u2019s methodology is, in fact, \u201cmore generous\u201d to the companies than the EA\u2019s.\nCommenting on the results of the BBC\u2019s investigation in general she said: \u201cI'm not surprised, these networks haven't been invested in for decades. That investment needs to take place.\u201d\nIn May the UK\u2019s top engineers and medical professionals warned in a public report the risk from",

Around 50 Indians have also been injured.\nThree Filipinos have also been killed, AFP quoted Philippines officials as saying. Filipino and Nepali workers are also among the injured.\nTwo-thirds of the Kuwaiti population is made up of foreign workers and the country is highly dependent on migrant labour, especially in the construction and domestic sectors. \nHuman rights groups have regularly raised concerns over their living conditions.\nLocal media reports said the building housed 196 workers and there are suggestions that it may have been overcrowded.\nA senior police officer told state TV that there were a \"large number\" of people in the building at the time of the fire.\n\"Dozens were rescued, but unfortunately there were many deaths as a result of inhaling smoke from the fire,\" he said, adding that warnings were often issued about overcrowding in this type of accommodation.\nKuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Fahad Yusuf al-Sabah accused property owners of greed and said violations of building standards had led to the tragedy.\n\"Unfortunately the greed of the property owners is what led to this,\" Sheikh al-Sabah, who is also acting interior minister, told Reuters news agency. \n\"They violate regulations and this is the result of the violations,\" he said.\nThe original death toll was 49 but Foreign Minister Abdullah Al-Yahya said on Thursday that one person had died overnight, AFP reported.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sent his condolences to the victims and their families.\n\"The fire mishap in Kuwait City is saddening,\" he said on X.\n\"My thoughts are with all those who have lost their near and dear ones.

    "A sailor was severely injured after a cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden was struck by two cruise missiles fired by the Houthis in Yemen, the US military said. \nThe injured sailor was airlifted to another ship for medical treatment, the US Central Command (CentCom) reported.\nIt added that crew members were fighting a fire on board the MV Verbena - a Palauan-flagged, Ukrainian-owned, Polish-operated ship.\nCentCom later said it had destroyed two Houthi patrol boats, one unmanned surface vessel and one drone over the Red Sea in the last 24 hours.\n\"It was determined these systems presented an imminent threat to US, coalition forces, and merchant vessels in the region,\" CentCom said in a statement.\nThe Houthis earlier said they had carried out attacks on three ships within the past 24 hours, including on the MV Verbena, \"in retaliation to the crimes committed against our people in the Gaza Strip, and in response to the American-British aggression against our country\".\nThis latest attack comes a day after the Iranian-backed group targeted a Greek-owned ship in the Red Sea, causing severe flooding on board.\nThe armed Houthi group sees itself as part of an Iranian-led \"axis of resistance\" against Israel, the US and the wider West.\nSince November, the rebel group has been carrying out attacks on ships they say are linked to Israel in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying their actions are in support of the Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe US and the UK have carried out a series of attacks on Houthi targets inside Yemen in response, leading the Houthis to retaliate against ships it believes are linked to those countries.\n\"The Houthis claim to be acting on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza and yet they are targeting and threatening the lives of third country nationals who have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza,\" CentCom said.\nThe rebels' attacks on merchant vessels in the Red Sea prompted many shipping companies to stop using the waterway, through which about 12% of global seaborne trade passes.\nOn Wednesday, the Houthis targeted a Liberian-flagged vessel named Tutor using a sea drone in the Red Sea. No casualties were reported.",
    "The European Union's top court has fined Hungary \u20ac200m (\u00a3169m) for failing to follow the union's asylum policies. \nThe court will also issue a penalty of \u20ac1m a day until it changes its policy. \nThe European Court of Justice said Budapest was in breach of a 2020 judgement that it had violated EU laws by forcing asylum seekers to travel to Belgrade or Kyiv to apply for a travel permit to enter Hungary. \nHungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, in a post on X, said the fine for \"defending the borders of the European Union\" was \"outrageous and unacceptable\" and said \"it seems that illegal migrants are more important to the Brussels bureaucrats than their own European citizens\". \nHungary has taken a hard line on migrants from outside the EU since more than one million people entered the country in 2015, most fleeing war in Syria. The Hungarian government erected border fences and tried to stop many from crossing. \nEU law states that everyone fleeing persecution in their home country has the right to ask for international protection, and cannot be removed to their home if there is a serious risk of death or torture. \nIn a press release on Thursday, the EU court said Hungary \"deliberately\" avoided applying EU policy and its failure \"constitutes an unprecedented and extremely serious infringement of EU law\". \nThe failure included the country unlawfully detaining people applying for international protection and not respecting their right to remain in Hungary until an appeal on their application was exhausted, the court said. \nThe court said Hungary's failure to follow EU laws passed responsibility on to other EU countries and undermined solidarity. \nA new EU policy on asylum that aims to speed up the asylum process requires member countries to either take in thousands of migrants from \"frontline\" nations, such as Italy, Greece and Spain, or provide extra funding or resources instead. \nIn response, Hungary vowed not to take any irregular migrants, regardless of any pact. \nHungary will take over the rotating presidency of the EU on 1 July.",
    "Undercover officers in the US recorded lectures by radical preacher Anjem Choudary which show he was the director of a group banned under UK terror laws, a court has heard.\nMr Choudary, 57, faces charges including that he \u201cdirected\u201d the group Al-Muhajiroun.\nHe is on trial at Woolwich Crown Court alongside Khaled Hussein, 29, from Edmonton in Canada, who is charged with being a member of a banned organisation.\nBoth men deny the charges.\nOpening the prosecution, Tom Little KC, said both men had a \u201cradical mindset\u201d.\nHe told the court that Mr Choudhary, from Ilford, east London, had directed Al-Muhajiroun for a \u201csignificant period\u201d but \u201cbided his time\u201d following a number of arrests.\nMr Choudary faces charges of directing a terrorist organisation, being a member of a banned organisation and supporting a banned organisation.\nThe prosecution said that he was \u201cdirecting\u201d the banned organisation Al-Muhajiroun (ALM) from 2014 onwards.\nMr Little KC told the jury that terrorist organisations were not like a sports club or a gym where you signed up for membership. They \u201clurk in the shadows seeking to avoid detection,\u201d he said.\nMr Little KC said Al-Muhajiroun was not always active.\n\u201cThere were times when arrests and interventions limited what they were able to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we suggest Anjem Choudary never gave up. He bided his time.\u201d\nThe prosecution said the other man in the dock, Khaled Hussein, is also known as Abu Aisha Al Kanadi and is a Canadian national.\n\u201cIt is clear on the evidence that he respected if not idolised Anjem Choudary and we say would do whatever he was asked to by him,\u201d Tom Little KC said.\nMr Little KC suggested the pair shared a \"warped and twisted mindset\".\nIn 2016 Mr Choudary was convicted of inviting support for the Islamic State group. He was released from prison in October 2018, and the restrictions imposed on him - which prevented him preaching - ended in July 2021.\n\u201cThe conviction undoubtedly made him more cautious in who he would speak to openly,\u201d Mr Little KC told the jury. \u201cHowever, his desire to further the aims of ALM caused even him sometimes to let down his guard.\u201d\nMr Little told the jury that Mr Choudary had directed Al-Muhajiroun for a number of years and more recently had \u201cencouraged support for it in lectures to the Islamic Thinkers Society (ITS)\u201d.\nThe prosecution says this society was based in New York and part of Al-Muhajiroun.\n\u201cThey were one and the same,\u201d Mr Little KC told the court.\nIn a video recorded in 2016, Mr Choudary referred to Islamic Thinkers as \u201cour branch in America\u201d.\nBut unbeknown to him, the group had been infiltrated by two undercover officers in the US who attended a number of lectures and classes given by Mr Choudary and recorded them.\nThe prosecution said that Mr Hussein attended some lectures online, and assisted Mr Choudary.\nAs early as December 2020 he was in contact with a man in a Facebook chat, unaware that he was an undercover officer.\nMr Hussein was also in contact with undercover officers in Canada. In September 2021 he sent one a message saying \u201cThe Islamic Thinkers Society are actually Al-Muhajiroun North America.\u201d\nIn a public post on Reddit in April 2022 Khaled Hussein said that he was leaving ITS. But the next month he dialled into an ITS Zoom call, the jury was told.\nIn June 2022 Anjem Choudary gave an online lecture to ITS entitled \u201cThe Obligation of Dawah'.\n\u201cIt\u2019s plain as pikestaff isn\u2019t it?\u201d Tom Little KC told the jury. \u201cITS are Al Muhajiroun North America.\u201d",
    "President Joe Biden has said he would not use his power to reduce any prison sentence handed down to his son, a day after the White House declined to comment on the possibility.\nSpeaking at the G7 summit in Italy, the president said he would not commute Hunter Biden's sentence on a federal gun charge.\nA Delaware jury on Tuesday found Hunter Biden guilty of lying about his drug use when buying a revolver in 2018.\n\"I said I abide by the jury decision. I will do that. And I will not pardon him,\" the president said Thursday.\nIn response to a question, Mr Biden also said he would not use his presidential power to commute - or reduce - his son's sentence.  \nBefore the verdict, Mr Biden said he would not issue a pardon in the event of a guilty verdict. \nHowever when asked about a commutation after the verdict was passed, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre would not comment and referred to the president's earlier statements.\nUS presidents have the power to commute sentences for defendants convicted of federal offences. They can also choose to issue outright pardons, vacating convictions entirely. \nCommuting a sentence would leave the conviction intact, but replace a sentence given in court with a lesser one.\nPresidents do not have the power of commutation or pardon in state-level cases.  \n\"I'm extremely proud of my son, Hunter,\" President Biden said during Thursday's news conference. \"He has overcome an addiction. He's one of the brightest, most decent men I know. And I am satisfied that I'm not going to do anything.\"\nHunter Biden pleaded not guilty to two charges related to lying about his drug use on a federal background check, and one for possessing a gun while addicted to or using drugs.\nThe 54-year-old claimed he was in recovery when he purchased the gun in October 2018. \nIn total, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though legal experts say a sentence that long is very unlikely. \nConstitutional scholars disagree on whether a president\u2019s pardon power includes himself, though Donald Trump  - if he won the presidency in November - could be the first to try if he were to be convicted in either of the two federal criminal cases he faces.",

    "The papers are dominated by Labour's manifesto launch and their verdicts on the document.\n\"We'll give nation hope\" is the how the Daily Mirror sums up Sir Keir Starmer's message. It highlights his pledge to build a better future for children.  It calls the manifesto a serious agenda which will genuinely improve lives. \nThe Guardian focuses on Starmer's promise \"to fix Britain\", but it says he's already facing questions about how he'll avoid deep cuts to some public services without either raising taxes or \"fudging fiscal targets\".\nIt highlights criticism from the independent economic research body, the Institute of Fiscal Studies, which argues that Labour, like all the main parties, is not being wholly clear on the real state of the UK's public finances. \nInside its main pages, the Guardian argues that if Labour is to pay for its pledges by growing the economy and not just by raising taxes, then a lot is riding on the party's ability to cajole business to behave differently.\nFor the Times, Starmer's manifesto is a \"gamble on growth\" with his promise to get Britain's economy moving faster that any other G7 country. \nThe paper also points out he has repeatedly failed to give assurances that he won't raise capital gains tax, fuel duty and tax relief on pensions, even though he has ruled out raising the main rates of tax - income tax, national insurance and VAT.\nThe Daily Express says the manifesto is a \"tax trap\" which would lead to \"mayhem\" under Labour.  \nThe Daily Mail has similar concerns, asking, in its main headline: \"What is Labour NOT telling us about tax hikes?\" The paper calls the manifesto dangerous and divisive, and argues that Starmer's pledges to \"turbocharge\" the economy are undone by policies which - it says - will kill jobs and stifle growth.\nThe Times has details of an opinion poll it commissioned which puts Reform UK ahead of the Tories for the first time.\nPolling firm YouGov questioned 2,200 people on Wednesday and Thursday, after the Conservatives' manifesto launch. The poll put Reform up on the Conservatives by one percentage point, which is within the margin of error. For context, a tracker of all the election polls can be found here.\nThe Times says the finding is a \"symbolic moment that deals another blow to Rishi Sunak's electoral hopes\".\nThe poll is the main story for the Daily Telegraph, which says Tory strategists had been fearing such a \"crossover moment\" in the polls since Nigel Farage returned to frontline politics. Senior Conservative party members, the paper says, have been warning recently that Labour could win what they're calling a \"super-majority\" if Reform splits the right-wing vote.\nAnd away from the election, the Times carries a warning from NHS England's medical director that a weight-loss drug, which goes by the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy, shouldn't be used just for slimming. \nProfessor Stephen Powis says the drug, produced to help control obesity and type 2 diabetes, wasn't a quick fix for people wanting to get \"beach body ready\", and shouldn't be used without a doctor's supervision. \nThe paper says A&E doctors are seeing many young women of healthy weight coming in with deadly complications from taking the medication simply to tone up.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

    "Shopping habits have not been the same since the Covid pandemic and resulting lockdowns.\nFor many, and particularly younger shoppers, it saw the lines blur between social media and e-commerce.\nUnable to shop in person, and with TikTok downloads soaring, a trend began that would go on to be described as a cultural phenomenon: #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt.\nThe hashtag, where users post what they\u2019ve bought thanks to recommendations about products on the app, has now been posted more than seven billion times.\nFor Lilia Souri and AJ Pulvirenti who co-host the marketing podcast \"Gen Z on Gen Z\", TikTok is winning with their generation.\n\"It\u2019s become one of the biggest because of how advanced the algorithm is, and because, before TikTok Shop even was created, we were seeing shopping behaviours happening on TikTok as a whole,\u201d says 27-year-old Lilia Souri.\n\u201cYou can purchase a product directly on the platform, and then continue scrolling, in a cycle of watch, shop, repeat,\u201d her co-host AJ Pulvirenti, 25, adds.\nSocial shopping is a big market and growing fast. In 2023 globally it was worth $570bn (\u00a3446bn), and is forecast to be worth more than a trillion dollars by 2028, according to estimates by Statista.\nWhile TikTok is one of the big players, its position looks vulnerable. TikTok could be banned in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance.\nSo where would that leave social shopping?\nIf you look at the number of buyers, then Facebook is still the biggest presence in social shopping, according to Jasmine Enberg, chief social media analyst at E Marketer.\nMost of its transactions take place on Facebook Marketplace, \u201cone of the few places where Gen-Z and young people still go to on Facebook,\u201d she adds.\nBut if you're looking at the percentage of users who actually buy something, then TikTok is ahead, says Ms Enberg.\nData from US-based E-marketer suggests 40% of TikTok users in the US will make at least one purchase on the platform this year, in front of both Facebook and Instagram.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important activity on the app, especially for its users,\u201d says Ms Enberg.\nKeen not to be left out, Amazon added a Consult-a-Friend feature last year, allowing customers to ask friends for advice while scrolling through its app.\nGen Z podcaster AJ Pulvirenti is sceptical about these new features.\n\u201cWhen a platform just tries to replicate something from another platform and doesn't offer anything very new or intriguing about it, it's not going to make people feel inclined to switch from something that they're used to,\u201d he says.\nA recent study by market-research firm Data.ai suggests that Gen Z spend around two hours a day on TikTok, compared to a little less than 10 minutes on Amazon.\nPerhaps TikTok's experience in Indonesia might have some useful lessons.\nIn 2021 it became the first country to pilot the app's e-commerce service, and became one of the biggest markets for TikTok Shop.\nBut with local commerce suffering in the wake of the pandemic, the government introduced rules last October to protect local retailers, which forced TikTok Shop to close. \nFor 26-year-old entrepreneur Evo Syah it was a major blow.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me, but what I can do?\u201d he says recalling the tough decisions he had to make.\n\u201cI just start my business for one year, and then they shut me down,\u201d he says.\nBut two months after the closure, TikTok agreed to invest $1.5bn in Indonesia\u2019s biggest e-commerce platform Tokopedia, meaning sellers like Evo Syah and millions of others could return to the app.\nThe 26-year-old said he \u201cnever felt happier\u201d. But not everything went back to normal.\n\"Before the TikTok shop closed I could get sales like 20 million rupiah (\u00a3966) daily. But after it reopened again that\u2019s down to 10 million rupiah (\u00a3483),\u201d he says.\nMr Syah sells most of his products on livestreams, a selling method which has boomed in popularity in Asia, but according to Ms Enberg has failed to take off in the UK and US.\n\u201cIndonesia is a very different commerce landscape to the US,\u201d she says.\nHowever, in both Indonesia and the US,  TikTok Shop has been crucial for a lot of small and local merchants, she adds.\n\u201cMany of them don't really have another place that is as powerful as TikTok.\u201d\nLooking ahead to a potential US ban, Ms Enberg says it would send ripples through the world of social shopping. \n\u201cInstagram Reels is the most natural fit for a lot of displaced TikTok users. But we'll probably also see a rise of new apps.\"\nGen Z podcast hosts AJ Pulvirenti and Lilia Souri agree: \u201cIn a world where maybe TikTok is banned. Those behaviours are still going to exist and they're still going to thrive,\u201d Lilia says.\n\u201cIn a world where this may happen.

I had water to give them and panniers of tea,\" she said.\nFor the rest of the war the three women and many others were flown across Europe in specially adapted RAF planes that could carry up to 24 casualties. \nLACW Robert's daughter, Maureen Rogers, said she felt \"humbled and privileged\" to have this opportunity to commemorate her mother.\nShe said her mother would have taken the ceremony \"in her stride\".\n\"She used to say to me: 'We had no idea what we were going to encounter,\" Ms Rogers said. \nLACW Birkbeck's daughters, Sian Gammond and Cheryl Ridler, said their mother did not talk much about the war. \n\"I think it was my father who first brought it up when he said \u2018you\u2019ll never guess what your mum did',\" Ms Gammond said. \n\"She didn't think she was very special, but my dad said she was a hero to go out and she'd say 'no, just doing my job'.\"\nThe sisters said their parents met at RAF Blakehill Farm, now a nature reserve, which made the ceremony even more special.\n\"You think, gosh, they walked around here,\" Ms Gammond said.\n\"She was a very strong, independent lady and she loved doing jitterbug dancing,\" Ms Ridler added. \n\"She was the jitterbug queen where she came from.\"\nBoth woman commended the continued work of the women in the RAF medical reserves.\n\"To think that it\u2019s all been carrying forward and they\u2019re still doing such amazing work,\" Ms Ridler said. \nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

It made me ill mentally and physically.\"\nShe thinks back to that day seven years ago and says: \"I spoke to my sister in the morning and the next day and evening, I lost my sister.\"\nBedriya's brother Sadik is critical of the \"stay put\" policy of the London Fire Brigade, where families were told not to evacuate the tower block when fire crews initially arrived on scene.\nSadik says: \"If they had not stayed they would still be alive today.\"\nHe tells me about his sister: \"She got on with everyone -  different languages, different religions.\"\nHe adds: \"They were a good family, well brought up. \n\"Nura's daughter was intelligent like her mother. She had won an award from the Bill Gates foundation. She wasn't just helpful for her family, she would have been an asset to the country.\"\nBoth Sadiq and Bedriya grew up in Ethiopia. They belong to the Ethio-Eritrea group,  which first appeared in public in January during the Grenfell Testimony Week. \nThis was a closed event created to allow families the chance to speak face to face with those involved in the multimillion-pound compensation settlement.\nThey included the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the London Fire Brigade and companies involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, such as Arconic, Celotex and Kingspan. (Arconic did not send a delegate).\nIbhrahim Toukou, who is from Eritrea, was at the Grenfell Testimony Week.\nHe lost his brother Mohamednur Tuccu, his sister-in-law Amal Admedin and his three-year-old niece Amaya. Amal's cousin Amna who was visiting also died.\nIbrahim is critical of the \u00a3150m civil claim being settled before the criminal findings. \nHe also says his mother in Eritrea was not able to receive any compensation.\n\"How are you talking about compensation now?,\" he asks.\n\"First of all you have to look at the criminal investigation until the end and then ask for compensation.\"\nIbrahim adds: \"We don't know how guilty they might be: it's not justice thinking about money. It's not justice doing it this way.\"\nPaulos Tekle's son Isaac died in the fire. He was five years old. \"The feeling I have in my heart is the same,\" Paulos tells me. \n\"In the early stage of the fire we were really struggling, but now this group makes us together, helps us, we can share information.\"\nHe says the get-togethers mean a lot to him, explaining: \"It's like therapy.\"\nOutside of official events, the Ethio-Eritrea Grenfell group meet up regularly to socialise, share information and support each other.\nThey also celebrate each other's festivals together, such as Christmas and Eid.\nThe group's translator, Daniel Beyene, has helped them work with the police and the authorities in the aftermath of the fire.\nDaniel has also guided them through the lengthy, complex and at times technical Grenfell Tower Public Inquiry.\n\"Language is the biggest barrier,\" he says. \n\"You have the loss and then on top of that not understanding the system and not being able to express yourself. It's really hard,\" he says.\nNow, like so many affected by this tragedy, the groups are anxious about what the inquiry's final report and recommendations will contain. \nBedriya says: \"Every day I have attended the inquiry, for the last six years. I am waiting like everybody else what is going to be in that report.\"\nShe adds: \"I hope some sort of justice will be reported.\"\nSadik tells me he hopes the inquiry will prevent anything like this ever happening again. \nHe says: \"As far as we are concerned, we lost our family, we didn't have justice. We are still waiting for justice.\"\nThe report will be made public on 4 September.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The hospital backlog in England has gone up slightly over the past month, latest NHS figures show.\nThe waiting list hit 7.57 million at the end of April, up from 7.54 million the previous month.\nThe numbers waiting for treatment has been a key election issue after the prime minister made it one of his five priorities for government.\nThere had been signs the waiting list was coming down. But despite the rise, it is still lower than the September peak of 7.77 million.\nMore than 300,000 of the waits have been for longer than a year.\nIn many respects the rise in the number of waits is not surprising. The size of the waiting list has in the past fluctuated month-by-month.\nAnd modelling always predicted that once the rapid rises seen since the pandemic hit stopped, there would be a period where the waiting list would remain pretty flat.\nBut in the early weeks of this election campaign, Rishi Sunak has been claiming the waiting list has been falling.\n\nIn other areas, waiting time targets for A&E and ambulance response times also continue to be missed.\nSiva Anandaciva, of the King\u2019s Fund, said the figures show the NHS is under \u201cincredible pressure\u201d despite spring and early summer traditionally being the quieter time of year.\nHe added: \u201cWe are seeing performance challenges that would have been unfathomable 10 years ago.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that the NHS is again at the top of many polls on what matters most to voters, as we head towards a general election.\u201d\nNHS England medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis said demand across the board remained high.\nHe also warned the five-day strike by junior doctors at the end of this month was likely to cause \u201cfurther disruption\u201d.\nIt comes as a report by the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) has warned long waits for cancer care are becoming routine across the UK, with nearly half of all specialist cancer centres experiencing delays most weeks.\nThe RCR report was based on responses from senior managers at 60 specialist cancer centres in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nThe survey, carried out in November 2023, found the number of centres experiencing severe delays had almost doubled in a year.\nManagers at 47% of sites said patients needing chemotherapy and other cancer drugs were facing delays \u201cmost weeks or every week\u201d - up from reports of delays at 28% of sites the previous year.\nCentres reporting weekly delays to radiotherapy also nearly doubled, from 22% in 2022 to 43% in 2023.\nAlmost all clinical directors surveyed said workforce shortages were causing backlogs.\nThe college said there was a \u201cstaggering\u201d 30% shortfall in radiologists and a 15% shortfall in clinical oncologists.\n\u201cWe simply do not have enough doctors to manage the increasing number of patients safely, and this problem will only worsen as demand continues to rise and more doctors leave the NHS,\u201d said RCR president Dr Katharine Halliday.",
    "Jaguar Land Rover says it plans to invest more than \u00a31m to help the police fight vehicle crime in the UK.\nThe money will be used to support police operations in theft hotspots, as well as to fund intelligence gathering.\nEarlier this year, the company\u2019s boss angrily denied reports that Range Rovers were particularly vulnerable to theft.\nHowever, owners have complained that insurers have been hiking their premiums dramatically, or even refusing cover.\nAmong them is Meryl Cabellos, a 41-year-old Frenchman who has lived in the UK for seven years, and works in the technology industry.\nLast year, the cost of insuring his 2017 Range Rover Sport doubled, from \u00a32,000 to \u00a34,000.\nHe then discovered that his insurer would not be able to renew his cover at all this year \u2013 and struggled to find a replacement.\nFaced with a best quote of \u00a310,000, and with the car itself losing value rapidly, he decided to cut his losses and sell it.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been Range Rover customers for many years, and it really feels as though we\u2019re being priced out now,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just really disappointed. We loved the car but because of the insurance the experience of owning it went downhill so quick.\u201d\nInsurance costs can vary considerably, with factors such as the driver\u2019s record and experience, as well as where the car is kept and the security features it contains all taken into account.\nExpensive, luxury cars are often targeted by thieves, because they can be sold abroad at a big profit. That, in turn, can push up premiums.\nFor Jaguar Land Rover, this has become a problem. The company builds a range of premium models, with the Range Rover brand a particular favourite for celebrities, politicians and even royalty.\nThat kind of prestige comes at a cost. The Range Rover starts at \u00a3104,000 while its smaller sibling, the Range Rover Sport, is on sale from \u00a375,000. But embarrassingly for the company, it also has a reputation for being vulnerable to theft.\nEarlier this year, JLR\u2019s chief executive Adrian Mardell condemned reports that suggested the Range Rover was Britain\u2019s \u201cmost stolen vehicle\u201d.\nHe admitted that vehicle theft by organised criminals was a serious issue in the UK, but insisted his own business had been unfairly singled out, and that strenuous efforts had been made to improve vehicle security.\nHe accused the insurance industry of failing to take account of all the available information when setting premiums.\nThe police funding is the latest in a series of moves designed to reassure consumers and attempt to bring down insurance costs.\nLast year, for example, the company set up its own insurance products in an effort to help customers who were unable to obtain cover, though some Range Rover owners claim they have still been unable to obtain quotes.\n\nThe new money, JLR says, will be used to support several police forces \u201cwith additional dedicated resources to respond to vehicle thefts across the country\u201d.\nIt will also help pay for a new national policing unit to gather intelligence on vehicle thefts, and increased police activity at the ports used by criminal gangs to ship cars abroad.\nThe company says it is already sharing information with the police to help them find and recover vehicles, and has provided training to some 650 officers.\nAt the same time, it says it has been working hard to make its vehicles less vulnerable to theft.\nIt cites data from the Police National Computer showing that since January 2022 only 0.2% of new Range Rovers and Range Rover Sports have been stolen.",
    "It is a sign of a changing Northern Ireland.\nOne in every 16 pupils at school here is now a \u2018newcomer\u2019 according to the Department of Education.\nThe term is used to refer to a pupil who is often originally from outside the UK and does not initially speak the same language as their class teacher.\nIn 2023/24, there were nearly 21,000 newcomer pupils accounting for about 6% of the school population. This has risen by about 4,750 pupils since 2018/19.\nThis week some of those newcomers got together in a scheme that one nine-year-old called \"fascinating\".\nIt took place at Stranmillis University College and was put on by the education charity, Saphara. \nSixth formers from local secondary schools provided inclusive games and crafts with primary school pupils to help them feel welcomed.\nThe scheme also brings schools together from both sides of the community in Northern Ireland.\nPrimary five students from Mavern Primary School near the Shankill Road met their peers from St Joseph\u2019s Primary School close to the Falls. \nSixth form students from Assumption Grammar School, Ballynahinch, and Down High School in Downpatrick provided workshops and played games and crafts with the primary school pupils.\nNine-year-old Jonathon said he had \"really enjoyed\" the activities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nice to get to know other pupils,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMy mum and sister are from China, but I was born here. I speak Mandarin and English.\n\u201cThere are a lot of people in my school from different places. My friend Felix is from Thailand. It\u2019s fascinating to learn from these people and get to know more about their culture in school.\u201d\nYasmin, who is also nine years old, says Northern Ireland is \"a nice country with lovely people\".\n\u201cMy mum and dad are from Africa, but they moved here,\" she said.\n\"I was born in Northern Ireland.\u201d \nThe sixth formers taking part in the scheme with Saphara created the workshops and gained new skills like teaching and leadership.\nOne sixth former, 17-year-old Maria, attends Assumption Grammar School and has experienced being a newcomer.\n\u201cI was adopted from Guatemala very young, so I grew up with the language here and our culture,\" she said.\n\"It is amazing to see all these newcomer children who still have their own culture and heritage and they are all getting to experience our culture too.\n\u201cNorthern Ireland is becoming a lot more diverse. I now see a lot more people with the same colour of skin as me. I think it is great for everyone else to grow up with this as I grew up around predominantly white people.\u201d\nAnother sixth former, Ollie, attends Down High School and was helping with the scheme.\n\u201cBringing children together is vital for our society as it introduces different ideas, cultures and languages. By doing so we are creating a friendlier and more diverse Northern Ireland,\u201d Ollie told BBC News NI.\n\"It\u2019s all about belonging and finding a home here,\u201d he added.\nSaphara founder and CEO Dr Christine Burnett said the scheme's goal is to make children feel \"welcomed and part of the community here\".\n\u201cWe want to affirm the value of every child, to help them understand their value and worth,\" she said.\n\u201cHistorically Northern Ireland has been a non-diverse place due to things like the Troubles, so we have not had the benefit and richness of cultural diversity that other places in the UK and Ireland have had.\n\u201cRecently there has been an influx of people from different parts of the world coming to Northern Ireland and this is something which should be welcomed. \n\"We can equip the young people and families coming here to contribute to a fuller and more inclusive Northern Ireland.\"",
    "Sub-postmasters in Scotland who were wrongly convicted as part of the Post Office Horizon scandal have been automatically exonerated.\nEmergency legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament has been given Royal Assent and came into force on Friday.\nIt means anyone convicted of embezzlement, fraud or theft in connection with Post Office business between 1996 and 2018 have had their convictions quashed and are eligible for compensation.\nA law exonerating postmasters in England and Wales was introduced in March.\nThe Post Office Horizon scandal saw 900 sub-postmasters in communities across the UK prosecuted for crimes of dishonesty or forced to balance their books from savings or loans because of a faulty computer system called Horizon.\nIt has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in the UK in recent times. A public inquiry is ongoing.\nIn 2020 the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) - which investigates possible miscarriages of justice - wrote to 73 potential victims of the Horizon scandal in Scotland.\nAs of March 2024, a total of 19 people had come forward in Scotland to ask for their convictions to be reviewed.\nEight of those cases were referred to court. Seven people had already been cleared, including Caren Lorimer who had her conviction posthumously quashed this week. \nIn Scotland the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) had sole responsibility for prosecuting Horizon cases, whereas in England the Post Office could act as prosecutor.\nThe Scottish government, alongside the Crown Office, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission and the Post Office, will notify those affected and ensure police and court records are amended.\nJustice Secretary Angela Constance has written an open letter to sub-postmasters setting out next steps. She said she hopes the legislation \"goes some way to righting the terrible wrongs of the past\".\nShe said: \"Of course, no amount of compensation can fully mend the lives that were torn apart by this miscarriage of justice.\n\u201cI will be writing to those affected to tell them their convictions have been quashed and ensuring court records are changed, so the victims of this scandal can have their good names restored as quickly as possible. They have already waited too long for justice.\u201d",
    "House buyers are putting off purchasing a new home until the Bank of England cuts interest rates, evidence suggests. \nUK housebuilder Crest Nicholson was forced to issue a profit warning after it said sales momentum had softened since Easter due to volatile mortgage rates as well as buyers now expecting borrowing costs to drop later this year.\nMeanwhile, a survey of chartered surveyors found that demand for homes had weakened in May.\nFinancial markets are forecasting that the Bank of England could cut interest rates in August or September.\n\nCrest Nicholson reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a330.9m for the six months to the end of April, including the impact of exceptional costs, compared to a \u00a328.4m profit over the same period last year. \nThe housebuilder said that while \"the spring selling season started well\", it added: \"Momentum has softened slightly since Easter, reflecting the volatility in mortgage rates and the expectation of a base rate reduction coming later in the year than previously expected.\"\nIt added: \"The imminent general election is creating some short-term uncertainty, but this is anticipated to be alleviated in July once the outcome is known.\"\nThe firm now expects adjusted full-year profits of between \u00a322m to \u00a329m. Analysts had expected the company to announce profits of around \u00a338m.\nCrest Nicholson's share price tumbled by nearly 12% to 212.4p.\nA survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) found that demand had weakened in May.\nTarrant Parsons, senior economist at RICS, said a recent recovery in the housing market \"appears to have slipped into reverse of late\" which he blamed on higher mortgage rates in the past couple of months.\nHowever he predicted that this was \"delaying, rather than derailing, a modest improvement going forward\".\n\"Indeed, respondents continue to envisage a more positive trend in sales activity coming through over the year ahead, although this is likely predicated on the Bank of England being able to start lowering interest rates in the coming months.\"\nThose surveyed by RICS said that demand was weakest in both south east and south west England.\nIn contrast, prices were still robust in Scotland and Northern Ireland.",
    "The parents of a baby who died at two weeks old are launching a compensation claim after a coroner ruled that failure to recognise his mother's rare medical condition contributed to their son\u2019s death.\nRobyn and Jonathan Davis from Steyning in West Sussex say they are seeking damages for the physical and mental impact following the death of their baby, Orlando, 14 days after he was born by emergency caesarean at Worthing Hospital in September 2021.\nNew figures obtained by BBC South East show \u00a3143 million has been paid in claims and legal fees for maternity cases on behalf of University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust between 2006/7 and 2022/23.\nDr Tim Taylor, chief of service for the Women and Children\u2019s Division said: \u201cOur sincerest condolences go out to Mr and Mrs Davis, and I would like to repeat our apologies and regret for their devastating loss of Orlando, and any additional distress they experienced as a result of our investigation, or the inquest process.\u201d\n\nAt an inquest in Chichester, West Sussex senior coroner Penelope Schofield found the baby's death was caused by a type of brain damage.\nBut she concluded this was contributed to by neglect, after clinicians failed to recognise that Mrs Davis had developed hyponatremia - a lower than normal level of sodium in the bloodstream - during labour.\nMrs Davis, who is a former midwife, says it has been devastating.\nShe said: \"We feel that we need some compensation for the damage that\u2019s been done to our mental health and our physical health.\n\"I\u2019ve been left with birth injuries that affect me day to day, eventually I will need surgery and I will need a lot of care for that\", she said.\n\"It\u2019s been incredibly traumatic.\"\nMr Davis said making a civil claim was a way \"to get the trust to put their hands up and say they have failed you\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the families that have to push that and that\u2019s why it\u2019s such a broken and sickening system.\u201d\nNew figures from NHS Resolution show the NHS has paid out money in relation to 180 obstetrics cases at the Sussex trust between 2006/7 and 2022/23.\nThe figure includes pay-outs at both Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust and Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, before they merged in 2021.\nDr Taylor said: \"Any occasion where a child or mother suffers harm is one too many.\n\"We realise how traumatic it is for a family to go through this, and our heartfelt sympathies go out to them.\n\"In recent years our teams have made significant improvements in the ways they work - a stronger triage system, investing in 40 more midwives, and providing urgent appointments for medically complex cases - so that mothers-to-be, children and mothers are safe in our care.\u201d\nBBC South East's health correspondent, Mark Norman, said: \"The Sussex trust has one of the largest maternity units in the country and compared to other trusts does not have an unusually high number of claims  or indeed the value of claims.\"\nHe said the trust says the outcomes for mothers and babies at its hospitals are better than most others across England. \n\"Statistically it has seen significant reductions in neonatal deaths and still births in the last year.\"\nHe added: \"But statistics and not going to comfort grieving and broken families who feel they  are not being dealt in a way that acknowledges their pain.\"\nAt least 137 cases have also been settled at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, which was the subject of a public inquiry into maternity failings.\nBBC South East discovered 40 pay-outs at the two trusts related to stillbirths, and 36 cases, totalling \u00a3106 million, went into covering the costs of babies born with cerebral palsy.\nNationally NHS Resolution said obstetric claims accounted for 13% of clinical claims reported in 2022/23 but made up 64% of those claims by value.\nStaci Liversedge, a clinical negligence lawyer who has represented families in East Kent, said compensation can cover the long-term needs of the children affected.\nSarah Hayes, Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer, at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust said:\n\u201cWe recognise the immeasurable impact on families when mistakes are made. The impact of these outcomes can never be altered and for this we are truly sorry.\n\u201cWe would always encourage any families who have any ongoing concerns to contact us.\u201d\nLast month an inquiry into traumatic childbirths called for an overhaul of the UK\u2019s maternity and postnatal care.\nThe inquiry found poor care was \u201call-too-frequently tolerated as normal\u201d. \nThe Conservatives say they are investing an additional \u00a335 million over the next three years to improve NHS maternity safety through further training.\nThe Labour Party says it is committed to increasing the number of midwives and will also improve training and change the culture where mothers aren't being listened to and where staff are afraid to speak up for fear of repercussions.\u201d\nThe Liberal Democrats say they plan to ensure maternity care is properly prioritised.\nAn NH",
    "Outside the town hall in the historic centre of Munich, a stirring rendition of the national anthem strikes up.\nIt\u2019s a musical display that sparks a crescendo of warm applause among the intrigued Bavarian locals who\u2019ve stopped to appreciate it.\nBut the solitary musician is not German. He\u2019s Scottish. And his instrument is a bagpipe.\nIndeed, you could be hard pushed to find a German entirely happy to perform their own anthem like this. Brash or impromptu displays of tuneful public patriotism aren\u2019t very German.\nHowever, this melodic interlude neatly reflects how visiting football fans are energising and giving a prompt to their hosts who have, so far, seemed somewhat apathetic to the party they\u2019re about to throw this summer.\nResearchers have put it down to a combination of eight years without a win in the knockout stages of an international tournament for the men\u2019s team, the high price of tickets and also a wider national malaise.\nGermany\u2019s politics are increasingly fragmented and fractious with clashes within the coalition government, and economic growth is sluggish at best.\nWhat the country really needs is another \u201cSommerm\u00e4rchen\u201d - a summer fairy-tale.\nThis is the label that was lovingly attributed to the summer of 2006, when Germany hosted the men\u2019s World Cup.\nWhile today most Germans would still raise an eyebrow at an impromptu street performance of their anthem, 2006 was notable in that fans waved flags with carefree joy. \nPreviously, many had felt deeply uncomfortable displaying national colours - a legacy of the country\u2019s troubled 20th Century.\nThe home team was knocked out in the semi-final 18 years ago, but not before capturing the public imagination. This, in turn, showcased to the world a united, colourful and more confident country.\n\u201cEverybody hopes for a Sommerm\u00e4rchen 2.0 with the happy mood of 2006 returning in 2024, but I am sceptical,\u201d says leading football journalist Philipp K\u00f6ster.\nHe identifies a number of reasons why he feels like this.\n\"It\u2019s a different situation, we\u2019ve got the war in Ukraine, we just went through the pandemic, society is torn, people don\u2019t know what direction they should take.\"\nGermany\u2019s ruling three-way coalition, that assumed power in 2021, has passed key legislation, but perpetual bickering has made it unpopular.\nAt the same time, the far-right anti-immigration AfD has been picking up support and scored an unprecedented success, coming second at last weekend\u2019s European Parliament elections.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see if this tournament makes people come together, turn into good hosts and maybe find some direction themselves,\u201d says Philipp K\u00f6ster.\nThere\u2019s plenty of direction at ESV Freimann football club in the north of Munich.\nIt comes from the legions of volunteer coaches dispensing vocal encouragement to the many dozens of young players who are training on the impeccably kept grass.\nMore than 300 children play here every week with 18 teams in all. The women\u2019s side is currently the most successful.\nIf the appetite for Euro 2024 is wanting among many German adults, the teenagers here buck the trend. They\u2019re revelling in the prospect of being hosts.\n\u201cI think it will bring people together because it\u2019s something we share as a community because so many people love football,\u201d says 14-year-old Samuel.\nBut he doesn\u2019t believe Germany are good enough to win the tournament.\nIt\u2019s a view shared by his teammate Ryan, although he predicts the impact of a home victory would be massive.\n\u201cIf the Germans win, then many more people will play the game and that\u2019s a really good thing. But I just can\u2019t believe this is all happening where I live.\u201d\nFor the national organisers, the safety and security of all the fans is the number one priority.\nEuro 2024 takes place at a time of increased international tension, as a result of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the renewed conflict in the Middle East.\nOutside police HQ in central Munich, I meet Deputy Commissioner Michael Dibowski.\nFrom his base here, he will command operations around the six matches being held in the city over the next month.\nHe says his aim is to ensure every fan has as much fun as possible, but his team is preparing for every type of threat one may expect at such a high-profile event.\n\u201cDuring the last weeks we've had some postings on social media from the Islamic State,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWe checked these posts but we don\u2019t expect a concrete danger. It\u2019s possible that someone could be motivated by this post, so we have to be here, present and prepared.\u201d\nGermany has seen a number of politically motivated attacks recently.\nEarlier this month, a police officer was stabbed to death in Mannheim, in the south-west of the country, as a far-right gathering was taking place.\nWith much of the preparation until now taking place away from the public gaze, it may be understandable to some extent that collective excitement isn\u2019t yet at fever pitch.\nAnd it\u2019s worth remembering that in the run-up to Germany\u2019s golden summer of 2006, there wasn\u2019t much o",

    "A hospital trust is to pay out more than \u00a329m in compensation to the family of a baby girl who suffered \"catastrophic\" injuries due to medical negligence. \nStockport NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Stepping Hill Hospital in the town, admitted failings by its staff had left the infant with cerebral palsy. \nThe sum is believed to be the second largest settlement ever agreed by the NHS in a medical negligence case, according to the family's lawyers. \nThe trust said it had offered its \"sincere apologies\" to the family and said \"many improvements\" had been made in the years since the baby was born. \nThe baby, who is subject to an anonymity order, was born seemingly healthy but began showing signs of distress a short time later. \nAccording to her family's legal team, hospital staff made a \"series of negligent omissions\" and there was a delay in performing surgery. \nAs part of the settlement, handed down at the High Court in London, the trust accepted breach of duty and causation. \nBarrister Bill Braithwaite KC, who acted for the family, said they had \"waited a number of years\" for a trial before the trust agreed to settle the case. \n\"This young girl\u2019s life has changed forever and the impact on the whole family has been devastating,\" he said. \nYasmin Ameer, from Nockolds Solicitors, said it had been \"an honour\" to represent the family. \nShe said the settlement was \"hugely important\" for someone whose life had been \"irreversibly damaged\".\nThe firm said it had also secured \u00a32.13m in interim payments as the case progressed, enabling the family to buy a more suitable home and a rehabilitation package. \nChris Allen, who was junior counsel in the case, said: \"The family have always conducted themselves with such dignity and resilience in the most challenging of circumstances, and I am truly delighted that we have been able to secure a settlement which ensures all of the claimant\u2019s future needs are provided for.\"\nA statement for the trust read: \"We hope that the settlement will provide the family with some comfort and reassurance for the future and will help with the care and other support that they need.\u201d\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A group of anglers have bought a four-mile stretch of the River Ericht in Perthshire, to try and improve water conditions that are harming endangered salmon.\nThe river, which runs through the town of Blairgowrie, is a key spawning tributary in the River Tay system.\nBut the Blairgowrie Rattray and District Angling Association (BRDAA), who have been fishing in the area for a century, says there is a history of water extraction for industrial purposes and salmon stocks are falling due to low water levels.\nThe club hopes their buy-out from previous owner Macpherson Fishing will increase their lobbying power to the Scottish government.\nSalmon stocks are falling in rivers across the country with rod catch numbers at their lowest level since 1952, according to the latest Scottish government figures.\nThe River Ericht however has a problem with water abstractions which make it more difficult for the fish to swim upstream - as low waters make stressed fish more susceptible to predators such as birds.\nThe BRDAA said use of the river by mill lades and a fish farm over time has reduced flows along with Victorian-age weirs which are now falling into disrepair, starving the river of water in dry spells.\nFollowing the official handover of the four-mile stretch of river on Saturday, the group said it would leave \"no stone unturned\" to help species recovery on the Ericht - which is part of a European Special Area of Conservation for salmon.\nAnglers in the group carry out a range of work on the river each year, from litter picks and tree planting to managing invasive species on the river banks.\nThey also monitor salmon stock and, now that they own a larger stretch of the river, they expect their data will give them greater clout when making arguments to the Scottish government.\nThe BRDAA said it had been \"encouraged\" by catches to date this year, with 38 landed from the Ericht and returned to the water mostly during the key spring run.\nBut river convener Grant Kellie, who is also a member of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association's fishing group, said he had seen salmon stranded and dying on the Ericht.\nHe said: \"Water abstraction has a detrimental effect on the movement of fish, whether juveniles or adult salmon heading upstream so we need to keep the flows more regular.\n\u201cThis is not just an issue on the Ericht. I believe there are about 260 rivers in Scotland which all have issues preventing the easy passage of migratory fish.\n\"The Scottish government needs to step up at this moment in time and get this implemented so we can get the fish back to where they should be. \n\"The national salmon strategy is not working, at the moment.\n\"Now that salmon are on the endangered list, how long does the species have?\u201d\nThe club, which started in 1924 to encourage angling in the area now has around 300 members and officials are hopeful that, with action, there can be rejuvenation.\nThe four miles of the river were officially handed over during a ceremony on the banks on Saturday, with Jamie Macpherson of Macpherson Fishing taking the first ceremonial cast.\nGeorge Thomson from the SGA Fishing Group, said: \u201cBRDAA deserves great credit for taking this step at a critical time for our salmon. It demonstrates the passion hard working local people have for the species and a way of life.\u201d\nThe Scottish government has been contacted for comment.",

    "Leaders of the world's seven richest nations - including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - are gathering in Italy to decide what to do to about the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Ukraine. \nThe G7 summit will also involve leaders from Africa and the Indo-Pacific region, and will discuss economic co-operation with developing countries. \nThe G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called \"advanced\" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. \nThey are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. \nRussia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014 for its takeover of Crimea.\nChina has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's second-largest population. \nIts relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are.\nBoth these nations are in the G20 group of developed and developing nations.\nThe EU is not a member of the G7, but attends the annual summits. \nThroughout the year, G7 ministers and officials hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events.\nItaly has the G7 presidency in 2024. \nThe 2024 G7 summit will be held from 13 to 15 June in Apulia, in Italy. \nIt will be the first major international forum hosted by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, since she took office in October 2022.\nAs well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Italy says it wants the summit to focus on Africa and migration, economic security, and international co-operation on artificial intelligence (AI). \nBetween them, the G7 nations have already imposed on Russia the biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy.\nThey have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system. \nG7 and EU nations have also frozen about $325bn (\u00a3254bn) of Russian financial assets which were held in their territories, such as the foreign currency reserves of Russia's central bank.\nThe G7 nations are now working on a scheme to take the interest those assets have earned and pass it to Ukraine in the form of a loan. This could amount to $50bn.\nOn 3 June, G7 leaders all backed the plan put forward by US President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza.\nHe has proposed an immediate ceasefire by Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages, an increase in aid for Gaza and a peace deal which guarantees Israel's security and the safety of Gazan residents.\nItaly says \"the relationship with developing nations and emerging economies will be central\" to the G7 summit, and that it \"will work to build a co-operation model based on mutually beneficial partnerships\".\nIt has invited leaders from 12 developing countries in Africa, South America and the Indo-Pacific region. \nUnder the the Mattei Plan, Italy will give grants and loans worth 5.5bn euros (\u00a34.6bn) to several African countries, to help develop their economies.\nThe scheme would also position Italy as an energy hub, building gas and hydrogen pipelines between Africa and Europe.\nHowever, many commentators suspect it may be a cover for Italy to crack down on further migration from Africa.\nItaly is asking other nations to contribute financially to the scheme.\nAs the G7's president in 2023, Japan pushed for the group to draw up a plan for international economic security.\nThe G7 adopted an anti-coercion pact, designed to stop countries such as China and Russia using their economic strength to impose their will on others. \nIn December 2023, Italy pulled out of the Belt and Road Initiative - a scheme to expand China's ports and transport routes worldwide to boost trade. \nMs Meloni said that joining had been \"a serious mistake\". The US has called the initiative \"debt-trap diplomacy\" on China's part.\nIt is thought that the US is keen for G7 leaders to take further action on economic security at the summit in Italy.  \nThe safety of AI was raised at the 2023 summit in Japan and resulted in the Hiroshima AI Process, intended to promote \"safe, secure, and trustworthy AI worldwide\". \nHowever, this was only a collection of voluntary measures. \nThe G7 summit may look at drawing up further international regulations for AI safety, building on the AI Act adopted by the EU and the US president's executive order on AI.\nThe G7 cannot pass laws. However, some of its past decisions have had global effects.\nFor example, the G7 played a crucial role in setting up a global fund to fight malaria and Aids in 2002.\nAhead of the 2021 G7 summit in the UK, the group's finance ministers agreed to make multinational companies pay more tax.\nIt has also provided financial aid to developing countries, and taken steps to tackle climate change.

    "Every major English water company has reported data suggesting they've discharged raw sewage when the weather is dry - a practice which is potentially illegal.\nWater companies can release untreated sewage into rivers and seas when it rains to prevent it flooding homes, but such spills are illegal when it's dry. \nOn dry days there is less dilution and sewage can cause more damage to the local environment and pose a health risk to swimmers.\nSewage spills into England's rivers and seas by water companies more than doubled in 2023.\nAccording to the Environment Agency, there were 3.6 million hours of spills, compared to 1.75 million hours in 2022.\nWater UK, the industry body for sewerage companies, said this was \"unacceptable\", but argued that the record levels were due to heavy rain and increased data collection.\nHowever, the Environment Agency said that increased rainfall does not override water companies' responsibility \"to manage storm overflows in line with legal requirements\".\nSome environmental charities blame water companies for a failure to fix leaky pipes and other damaged infrastructure - and criticise the regulator for not forcing them to act. \nMost of the UK has a combined sewerage system, meaning that both rainwater and wastewater - from toilets, bathrooms and kitchens - are carried in the same pipes.\nWastewater is usually sent to a sewage treatment works.\nBut capacity can sometimes be exceeded during heavy rainfall, especially if dry ground cannot quickly absorb large quantities of water. \nThis could lead to inundation of sewage works and potential flooding of homes, roads and open spaces. \nThe system is therefore designed to overflow occasionally, and discharge excess wastewater into the sea and rivers. \nThis is called combined sewer overflows (CSOs).\nHowever, according to the BBC there is evidence that some water companies are potentially spilling sewage when it is not raining. \nWithout rainwater to dilute the waste, this can lead to higher concentrations of sewage entering waterways - and is therefore illegal.\nThe BBC has examined spill data sent by the nine sewage companies from 2022 to the Environment Agency and cross-referenced it with rainwater. The results of the BBC's analysis suggest there may have been dry spills starting on more than 200 days in 2022 lasting over 29,000 hours - including during the record summer heatwave when people were cooling off in England's rivers and seas. \nTo confirm this has happened the Environment Agency says they carry out further checks and visit the sites where the spills may have taken place.\nThe BBC also found that untreated sewage was illegally released into Lake Windermere in the Lake District in February 2024 after a fault. \nWater companies which are found to have breached the rules by spilling on dry days or failing to meet other conditions can be fined or prosecuted. \nIn April 2023 the Conservative government announced a plan to improve water quality.\nAs part of this, it said polluters could face unlimited fines in the future which would be re-invested into a new Water Restoration Fund which aims to improve water quality. \nSix months later Water UK, the industry body, announced plans on behalf of its members to almost double spending to pay for upgrades and cut sewage discharges. \nIt said this would be the \"most ambitious modernisation of sewers since the Victorian era\", but that customer bills would have to rise by \u00a3156 a year to cover the cost.\nThis week the UK's political parties released their manifestos including their proposals for the sewage industry. \nSteve Reed, Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told the BBC that a Labour government would \"put the water companies under special measures to force them to clean up their act\".  \n \"We will give the regulator tough new powers to make law-breaking water bosses face criminal charges and ban the payment of their multi-million pound bonuses until they clean up their toxic filth,\" he added.\nThe Liberal Democrats have said they will introduce a sewage tax on water company targets and set legally binding targets to prevent sewage dumping bathing waters and \"highly sensitive nature sites by 2030\".\nSian Berry, parliamentary candidate for the Green Party told the BBC: \"Private water companies have failed to invest, resulting in sewage leaks and run-off at record levels. It's made our coastlines and inland waterways filthy and unhealthy when they should be clean and safe.\"\nThe BBC has approached Reform for comment on this issue.\nIn May 2024, a team of the UK's top engineers and scientists warned of the growing public health risk from human faeces in the country's rivers, and called for more regular testing.\nThe presence of faeces can expose people to bacteria such as salmonella and E.coli, which cause diarrhoea and vomiting, or viruses like hepatitis A which can lead to liver infection.\nAlso in May, thousands of residents in Devon were told to drink bottled water after their ",
    "In April last year, Sudan was thrown into disarray when its army and a powerful paramilitary group began a vicious struggle for power.\nThe war, which continues to this day, has claimed more than 15,000 lives. And in what the United Nations has called one of the world's \"largest displacement crises\", about nine million people have been forced to flee their homes.\nThere have been warnings of genocide regarding the western region of Darfur, where residents say they have been targeted by fighters based on their ethnicity.\nHere is what you need to know.\nSudan is in north-east Africa and is one of the largest countries on the continent, covering 1.9 million sq km (734,000 sq miles).\nThe population of Sudan is predominantly Muslim and the country's official languages are Arabic and English.\nEven before the war started, Sudan was one the poorest countries in the world. Its 46 million people were in 2022 living on an average annual income of $750 (\u00a3600) a head.\nThe conflict has made things much worse. Last year, the economy shrunk by 40%, Sudan's finance minister said.\nAfter the 2021 coup, a council of generals ran Sudan, led by the two military men at the centre of this dispute:\nThey disagreed on the direction the country was going in and the proposed move towards civilian rule.\nThe main sticking points were plans to include the 100,000-strong RSF into the army, and who would then lead the new force.\nThe suspicions were that both generals wanted to hang on to their positions of power, unwilling to lose wealth and influence.\nThe RSF was formed in 2013 and has its origins in the notorious Janjaweed militia that brutally fought rebels in Darfur, where they were accused of ethnic cleansing against the region's non-Arabic population.\nSince then, Gen Dagalo has built a powerful force that has intervened in conflicts in Yemen and Libya. He has also developed economic interests including controlling some of Sudan's gold mines.\nBefore the current conflict erupted, the RSF had been accused of human rights abuses, including the massacre of more than 120 protesters in June 2019.\nSuch a strong force outside the army has been seen as a source of instability in the country.\nShooting between the two sides began on 15 April 2023 following days of tension as members of the RSF were redeployed around the country in a move that the army saw as a threat.\nThere had been some hope that talks could resolve the situation but these never happened.\nIt is disputed who fired the first shot but the fighting swiftly escalated in different parts of the country.\nThis fighting is the latest episode in bouts of tension that followed the 2019 ousting of long-serving President Omar al-Bashir, who came to power in a coup in 1989.\nThere were huge street protests calling for an end to his near-three decade rule and the army mounted a coup to get rid of him.\nBut civilians continued to campaign for the introduction of democracy.\nA joint military-civilian government was then established but that was overthrown in another coup in October 2021, when Gen Burhan took over.\nAnd since then the rivalry between Gen Burhan and Gen Dagalo has intensified.\nA framework deal to put power back in the hands of civilians was agreed in December 2022 but talks to finalise the details failed.\nWhen it began, the conflict appeared to be around the control of key installations.\nHowever, much of it is now happening in urban areas and civilians have become unwitting victims.\nThe RSF captured much of the capital, Khartoum, and Darfur.\nThe military controls most of the north and the east, including the key Red Sea port of Port Sudan.\nIn a major blow to the army, the RSF seized the strategic city of Wad Madani in December, along with much of the surrounding Gezira state. Hundreds and thousands of civilians were forced to flee the city, which had become a hub for humanitarian services and a refuge for those who had escaped conflict in other parts of the country.\nIn February, the army recaptured the centre of Omdurman, one of three cities along the River Nile that form Sudan's wider capital, Khartoum. It regained control of the state broadcaster there - a symbolic breakthrough for the army.\nAttention is now on el-Fasher, the last major urban centre in Darfur that is still held by the army. The RSF has laid siege to the city, causing hundreds of casualties, overwhelming hospitals and blocking food supplies.\nAs well as sparking major displacement, both sides in the conflict have been accused of war crimes.\nWhen leaving his post in September, UN envoy to Sudan Volker Perthes accused the RSF of committing sexual violence, looting and killings in areas it controls. He also condemned the Sudanese armed forces for indiscriminate aerial bombings.\nDuring the early days of the war, the BBC found that both sides had launched airstrikes and artillery fire at hospitals while patients were still in the building and doctors have also been singled out for attack. Both acts are potential war crimes.\nTh",
    "A teacher who was sacked after her menopause symptoms worsened during a dispute about moving to a different school base has been awarded more than \u00a360,000 for unfair dismissal.\nAllison Shearer, who worked with pupils with additional needs, won her employment tribunal in Glasgow against South Lanarkshire Council.\nShe had told the head teacher she did not want to move to a school with high levels of violence because she feared it would increase her blood pressure and menopause symptoms. \nThe court heard the English teacher's health concerns were ignored and she was later sacked. \nMs Shearer, who was based at Clydesdale Support Base in Carluke, was told she would be moved to Kear School in Blantyre after she disagreed with a plan to allow a pupil with asthma to vape in every class. \nHead teacher Neil Govan, who leads both schools within the Kear Campus group,  told staff that supervising the underage pupil while vaping was part of the \"duty of care owed by teaching staff to pupils\", the tribunal heard. \nHowever, the tribunal found there was no evidence to support the claim that moving Mrs Shearer out of her role at that school was a \u201cpunishment beating\u201d for her objection to supervising vaping. \nMs Shearer - who was taking prescribed medication for menopause symptoms, high blood pressure, anxiety and low mood - became extremely anxious about the planned move, the hearing heard.\n\"She believed that there were high levels of violence and injuries to teaching staff at that school, that management were ineffective and authoritarian, and that there was a culture of blaming staff for being assaulted,\" tribunal documents said. \nThe tribunal said Ms Shearer had \"regular nightmares and disrupted sleep\" and \"found it difficult to think about anything except the move to Kear School\u201d.\nThe tribunal found Mr Govan's response to an occupational health report into Ms Shearer's situation to be \"a dismissive, intransigent and unhelpful\".\nShe was sacked while on sick leave after refusing an \"ultimatum\"  which gave her four days notice to agree to moving to a permanent supply teaching role, or into a  school for pupils with severe disabilities, which she felt she was unqualified for.\nMs Shearer had been based at the Clydesdale Secondary Support Base between 2015 and 2022, teaching English to Higher level, and maths and health and wellbeing to SQA National 5 level. \nShe was replaced by a primary supply teacher when she was removed from that post.\nKear Campus - South Lanarkshire Council\u2019s group of schools for pupils with additional social, emotional and behaviour needs - provides full and part-time education across several bases in the county. \nThe court heard pupils at Kear School in Blantyre were those \"most likely to exhibit distressed behaviour through violence, causing damage to property or attending under the influence of drugs, alcohol or other substances\". \nIt had more than 20 teachers and support staff and could take 60 full-time secondary students, but attendance was normally between six and 20 pupils, the court said. \nThe judge said that \u201cno reasonable employer would have insisted\u201d that Shearer teach at Kear, given the effect of that proposal on her health\nIn awarding Ms Shearer \u00a361,074.55 for unfair dismissal, loss of earnings and compensation for injury to feelings, the court said she was a \"talented, experienced and successful teacher of English\" who would be able to find another job near her home in East Renfrewshire.",

    "A London GP says blood tests are being delayed as staff are asked to process only \"clinically critical\" samples following a cyber attack that he says has had a \"massive effect\" on pathology services in the capital. \nThe attack on IT systems at firm Synnovis has affected King's College Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' - including the Royal Brompton and the Evelina London Children's Hospital - as well as primary care services.\nDr Abdul Kamali, says the NHS is \"planning\" and \"prioritising\" patient care, adding: \"We've coped through Covid which was a major situation so hopefully we will get through this.\"\nSynnovis said it had \"put additional resources in place\" so that urgent samples received from GPs or hospitals could be processed \"within appropriate timeframes\".\nA critical incident was declared on 4 June after the incident affected the delivery of services such as blood transfusions and test results.\nOn Monday, Synnovis said in an email to GP and primary care services that it could only process 400 blood samples a day from the impacted trusts.\n\"For the time being we can only accept samples which the requesting clinician considers to be \u2018clinically critical\u2019,\" it said.\n\"As experts, your clinical view of what is considered \u2018critical\u2019 will be accepted by the laboratory, but we urge you to apply this definition carefully, given the severe capacity limitations we are facing.\"\nSynnovis' email added it was unable to track tests that have not been processed and could not respond to individual queries about the status of samples.\n\"If you have a patient you consider to be critical, but you haven\u2019t received a test result for them, please repeat their blood test and send it to us marked \u2018critical\u2019 so that we can process it,\" it said in the email.\nDr Kamali, who works in east and south London, told BBC Radio London: \"Doing a test and having to repeat it has an impact on resources.\n\"Without tests results, diagnoses can't be made, treatments can't be given, so it has had a massive impact for patients coming into the surgery as well as going to hospital.\n\"We have had patients who have been to the hospital on Monday and they've waited for many hours and the results are not coming back.\"\n\nHe added: \"They've had to come back to us the following day and try to repeat this test.\n\"It's all about planning, communication with the patients and prioritising.\"\nProf Dee Thiruchelvam, chief nursing officer at NHS Blood and Transplant, said manual checks of blood took longer to process than the computerised system.\nShe told BBC Radio London: \"In a situation where you do not know a patient's blood type, the safest blood type to give is O negative, which is the universal blood type. \n\"The other alternative is O positive if they're male or a woman over child-bearing years.\n\"We use about three units of blood every minute in the NHS. So during our circumstances at the moment, we are needing a lot more O negative and O positive.\"\nShe said there had been a \"fantastic response\" to the call for blood donors in London.\n\n\"Patient safety is key, which is why we're calling for new donors to come forward to help.\n\"We're going to continue to need donations in the coming weeks and months, because we need blood 365 days a year.\"\nA spokesperson for Synnovis confirmed that after the cyber-attack, some unprocessed blood samples were discarded as they were \"no longer suitable for analysis\".\n\"Our team is currently working with the trusts and GPs to determine which samples will be affected and the process for informing patients,\" they said.\n\"We understand and apologise for any distress this may cause patients who have to re-test.\"\nThe cyber-attack is believed to have been carried out by a Russian group calling themselves Qilin.\nMeanwhile, Home secretary James Cleverly told BBC London the UK had \"very strong cyber defences\".\nHe said: \"The events recently show us that we need to be constantly vigilant and we need to be constantly liaising with our international partners.\n\"The threat is constantly evolving and our defences against those threats are also constantly evolving.\n\"Of course we are investigating what's going on whilst also making sure we defend ourselves against future such attacks.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An art student said it was \"totally unexpected\" when his portrait of football manager Kieran McKenna was signed by the subject himself.\nAndy, 16, discovered nine years ago he had a passion for drawing before he moved from China to Ipswich to pursue his studies. \nFollowing Ipswich Town Football Club's (ITFC) recent promotion to the Premier League, Andy decided he would undertake a portrait of McKenna - but never expected he would see it.\nHe said McKenna's reaction had helped \"encourage\" him in his artwork.\n\"ITFC got promoted and it's such a big moment for all of us in Ipswich to celebrate and Kieran McKenna is our hero so I decided to draw him,\" Andy explained. \nWhile Andy admitted he was not a big football fan, he said he was aware of how much of a \"brilliant\" manager McKenna is.\n\"My art teacher came up with the idea that we could do a timelapse of me drawing,\" he continued.\n\"I didn't expect for [McKenna] to see it himself and it was totally unexpected.\n\"I just feel very excited.

    "A man who killed a female friend in her own flat has been jailed.\nAnthony Green, 51, of County Close, Beeston, Nottinghamshire, was originally charged with Ruth Hufton's murder.\nThe 46-year-old, who lived in a flat on the same street, was found dead on 25 September last year, after concerns were raised by her family.\nJailing Green for 12 years for manslaughter, Judge James Sampson said no sentence \"can right this grievous and devastating wrong\".\nGreen, wearing a white shirt and dark trousers, appeared at Nottingham Crown Court on Thursday for sentencing.\nHe had admitted killing Ms Hufton by tying a scarf around her neck and leaving her unconscious on a bed in her flat.\nHe was initially charged with murder, but on 10 May his guilty plea to manslaughter was accepted by prosecutors.\nMary Prior KC said Ms Hufton had been killed by \"a significant and sustained pressure\" being applied to her neck with the scarf.\nShe added: \"Ruth would've suffered fear and terror before she fell unconscious. He did nothing [to help] and must have watched her die.\"\nGreen was seen on CCTV coming and going from the flat several times on 21 September.\nHe then locked the front door and took her phone, keys, and other possessions.\nMs Hufton's mother Margaret called police four days later due to \"a mother's instinct\" something was wrong.\nThe court heard Ms Hufton had once been a \u201chappy, young woman\u201d whose life took a downward turn when she became addicted to Class A drugs.\nIn a statement, her family said: \"She was a beautiful, intelligent, strong-willed, determined and gifted person whose life was cruelly taken from her.\n\u201cShe could speak multiple languages, having once worked in the Army as a linguist in the Royal Signals. She could also communicate in sign language.\n\u201cTo hear the words she had died in such awful circumstances was truly devastating.\n\u201cGreen\u2019s callous and malicious actions in taking Ruth\u2019s life and leaving her for several days \u2013 as well as stealing her possessions \u2013 makes him beyond redemption.\"\nWhen Green was arrested by police he initially denied any involvement in her death.\nIn mitigation it was said he had been under the influence of Class A drugs at the time and that his guilty plea demonstrated remorse.\nJudge Sampson said: \"It's clear your only thoughts were for yourself.

You gave a lying account in interview - there is no remorse in that.\"\nGreen will serve eight years - two thirds of his sentence - before being considered for release on licence.\nDet Insp Kaz Smithson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: \u201cThis was a painstaking inquiry that involved trawling through many hours of CCTV footage, forensic work and analysis of mobile phone data.

    "The source of a mystery humming sound which has plagued people living in Omagh may now have been identified \u2013 but is not being made public.\nPeople in the County Tyrone town first started to report a persistent humming that was keeping them them awake in the second half of last year.\nA Fermanagh and Omagh District Council investigation has now ended.\nJohn Boyle, the council\u2019s director of community and wellbeing, said it had been \u201ccomplex\u201d but had been able to \u201chone in on a specific spot\u201d.\nMr Boyle said the noise \u201cwasn\u2019t audible every night\", and was linked to atmospheric conditions, making the investigation very difficult.\n\u201cWe were able to hone in on a specific spot, and undertook a targeted screening exercise with a number of industrial businesses using equipment on a 24-hour basis,\" he said.\n\u201cHowever, a particular premises became the focus, and environmental health officers engaged with the management.\n\u201cWhile nothing was absolutely concluded, the noise did cease in a sense, but we will keep the complaint open and under review over the next number of months.\"\nHe told the council\u2019s regeneration and community committee the council had received a total of 11 hum complaints.\nBack in April, Mr Boyle told the same committee that unless there \u201care formal, public legal proceedings, we would not be naming the source of that noise\u201d.\nAlan Rodgers, a journalist with the Ulster Herald, said that people in Omagh were \u201cwaking up in the middle of the night and were hearing this humming sound\u201d.\nHe said that it \u201cwasn\u2019t just specific to one particular area of the town\u201d and was \u201cvery frustrating\u201d to people who didn\u2019t know where it was coming from.\nMr Rodgers said that the council began an investigation into the source of the noise, \u201cbut initially they couldn\u2019t find a definitive source for it\u201d.\n\u201cThis was a very real fear for people\u2026 would they ever get a good night\u2019s sleep again?\u201d\nHe said that the hum \u201cseems to have died down\u201d in recent months but added that the council had warned that the sound may return in the autumn.\n\u201cThankfully for now people seem to be getting a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d Mr Rodgers said.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI on Thursday, one Omagh resident said the hum \u201ccaused a bit of disturbance but it didn\u2019t really hurt anybody\u201d.\n\u201cIt was a bit of gossip, that\u2019s what it was,\u201d he said.\nAnother resident said the council should \u201cof course\u201d tell people where the noise was coming from.\n\u201cWhy would they keep it secret?\u201d she asked.",
    "The family of Harry Dunn, the motorcyclist killed outside an airbase by an American woman, has called for a public inquiry.\nAn inquest into the 19-year-old's death at RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire concluded that he died as a result of a road traffic collision.\nThe coroner called for driver training to be given to US personnel working in the UK.\nMr Dunn's family criticised the driver, Anne Sacoolas, who was driving on the wrong side of the road in August 2019, for not attending the inquest. A representative of Sacoolas declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. \nEven though the inquest has now finished, the fight for justice is not yet over for Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles.\nShe said: \"We need a public inquiry to really give us all of the answers to why we were snubbed by the UK government at the very beginning. We went through hell with them and we want to know why.\n\"We want to make sure that no other family goes through what we went through, with feeling like our own government were not there to help us.\"\nShe wrote to the prime minister at the time, Boris Johnson, to urge him to meet with her family after Sacoolas returned to the US claiming diplomatic immunity following the crash.\nThe mother described the inquest as \"one of the worst weeks since actually losing Harry\".\nShe explained it was difficult listening to a \"barrage and a tsunami of medical reports\" that are now \"etched onto that shattered heart like a tattoo\".\nMs Charles added: \"On the other side of that, we as a family, I think, feel really proud of the point that we have got to and all we achieved for Harry now.\n\"This whole inquest this week is definitely giving us more hope for the future that actually we can start to move forward now.\n\"We've got a lot of work to do on ourselves, I think we're going to be reaching out possibly for more help, but we feel we are in a position to do that.\"\nMs Charles was also highly critical of Sacoolas's decision not to attend the inquest despite being invited to do so.\nShe did not come to the UK for previous court hearings, choosing instead to appear via video link.\nShe was sentenced in December 2022 to eight months in prison, suspended for a year, for causing death by careless driving.\nMs Charles said: \"I'm disgusted. I think she could have used this week to redeem herself in some small way and she just chose to hide again.\"\nSacoolas sent a statement to the coroner apologising for her \"tragic mistake\" which she would \"live with every single day for the rest of my life\".\nThe Northamptonshire coroner, Anne Pember, used her powers to issue three Prevention of Future Deaths notices at the end of the inquest. \nShe urged the UK government to look into pressures on the ambulance service and the US government to introduce driver training for their employees in the UK.\nThe family's spokesman, Radd Seiger, said: \"There's a complete failure to assess the risks of bringing all those Americans here to our rural country roads.\"\nHe added that the US government had been invited to the inquest to explain why civilian employees did not get driver training even though military personnel did, but the US did not send a representative.\nHe said: \"Imagine being invited by His Majesty's coroner to come and explain yourselves and effectively thumbing their nose at her, it's extraordinary.\"\nA representative of Sacoolas declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. \nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \"The decision on if a public inquiry takes place would have to be made by the next government.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A replica build of the famous Sutton Hoo burial ship could have to be paused following a dispute. \nA group of volunteers behind the \u00a31.5m reconstruction of the boat in Suffolk have until July to cut back their use of their base to 40%.\nThe Sutton Hoo Ship's Company (SHSC) said the limited space at The Longshed, Woodbridge, would mean they would not be able to complete the project, describing the possibility as a \"tragedy\".\nThe leaseholder, The Woodbridge Riverside Trust, said the group had needed to renew an agreement to make use of more of the building and, despite reminders, this had not been done. \nJacq Barnard, project manager of SHSC, said the project had a year left but it would be \"impossible\" for them to make use of just 40% of the building as the ship is \"bigger than that\".\n\"To move the project would be a tragedy because we can't take it out the back of the building by road,\" she explained.\n\"We'd have to take it out the front of the building onto the river somehow.\n\"The expense of that would be enormous and we are a charity - we are constantly trying to fundraise to complete the build.\n\"So it would take an awful lot more fundraising and expense to get that done. It's just so disappointing.\"\nSean McMillan, trustee and chair of SHSC, said he remained optimistic the issue could be resolved. \n\"We will get there but we'd like to get a lot of things resolved quite quickly,\" he said.\n\"We cannot possibly continue to work and build this ship safely with only 40% of the building and we certainly can't entertain visitors in the way that we ought to and the way that they deserve.\"\nWhile Woodbridge Riverside Trust (WRT) holds the lease for the building, Woodbridge Town Council owns it.\nA previous restriction was put in place by the council that allowed SHCH 40% of the building - which the trust said was \"probably considered sufficient at that time\" - for a maximum of 10 years with \"no possibility of extension\".\nHowever when the project required more space, the council agreed to allow them 56% of the building - which equates to 75% of the floor - and this was valid for three years expiring 13 July 2024. \nThe trust claimed that SHSC had been reminded of this expiration \"several times\" since January and prompted to apply to renew the provision but had reportedly chosen not to.\nA spokesperson for the trust said it \"actively\" wanted SHSC's project \"to succeed\".\n\"If SHSC decide to lose some of the current space they have (from 14 July) by not applying to WRT to facilitate the renewal of the side-letter with the town council, that is their choice,\" they added. \n\"It will be of their doing, and not the doing of others.\"\nWoodbridge Town Council has been approached for comment. \nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A building abandoned following the collapse of an Essex charity is to reopen for children and young adults with special needs.\nThe premises, formerly occupied by PARC (Essex), will once again be used for respite services from the end of July.\nAbout 140 families were affected when it closed in June 2022 after at least \u00a364,000 could not be accounted for. \nA new organisation, Happy Hill Essex CIO, will now offer services from the site.\nHappy Hill is part of a larger community interest company (CIC) called SEND Sensation, which will also use the building.\nShort breaks will be offered to carers and families of children and young adults up to the age of 25 with special educational needs and/or disabilities. \nAfter-school and holiday clubs as well as weekend clubs and activities will also be offered according to founder, Heather Hill. \nMs Hill, who has two children with special needs, said she was excited at the prospect of the centre reopening.\nShe told BBC Essex the centre was now being refurbished, in the hope of reopening in the summer, following a deal which had been \"months in the making\" and promised there would be no \"repeat of history happening again\". \nAt least \u00a364,000 of funding provided to PARC (Essex) by Essex County Council could not be matched with services the money was intended for.\nIts trustees said a \"counting anomaly\" had been uncovered but no further details were provided.\nThere is no evidence the money was misappropriated or any suggestion of wrongdoing.\n\nFormer PARC staff members were awarded a total of \u00a3166,000 by an employment tribunal last year but say they have not yet been paid any of the money.\nAs the authority responsible for the commissioning of children\u2019s services, Essex County Council is taking on the lease for the building. \nIt will be sublet in its entirety to Happy Hill Essex CIO while the landlord, Braintree District Council, will continue to own the property.\nMs Hill said: \"We are thrilled and deeply grateful for the chance to provide the community with a dedicated space that caters to the diverse needs of the wider special needs community. It's important to emphasise that the spirit of PARC will not be forgotten\".\nBraintree District Council took possession of the building after PARC's trustees surrendered the lease nine months ago.\nA spokesman said: \"We have worked closely and in partnership with our colleagues at Essex County Council in bringing this community asset back into operational use and we\u2019re delighted with the result because we know how important this facility is and the service it provides are to families and young people with special and additional needs\".\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A hospital trust is one of only a handful in the country offering routine limb-saving plastic surgery for diabetic patients suffering from foot ulcers. \nDiabetic foot ulcers affect more than 18 million people worldwide each year and costs the NHS in England more to treat than breast, prostate and lung cancer combined. \u00a0\nStaff at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, carry out a small number of operations each year to preserve patients' feet and avoid major amputation. James Chan, a consultant plastic surgeon, wants to see the technique expanded across the UK. \nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"Major amputation incidence in England is now one of the lowest internationally, however a continued focus on reducing unwarranted variation in footcare outcomes is key ambition of the NHS.\"\nAs part of his role at the British Association of Plastic and Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons, Mr Chan has been trying to engage with more surgeons around the country to make the procedure more widely available.\n\"These techniques are relatively newly discovered,\" he said.\n\"In other countries like Taiwan, or Korea or in the United States they've started doing this over the last few years and found good success rates and that's why we're starting to adopt this in the UK,\" Mr Chan said.\nThe procedure involves cleaning out the infected wound then transplanting a healthy bit of skin, muscle or bone down to the foot.\nMore than five million people in the UK live with diabetes, it is estimated that one in three to one in five of them will develop a diabetic foot ulcer at some point.\nWhen diabetes - both type 1 and type 2 - is present for many years, especially if it is poorly controlled, it can cause complications such as reducing blood flow to vessels in the feet and nerve damage which can reduce sensation. This increases the risk of ulcers and infections which may lead to amputation.\n\"Now more and more people in their 30s and 40s are getting this and they have ulcers that just don't heal and go on for years on end and ultimately can lead to an amputation,\" said Mr Chan.\nAccording to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, nearly 8,000 diabetic patients in England had a below the knee amputation between 2017 and 2020.\nIt is estimated that diabetes costs the NHS more than \u00a310bn a year - or 10% of its budget. This includes treatment of complications arising from the condition and out-patient appointments.\nStaff at Stoke Mandeville Hospital carry out less than 10 reconstructive plastic surgeries on diabetic patients a year, but they plan to do more.\n\"From the cases we've done so far we've seen people are able to get back to work, get back on their feet and have a good quality of life afterwards,\" Mr Chan said.\n \"We've had young people who were hospitalised several times a year because of sepsis from the foot and now they're back to work and four years down the line they're still infection free,\" he added.\nJohn Smith, 54, from Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, is a self-employed gardener with type 2 diabetes.\nHe has previously needed to take six months off work because of a foot ulcer.  \nIt got so bad that he had his big toe amputated at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.  \nBut after the wound would not heal, plastic surgeons at Stoke Mandeville Hospital took a skin flap from his thigh and attached it to his foot.\nFour years on and he is still infection free and able to work.\nHe said: \"[I] still climb ladders, do my work, drive alright, ride my push bike, walk alright on it, everything....really it's improved a lot.\" \nDiabetes UK said regular foot checks can help reduce the risk of foot amputations for people living with the condition and should be carried out by trained health professionals once a year, or more often if identified as high risk.\nPhaedra Perry, the head of Diabetes UK south west and south central, said: \"Amputations can have a devastating impact on people\u2019s lives so it\u2019s vital that healthcare professionals and people living with diabetes prioritise their foot health.\u201d\nNHS England said the percentage of people who receive all the checks for diabetes care in England had returned to pre-pandemic levels and an additional \u00a336m had been provided to help restore services.\nAn NHS spokesperson, said: \"Evidence shows that quality foot care supports reduced minor and major amputations, diabetic complications, hospital admissions, length of stay and improved patient experience.\n\u201cMeanwhile, major amputation incidence in England is now one of the lowest internationally, however a continued focus on reducing unwarranted variation in footcare outcomes is a key ambition of the NHS.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The parents of a young man killed in a catastrophic car crash in Loughborough in 1986 are trying to trace relatives of three other teenagers who died with him and another who was seriously injured.\nRobbin and Patsy Suffield, who now live in Warwickshire, have campaigned for better protection for young drivers ever since their 18-year-old son Neil died.\n\"For decades we\u2019ve just been up against a brick wall,\" Mr Suffield said, as he described feeling like a \"lone voice\".\nThe couple are keen to contact the other families bereaved in the Loughborough crash, to make them aware of the support available from the growing Forget-Me-Not Families Uniting group.\nThe families have backed a new law in Parliament proposing graduated driving licences.\nIf introduced in the UK, newly-qualified drivers would face certain restrictions for the first six months after passing a driving test, including limits on carrying passengers.\nMr Suffield said the car his son Neil and his friends were travelling in hit a bus. \n\"They decided with their youthful excitement to all pile into a small car,\" he said. \"Six of them in a car that was built for four, with a driver who\u2019d only just passed his test.\n\"Of course if we'd had graduated driving licensing, six wouldn\u2019t have got into the same car.\"\nFive of the boys died and one was seriously injured.\nMrs Suffield said they never felt they should blame the young driver because \"it could have been any one of the other boys in that car driving\".\nThey believe the law would \"protect\" rather than \"control or restrict\" young drivers, as well as keep other road users safe.\nThe Suffields have found comfort in meeting other bereaved families and their network is growing.\nThey now want to reconnect with the Loughborough crash families they have lost touch with over the years. \nMr Suffield said \"We\u2019ve successfully contacted one other family, but that leaves four others and we feel that they ought to be aware of our group.\"\nThe names of the crash victims whose families they are trying to trace are Mark Adam Smoothy from East Leake, Alan Edward Clarke and Ian David Castledine, both from Loughborough, and Wayne Hughes from Coalville, who was seriously injured.",
    "Unemployed doctors are turning to charities for help because they cannot pay their bills, according to a representative of GPs.\nDr Rachel McMahon made the comments as a Stockton Council report referred to doctors looking for work, while hard-up practices could not employ them despite a backlog of patients. \nThe report is due to be considered by council leaders next week.\nDr McMahon said she knew GPs who \"haven't managed to do any GP work for several weeks in Teesside\" and that they were \"probably working about half of the hours they could work for the NHS\".\nDr McMahon is CEO and company secretary for Cleveland Local Medical Committee (LMC), which represents GPs.\n \"We know there are GPs who are turning to charities for support because they can\u2019t find any work and they can\u2019t pay their bills,\" she said.\nIt was a \"terrible shame\", she added, when patients were waiting so long for their appointments to have a fully trained workforce who were \"unable to help practices out\".\nDr McMahon put this down to \"recurrent underfunding\" and said \"although all the political parties say they\u2019ll put money into the NHS, it often goes into hospitals rather than into general practice\".\nShe said it was one of the reasons practices were facing \"really high\" financial pressure. \n\"We\u2019ve got many practices in Teesside which would like to recruit because they want to offer a better service to their patients, but they simply can\u2019t afford financially to do so,\" she said.\nDr McMahon said numbers of GPs had fallen while numbers of patients had risen nationally, leaving doctors with higher workloads, looking after 800 more patients than 10 years ago.\n\u201cLocally, we have GPs who want to work and practices who want to employ them. The finance is the only barrier,\" she said.\nDr McMahon told the Local Democracy Reporting Service how practices hit by rising prices had laid off doctors in other parts of the country. \nAsked whether this could happen on Teesside, she said: \"It\u2019s definitely possible. We\u2019ve not heard of any situations like that yet but it\u2019s definitely something that some practices are thinking.\"\nShe said on Teesside 75% of appointments were face-to-face in April this year, and practices delivered enough appointments for more than half of the population. \nThe government released plans in May last year to make it easier for patients to see GPs and provide faster, more convenient care. \nThe \"recovery plan\" aimed to support patients, reduce the numbers struggling to contact their practices, bring in and keep more doctors and cut bureaucracy.\nBut the LMC felt the national recovery plan \"would have limited impact as it failed to address the underlying issues around funding and workload\".\nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A company has been chosen in the latest stage of a partnership deal to develop the 650-acre Cornwall Airport Newquay estate.\nCornwall Council owns and operates the airport and manages the wider estate, which includes Aerohub Business Park, the Spaceport, Kernow Solar Park and 200 acres of undeveloped land. \nThe airport served 440,000 passengers in 2023/24 and brings in about \u00a372m to the Cornish economy annually but has continually run at a loss with the 2024/25 subsidy likely to be more than \u00a34m.\nThe Conservative-run council has started the process of finding a financial partner to develop the land and also take the financial pressure off the council and taxpayers when it comes to running the airport.\nThe name of the company the council could partner with has not been released to the public.\nAt a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Councillor Louis Gardner, portfolio holder for the economy, said due to the cost of compliance with Civil Aviation Authority rules, the airport would never be financially sustainable, adding \"numerous previous administrations have failed to exploit potential land utilisation\".\nDeputy leader David Harris said: \"Some have said that this is a disguised sale of the airport estate. \n\"Tosh!

    "A Metropolitan Police log - instructing officers to recall Zara Aleena's murderer to prison days before he attacked her - was closed prematurely and further checks should have been carried out, the inquest into her death has heard.\nJordan McSweeney, a sexual predator with 28 previous convictions, was still at large on 26 June 2022, when he killed the 35-year-old in Ilford, east London. \nHe had been released from jail on licence nine days earlier.\nGiving evidence at East London Coroner's Court, Sgt Ian Batten told the jury he had not realised his report on the police system had been closed hours after he made it.\nThe inquest had previously been told that prolific offender McSweeney should have been ranked as \u201chigh risk\u201d as far back as February 2021.\nSgt Batten said if the categorisation had been made,  a \"manhunt investigation\" would have been launched to find him.\nHowever, based on the information he had seen, Sgt Batten had not believed there was any risk to the wider public.\nThe officer said there was a \u201chigh volume of work\" in the operations room, and it was \u201cnot unusual\u201d to have 10 to 15 cases each shift where electronically tagged offenders had breached bail conditions. \nThe inquest heard that McSweeney had previously suggested he would like to find work at a funfair after leaving prison, but Sgt Batten said he was not aware of this, and so had not checked if there were any in the local area.\nHe said an address recorded as McSweeney\u2019s grandmother\u2019s did not exist, but that he had directed officers to attend his mother\u2019s address.\nThe inquest also heard from PC Janet Matthews, who had gone to the mother's address to search for McSweeney in the early hours of 25 June.\nBody-worn camera footage showed officers asking his mother if they could enter her home to check he was not there, but his mother refused and said she did not know where he was.\nPC Matthews said she did not believe she had any powers to search the address, as she did not have enough evidence that he was there.\nThe jury also heard a witness statement from Kevin McKenna, a fairground worker, who said McSweeney had been sharing a caravan with him at Valentines Park in Ilford since 21 June.\nHe said McSweeney had been working at two fairgrounds with him in Ilford and in Wanstead, helping children on the rides.\nHe said on the night that Ms Aleena was murdered, he had been drinking heavily at a pub with McSweeney, who had been \u201ctalking to everyone\".\nHe said later in the evening, a member of bar staff had told him: \u201cI can\u2019t serve you while he is there,\u201d referring to McSweeney, but said he did not know why.\nMcSweeney\u2019s boss, John Parnham, described picking him up in the car from the fairground in Wanstead the day after Ms Aleena was attacked, and said he had remarked to him that there must have been a bad traffic accident as the roads were closed.\nHe said McSweeney replied: \u201cNo, someone has been murdered.\u201d\nLater that afternoon, he said police had come to the fairground and shown him a photo.\n\u201cI was sure it was Jordan,\u201d he said. \u201cI went white.\u201d\nHe told officers that McSweeney was asleep in the caravan, where they arrested him.\nThe inquest continues.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A drink driver who hit a retired teacher with his car then drove over her as she lay in the road has been jailed for causing death by careless driving.\nMandeep Singh, 45, was driving on the wrong side of the road when he hit Doris Post, who was pushing her bicycle across a pedestrian crossing on Lower Rushall Street in Walsall, on the morning of 13 July 2021.\nSingh, from Walsall, who was over the alcohol limit while at the wheel of his Volkswagen Polo, pleaded guilty to the charge.\nThe 45-year-old was jailed for eight years and disqualified from driving for eight years and three months when he appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court on 7 June.\nWest Midlands Police said Singh stopped his car for six seconds after the collision, then drove over his victim who was lying in the carriageway, before stopping his vehicle.\nHe was then detained by members of the public until officers arrived.\nDoris Post was treated by paramedics but nothing could be done to save her and she was pronounced dead at the scene.\nMiss Post taught foreign languages at Queen Mary's High School in Walsall for 27 years, before retiring in 2019.\nAfter her retirement, Miss Post was known to go on a daily bike ride around Walsall Arboretum, opposite the school where she had worked for decades.\nIt is believed she was returning from her daily ride when she was hit by Singh's car. \nSgt Julie Lyman, of West Midlands Police's serious collision investigation unit, said: \"Singh was driving a vehicle while over the limit when the collision took place.\n\"He stopped his car for six seconds and then drove over his victim.

    "A construction company has been fined more than \u00a32m after a worker drowned while working on a flood defence project in Leeds.\nGary Webster, 60, was one of two men on a boat trying to retrieve a gas canister from the bottom of weir gates at Knostrop Weir on the River Aire when the boat capsized.\nThe Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said he was rescued by a diver after almost 15 minutes and was taken to hospital but died two days later, on 1 November 2017.

    "The owners of empty and run down properties in the Isle of Man's capital will be charged rates in future, the after the local authority voted to adopt a new policy.\nDouglas Council has revised its approach to the buildings, previously classed as zero-rated, to encourage renovation to create more available housing.\nThe treasury had historically deemed dilapidated buildings as exempt, but after a recent tribunal revealed the stance had no statutory footing, the council updated its stance.\nCouncil leader Claire Wells said the former system had been unfair on other ratepayers and the extra funds would go towards improving facilities in the city.\nOwners of empty properties will now be charged unless the building has been demolished.\nThe council had initially changed its policy in September to one of charging rates for properties that could not be lived in after the exemption had been in place for between 12 and 18 months.\nA challenge to the change at a rent and rates tribunal hearing in April ruled that the Treasury's policy was only based on a \u2018good faith agreement\u2019.\nThe council said the government had not provided any legislation to the tribunal which allowed properties to have \"ad-hoc allowances whilst being renovated\" and therefore there was no obligation for local authorities to comply.\nSpeaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service Ms Wells said: \"We should be encouraging people to invest in their properties and make sure people can live in them.\"\nThere were \"plenty\" of properties in the city centre that could be renovated but had been left to \"sit and rot\" because rates were not charged, she added.\nA government spokesman said the Treasury had been liaising with local authorities to find out their \"views and preferences in tackling such properties\u201d, and further work would be needed to understand the \"legislative implications\".\nAdditional reporting by Emma Draper, Local Democracy Reporter.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

    "The owners of the famous Glasgow restaurant Rogano are suing their landlord so that they can reopen for the first time in four years.\nThe seafood restaurant - with its distinctive art deco styling -  has been closed since the coronavirus pandemic.\nIts owners Forthwell Ltd claim it has been unable to reopen because of damage caused by flooding on three occasions between December 2020 and January 2021. \nTheir lawyers want a judge to order the landlord Pontegadea to provide repairs, or pay damages of \u00a3789,000. \nThe restaurant had welcomed celebrities like Rod Stewart, Jude Law, Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Elizabeth Taylor and Harvey Keitel since it first opened in 1935. \nForthwell\u2019s legal team stated flooding damage to the restaurant was caused by an \u201cinsured risk\u201d and that Pontegadea breached its obligation to maintain the Rogano and allow it to trade.\nThey claim it was unable to reopen because  the flooding had left the building with \u201csubstantial damage\u201d.\nBut lawyers for Pontegadea argued the restaurant's owners had their own insurance, and therefore the claim should be struck out.\nIn a written judgment published by the Court of Session on Thursday, Lord Braid allowed the case to proceed.\nHe wrote: \u201cThe issue does not turn on insurance law, nor circuity of action based on rights of subrogation, but, more straightforwardly, turns on what the parties intended, which is a matter of construction of the lease.\n\u201cWhile it may well be that where the parties are joint insured, they will invariably be found to have intended to preclude\u2026a claim by either of them for breach of the term of the contract which caused the loss, that need not inexorably follow and in any event does not preclude other terms of the contract from being enforced.\n\u201cI will find the pursuer entitled to a proof before answer on those averments, notwithstanding the reservations just expressed.\u201d\nThe restaurant was featured in an episode of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain\u2019s Parts Unknown programme, where he shared oysters and lobster thermidor with comedian Janey Godley.\nOther celebrities to have visited Rogano include Kylie Minogue, who is said to have ordered mussels when she visited and left her waiter so starstruck he could only carry one starter at a time out of fear of dropping the plates.\nKeira Knightley visited every night for two weeks to eat scrambled eggs and smoked salmon while filming a drama The Jacket in Glasgow.\nThe case will now be heard in the Court of Session in the near future.

    "On 1 October 2017, Heather Gooze was serving drinks at the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas when concert-goers began running into her bar, screaming and covered in blood.\nA gunman perched high in a Las Vegas hotel had opened fire on the festivities below. He killed 60 people and wounded over 400 more. He was able to carry out what is still the deadliest mass shooting in US history because of a mechanism he installed on his gun known as a bump stock.\nIn the aftermath of the massacre, then-President Donald Trump banned bump stocks, a modification that allows a rifle to fire like a machine gun. It was a rare example of the US making a change to its gun policies in the wake of a mass shooting, and it was a reform that survivors of the attack welcomed.\nThe ban was all the more extraordinary because it was instituted by a Republican president and supported by the National Rifle Association, figures that would normally oppose a gun control proposal.\nOn Friday, the US Supreme Court struck down the ban, deciding in a 6-3 opinion that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had overstepped its authority to outlaw the device. \nFor survivors like Ms Gooze, who identifies as liberal and thought Trump\u2019s ban was \u201cphenomenal\u201d, the ruling felt like a step backward for the country.\n\u201cWho has ever used a bump stock for good?\" she told the BBC. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for a civilian to use a mass shooting machine.\u201d\nMs Gooze, 50, still vividly remembers the panic of helping people flee the carnage, and the frantic battle to save the people struck by the more than 1,000 rounds that the gunman fired with the help of his weapon\u2019s modification.\n\u201cI had my finger in the bullet hole of one of our angels in the back of their head,\u201d she said of one victim she tried to save. She stayed with the body of another victim for hours, using a phone she found in their pocket to contact the family.\n\u201cI watched people\u2019s lives change right in front of my face, as well as my own,\u201d she said.\nOne of those lives was Brittany Quintero\u2019s. Ms Quintero was separated from her friend in the chaos of the shooting, and though they both survived, she has spent years working through the trauma the shooting inflicted.\nShe told the BBC that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision had left her reeling.\n\u201cIt feels like another slap in the face, to be honest,\u201d she said.\nMs Quintero, 41, said she does not necessarily believe that more stringent gun restrictions would help prevent mass shootings. She also believes not enough proposed solutions address mental health.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think taking away people\u2019s Second Amendment rights is going to solve these things that keep occurring,\u201d she said, referring to the protections for gun owners enshrined in the US Constitution. \n\u201cIf someone has it in their mind to do it, they\u2019re going to find a way or other means.\u201d\nBut despite her reservations, she still thinks the Supreme Court was wrong to reinstate access to bump stocks.\nThe Route 91 survivors were not universally disheartened by the Supreme Court decision. Several were discussing the news in a private Facebook group, Ms Gooze said, and some members of the community had responded that the ruling did not bother them.\n\u201cA gun isn\u2019t the issue, we need them to keep what little freedom we have left. It\u2019s the government that\u2019s the enemy,\u201d one survivor wrote in a message that Ms Gooze read to the BBC.\nGun violence remains a major public safety issue in the United States. The nation has experienced 215 mass shootings so far in 2024, according to the Gun Violence Archive (their methodology defines a mass shooting as when four or more people are shot or killed, not including the shooter).\nBoth Ms Gooze and Ms Quintero lamented that the gun debate had grown so politicised.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to see in my lifetime a true law or decision that will be made to solve the gun violence issue,\u201d Ms Gooze said.\nRepeated attempts to ban bump stocks through federal legislation have stalled, and face little chance of passing in the near term due to a divided Congress.\nTrump, who is again running for president, said he would respect the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to strike down his policy and reaffirmed his support for broader access to guns.\n\"The Court has spoken and their decision should be respected,\u201d Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump has been and always will be a fierce defender of Americans' Second Amendment rights and he is proud to be endorsed by the NRA.\u201d\nIn video on X, formerly Twitter, the gun shop owner who challenged the bump stock ban at the Supreme Court celebrated his victory and said he had prevented the government from banning other gun parts.\nThe nation's highest court sided with his argument that the Trump administration overstepped when it sought to regulate bump stocks like machine guns.\n\u201cI stood and fought,\u201d said gun shop owner Michael Cargill, \u201cand because of this, the bump stock case is going to be the case that saves everyth",
    "At one of Central America\u2019s most popular tourist spots, you can stand a few hundred metres from boiling volcanic lava.\nMeet any backpacker in a hostel bar in Central America, there is a high chance they have hiked, or are planning to hike, the twin volcanoes of Acatenango and Fuego.\n\u201cThe thing I remember most is the sound of the bubbling,\u201d recalls 23-year-old Leila Mitchell, who visited in 2022. \u201cHuge spurts of orange, glowing lava.

Some are known to go within 100 metres of its rim.\nProf Watson used to take students on a yearly field trip to Fuego \u2013 but stopped in 2015 after it became more energetic. \u201cAn INSIVUMEH volcanologist advised against going up there, and we\u2019ve not been up since,\u201d he says.\nINSIVUMEH is a government agency that monitors Fuego. Since 1999, it has recorded 79 serious eruptions \u2013 called paroxysms \u2013 with more than 47 occurring after 2015.\nSix years ago, this ratcheting up of activity had tragic consequences.\nOn 3 June 2018, a powerful eruption caught much of the surrounding area by surprise. It buried the entire town of San Miguel Los Lotes under ash and rock.\nJonathan Dovgan Prera was on his way back to Acatenango from Fuego that day with a tour group he was guiding.\n\u201cI remember hearing the tremors. An older guide said something bad was about to happen\u2026 \u2018just run\u2019.\u201d\nHis tour group that day was made up of university athletes, who managed to sprint back to base camp unscathed. \u201cYou could feel the ash and small rocks hitting you,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat was one of the scariest moments of my life.\u201d\nThe official death toll from the eruption was 218 people, but locals say as many as 3,500 people disappeared that day.\nProf Watson says out-of-date census data explains this discrepancy, as well as the difficulty in identifying remains.\nDespite his near-death experience, Jonathan has continued to climb Fuego and leads two to three tour groups a week up the active volcano.\n\u201cExplosive activity continues to happen daily, virtually uninterrupted\u201d says Roberto M\u00e9rida, a volcanologist at INSIVUMEH. \u201cIt is precisely what attracts the attention of tourists.\u201d \nYet many are completely unaware of the risks associated with this much-touted tourist experience.\nLeila's boyfriend Louis Martlew, 23, visited the volcanoes with her. \u201cWe signed a piece of paper and laughed about the fact that we were signing our life away.\u201d\nIt was only after they returned that another traveller told them about the 2018 eruption. \u201cI was stupid not to realise how bad that could have been,\u201d Leila said.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s made for tourists and it\u2019s just a thing that happens, I thought it was perfectly safe.\u201d\nSix years on, the hike is more popular than ever.\nLocal guides estimate that 200 to 400 people visit the volcanoes every day, jumping to as many as 1,000 on a busy Friday or Saturday.\nMatt Hartell was one of the first adventure tour guides to set up shop in the area in 1998. \u201cWe\u2019d be the only people on the mountain,\u201d he remembers. \u201cNow there are 30 other companies out there every day of the week.\u201d\nTourism is a huge economic driver for Antigua in particular and Guatemala in general. In 2018, the tourism industry brought over \u00a3838 million to the Central American nation\u2019s coffers.\nAnd it is those who derive their livelihoods from guiding groups up the volcanoes that are the most at risk as they spend far more time in the danger zone than most others.\n\u201cSome of my guides don\u2019t want to take people over there\u201d says Matt Hartell, adding that he himself tries to avoid going \u201cwhenever I can\u201d.\nSo, is there an alternative?\nThe terraces of Acatenango, Fuego\u2019s dormant twin, offer a spectacular view of Fuego\u2019s lava shows.\nAll tours hike Acatenango first, resting in a base camp there. Those who are feeling adventurous then continue on to Fuego.\nProf Watson is baffled that tour groups continue to go the active volcano. \u201cGiven how good the observation platform from the terraces [of Acatenango] is, it seems a completely unnecessary risk.\u201d\nINSIVUMEH issues daily bulletins in Spanish on Facebook, X and its website warning of risks of injury or death to those who go too close to Fuego\u2019s crater.\nBut as climbing Fuego is not illegal, INSIVUMEH can only warn of the risks and lacks the power to stop visitors from going there.\nOn the ground, it is not obvious who is in char",
    "Would you give up the chance to have a partner, children and a choice of career?\nProbably not, but some take a very different path.\nJust 85 women in England and Wales became nuns or religious sisters between 2018 and 2022, according to the most recent statistics.\nSister Catherine is one of them.\nWhile faith has always been important to Catherine, 26, she did not always plan on joining a religious order.\n\"I'd had this dream of getting married and having seven children - you know, proper Catholic, you need to have lots of babies, right? - and little dogs and chickens, all of that,\" she says.\nYet here she is, part of a small group of women in a convent on the edge of Dereham, a small Norfolk town.\nGrowing up a Catholic and working for the local diocese, she had spent some time with the women she now sees as family.\nShe initially had doubts about joining them, working instead as an au pair in Austria.\nShe hoped to find \"a nice, handsome man\", but that did not happen.\n\"There were lots of moments on my day off I'd go exploring some of the beautiful surroundings,\" she says.\n\"And I can remember those times where I'd come across a chapel or a church and have that real sense of deep peace - almost a sense of being held - in God's presence.\n\"And so I realised this desire to belong totally to God was still there.\"\nShortly after the first Covid lockdown, Sister Catherine joined the convent of The Community of Our Lady of Walsingham, based in a converted barn.\n\"I thought I'd give it three weeks. Almost four years later, I'm still here,\" she says.\nA typical day involves at least three hours in prayer and silent contemplation.\nBut Catherine and the other sisters are also involved in the community, giving talks in schools, working in prisons and also with university students.\nThey also maintain the convent and its grounds, as well as its website and social media channels.\nShe says the small group has a lot of fun, enjoying crafting, baking and board games.\nThere is also the regular movie night. Oppenheimer was shown recently, but other popular choices include Disney and action films.\nSister Catherine firmly believes in the life she has chosen, although she still has the option to leave her habit behind.\n\"I have not yet made permanent vows. You have about seven years - maximum of 10, really - to decide if this is something you want to commit to for life,\" she explains.\n\"Which is really quite generous; even engaged couples wouldn't take that long to decide. That's an option that's still open.\"\nSister Theresa joined when she was a little older than Catherine.\nNow 39, she has been with the community for almost 15 years.\n\"I had an inkling when I was about 18 that God was saying 'You know, you could be a sister.' And, at first, I thought 'Oh no Lord, surely not,'\" she explains.\n\"But the funny thing was when that thought came to me in prayer, I did feel a sense of joy, even though I was a bit scared.\n\"(But) I did feel happy. I thought 'I need to explore this.'\"\nShe went on religious retreats, meeting other young Catholics.\n\"The funny thing was, I initially went because a cute boy I knew was going, so there was a bit of an ulterior motive,\" she says.\nOn retreats, she got to know herself better but still did not know many women who had chosen the life she now leads.\n\"I didn't know if you could be happy as a nun. I knew people that were happily married, so that was the idea I was clinging to, really.\"\nA further retreat to Walsingham, a small village in north Norfolk and one of England's holiest, helped make her mind up.\nShe met \"some really joyful sisters\" and says that, through prayer, she came to trust that what God wanted \"is what's best for me\".\nThat led her to become a religious sister. \nAlthough the terms are used interchangeably, sisters are more active in the wider world than nuns, who tend to lead much more enclosed lives. \nShe still feels the decision was right.\n\"I suppose, like any choice in life, you have moments where it's a struggle,\" she says.\n\"I loved the idea of marriage and children, so sometimes I think 'Oh gosh, I missed out on children.'\n\"You do have those thoughts sometimes. I think what is happened is that desire to be a mother... I'm able to show that in different ways.\n\"I do work, like being an assistant chaplain at one of the local universities. And I love seeing the young people grow in their faith.\n\"So there's that idea of nurturing others and helping them to grow and really flourish.\n\"I think that motherly desire that is in my heart; the kind of natural. biological thing. To be able to live that through helping others still helps me to feel fulfilled.\"\nSurrounded by fields and under big skies, the convent was once a family home.\nBought and converted in 2018, it is now known as House of the Divine Will.\nMost of its fittings and fixtures, including Ikea furniture, either came with the property or were donated, like the Apple Mac used for admin and updating the community's social media.\nHigh property prices ",
    "The desk of the writer Dr Samuel Johnson is to be returned to his former London home for the first time in more than 260 years.\nExcept, in a strange twist, its owner is now uncertain whether it really is the desk of the famous 18th Century dictionary author.\nIt's been suggested that despite many years of being treated as a literary relic, it could have been part of a Victorian hustle to make money.\nIt will be the star attraction of a new museum exhibition, but visitors will be asked whether they now believe it's authentic.\nDr Samuel Johnson was an 18th Century literary giant, remembered for compiling in 1755 what was then the most comprehensive dictionary of the English language.\nIn the TV comedy Blackadder the Third, Dr Johnson was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane, with the painstakingly researched dictionary ending up on the fire.\nWhat's now in dispute is the fate of the desk on which he wrote the dictionary when he was living in Gough Square, in a house which is now a museum to his memory.\nSince the 19th Century the wooden desk has been in Pembroke College Oxford - and the college is lending this prized possession to the Dr Johnson House museum.\nBut when Lynda Mugglestone, professor of the history of English at the college, began to check out the provenance of the desk, there were some unexpected questions.\n\"The real story is that we don't quite know if it's the real desk,\" she says.\nIt had come to the college through a clergyman who had been close to Dr Johnson's god daughter, Elizabeth Ann Lowe, and her sister. A plaque was attached to signify its historic importance.\nBut the puzzle is whether those sisters ever really had the desk or whether they used their literary connection as a way of guilt-tripping some famous writers of their era for money.\nProf Mugglestone says that as the centenary of Johnson's dictionary was being marked in 1855, the Lowe sisters began writing asking for cash, describing themselves as in penury and with nothing left but a desk which they said had been left to them by the great writer.\nThey were \"living in poverty\" in Deptford in south London, says Prof Mugglestone, and they made clear that \"donations were welcome\".\nWriters such as Thomas Carlyle and Charles Dickens, who had just written Hard Times, began to fund raise for the sisters. \nLiterary London was mobilised to help the sisters who were the surviving connections to Dr Johnson. The desk became part of that story.\nDickens wrote of the sisters being in \"great poverty, but undemonstrative and uncomplaining, though very old - with nothing to speak of in the wide world, but the plain fir desk on which Johnson wrote his English Dictionary\". \nSuch pleas from Dickens helped to raise large donations for the sisters, with the desk being saved as a \"proud possession to the English nation\".\nBut Celine Luppo McDaid, director of the Dr Johnson House, says it is now seems unclear whether this desk was actually Johnson's.\nThe case for it being authentic, she says, is that the sisters could have been thinking: \"We've sold everything else, but we still have this treasured desk, it's the last thing we have.\"\nOr else it might have been a chance to turn a bit of spare furniture into a financial lifeline.\n\"They might have seen an opportunity and decided that the knackered old desk in the corner was 'Johnson's desk',\" says the museum director Ms McDaid.\nProf Mugglestone says women in this era could be extremely financially vulnerable, with few ways to support themselves and such attempts to get money from rich connections might have been their only chance.\nThe Lowe sisters did have a link with Johnson through their father, an impecunious painter Mauritius Lowe, who had lost a grant from the Royal Academy after some rather murky \"misconduct\".\nMs McDaid says the painter and his children were living in \"abject poverty\" and Johnson, often broke himself, was sympathetic and helped them with money.\nBut the so far unanswerable question is whether the Lowe family really ended up with the famous desk and had kept it for more than 70 years after Johnson's death. It's from the right era, but is it the actual desk?\nResearching the desk's origins revealed records of other petitions for money by Elizabeth Ann Lowe and her sister, essentially begging letters - with stories that were not always consistent. The prime minister and the royals were among those getting requests for support.\n\"She is lying to someone,\" says Prof Mugglestone. But that doesn't ultimately prove either way the authenticity of the desk.\nThe exhibition will have to embrace this ambiguity and accept that even though this has been seen as Johnson's desk for generations, it might not be.\nVisitors to the exhibition next month will be asked to give their views on whether it was the desk where Dr Johnson's dictionary was written.\n\"I'd love it to be authentic,\" says Ms McDaid. \"Nothing is more evocative than a writer's desk... But there's no way we'll know.\"\nThe exhibition, Desks, Drudgery and the ",
    "This weekend, a secluded Swiss resort above Lake Lucerne will be transformed as dozens of world leaders and thousands of soldiers and police descend on B\u00fcrgenstock.\nMore than 90 countries and global institutions are attending the event, which aims  to discuss basic principles for ending the conflict in Ukraine.\nThe Swiss hope that the Ukraine summit might produce the first tentative sketch marks for a peace process, some 28 months after Russia invaded its neighbour.\nIt is the biggest gathering for Ukraine since the full-scale invasion.\nBut with key players like China staying away, and Russian President Vladimir Putin issuing a new ultimatum - demanding Ukraine\u2019s capitulation and calling that a peace proposal - expectations of significant progress are low.\nRussia has not been invited.\nFor Ukraine, the mere fact this meeting is taking place is positive.\n\"I believe that we will witness history being made here at the summit. May a just peace be established as soon as possible,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the opening of the event.\n\"We have succeeded in bringing back to the world the idea that joint efforts can stop war and establish a just peace.\"\nPoliticians in Kyiv have been hailing every confirmed participant as a gesture of support. For them, the giant summit should demonstrate to Moscow that the world stands on the side of Ukraine - and of international law.\nIt comes at a tough time.\nThere has been a new Russian offensive in the northeast, near Kharkiv, and missiles are slamming into homes and power plants across Ukraine with renewed intensity.\nSo size matters when it comes to the summit. But so does the substance.\n\"It\u2019s important to establish a political and legal framework for future peace. To show that peace can only be achieved in the framework of Zelensky\u2019s 10 points,\" Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Merezhko sets out the case from Kyiv. \"That includes the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its sovereignty.\"\nHe is referring to a peace formula put forward in late 2022 by Ukraine's president that insists on compelling Russia to return all the occupied land.\nUkraine now wants to rally as many countries as possible behind its formula, putting \"psychological pressure\" on Russia to accept such terms, should it come to that stage.\nRight now, that looks unlikely.\nThis summit was first mooted when the situation on the battlefield looked more promising for Kyiv: a prime time to try to shape the terms of any future peace deal.\nSince then the dynamic has shifted.\n\"I think the constituency that believes this may not be a war that\u2019s winnable for Ukraine is growing,\" argues Sam Greene of the Centre for European Policy Analysis, or CEPA.\nHe points to a \"significant chunk\" of the US foreign policy establishment who believe Ukraine should \"cut its losses\", as well as the rise in support in Europe for right-wing parties more sympathetic to Moscow.\n\"I think one thing this event is meant to do, is to galvanise support behind Ukraine\u2019s vision of an acceptable outcome,\" Professor Greene says.\nBut the turnout is less promising than Ukraine and Switzerland once hoped.\nJoe Biden will not come in person, a decision that upset Mr Zelensky. And the attempts to get key countries from the \"Global South\" \u2013 not instinctive allies of Ukraine \u2013 to sign up, were only partially successful.\nIndia, Brazil and China are all either no-shows or sending low level representatives.\nRussian officials have been lining up to dismiss the event as insignificant. It is \"worthless\" and a \"dead end\", according to Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. But Moscow has been pushing its allies to boycott the summit nonetheless.\n\"That is a minus,\" Oleksandr Merezhko admits. \"It seems China decided to support its strategic partner without limits, Russia, not the peace process: the aggressor, not the peace.\"\nOn the eve of the event, Vladimir Putin tried to drop another spanner in the works by outlining his own conditions for a supposed peace: the man who invaded Ukraine, unprovoked, now wants Kyiv to capitulate.\nAmongst other things, Mr Putin demands Ukraine hand over all four regions that Russia claims to have annexed, including areas that remain under Kyiv\u2019s control.\nKyiv dismissed that right away as \"ludicrous\".\nThe meeting on Lake Lucerne will home in on three of the least contentious points in President Zelensky\u2019s peace formula: the issues of nuclear security, getting food to global markets and getting abducted Ukrainian children and prisoners back home.\nStraying beyond that is unlikely to be productive.\nNot right now, when neither Ukraine nor Russia is ready to give up the fight.\n\"I think from the Ukrainian perspective, looking at what\u2019s going on the frontlines, what they really need is not a commitment to peace, certainly not at any cost,\" Sam Greene argues, of Kyiv\u2019s allies.\n\"They need a commitment to winning the war.\"",
    "The Israeli military says it will hold a daily \"tactical pause of military activity\" along a road in southern Gaza to enable more humanitarian aid to enter, but emphasised that there is no ceasefire and combat would continue in Rafah. \nThe pauses, which are said to have begun on Saturday, will last from 08:00 local time (05:00 GMT) until 19:00 local time until further notice. \nThey will only affect a route that leads northwards from the key Kerem Shalom crossing, which Gaza shares with Israel.\nA UN spokesperson welcomed the announcement but said it had not yet translated into more aid on the ground. \nIsrael has been under continuous pressure from its allies, including the US, to prevent the humanitarian crisis in Gaza from worsening.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday's announcement follows \"additional related discussions with the UN and international organizations\".\nThe route of the humanitarian pause leads from the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south of Gaza to the Salah al-Din Road - a main highway - and then northwards to the European Hospital near the city of Khan Younis. \nIn a post on X, the IDF clarified that there is no ceasefire in the southern Gaza Strip, and fighting would continue in Rafah.\nA spokesman for ActionAid, which is helping to deliver supplies in Gaza, told the BBC that the pause would help aid getting in but that they needed more details about logistics.\n\"We're still getting confused pictures around what these tactical pauses mean, how it will enable aid, not only to get inside the Gaza Strip, but to be distributed safely to the civilians there who need it,\" Ziad Issa said. \nHe added that ActionAid had seen \"significant attacks on aid convoys that are trying to get from to Gaza from Kerem Shalom in the last few weeks\". \nA spokesperson for the United Nations' humanitarian office (OCHA), Jens Laerke, told the AFP news agency that the organisation welcomed the announcement, but that \"this has yet to translate into more aid reaching people in need\".\nAccording to Israeli media, neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor the defence minister Yoav Gallant were aware of plans for a pause before they were announced. \nMr Netanyahu's office reportedly said the prime minister had told his military secretary that the plan was \"unacceptable\" after hearing about it on Sunday.\nHe has also reportedly been told that there has been no change to the IDF's policy and that the fighting in Rafah \"continues as planned\". \nIsrael\u2019s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said the decision to pause fighting had been made by a \"fool\" who was \"evil\".\nHundreds of thousands of people have fled Rafah since Israeli troops entered it more than a month ago, seizing control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt and ordering many people to evacuate. \nThe crossing - once the main point of entry for aid - has been closed since then. \nIsrael says its operation in Rafah is necessary to oust Hamas from what it calls the group's \u201clast major stronghold\u201d.\nInternational agencies have warned of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and made repeated calls for more aid to be let in. \nOn Wednesday, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a significant proportion of Gaza's population was facing \"catastrophic hunger and famine-like conditions\".\nThe number of aid trucks entering Gaza continues to be well below what agencies have said is required. \nOCHA reported that in May, the daily average number of trucks delivering humanitarian aid into Gaza - excluding fuel - was 97. In April that figure was 169 and in March it was 139. \nPrior to the outbreak of the war on 7 October, around 500 trucks carrying aid - including fuel - were entering Gaza every day. \nOCHA points out that since 7 May, it has been unable to directly observe the arrival of aid from the private sector through the Kerem Shalom crossing.\nThe IDF said eight Israeli soldiers were killed in an explosion in Rafah on Saturday - the deadliest incident for the army in the war since January.\nIt happened during an operation in the Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood of Rafah, which has been a key target for Israeli forces in recent weeks.\nThe armed wing of Hamas said it fired a rocket towards an armoured vehicle after setting up an ambush.\nMr Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war against Hamas, urging Israelis not to let anyone \"divert\" them from the \"clear and simple fact \u2013 despite the heavy and shocking price we must stick to the goals of war\".\n\"Elimination of Hamas' governmental and military capabilities, returning all of our hostages, making sure that Gaza will not pose threat to Israel and returning our residents safely both in the north and in the south,\" he said. \nAid agencies have repeatedly reported difficulties in distributing aid around Gaza. The UN children's agency Unicef told the BBC on Friday that a convoy carrying aid was denied entry to northern Gaza, despite having all the necessary documents",
    "The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has declined to press charges against Attorney General Merrick Garland for contempt of Congress after the House of Representatives narrowly voted to punish him for his refusal to hand over audio tapes from an investigation into President Joe Biden.\nThe Republican-controlled House voted 216-207 on Wednesday to recommend that the DoJ, the department that Mr Garland oversees, file criminal charges against America's top law enforcement officer.\nThe move stems from Mr Garland's refusal to turn over to Republican lawmakers recorded interviews from a justice department probe of Mr Biden's handling of classified documents.\nIn a letter sent to Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on Friday, a top DoJ official said the department found that Mr Garland's actions \"do not constitute a crime\". Mr Johnson called the move \"sadly predictable\".\nCarlos Felipe Uriarte, an assistant attorney general, said it was a \"longstanding position\" of the department not to bring charges in cases where the president has made the decision to conceal the requested material using his power of executive privilege. \nExecutive privilege is legal doctrine that grants presidents the right to withhold executive branch information from the other two branches of US government.\n\"Accordingly the Department will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the Attorney General,\" Mr Uriarte wrote.\nThe House Speaker said he would go to federal court to force the attorney general to hand over the audio.\nMr Johnson called the DoJ decision \u201canother example of the two-tiered system of justice brought to us by the Biden Administration\u201d.\nHe cited the case of two ex-Trump aides, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, who tried to cite executive privilege in flouting congressional subpoenas. They were found in contempt of Congress, criminally prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms.\nLast month, Mr Biden invoked executive privilege to block congressional Republicans from accessing tapes of his interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating his retention of classified documents after he served as vice-president.\nMr Biden turned in the documents once they had been discovered. The DoJ special counsel who interviewed the Democratic US president said that although he had retained the files, he should not be charged as jurors would probably view him as a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\". \nThe White House said that Republicans had no legitimate need to access the five hours of audio, since a transcript had already been released. They argued that Republicans wanted to use the audio for campaign attack ads against Mr Biden as he seeks his second term as president this November.\nAs the oldest US president, 81-year-old Mr Biden's age is seen by opponents as a key political vulnerability. His Republican challenger, Donald Trump, just turned 78.\nTrump is facing a federal prosecution on charges of having retained documents that were meant to be handed over to government archivists after he left office. \nHe allegedly attempted to obstruct justice by hiding the classified memos after he had been ordered to submit them.\nTwo other attorneys general have been held in contempt of Congress in recent years. \nIn both cases Eric Holder, a Democrat, and Bill Barr, a Republican, received similar letters from the DoJ stating that prosecutors were declining to press charges.",

    "Pope Francis has met with more than 100 comedians from across the world,  including Jimmy Fallon, Chris Rock and Whoopi Goldberg, at the Vatican in Rome.\nThe Pope said comedians have the \"power to spread serenity and smiles\" in a world where people are immersed in \"many social and personal emergencies\". \n\"You unite people because laughter is contagious,\" he added.\nThe entertainers were hosted in the Vatican hours before the pontiff was expected in Puglia for the G7 summit.\nDuring the audience with 107 comedians from 15 countries, the Pope praised their ability to make people smile.\n\"You can also laugh at God, of course, and that's not blasphemy,\" the pontiff told comedians, adding that \"it can be done without offending the religious feelings of believers\".\nAccording to reports on US media, comedian Jimmy Fallon was seen larking around the front of the audience hall before proceedings got under way - he was reportedly quickly told take his seat as the pope was due to walk through the door.\nFallon was joined by other big names in the entertainment industry, including US comedian Chris Rock, Italy's Silvio Orlando, and British actor and comedian Stephen Merchant.\nComedian Whoopi Goldberg, well known for Sister Act, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, from hit-show Veep, were also in attendance.\nThe cultural event preceded the pope's appearance at the G7 in the southern Italian region of Puglia - the first time a leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics attends the summit of the world's seven largest advanced economies. \nThe 87-year-old pontiff has called for global regulation of AI, warning of its danger to ethics and human rights.\nIn reference to current global events, the pope told comedians that while communication today \"often generates conflict,\" the entertainers are able to bring together diverse realities.\n\"How much we need to learn from you,\" he added.\nAfter the audience the Pope met briefly with each comedian, exchanging a few words with each - though some interactions were somewhat one-way. \n\"Well it was brief, he spoke in Italian, so I'm not quite sure what was said,\" quipped late-night host Conan O'Brien. \n\"It was quick...

    "A judge ordered the liquidation of Infowars host Alex Jones' personal assets, clearing the way for potential payouts to families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting.\nHowever, US Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez ruled against a liquidation of Mr Jones\u2019 company Free Speech Systems, which owns the Infowars brand.\nRelatives of the victims have won a total of $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) in defamation judgements against Mr Jones and his company over his false statements about the attack.\nThe liquidation will force the sale of Mr Jones's assets - including a multimillion-dollar ranch, other properties, cars, boats and guns.  \nAccording to recent court filings, Mr Jones has around $8.6m in personal assets.\nThe ruling on Friday in Houston, Texas, means that for now, Free Speech Systems and Infowars will continue to operate.\nAccording to court filings, Free Speech Systems employs 44 people and made nearly $3.2m in revenue in one recent month, mostly from selling dietary supplements and other items. \nFamilies of the victims were divided on whether the corporate bankruptcy should be thrown out or also changed to a liquidation procedure.\nThe decision does not remove Free Speech Systems' liability, and the plaintiffs in the defamation cases will be able to pursue the damages they are owed in state courts or through further bankruptcy hearings.\n\"There's no easy or right answer here,\" Judge Lopez said, at times sounding deeply emotional as he delivered his decision. \u201cI think creditors are better served in pursuing their state court rights.\"\nOne of the attorneys for the families said they would move quickly to collect damages.\n\u201cThe court authorized us to move immediately to collect against all Infowars assets, and we intend to do exactly that,\u201d Christopher Mattei said in a statement Friday. \"Alex Jones is neither a martyr nor a victim. He is the perpetrator of the worst defamation in American history.\"\n\n\nFollowing the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Mr Jones and guests on his broadcasts repeatedly called into question whether the massacre actually occurred, floating conspiracy theories about whether the murders were faked or carried out by government agents.\nTwenty young children and six school staff were killed in the attack.\nAt one point Mr Jones called the attack \u201ca giant hoax\u201d and in 2015 he said: \"Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured\u2026 I knew they had actors there clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids, and it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors.\"\nMr Jones has since acknowledged that the Sandy Hook killings occurred.\nFollowing the broadcasts, victims of the families were harassed online and in person by Infowars viewers. The families filed defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas, and their legal victories resulted in Mr Jones and Free Speech Systems declaring bankruptcy.\nFriday\u2019s hearing was over whether those bankruptcy cases would be converted from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, a portion of US bankruptcy law that allows straightforward liquidation rather than more complicated financial restructuring. \nOn recent broadcasts and on his social media accounts, Mr Jones has continued to rail against the US justice system and claim that there is a government plot to silence him.\nHe has repeatedly warned that he is about to be taken off the airwaves, although US free speech laws mean he would be free to set up a new company and continue broadcasting even if his company were to be liquidated.   \n\u201cWe just dodged a bullet, praise Jesus,\u201d Mr Jones said while broadcasting on Infowars after the hearing. \u201cI would have been off the air today if the judge hadn\u2019t done the right thing. We live to fight another day.\u201d\nDuring the hearing, lawyers for the families claimed that the conspiracy theorist was attempting to reduce the value of his company \u2013 for instance by urging listeners to buy products from a company owned by his father rather than directly from Infowars.\nBut Mr Jones\u2019 lawyers countered by arguing that in recent weeks, the company had seen record sales.",
    "The Princess of Wales will make her first public appearance of the year when she takes part in the annual Trooping the Colour parade.\nCatherine will be in a carriage procession with her children, as the Royal Family parades along the Mall.\nShe will also make an appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.\nThe plans were revealed in a health update from the princess, who is continuing with her chemotherapy treatment after her cancer diagnosis.\nThis first step back into public life for Catherine comes on one of the biggest royal events of the year.\nThe King's birthday parade, traditionally celebrated in the summer rather than on his actual birthday in November, sees a military parade and inspection, with music and pageantry.\nThis year, after his cancer diagnosis, the King will be in a carriage rather than on horseback during the procession and when he inspects the troops on Horse Guards Parade.\nKing Charles is \"delighted\" that the Princess of Wales will be at the ceremony, according to a Buckingham Palace spokesman.\nIn a personal message, the princess said she was \"not out of the woods yet\", and had \"good days and bad days\", but was \"looking forward to attending the King\u2019s birthday parade this weekend with my family\".\nDuring the parade a regimental flag is \"trooped\" through the ranks of soldiers, with this being rotated among the five regiments of Foot Guards.\nThis year it will be the Irish Guards who take the lead, with some Irish music expected to be a feature of the parade and their mascot an Irish wolfhound making an appearance.\nGun salutes will be fired in nearby Green Park and when the royals are gathered on the palace balcony, there is usually a flypast thundering overhead.\nAlthough these events have a strong focus on tradition, there are changes, such as allowing soldiers this year to have beards. This comes with the stipulation that there should be \"no exaggerated colours\".\nAlso making a return will be three of the horses of the household cavalry which ran away and were injured during a rehearsal.\nAhead of this year's Trooping the Colour there had been a dispute over a planned protest by anti-monarchists.\nGraham Smith of the Republic group criticised the expense of the parade and said: \"The feudal tradition of royal pageants needs to stop.\"\nThe protest will go ahead but with a requirement not to use amplified sound.",
    "After the success of BBC drama Lost Boys and Fairies, series writer Daf James shares his own experience with adoption - and fans say how the series reflects the real-life issues they've faced in building a family.\nSince BBC drama Lost Boys and Fairies aired earlier this month, critics have praised the \u201cquiet melancholy\u201d and \u201craw honesty\u201d of the series.\nOne reviewer called it \u201cextraordinary\u201d, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a story about when people collide with each other and try to build a family out of all of their various parts.\u201d\nThe three-part series tells the story of performance artist Gabriel (played by Sion Daniel Young) and accountant Andy (Fra Fee) who decide to adopt. The pair are forced to confront many of their own traumas from childhood as they gear up to become parents.\nThe drama draws inspiration from the real-life experience of writer Daf James and his husband. \nAnd for real-life adopters, who saw part of their own lives unfold on the show, watching the series was especially poignant. \nMorgan and his husband, Derry, are trying to adopt their first child. They recently finished the BBC series and were astounded at how the show conveyed lots of what they\u2019re currently experiencing.\n\u201cThe adoption process is a rollercoaster of emotions,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cBut Lost Boys and Fairies captured it perfectly. It was spot on.\n\u201cMy husband and I cried like a baby watching it.\u201d\nFrom their first date, Morgan and his now husband connected over wanting a child. They both considered other options, but adoption really \"resonated\" with them both. \nThree years on, they\u2019re weeks away from being assessed at a panel where they could be approved as adopters.\nLike the protagonists of Lost Boys and Fairies, they\u2019re now attending activity days in the hopes of bonding with a child they could then be matched with.\n\u201cIt's a really strong feeling [going into that environment] because you go there with the intention to find a child, but the kids are there to play,\u201d says Morgan.\nIn the show and in real life, prospective adopters can attend activity days and meet up to 30 children waiting for adoption. \nIt\u2019s \"challenging\", Morgan says, because there is no guarantee that adopters will automatically be matched with the child they choose.\nFor adoptive parent Peter Hunt, the power of the show was how accurate the small details were. He and his husband Andrew adopted their first child in 2019, and found the series brought back memories of their experience.\n\u201cAndrew and I were laughing at their tidying,\u201d he says. \u201cYou spend days beforehand preparing for your social worker to come round because you think it\u2019s a representation of you, or something you might be judged on.\n\u201cSo it was the small attention to detail and I think the level of humour that you have when you are in that process that really resonated when watching.\u201d\nAnother scene that stood out to him was when Gabriel and Andy had found a child they wanted to move forward with, they both were then given the child\u2019s file, including details of their family home and the reasons why they were in local authority care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to read in written form how much trauma these children have been through in such a short period of time in their early lives,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo you have to develop a bit of a thick skin when you're reading those stories to be able to understand or even attempt to understand that trauma and how you might parent a child that's been through that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll always advocate for my adoption experience,\u201d says Cardiff-based writer and composer, Daf James, who created the series.\n\u201cEven though I'd seen adoption on screen, I'm not sure if I had necessarily seen it authentically represented in the way that I was experiencing it,\u201d he adds.\nLast year, the Department of Education reported that one in five adoptions in England were by same-sex couples. \nJenny MacQuire, from charity Adoption Matters, says: \u201cSexuality isn't an important factor when it comes to adoption. What is important is the commitment, resilience, stability and love that children who have suffered early childhood trauma need.\u201d\nWhen Daf and his husband made the decision to adopt, they had several friends and acquaintances around them that had already followed that route into parenting.\nBut there wasn\u2019t a huge amount of culture or media coverage around adoption, let alone on gay couples, says Daf.\n\u201cThere were definite highs and massive lows - of course there are, this is life and life is messy.\" \nOne of the main challenges is the trauma a child has potentially faced, Daf explains.\nAround 3,000 children are adopted every year, says Alison Woodhead from charity Adoption UK.\n\u201cMost of them will have experienced significant neglect and abuse in early childhood, and many will experience a number of moves in care before being placed for adoption,\u201d she says.\nDaf says \u201cthere's a lot of grief and loss that children encounter in adoption, and that's all part of the parcel, but we were brilliantly supported by social services\u201d.\nOne particular h",
    "Tracey Emin has been honoured with a damehood for services to British art, and has also revealed to the BBC that she has just been given the four-year \"all clear\" from cancer.\nEmin, one of Britain\u2019s most acclaimed artists, was diagnosed with serious bladder cancer in 2020 and underwent major surgery.\nShe says she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d still be alive now, \"let alone sitting here and becoming a dame\".\n\"When you've had cancer to the level that I had, where you really think you're probably going to die and you're looking at months ahead of you to live - and then suddenly everything turns around, it's like being born again and life starts again and all these really amazing things happen.\"\nWe meet in the studio at her imposing central London home in a Georgian square in Bloomsbury.\nWe\u2019re surrounded by her paintings, some propped up on stools. The drips of white, red and blue paint on the parquet floor below them are evidence of Emin\u2019s style.\n\"I'm quite aggressive with the paint and my movements and my strokes and everything,\" she says.\nThe damehood, revealed in the King\u2019s Birthday Honours on Friday, was entirely unexpected, she says.\nShe had already been appointed CBE in 2012, but \"Dame Tracey\", she laughs, \"has a ring about it\".\n\"It's really cool,\" she says. \"I don't think there's ever been one before.\"\nShe might not have become Dame Tracey if she hadn\u2019t been alerted to a letter marked \"urgent\" sitting unopened at her former studio.\nShe tells us she spent a day at a Buckingham Palace garden party, where she found herself shaking hands with the King and Queen.\n\"I was thinking, this is a bit weird. I'm kind of up the top here. I wonder why.\"\nIt was only on her way home that she received the call about the letter. I get the feeling she hasn\u2019t stopped smiling since.\nEmin rose to fame alongside the likes of Damien Hirst and Sarah Lucas as one of the YBAs. The Young British Artists, labelled in the late 1980s, were known for their openness to different material and processes, their shock tactics and their entrepreneurial spirit.\nShe had left school at 13, and has previously talked of being abused as a child and raped at that age. She tells me she only returned to education \"by law\" at 15 and only until she was legally allowed to leave. She spent most of her time in the art department.\nEmin only ever wanted to be an artist. The art teachers encouraged her. A while back, she actually bumped into one, Mrs Morris, in Marks and Spencer. \"She was 86 then, and she was so proud of me and it was so sweet.\"\nEmin has always made deeply personal work. My Bed, her groundbreaking 1999 Turner Prize installation, was a dishevelled double bed surrounded by overflowing ashtrays, used condoms and empty vodka bottles.\nBut whether it was that depiction of a period in her life when she was at a low ebb, drinking too much and eating too little; or a neon sign proclaiming \"I could have really loved you\"; or any one of her visceral paintings, Emin has always poured her emotions, her experiences and her trauma into her art.\nShe describes art to me as having \"many rooms\". Her room \"is emotional and it\u2019s about feelings, and it\u2019s supposed to work like a magnet to attract other people, their emotions and their feelings\".\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995 - the dates were the years she had been alive at that point - was another autobiographical work from the early days.\nInside a tent, Emin had appliqu\u00e9d 102 names. The work\u2019s title suggested sexual encounters, but she also listed people she had spent more innocent nights with during her life, including her twin brother Paul. Poignantly, she also mentioned the two foetuses from an abortion a few years before.\nEmin tells me her art isn\u2019t just about her, but is a filter for others.\n\"My art is a place where people can expose themselves by looking at it, and they can feel their own feelings and their own emotions.\"\nLooking back, she says: \"I was making art about rape, abortion, teenage sex abuse - many, many taboo subjects. And I was making those subjects open and available for discussion, which can only be a good, healthy thing.\"\nThis was a long time before the MeToo movement.\nThe media and some critics often dismissed Emin and her work, also commenting negatively on her appearance and accent. The press treated her \"quite diabolically\" she says.\nShe became a celebrity - but didn\u2019t play the game. She was outspoken, she drank and sometimes swore.\nShe gave up alcohol in 2020. Now about to be 61, she tells me, more than the drinking, she regrets the smoking and the fact she didn\u2019t look after her health.\nShe documented her cancer journey on Instagram, with treatment including having her bladder and other organs in her pelvis removed during lockdown.\nSitting with her now, she looks a picture of health.\n\"Being made a dame is, to me, something to be really happy about and celebrate because it's another marker on my life,\" she says.\nIt also means she\u2019s now \"100%\" part of the establishment, even though she s",

    "Thousands of people in Brazil have protested against a proposed nationwide law change which would equate abortion to homicide, even in cases where a pregnancy is the result of rape.\nIt would mean women who terminate pregnancies after 22 weeks could be jailed for up to 20 years.\nBrazil's ruling party opposes the move but conservatives in Congress are attempting to push the bill through.\nProtesters have gathered in many Brazilian cities in recent days, including Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Bras\u00edlia. \nSome have carried placards reading \"a girl is not a mother\", with much of the anger focused on the impact the law change could have on under-18s.\nAnalysis of crime data shows children aged 13 and younger make up more than 60% of rape victims in the country. \nCurrently under Brazilian law, abortion is legal in very limited circumstances - when someone has been raped, if there is risk to life or if there is a diagnosis of foetal brain abnormality - and can carry prison sentences of up to three years outside of those cases.\nIf this change goes ahead, self-administering or consenting to an abortion could result in a jail sentence equivalent to those handed out in \u201csimple homicide\u201d cases, which range from six to 20 years. \n\nThe law would also apply to health professionals carrying out the procedure. \nSimple homicide, under Brazil\u2019s penal code, is when a person kills another with intent.\nThe bill has made quicker progress than expected after lawmakers bypassed some procedural stages, leading to outcry from opponents. \n\"We will not accept a setback,\" councilwoman Monica Benicio told Reuters news agency.\n\"We will not accept a conservative government negotiating spurious policies over our lives. We will continue to advance until legal abortion is a guaranteed right in Brazil,\" she added.\nAfter the vote was pushed through, deputy S\u00f3stenes Cavalcante, who authored the law change, was buoyant and responded by writing \"victory to life\" on social media.\nThe Brazilian government vehemently opposes the law change, with the country's human rights minister Silvio Almeida calling it \"immoral\".\nIn a statement, Mr Almeida said: \"It is difficult to believe that Brazilian society, with the countless problems that it has, is currently discussing whether a raped woman and a rapist have the same value in terms of law.\"\nHis comments came as many activists highlighted the jail sentence for someone charged with rape is around 10 years.\nWhile Brazil is led by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's left-wing party, many of the country's lawmakers belong to former President Jair Bolsonaro's right-wing Liberal Party (PL) and other conservative groups.\nPL are the largest party in Congress's Chamber of Deputies, but they will need support from other opposition lawmakers for it to pass.\nNo date has been set yet for a vote in the Congress's Chamber of Deputies.",

    "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was interviewed on BBC Breakfast on Friday and also took questions from the public on BBC Radio 5 Live. He made a number of striking statistical claims on a host of subjects.\nHere we examine some of them.\nHe did not specify what statistical source this was based on and this claim needs context. \nAnnual net migration - the difference between people coming to the UK and leaving - in the year to December 2023 was 685,000.\nAssuming the population increase due to net migration occurred evenly through the year, this would amount to 2.6 people every two minutes.\nThe average UK household occupancy in 2023 was about 2.4 people, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nSo if every new member of the UK population due to net migration last year ended up in a household of 2.4 people and that household required a new home to live in, you could get to a statistic similar to that cited by Mr Farage.\nHowever, this kind of calculation does not take into account some existing homes being vacant, or how many people, on average, live in a household formed by new migrants.\nMoreover, analysts say the interaction of immigration and housing demand is complex - and the main impact is likely to be through house prices and rents.\nThe government\u2019s Migration Advisory Committee, its official advisory body, found evidence in 2018 that a 1% population increase due to migration leads to a 1% rise in house prices.\nBut the Migration Observatory concluded more recently that \u201cit is challenging to establish a causal relationship between the price of housing and the level of immigration with any precision\u201d.\nThis claim is not correct if you look at the latest figures for overall migrant visas. \nMr Farage did not specify which time period he was talking about but in the year ending March 2024, about a third of all visas issued went to dependants.\nHis claim is broadly correct though on the numbers coming on work visas.\nOut of all the work visas issued in the year ending March 2024, 48% were issued to dependants.\nHowever, it is worth noting that dependants of a person on a skilled worker visa or a student visa are not entitled to claim benefits in the UK.\nAnd they are allowed to work - although we don\u2019t know what proportion do so.\nThe UK actually has \u201clow levels of proven electoral fraud\u201d, according to the Electoral Commission, an independent body tasked by Parliament with overseeing UK elections. \nIts data shows that of the 1,462 cases of alleged electoral fraud reported to police between 2019 and 2023, 11 led to convictions and the police issued four cautions.\nOf the five convictions for electoral fraud in elections held in 2019, one of them involved postal ballots.\nThis claim is misleading. \nScientists at Nasa told Reuters in March that human activity has been responsible for around 33% of the total carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. \nThe natural world recycles hundreds of billions of tonnes of CO2 every year. But what really matters for the climate is how CO2 levels change over time.\nWithout human influence, the amount of CO2 produced would roughly equal the amount absorbed - meaning the level of CO2 in the atmosphere would stay roughly the same. \nBut since 1750, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by 50%. It is at its highest level for two million years.\nThe UN\u2019s climate body - the IPCC - produces comprehensive reports on the state of knowledge about global warming, drawing on the work of the world's scientists.\nThe IPCC concluded in its 2023 report that \u201chuman activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming\u201d.\nIt is difficult to come to a verdict on this claim because there is no breakdown of shoplifting prosecutions, by value of goods stolen. \nUnder the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, there are different rules for prosecuting \u201clow-value shoplifting\u201d, defined as theft from a shop of goods valued at under \u00a3200.\nThe maximum sentence for this is six months in prison, but the offence can be dealt with by issuing a fine (which would count as a prosecution). \nThere has been a large increase in shoplifting in recent years.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, in the year ending December 2023 the number of recorded shoplifting offences increased by over a third in England and Wales compared with the previous year.\nThere were 430,000 offences in 2023 compared with 315,000 in 2022.\nIn 2023, more than 31,000 people were prosecuted in England and Wales for theft from shops but these figures do not specify the value of goods stolen. \nAdditional reporting by Tom Edgington, Mark Poynting, Anthony Reuben and Lucy Gilder.\nThis piece was updated to reflect that the Migration Observatory updated - on 15 June - its quote on the relationship between immigration and house prices.  \nWhat claims do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

an annual showcase of new and upcoming titles held in Los Angeles and watched by millions - audiences saw previews of a number of story-rich titles from South Asian teams. \nOne of those was Detective Dotson by Masala Games, based in Gujarat, about a failed Bollywood actor turned detective.\nIndustry veteran Shalin Shodhan is behind the game and tells BBC Asian Network this focus on unique stories is \u201cbucking the trend\u201d in India's games industry.\nHe wants video games to become an \u201cinteractive cultural export\u201d but says he's found creating new intellectual property difficult. \n\u201cThere really isn\u2019t anything in the marketplace to make stories about India,\" he says, despite the strength of some of the country's other cultural industries.\n\u201cIf you think about how much intellectual property there is in film in India, it is really surprising to think nothing indigenous exists as an original entertainment property in games,\" he says. \n\"It\u2019s almost like the Indian audience accepted that we\u2019re just going to play games from outside.\u201d\nAnother game shown during SGF was The Palace on the Hill \u2013 a \"slice-of-life\" farming sim set in rural India.\nMala Sen, from developer Niku Games, says games like this and Detective Dotson are what \u201cIndia needed\u201d.\n\u201cWe know that there are a lot of people in India who want games where characters and setting are relatable to them,\" she says.\nGames developed by South Asian teams based in western countries have been finding critical praise and commercial success in recent years.\nVenba, a cooking sim that told the story of a migrant family reconnecting with their heritage through food, became the first game of its kind to take home a Bafta Game Award this year.\nCanada-based Visai Games, which developed the title, was revealed during SGF as one of the first beneficiaries of a new fund set up by Among Us developer Innersloth to boost fellow indie developers.\nThat will go towards their new, unnamed project based on ancient Tamil legends.\nAnother title awarded funding by the scheme was Project Dosa, from developer Outerloop, that sees players pilot giant robots, cook Indian food and fight lawyers.\nIts previous game, Thirsty Suitors, was also highly praised and nominated for a Bafta award this year.\nGames such as these resonating with players worldwide helps perceptions from the wider industry, says Mumbai-based Indrani Ganguly, of Duronto Games.\n\u201cFinally, people are starting to see we\u2019re not just a place for outsource work,\u201d she says. \n\u201cWe\u2019re moving from India being a technical space to more of a creative hub.\n\u201cI\u2019m not 100% seeing a shift but that\u2019s more of a mindset thing. \n\"People who are able to make these kinds of games have always existed but now there is funding and resource opportunities available to be able to act on these creative visions.\u201d\nBritish-Indian game developer Charu Desodt believes the success of titles such as Venba has been thanks to their commitment to authenticity.\n\u201cThey make me feel very proud,\" she says.\n\"We\u2019re coming to a point where the industry is growing massively, both in terms of hours spent gaming but more importantly in the variety of the games. \n\"When you have authentic local stories told from the heart, that\u2019s something everyone can relate to.\u201d\nCharu says funding for \"unique and quirky stories has been an issue\" but recent successes such as Venba and Thirsty Suitors have shown there is an appetite for south Asian stories told by south Asian developers.\nSome of the industry's biggest companies are also paying attention.\nLast year, Sony launched its India Hero Project with a goal to \u201cunearth and empower India\u2019s brightest game development talents\u201d via mentorship and funding.\nIts first cohort of games included slice-of-life games Fishbowl, museum exploration game Mukti and rhythm-action game Suri: the Seventh Note, inspired by mythical Indian stories from the Himalayas to Rajasthan.\nMeanwhile french publishing giant Ubisoft\u2019s Indie Series has supported Thousand Star Studios in creating Aikyam \u2013 a Bollywood-inspired fantasy roleplaying game set to be released this year.\nCharu says video games and their interactivity allow ",
    "The family of a UK swimmer said they have lost thousands of pounds after buying tickets to see him compete in the Paris Olympics which turned out to be fake.\nMatt Richards' mum Amanda said they were \"completely duped\" after spending \u00a32,500 as they tried to get to see the medal hopeful this summer.\nHer son, from Droitwich, Worcestershire, then took to social media to criticise the games' organisers and said the International Olympic Committee (IOC) should give tickets to the families of competing athletes.\nThe BBC have approached the IOC for a response. \nThe swimmer secured Olympic gold at Tokyo 2020 as a member of the men's 4x200m freestyle relay and could now compete in six events at the games, which begin on 26 July, after qualifying for Team GB.\nMs Richards said the family had entered the official ticket ballot but by the time their turn arrived only the most expensive tickets could be purchased - for 3,000 euros each.\n\"We're just a normal working family, we don't have that kind of that money,\" she said.\n\"We couldn't afford to buy tickets for everything he's swimming in but we wanted to be there for sort of the important ones, the semis and the finals, so we bought tickets for five evening events.\"\nThe family had come across a website which had \"looked perfectly legitimate.\"\nMs Richards said emails confirming the purchases had arrived before they eventually realised it was a scam after spotting spelling and grammatical errors.\n\"I started getting emails asking me for my nominal details... They kept repeatedly coming and asking for those nominal details,\" she told the BBC.\n\"We don't have masses of savings. We just don't have the money to be able to just buy another set of tickets.\n\"We're devastated...I was really upset. I feel like a fool.\"\nPosting on his story on Instagram on Friday, Mr Richards said it was not fair that the Olympic Games should be for those \"who can afford to come and watch\".\n\"It's time that [The Olympic Games] support the families of people competing by giving them tickets to events,\" he posted.\n \"Seeing your family or friends compete at the Olympic Games shouldn't be reserved for the people that have thousands to spare.\"\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Across Scotland there was optimism and excitement as the national team prepared to face Germany in the opening match of Euro 2024.\nBut the Tartan Army endured a miserable night as Germany ran out 5-1 winners.\nIt took only 10 minutes before the three-time European champions took the lead through Florian Wirtz.\nWorse soon followed in a disastrous first half as Jamal Musiala doubled the Germans' lead.\nA Kai Havertz penalty all but ended the game by half-time after Ryan Porteous was given a straight red card.\nSubstitute Niclas F\u00fcllkrug made it 4-0 in the second half before a late own goal by Antonio R\u00fcdiger gave the Scotland fans something to cheer about.\nBut in injury time Emre Can added a fifth to cap the biggest win in the opening match in the 66-year history of the tournament.\nAnticipation for Scotland's first international tournament on foreign soil since the 1998 World Cup in France saw fans gather across the country in pubs and fan zones.\nAnd an estimated 200,000 made the pilgrimage to Germany to cheer on Steve Clarke's men.    \nDespite taking on the tournament hosts, many fans were in upbeat mood ahead of the game and bar staff were braced for a bumper night.\nJennifer Morrison, the event manager at Glasgow's Merchant Square said preparations for the game had been underway \"for months\", with hundreds coming through the doors.\nMany forecast a good result and one even said it felt \"like Christmas Eve\" in the build-up.\nMore than 1,200 fans gathered at Platform in Glasgow city centre, wearing Scotland tops from across the years and waving Saltires.\nBut the good mood swiftly faded and by half-time many were simply hoping it did not get any worse.\nDavid Hunter, from Hamilton, told BBC Scotland News: \"I\u2019m feeling very deflated. \n\"We always said it was a tough ask to go to Munich and get a result in the first game.\n\"It\u2019s damage limitation at the moment.\"\nAlly McGinnigal, 37, from Dennistoun, was already looking ahead to Scotland's remaining fixtures against Switzerland on Wednesday and Hungary on 23 June. \nHe said: \"There\u2019s still two games to go.

Still hopeful. Come on Scotland.\"\nAnother added: \"We knew with the injuries and stuff it was going to be a bit difficult but, we expected more than what\u2019s just gone on just now. But we\u2019ve still got two games left in the group so we\u2019ll win the next two games.\"\nA sense of gloom sank in across the country at the fan zones that had been set up in hope of a party.\nAt Cumbernauld's Broadwood stadium the half-time soundtrack of Deacon Blue's Dignity failed to raise spirits.\nAnd at Riverside Park in Dundee supporters endured foul weather ahead of kick-off.\nOne fan at the fan zone in Inverness called the result \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201cso bad\u201d while another called the performance \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\nBut others retained some hope, saying that the team needed to \"keep their heads up\" for the remaining fixtures. \nAt Dunfermline's East End Park there were three generations of one family in attendance with Peter Nellis joined by his daughter Maria and grandchildren Mason, Megan and Caitlyn.\nMegan told BBC Scotland News: \"It's good for people like me, because I'm not allowed in pubs because of my age, so it's good to be in places like this where we can get a nice atmosphere for the games.\" \nHowever one young fan perhaps summed up the match best.\nHe simply said: \"Everyone was so bad.\"",
    "It is \"insane\" sunbeds are not banned in Northern Ireland as they are elsewhere in the world given their links to skin cancer, an Australian dermatologist has said. \nJim Muir said tanning parlours are known to increase the risk of melanoma \"very significantly\".\nThey have been banned in Australia for more than a decade.\nIt comes as Belfast has been named the \"sunbed capital of the UK\" after data showed 37% of adults in the city use them.\nThe research, by the charity Melanoma Focus, also shows that melanoma skin cancer is on the rise in the UK.\nMr Muir spoke to BBC News NI while visiting Northern Ireland to share his experience of working in Australia, the \"melanoma capital of the world\".\n\"It's mad to go to a tanning parlour. It's just crazy,\" he said, adding that doing so causes premature aging and exposes people to cancer-causing ultraviolet (UV) light. \nMr Muir joked that in Australia \u201cwe can get melanoma and skin cancer for free by going outside\u201d but that sunbed users in Northern Ireland \u201chave to pay for it\u201d.\nOne self-described \"sun worshipper\" who developed skin cancer told BBC News NI not enough is being done to warn people about melanoma risks.\n\"You just look at how much we know about smoking and cancer,\" said Lyn Stevenson. \n\"The risk between sunbeds and not protecting yourself in the sun and cancer is as real, but I don't think we do enough about it.\" \nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) has said skin cancer makes up more than 30% of all cancers detected in Northern Ireland and is usually caused by exposure to UV rays.\nIt can be divided into two types: melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.\nMelanoma is a type that can spread to other areas of the body. The most common sign is the appearance of a new mole or a change in an existing mole. \nThis can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms, and face are most commonly affected.\nIn most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than one colour. \nThey may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed.\nAccording to figures from the NI Cancer Registry, there are about 400 cases of malignant melanoma each year in Northern Ireland, with an average of 60 deaths per year.\nNon-melanoma skin cancer is more common and usually less serious - figures show less than 4,000 cases per year on average, with about 1% of those resulting in death. \nFactors that increase the chances of getting melanoma include age, having pale skin, a large number of moles and a family history of skin cancer.\nBut the main cause is exposure to UV rays, which comes from the sun and is used in sunbeds.\nLyn Stevenson was a \"self-confessed sun worshiper\", who admits that when she was tanned she \"felt healthy, ironically\". \nShe recalled sitting in her garden in summer 2023, when she noticed a new mole on her knee. \nLyn, a pharmacist, knew about the ABCDE checklist, which can be used to assess the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma.\nAnd that evening, she saw a tweet from Action Cancer about its new skin cancer detection service - and \"thought the universe is trying to tell me something\".\nWhen she was diagnosed with malignant melanoma, Lyn was \"completely shocked\" as she did not suffer from painful sunburn when tanning her skin.\nHer cancer was caught early and had not spread. And while she used sunbeds in the past, she added, now \"fake tan and factor 50 would be the rules I live by\".\n\"I look at the number of people who are using sunbeds in Northern Ireland and I want to talk to them and say, do you know what, I was like you, and I didn't think it would happen to me and I didn't think the risk was there.\n\"I get the bit around getting a tan because I did feel that lovely healthy glow, but again, it was far from healthy when it was giving me cancer.\"\nThe most common symptom is the appearance of a new mole, or a change in an existing one.\nThis could be a change in colour, shape or size, or if the mole has become painful or itchy.\nThe NHS also advises people to see their GP if they find a new or unusual mark on your skin that has not gone away after a few weeks.\nAsymmetry: two halves differ in shape\nBorder: edges irregular or jagged\nColour: uneven/patchy; shades of black, white, grey, brown or pink; two or more colours = suspicious\nDiameter: for most melanomas, at least 6mm\nEvolving: changing in size, shape or colour\n\u2018Funny\u2019: if it looks odd, or you aren\u2019t happy about it for any reason get it checked\nIn 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) classified exposure to UV sunlamps, sunbeds and tanning booths as carcinogenic.\nThat same year, Brazil became the first country to ban sunbeds for cosmetic purposes. Australia banned commercial sunbeds in 2013.\nIn Northern Ireland, under-18s are not allowed to use sunbeds - but for Australian dermatologist Mr Muir this does not go far enough.\n\"If it's not safe when you're under 18, it's not safe when you're over 18.\n\"You do sometimes have to protect people from themselves. We have speed limits, we have seatbelts,",
    "A \"neighbour from hell\" has been jailed for ruining the lives of elderly residents in his street - including by walking past their houses in a Spider-Man mask. \nLiam Bain shouted, spat at, intimidated and tormented his neighbours in the Longton area of Lancashire over a decade, police said.  \nOne victim, an 80-year-old man, said Bain had \"ruined his retirement\", while another victim said they had been made a \"prisoner in my own home\". \nBain pleaded guilty to five counts of harassment and was sent to prison for 18 weeks at Preston Crown Court on Monday. \nLancashire Police said all his victims were aged between 60 and 85 during the course of his offending. \nAt one stage, he told them: \"You lot can't do anything about it, I will still be here when all of you are dead.\u201d\nThe court had heard that Bain's bizarre behaviour included staring at one of his neighbours while flexing his muscles and \"shadow-boxing\".\nHe would walk past their houses in a balaclava or Spider-Man mask in an \"intimidatory manner\", and beeped at them with his horn when he drove past them.\nOn other occasions he harassed workmen doing work on two of his neighbour's properties, offering to fight them and challenging them to arm-wrestles. \nBut police said some of his behaviour was more sinister. \nOn one occasion, he sprayed a woman's car with a jet wash as she drove past, and when she got out of the vehicle he soaked her with water and shouted abuse. \nOn another occasion, he shined a laser pen at a woman while she was driving, causing her to swerve. \nThe force said he disrupted his neighbours' sleep by using leaf-blowers and blasting loud music from his van in the early hours of the morning. \nRecorder Kevin Slack, passing sentence, told Bain there was no other way to describe him other than \"a neighbour from hell\". \n\"You have caused the residents of these two streets untold misery without there being any cause for you to behave the way you have,\" the judge said.\nIn a statement read to the court, one of his victims described Bain's behaviour as \"persistent, agonising torment\", while another described themselves as an \"emotional wreck\".\nThe 80-year-old man added: \"I know that when I venture from my home I will suffer intimidation and harassment each time I leave or return.\"\nPC Jenny Fairhurst, who worked on the case, described Bain's offending as a \"sinister campaign of abuse and harassment\".\n\"It shocks me that someone can have such blatant disregard for their neighbours, especially given their ages and vulnerabilities\", she added. \nBain, now of Shakespeare Road in Preston, was hit with a restraining order banning him from entering the two streets where the victims lived or contacting them in any way. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Lawrence Shankland, the Premiership\u2019s 24-goal leading marksman and John McGinn, who needs just one more strike in dark blue to enter the country\u2019s top five all-time leading goalscorers.\nThere could also be a little bit of history on Scotland\u2019s side, although it requires some elastic thinking.\nEuro 2020, played a year later than planned due to the Covid pandemic, had no single host so we can discount Ital",
    "The portrayal of a university academic in a Steve Coogan film about the discovery of Richard III's remains did have a defamatory meaning, a judge has ruled.\nRichard Taylor is suing the comedian, who wrote the film, as well as his production company Baby Cow, and Pathe Production for libel.\nThe film tells the story of historian Philippa Langley and her search to find the king's skeleton under a Leicester car park in 2012.\nMr Taylor launched High Court legal action claiming the film had made him appear \"misogynistic\" and \"weasel-like\". \nThe Lost King focused on the role of historian Philippa Langley in the search, which involved archaeologists from the University of Leicester.\nMr Taylor was the deputy registrar of the University of Leicester at the time and was later played in the film by actor Lee Ingleby.\nAt a preliminary court hearing in February, Judge Jaron Lewis was asked to decide several early issues in the case, including the \"natural and ordinary\" meaning of Mr Taylor's portrayal and whether it was a statement of fact or opinion.\nLawyers for Mr Taylor, formerly deputy registrar of the University of Leicester, said the film - of which Mr Coogan was a writer and a producer - presented him as being \"dismissive, patronising and misogynistic\" towards Ms Langley.\nIn a further judgment on Friday, Judge Lewis ruled the film portrayed Mr Taylor as having \"knowingly misrepresented facts to the media and the public\" about the discovery, and as being \"smug, unduly dismissive and patronising\", which could be defamatory.\nHe said: \"The character Mr Taylor was portrayed throughout the film in a negative light. At no point was he shown in a way that could be described as positive, or even neutral.\n\"Whilst an individual scene may not in itself cross the threshold of seriousness, taken together the film makes a powerful comment about the claimant and the way he conducted himself when undertaking a senior professional role for a university.\n\"The poor way in which he was depicted as behaving towards Ms Langley was contrary to common shared values of our society and would have been recognised as such by the hypothetical reasonable viewer.\"\nThe ruling means the case can now proceed to trial, for which a date has not been set.\nAt the previous hearing, William Bennett KC, representing Mr Taylor, said the film showed him as a \"devious, weasel-like person\" and a \"suited bean-counter\", who was \"mocking\" Richard III's disability.\n\"It's a straightforward, plot-driven film where everything that is said and done matters,\" Mr Bennett said.\nAndrew Caldecott KC, representing Mr Coogan and the two companies, said the film stated it was \"based on a true story\", adding: \"It is not a literal portrayal of exact words and would be understood as putting forward Ms Langley's perception.\"\nHe continued that while the film was \"clearly strongly critical\" of Mr Taylor and the university for \"sidelining\" Ms Langley during the discovery process, \"no reasonable viewer\" would conclude that Mr Taylor's motive was \"sexism or misogynism\".\nWhile Judge Lewis ruled that aspects of Mr Taylor's portrayal could be defamatory, he said he did not think a viewer of the film \"would have come away from the film thinking that it was saying that the claimant was a misogynist or sexist\".\nHe also said someone watching the film would not think Mr Taylor was \"equating Richard III's physical deformity with wickedness or moral failings\" from the portrayal.\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The Parkland, Florida, school building where a gunman killed 17 people six years ago is being torn down, eliciting mixed emotions from still grieving parents. \nThe demolition began on Friday morning as some family members of the victims watched from a distance.\nThe February 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is among the deadliest school shootings in US history. \nThe culprit was sentenced to life without parole in 2022. \nAuthorities invited the families of the students killed in the massacre to watch the first blows to the building if they choose.\nLori Alhadeff, whose 14-year-old daughter Alyssa was killed, told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that she wants the building gone. \n\"It's one more step in the healing process for me and my family,\" she said. \"My son still goes to school there, and he has to walk past that building where his sister died.\" \nLike Ms Alhadeff, Jackson Meaney, a incoming second-year student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, thinks the building's demolition is a \"good thing\".\n\"Nobody really knows what they're going to end up replacing it with,\" Mr Meaney said. \"That'll maybe be interesting to see what they do for that. But [the demolition is] a good thing.\"\nOther parents, however, said they had hoped that the building would be left standing to honour the students who lost their lives. \nAmong them are Gena and Thomas Hoyer, who lost their son Luke during the shooting. \n\"For me, the trouble with the building is it's the last place where Luke was alive,\" Mrs Hoyer said. \"It's hard for me thinking that the building is coming down.\" \nShe acknowledged, however, that she understands the Parkland community and some of the families \"need closure\". \n\"I don't need it for closure for me, there will never be closure, but I do understand the feelings of the community,\" she said. \nThe local school board in Florida's Broward County has yet to determine what will take the building's place.\nPreviously, school administrators had suggested that a field for the school's band or Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, or JROTC, be placed there, together with a pathway to a temporary memorial that was put in place several years ago.\nSome of the students killed during the shooting participated in the school's band or JROTC. \nTony Montalto, whose daughter Gina, 14, died that day, said he would like to see a permanent memorial replace the one currently in place. \n\"We are part of the community, too,\" he told CBS. \nBut Mr Montalto acknowledges there are \"a lot of conflicting emotions\" that come with the demolition of the building. \n\"My son is concerned that people will forget now that the building is being taken down,\" he said.\n\"My wife said she had kind of grown attached to the space as we walked through it so many times with different leaders and policy makers.\"\nThe gunman who carried out the shooting, Nikolas Cruz, was sentenced in November 2022 to life in prison without the possibility of parole. \nThe previous month, a Florida jury voted for him to be spared the death penalty, a decision that sparked outrage among relatives of the victims.
