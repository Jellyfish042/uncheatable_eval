    "1591 campaign by Maurice of Nassau\nMaurice's 1591 campaign was a major campaign during the Eighty Years' War, during the campaign Maurice of Nassau was able to recapture the cities of Nijmegen, Deventer, Zutphen, Delfzijl, Hulst and Knodsenburg.\nBackground\nIn October 1578, Philip II of Spain sent Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma to the Spanish Netherlands as governor and to reconquer the territories previously occupied by the rebels who proclaimed the Union of Utrecht shortly after.\nDuring his service as governor, Alexander Farnese reconquered a lot of territories previously held by the proclaimed Union of Utrecht, including the cities that were captured during the campaign.\nIn 1585, Maurice of Nassau  became Stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland. Shortly after he conducted military reforms that improved the Dutch States Army and made the rebellion against Spain more organized. In 1590, Maurice captured Breda and Steenbergen, which allowed Maurice to launch his respective campaign.\nCampaign\nIn 1590, discussions were already made to start the campaign. The States General discussed over which city would be captured during this campaign, Nijmegen was one of many that was agreed on the recapture. The States General also agreed to capture Zutphen over Geertruidenberg even though it was recaptured by Parma, but they prioritized Zutphen over Geertruidenberg due to the garrison stationed there could cause more damage to the one in Geertruidenberg.\nZutphen\nMain article: Siege of Zutphen (1591)\nThe siege of the city of Zutphen was the first major conflict during this campaign. Maurice of Nassau commenced this siege on the 19th of May and it ended on the 30th of May, the siege lasted 11 days until the garrison was forced to surrender. The city was recaptured by rebel forces.\nDeventer\nMain article: Siege of Deventer (1591)\nThe siege of Deventer took place shortly after the siege of Zutphen. The siege lated from 1 June to 10 June. The rebel forces recaptured the city from the Spanish garrison led by Herman van den Bergh.\nDelfzijl\nMain article: Capture of Delfzijl\nThe capture of Delfzijl began 16 days after the siege of Deventer on 26 June and ended on 2 July. The city was recaptured by the rebel forces after the entire garrison surrendered.\nThe Siege of Knodsenburg was the most major action of this campaign\nKnodsenburg\nMain article: Siege of Knodsenburg\nThe siege of Knodsenburg was the major conflict during this campaign. The Spanish forces led by Alexander Farnese attacked the city on 21 July. The garrison, led by Gerrit de Jong was relieved by an intervention by Maurice of Nassau and Francis Vere. On 25 July, four days after the siege started, Parma was defeated and managed to retreat through the River Waal.\nHulst\nMain article: Siege of Hulst (1591)\nThe siege of Hulst lasted from 20 to 24 September. The commander of the Spanish garrison, Colonel Castillo, asked for terms after five days of resistance, which were accepted.\nNijmegen\nMain article: Siege of Nijmegen (1591)\nThe siege of Nijmegen was the last conflict of this campaign, it lasted from 17 to 21 October, after the Spanish garrison, led by Derrick Vlemminck was forced to surrender. Afterwards the Spanish negotiated the surrender of the city.\nAftermath\nWithin a year, a lot of territories were reconquered by Maurice's army. Maurice later captured Steenwijk, and Coevorden in 1592. This cut off Groningen from Twente, which he would utilize to capture Groningen, which expelled the Spanish from the Northern Provinces.\nA few years after, Maurice started another campaign in 1597, in which he captured more Spanish held cities. These two campaigns were the height of his ten years' campaign.\nNotes\n",

    "The Chanson des Ch\u00e9tifs (\"song of the captives\") is an Old French chanson de geste falling about halfway through the Old French Crusade Cycle (a series of narrative poems about the First Crusade). It takes its name from the fact that its protagonists are \"knights taken prisoner at the start of the Crusade at Civetot in the disastrous defeat of Peter the Hermit's army\".:\u200a7\u200a It is preceded in the cycle by the Chanson d'Antioche, which culminates in the Crusaders' capture of Antioch and followed by the Chanson de J\u00e9rusalem, which recounts the Crusaders' siege and capture of Jerusalem and the Battle of Ascalon that follows.:\u200a3\u200a\nDate and historicity\nUnlike some parts of the Crusade Cycle, the Chanson des Ch\u00e9tifs has no basis in historical reality. It survives largely in thirteenth-century manuscripts; according to Carol Sweetenham, \"there are no precise indications for dating either the Ch\u00e9tifs or the J\u00e9rusalem, but given the manuscript tradition an assumption of early thirteenth century would not be too wide of the mark for either\".:\u200a4\u200a That said, the text itself attributes the Sathanas episode of the chanson to a commission by Raymond of Poitiers, the ruler of Antioch, datable to the period 1136\u201349, which may indeed reflect the oral or written origin-point for that episode.:\u200a13\u200a\nSummary\nThe following summary is based on that by Carol Sweetenham.:\u200a59\u201361\u200a\nLaisses 1\u20138: prologue\nFollowing the defeat of the Turkish army by the Crusaders at Antioch, the Turks' general Corbaran of Oliferne returns to Sarmasane, where the Sultan of Persia holds court. The Sultan accuses Corbaran of treachery on account of the Sultan's son Brohadas dying in battle while under Corbaran's protection. Corbaran, amongst others, pleads his case with the Sultan.\nLaisses 9\u201351: judicial duel(s)\nThe Sultan concludes that Corbaran's guilt should be tried by judicial combat, stipulating that Corbaran must find a Christian champion to prove his innocence by defeating two Turkish champions (later named as Sorgal\u00e9 and Golias).\nCorbaran's mother Calabra recommends a Christian prisoner (ch\u00e9tif) held in Oliferne: Richard of Chaumont. Richard strikes a bargain: he will fight on Corbaran's behalf if the prisoners are all freed. According to Sweetenham, \"an extra two laisses describing Calabra\u2019s divination with a magic cloth are inserted after laisse 24 in most manuscripts\").:\u200a59\u200a Corbaran brings Richard and the freed prisoners to Sarmasane, where Richard kills the Turkish champions and the Sultan recognises Corbaran's innocence.\nHowever, Lyon of the Mountain (one of Sorgal\u00e9\u2019s relatives) and Arfulan (one of Golias's sons) seek to avenge Sorgal\u00e9's death: Lyon leads an ambush of Corbaran; Arfulan attempts to kill him during a banquet. At this point, following laisse 40, manuscript B uniquely includes a further episode, in which a Breton knight named Cainan again accuses Corbaran of betraying the Sultan; this time Corbaran's champion is Harpin of Bourges, who dispatches Corbaran's accuser.\nIn all manuscripts, after Lyon and Arfulan's attempts at vengeance fail, the two team up to ambush Corbaran. A prophetic dream warns Corbaran of the threat, and he and his men defeat the would-be ambushing forces.\nLaisses 52\u2013103: defeating Sathanas (and his mother)\nCorbaran sets out from Sarmasane with the former prisoners to return to Oliferne. Yet a storm descends and they lose their way, thus coming to the dangerous Mount Tigris, which is inhabited by a monstrous serpent named Sathanas.\nMount Tigris lies in the realm of one Abraham, an under-king of the Sultan. The text later explains that Abraham has asked the Sultan to help him defeat Sathanas, but in the meantime Abraham must send his annual tribute to the Sultan via Mount Tigris. He convinces one of his own Christian captives, Ernoul, to undertake this perilous mission. As it happens, Sathanas attacks Ernoul and eats him just when Corbaran's company is passing nearby. One of the former prisoners with Corbaran, Baldwin of Beauvais, is Ernoul's brother; recognising his brother's screams, Baldwin ascends the mountain to seek vengeance. Aided by a holy talisman, he slays Sathanas and exorcises a demon that had possessed him. \nTrusting in Baldwin's prowess, the ex-prisoners ascend the mountain, followed by a sceptical Corbaran, are reunited with Baldwin, and find Sathanas's treasure-hoard.\nAt this point in manuscripts B and I, Corbaran and his companions encounter Sathanas's monstrous and vengeful mother, but survive.\nIn all manuscripts, the Sultan now arrives with his army to defeat Sathanas, and greets Corbaran with joy. Corbaran at last proceeds home to Oliferne, while the Sultan returns to his court.\nLaisses 104\u201328: Corbaran's nephew\nHarpin, one of the former prisoners, witnesses a wolf seize Corbaran's nephew. Harpin pursues the wolf. The boy is taken from the wolf by a large monkey, who carries him up a tree. While waiting to rescue the boy, Harpin defeats four lions; the monkey accidentally drops the boy, and Harp",

    "James MacLellan, born c. 1661 at Auchlane Castle in Kelton, Kirkcudbrightshire, Dumfries & Galloway, Scotland, was the 5th Lord Kirkcudbright, a title he held from 1721 until his passing in 1730. He was the son of William MacLellan and Jean McGhie, and his life would be marked by both personal and legal challenges.\nBiography\nIn his early years, James found himself at the heart of local affairs. By November 1682, he was already involved in legal matters, as indicated by a bond of relief while residing at Auchlane. This engagement with the law hinted at the complexities of life that lay ahead. In 1685, he was noted among those who did not attend King James II's coronation procession, a political choice that placed him squarely within the tumultuous landscape of Scotland's shifting allegiances.\nJames married Marie Drummond, a union that, despite lacking a formal marriage contract, blossomed into a partnership that welcomed three daughters: Janet, Mary, and Margaret. Their lives together were intertwined with property dealings and legal disputes that seemed almost a hallmark of that era. In December 1686, James ensured Marie's financial security with an annual rent of 400 merks, showcasing his commitment to family amidst the uncertainties of land ownership and debt.\nThe Lords of Kirkcudbright, being no timeservers, but staunch Presbyterians and thorough loyalists, risked all and lost all for, first, conscience, and, then, The Crown; hence the poverty of John, 3rd Lord; James, 5th Lord\u00a0; and William, 6th Lord.\nLord Kirkcudbright\u2019s dealings with land were significant. In 1686, he transferred land to Samuel McClellan, but this transaction did not quell the disputes that would plague him. By the end of 1687, he faced decrees from various creditors, illustrating the ever-looming pressures of financial obligations. Nevertheless, he continued to navigate these challenges, securing tacks of lands and mills, showcasing a resilience that would define much of his life.\nIn 1702, James was admitted as a Burgess of Kirkcudbright, a sign of his growing influence and status within the community. By 1710, he was actively engaging in land leases. MacLellan does not appear to have assumed the title Lord Kirkcudbright until his vote was urgently required and was of value in an election of Representative Peers in 1721, when there was a keen contest between the Earls of Aberdeen and Eglinton. His vote was objected to, but he voted at that and subsequent Elections of Peers up to 1727, thus affirming his place in the extensive narrative of Scotland's governance.\nThe years that followed brought recognition and responsibility. In 1725, he was granted privileges within the Incorporated Trades of Kirkcudbright, reflecting his integration into the economic and social fabric of the town. On 15 Feb 1729, James MacLellan of Auchlane was formally served heir to his uncle John, 3rd Lord Kirkcudbright.\nMacLellan is sometimes referred to as the 6th Lord Kirkcudbright, a common misconception that arises due to the fact that in 1668, his brother, John McClellan of Auchlane, made a supplication as heir of the deceased William MacLellan, 4th Lord Kirkcudbright, as nephew of John MacLellan, 3rd Lord Kirkcudbright, but immediately renounced his right as heir because he was pursued by his father William MacLellan of Auchlane's creditors and lacked sufficient funds to pay off his debts. Nevertheless, he is occasionally referred to as a Lord Kirkcudbright, despite the fact that he never possessed the title.\nWith the death of James, 5th Lord Kirkcudbright in 1730, the succession became the subject of much litigation between the three main claimants: Ephraim McClellan of Barmagachan, James, son of Sir Samuel McClellan, and William McClellan of Borness who eventually succeeded.\n",

    "Fantasy live action role-playing game\nCover art by Mike Bjornson\nSwordtag is a set of rules for a fantasy live-action role-playing game (LARP) published  by The Adventurers' Guild in 1988 in which players take on character roles, dress in \"play\" armor and fight each other with boffer weapons.\nGameplay\nSwordtag is set of basic rules for a fantasy LARP. Players can be one of nine character classes, largely drawn from Dungeons & Dragons, such as thief, mage, warrior, or bard. (In the updated Swordtag II booklet, this was increased to fifteen character classes.) The booklet gives an outline of combat and magic, and provides instructions on how to construct a boffer weapon or create a wand of light from a paper towel tube and a flashlight.\nPublication history\nThe concept of Swordtag was created by Brett Dougherty and was published by The Adventurers' Guild in 1988 as a digest-sized booklet with artwork by Mike Bjornson titled The Adventurer's Guild Swordtag Rulebook. This was followed two years later by the updated and expanded Swordtag II \u2013 The Gamebook.\nReception\nIn his 1990 book The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games, game critic Rick Swan was largely dismissive of the first edition of Swordtag, noting, \"Swordtag is more of an outline than an actual game; in spite of some engaging ideas, there's barely enough information to stage a brief encounter, let alone an entire adventure.\" Swan concluded by giving the game a poor rating of only 1.5 out of 4.\nStewart Wieck reviewed Swordtag II - The Gamebook in White Wolf #27 (June/July, 1991), and noted that the most useful information was how to construct equipment such as helmets, shields and swords. Wieck concluded by giving this booklet a rating of 4 out of 5, stating, \"\"Overall, it's relatively simple to pass judgment on this product. If you're interested in Live-Action gaming, then this is a fine way to find out more and get involved immediately.\"\n",
    "New Tokushima Broadcasting (\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u5fb3\u5cf6\u653e\u9001) was a proposed television station in Tokushima Prefecture. The station was supposed to use the JOTI-TV calls and broadcast on UHF channel 40. The coverage area was also supposed to include part of Awaji Island in Hyogo Prefecture.\nHistory\nNew Tokushima Broadcasting announced on November 18, 1969, that its callsign was going to be JOTI-TV (later obtained by Kagoshima Broadcasting in 1982) and its frequency was UHF channel 40 (later used by the Tokushima station of NHK E). Preparations for its establishment were hampered due to an incident involving a member of the operating organization (it is said that the plan to open the channel was scrapped). The deadline for establishing a company to obtain this license was not met in time, and in the end, the license expired on May 1, 1970, and the station was not opened.\nAfter that, there were moves to open a second commercial television station in Tokushima Prefecture, but due to spillover, especially along the coast, it was difficult to receive TV stations in the Kinki area and other areas headquartered in Osaka City, so the station was opened in 1959. A second commercial television station has not opened since Shikoku Broadcasting, and the frequency allocated to Tokushima Prefecture was canceled in May 1997, partly due to the promotion of digital terrestrial television broadcasting. Additionally, since there is a possibility that there may be an increase in the number of areas where it is difficult to view digital terrestrial TV broadcasts, the prefecture has set up reception bases for cable TV (some cable TV stations have started retransmitting some stations).\nJNN, ANN, and FNN, which currently have no affiliate stations in Tokushima Prefecture, are in charge of coverage of news coverage in the prefecture, respectively, by quasi-key stations in Osaka (Mainichi Broadcasting, Asahi Broadcasting Television, Kansai Television).\n",

W. Surface of Amoco, and was first drilled on December 23 or 29, 1934. Within two days of the discovery, Edgar F. Bullard, also of Amoco, purchased the deed to the land, for $1 per acre. The price soon rose to $5,000 per acre. On October 1, 1958, Hastings Oilfield split between Hastings West and East due to the Long Point\u2013Eureka Heights fault system. Production had stagnated by 1990. In 2009, Denbury Resources acquired the land from Venoco, for $201 million. In 2010, production resumed.\nGeology\nThe Hastings Oilfield is situated in the Frio Deep-Seated Salt Dome Fields. Its oil dates to the Oligocene, with the Marginlina, Frio and Vicksburg formations.\nOil production\nIn 1984, 656.2 million barrels were produced; 108.4 million from Hastings East and 547.8 million from Hastings West. 12.7 million barrels were produced a day; 1.06 from Hastings East and 11.6 from Hastings West.

A martial arts movie, it is the only film that Alexander Fu Sheng ever directed.\nPlot\nTou Kuan is a rich spoiled son of a wealthy woman from Guandong, in 19-century southern China. He often outsmarts his opponents and is always accompanied by his advisor and best friend Mai Song. One day, while bullying his teacher, his greedy uncle Shih Chun notices the commotion. He tries to convince his sister that her son is not worthy of inheriting her wealth but ultimately fails when Tou Kuan and his friend quickly clean up the mess, threaten his teacher and pretend to be studying, which impress his mom. Mai Song later challenges the martial arts master and his student to a fight, but Tou Kuan easily defeats them and is bored because he wanted a much harder challenge.\nTou Kuan later meets a mahjong player nicknamed \"Mr Blinker\", whom Tou Kuan had previously defeated numerous times in the game. Despite \"Mr Blinker\" bringing another mahjong expert and attempting to cheat, Tou Kuan manages to outsmart them all and force \"Mr Blinker\" to swallow mahjong blocks. Tou Kuan and Mai Song later run away after mistakenly punching \"Mr Blinker\"'s father, a local official. In the meantime, in an attempt to get rid of his nephew to inherit Tou Kuan's mother's wealth, Shih Chun meets a Taoist assassin nicknamed \"3 Eyes\" (named for his eye tattoo on his forehead). Shih Chun reluctantly agrees to split Tou Kuan's wealth in half as a payment after the assassin threatens to kill him. Their discussion is interrupted by a brief but vicious fight in which a constable disguised as a customer attempts to arrest the assassin and is killed, showing the assassin's prowess. \"3 Eyes\" says that Shih Chun's nephew must leave Guandong and that he doesn't want to be directly involved in the assassination attempt, so he will send another assassin to murder Tou Kuan while on a journey.\nShih Chun later convinces Tou Kuan's mother to tell her son to travel outside to search for a wife. Although he initially refuses, Mai Song later convinces Tou Kuan to travel northward to Beijing to take on the \"Three Northern Witty Young Masters\" in order to improve Tou Kuan's status as a \"Young Master\".\nBefore stepping on a passenger ship, Mai Song assures Tou Kuan that he will have \"entertainment\" while on the ship. A henchman of \"3 Eyes\" later attempts to kill Tou Kuan, but Tou Kuan manages to avoid the assassin. A tough man paid by Mai Song to fight Tou Kuan later beats and throws the assassin off the ship after mistaking the assassin for Tou Kuan.\nArriving in the north, the two men take a break in a straw field. Tou Kuan later defecates and encountered another bandits/assassin who he mistook for another thugs paid by Mai Song to challenge Tou Kuan.\nThey manage to find one of the northern \"Young Masters\" named Che Zai, who is actually con artist, in a restaurant. Che Zai has massive wealth including collections of western luxurious good and a flintlock pistol that Tou Kuan purchases. The two men go to an imperial guard recruitment near the Forbidden City. There they are fooled by a court employee, apparently paid Che Zai to bring the two \"volunteers\" to a \"shortcut\" to the imperial guard recruitment which turns out to be a surgery room for castrate volunteers to become court eunuchs. Barely escaping, Tou Kuan is given a yellow magua vest as a gift by Che Zai for supposed immunity from the law, though it is actually fake. They again barely escape the police after Mai Song fires a shot from the purchased pistol.\nThey later encounter another \"Young Master\", Ren Zhen-hao, a womanizer with a Western appearance in a snooker club. Zhen-hao challenges Tou Kuan to flirt with a woman dressed in red. Tou Kuan and Mai Song attempt to fake an assault to have the gain feelings for Tou Kuan, but this fails when the woman turns out to be an expert fighter and defeats Tou Kuan. Zhen-hao takes the opportunity to fake and injury and gain the woman's sympathy.\nZhen-hao again challenge Tou Kuan, this time a daughter of a Russian ambassador. Tou Kuan and Mai Song later infiltrate the Russian consulate by pretending to be a wax statue and a consulate employee respectively. Zhen-hao meanwhile attempts to fake suicidal emotion using a realistic-looking suicide instrument to woo the Russian woman, almost getting himself killed because the disguised Tou Kuan has swapped the fake suicide instrument with its real counterpart. The Russian woman quickly rejects Zhen-hao after discovering his fake act. Tou Kuan is almost caught after he blows his cover to approach the Russian woman, but is later spared after the Russian woman's aunt intervenes. The aunt is also in love with Mai Song and has a much greater influence than her niece's ambassador father. \nZhen-hao admits defeat and brings the two men to mee",

    "\nHistoric site in Queensland, Australia\nAllan Cunningham Monument is a heritage-listed monument on the Cunningham Highway, Cunningham's Gap, near the boundary of Tregony in the Southern Downs Region and Tarome in Scenic Rim Region, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Dornbusch & Connolly and built in 1927. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 April 2022.\nHistory\nThe Allan Cunningham Monument, located 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) north-east of Warwick, was constructed in 1927 to commemorate the centenary of the explorer Allan Cunningham's achievements in traversing the Great Dividing Range and documenting a pass through the mountains in 1828. Cunningham's Gap, as it became known, had long been important to the traditional owners, the Yuggera Ugarapul people, of the Fassifern Valley, and would become the main connecting link between the Darling Downs in the west to south-east Queensland and its coast in the east. The monument's construction coincided with the opening of a road through the pass, and it quickly became a tourist attraction, standing amidst the rainforest of the Main Range National Park.\nThe valley between Mount Mitchell and Mount Cordeaux, today known as Cunningham's Gap, had long provided a pathway for Indigeneous people from the Darling Downs in the west and the Fassifern Valley in the east below. A Dreamtime story tells of the Yuggera Ugarapul People of the Fassifern Valley rounding up all the kangaroos and holding them in a fenced enclosure so no other clan could catch them. However, an old woman released the captured animals and, as they bounded west across the range, they tore the gap between the two mountains.\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans in Queensland, the elevated and verdant grass plains of the southern Darling Downs, below what was to become known as Cunningham's Gap, were the traditional lands of the Githabal people. Githabal were known for their careful and deliberate use of fire for the management and maintenance of the grasslands of the Darling Downs (often termed fire-stick farming). The traditional method they used ensured the grasses and other plant species would regenerate and supply a reliable food source for the Githabal People as well as for game animals such as kangaroo and wallabies.\nAllan Cunningham\nAllan Cunningham (1791\u20131839) was an experienced, British explorer and botanist in Australia from 1817, joining both terrestrial and nautical expeditions with other explorers, such as John Oxley and Phillip Parker King, before leading his own expeditions through the country north of Bathurst and west of the Blue Mountains. He made important contributions to both Australian exploration and to botany, and was highly respected by his contemporaries. He died in 1839 and five years later an obelisk memorial was dedicated to him in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, reflecting this esteem. Later, in 1901, his remains were moved from a Sydney cemetery and interred within this obelisk.\nIn April 1827, after gaining the support of General Ralph Darling, the new governor of New South Wales, Cunningham led a team of six men and eleven horses north. By early June 1827, they had reached the south-eastern edge of what became known as the Darling Downs and were immediately impressed by the lush plains that stretched far to the north, bounded by forested mountains to the east. Cunningham reported to the governor that:\"From these central grounds, rise downs of a rich, black, and dry soil, and very ample surface; as they furnish an abundance of grass, and are conveniently watered, yet perfectly beyond the reach of those floods \u2026 they constitute a valuable and sound sheep pasture\".The British exploration party did not recognise that the grassy plains were the result of the Githabal people's careful management of the Southern Downs country over generations.\nOn this journey, Cunningham named the Condamine River, one of the major waterways on the Darling Downs. He also identified a possible pass over the dividing range to the coast, which would later be known as Spicer's Gap. The party returned to Sydney in mid-June 1827. Just over one year later, in August 1828, Cunningham headed another expedition, with two bullocks, two servants and a driver, from Ipswich (then known as Limestone) and followed the Bremer River, a tributary of the Brisbane River, south-west. The expedition's main purpose was to locate the pass that they found the previous year, but from the east side of the Great Dividing Range.\nAfter travelling for several days, the expedition arrived at the foot of the mountain range where they camped. Cunningham noted the presence of aboriginal people's camps in the distance:\"the smoke of natives\" fires was seen curling above the trees a little to the eastward of us, but these people kept themselves very quiet, not a voice heard, or a person seen\"Cunningham and his men reached what they believed was the gap they identified the previous year from the west (Spicer's Gap), bu",

    "1977 live album by Carmen McRae\nRonnie Scott's Presents Carmen McRae 'Live' is a live album by American singer Carmen McRae, recorded during the singer's July concerts at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in 1977. The recording also featured pianist Marshall Otwell, bassist John Gianelli and drummer Joey Baron. The album was released the same year in the United Kingdom by Pye Records.\nOverview\nMacRae first performed at Ronnie Scott's in 1975, but with British musicians. According to her, she felt uncomfortable without her trio. In addition, she admitted that British musicians are more clamped down compared to Americans. Also she caught a cold during two weeks of performances, and the applause from the audience seemed to her more respectful than sincere. In 1977, the singer returned to the club stage with her band and successfully held a series of concerts.\nCritical reception\nMike Hennessey, music critic and editor of Jazz Journal International, noted that MacRae was in great shape, singing with that effortless grace and authority that stems from years of hard work, and talking between songs with that easy, outrageous frankness that characterizes a born performer who feels at home in an intimate club the atmosphere.\nTrack listing\n\"Introduction By Ronnie Scott\"\n\"If You Could See Me Now\" (Tadd Dameron, Carl Sigman)\u00a0\u2013 3:18\n\"Sometimes I'm Happy\" (Irving Caesar, Vincent Youmans)\u00a0\u2013 2:45\n\"I'm Gonna Lock Away My Heart and Throw Away the Key\" (Jim Eaton, Terry Shand)\u00a0\u2013 3:10\n\"Baby Won't You Please Come Home\" (Charles Warfield, Clarence Williams)\u00a0\u2013 3:52\n\"Poor Butterfly\" (John Golden, Raymond Hubbell)\u00a0\u2013 3:45\n\"Evergreen\" (Barbra Streisand, Paul Williams)\u00a0\u2013 2:55\n\"Sunday\" (Chester Conn, Benny Krueger, Ned Miller, Jule Styne)\u00a0\u2013 5:23\n\"Weaver of Dreams\" (Jack Elliott, Victor Young)\u00a0\u2013 3:07\n\"Get Out of Town\" (Cole Porter)\u00a0\u2013 2:26\n\"With One More Look at You\" (Kenny Ascher, Paul Williams)\u00a0\u2013 4:42\n\"Miss Brown\" (Richard A.

    "Fictional character from Vampire: The Masquerade\nFictional character\nJeanette Voerman is a character from the 2004 video game Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines, an action role-playing video game developed by Troika Games and published by Activision. Set in White Wolf Publishing's World of Darkness setting, the game is based on White Wolf's tabletop role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade. Created by Brian Mitsoda, an early version of her character was debuted in the E3 demo for the game as a means to attract the attention of journalists. In game she is voiced by Grey DeLisle-Griffin, and on the box art and promotional artwork for the title portrayed by Erin Layne. In live action media, she has been portrayed by Whitney Moore in L.A. by Night.\nShe is one of the two vampire co-Barons of Santa Monica, California and owner of the Asylum night club, the other being Therese Voerman. Though both regard the other as their twin sister, it is Jeanette is the alter of Therese, who due to abuse has dissociative identity disorder. Neither is dominant or aware they share the same body, and Jeanette actively works to sabotage Therese. In books for the role-playing game, it is established that Asylum has become a global franchise, with Jeanette and Therese alternatively managing either the Santa Monica or Hollywood locations.\nJeanette has been cited as one of the best aspects of Bloodlines, praised for both her character design and character, and introduction and portrayal helped set the tone of the game. While some have criticized her character's sexualization as fanservice intended for a male audience, others have argued it works in line with her character and cited her high popularity with fan communities who have portrayed her through cosplay. Her relationship with her other personality Therese has also been analyzed, both through the scope of their contrasting personalities and how their issues reflect perceptions of successful women in the modern age.\nConception and design\nJeanette was written for Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines by Brian Mitsoda, who described her as a \"combination of seduction, mischief, tragedy, and madness\". One of the first character models made for the game, during the E3 demo Jeanette was not fully fleshed out. He wrote an early treatment of her as a \"sexpot seductress fit for the E3 crowd to make the journalists collectively say 'garsh', blush and wave shyly\", placing her in the game's strip club location to give players a quest to follow for the demo. As her character was developed and moved to another night club location in the game, Mitsoda was told to have her be more akin to her E3 version as the team leads felt she was not \"sexy enough\". Not wanting to undermine the character Jeanette had become, he wrote another character, Velvet Velour, to satisfy their mandates, and placed her in the strip club.\nAs the game takes place in White Wolf Publishing's World of Darkness setting, Jeannette is defined as a vampire belonging to the Malkavian clan, who are inflicted with mental issues. Jeanette is the alter of Therese Voerman, a woman suffering from dissociative identity disorder, caused in response to abuse Therese suffered as a child. Both are fully developed personalities unaware of the other within the same body, and neither is considered the dominant personality, instead regarding one another as siblings. To portray it accurately, Mitsoda studied cases of the affliction, while other aspects of her character were based on an ex-girlfriend.\nJeanette is a pale woman with eyeshadow smeared heavily around her eyes and her blonde hair trussed into two pigtails on either side of her head. Her outfit consists of a sexualized catholic schoolgirl outfit with a short blue skirt, white thigh-high stockings, a red choker, and brown shoes. Her underwear band is raised on each hip above the skirt, while her shirt is unbuttoned and tied below her breasts, exposing her cleavage and red bra. On the game's cover and promotional material she is portrayed by professional model Erin Layne, who was offered the job after a chance meeting with Shane DeFreest of Activision, the game's publisher. The photographs were taken by artist Tim Bradstreet, with the instructions for the photographs for the cover art to convey a \"alluring and mysterious mood\". In-game, Jeanette and Therese are both voiced by Grey DeLisle-Griffin, with the primary difference being delivery and tone.\nAppearances\nJeanette Voerman is a vampire in the 2004 video game action role-playing video game Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines, developed by Troika Games and based on White Wolf Publishing's Vampire: The Masquerade role-playing game. Acting as co-Barons of Santa Monica within the vampire society, they are actively hostile to one another.

    "Village of Gro\u00dfheide in Lower Saxony, Germany\nArle is an East Frisian village in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is an Ortsteil of the municipality of Gro\u00dfheide, in the Aurich district. The formerly independent municipality was incorporated into Gro\u00dfheide with the municipal reform law of 1 July 1972.\nHistory\nArle, located on the edge of a geest, was already a provostship under the archbishopric of Bremen in the 12th century, although under the name Erle. Unlike the neighboring M\u00fcnster area, its provosts were not rich noblemen, but incumbent clergymen. The St. Boniface Church was built from tuff on a high mound at this time.\nA tower in Arle was mentioned in 1408, among the castles that were taken by the Hamburgers with the support of Keno tom Brok. The castle later belonged to Hebe, the daughter of L\u00fctet Attenas, and her son Keno. Through his daughter Sophie, the castle came to the Howerda family in 1545, who became the sole owners of Arle. In 1613, Focko Beninga acquired Dreesche \u2013 a hamlet near Arle, probably by purchase. However, ownership changed in 1717 to the Barons of Wedel and in 1786 to the House of Innhausen and Knyphausen of L\u00fctetsburg.

    "Sports car racing category in Australasia\nThe TA2 Racing Muscle Car Series is an Australian motor racing category using TA2 class cars most closely associated  with the American Trans-Am Series.  It is the featured category at all rounds of the Hi-Tec Oils Super Series, an annual motor racing series held at various tracks in eastern Australia. The category is managed by TA2 Racing Australia, a company associated with the distributors of the Howe Racing chassis in Australia, and sanctioned by the Australian Auto Sport Alliance.\nIt is one of two Australian national-level racing series featuring TA2-class cars; the other is the Australian National Trans-Am Series. While run independently, both series feature identical cars, and the TA2 series organisers have changed technical regulations to keep cars eligible for both series.\nHistory\nThe category was established after driver and businessman Peter Robinson imported a Howe Racing Enterprises TA2-spec vehicle, with the intention of competing in a Queensland state-based sports sedan series. According to Robinson and colleague Craig Harris, they thought the relatively low purchase and operating cost, and the good performance of the vehicle made it a good basis for a one-make racing series.\nIn 2020, racing promotor ARG licensed the rights to the Trans-Am trademarks in Australia. However, an agreement between ARG and TA2 Racing Australia fell through, and TA2 Racing Australia opted to continue running the category as part of the AASA-sanctioned \"Australian Motor Racing Series\" (in 2024, branded as the Hi-Tec Oils Super Series).\nARG subsequently set up their own series based on the same cars, the Australian National Trans-Am Series.\nThe 2020 and 2021 series were affected by the global Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, due to competitors being unable to travel between Australian states due to quarantine restrictions, two separate titles were awarded, a northern and southern series.\nCars\nMain article: Trans-Am racing in Australia\nThe TA2 Racing Muscle Car Series is a spec series using identical spaceframe chassis built by Howe Racing Enterprises and using a modified GM LS3 engine. Most components are controlled, must be purchased from the vehicle's Australian distributor, and cannot be modified.\nThe cars may use one of three fibreglass bodies resembling the Chevrolet Camaro, Ford Mustang, or Dodge Challenger; regardless of the car body, the underlying chassis and engines are the same.\nMeeting format\nThe championship has generally been held over approximately six rounds. Of these rounds, most have three or four sprint races of approximately 20\u201330 minutes duration.\nAfter a free practice session on the Friday of a race meeting, starting order for the first race of most race meetings is determined by a qualifying session. Starting order for subsequent races is determined by the finishing order in the immediately previous race.\nIn 2023 and 2024, one \u201cenduro round\u201d per season was held featuring a race of approximately one hour in length, with the option of a co-driver.\nUnlike many circuit racing series in Australia, this series features \"rolling starts\" where the cars form up in grid order (in two rows) behind a safety car for a formation lap before commencing racing.\nMedia coverage\nThe 2024 series is broadcast on SBS, through subscription TV providers Fox Sports (Australia) and Kayo Sports, and an extended livestream covering some practice and qualifying sessions as well as races on YouTube and SBS On Demand.\nThe series is covered by specialist motor racing publications including Auto Action and SpeedCafe.\nChampions\n",

    "Klaus Warncke (14 June 1937 \u2013 2 January 1993) was a German schoolteacher, zoologist and entomologist who specialized in the Hymenoptera. He took a special interest in the genus Andrena of the Palearctic.\nWarncke was born in Neustrelitz, the second of four children of physician Kurt and Thusnelda n\u00e9e Schr\u00f6ter. The family moved to Samtredia near Posen in 1939 and moved in 1945 to Mecklenburg, Berlin and finally settled in Braunschweig in 1952. After graduating from high school in 1958 he went to study in Mainz followed by studies in Freiburg and Munich. He received his doctorate in 1964 with studies on Aconitum lycoctonum. He travelled in Iceland, Italy, and Spain, taking an interest in ornithology. He married Ulrike Winklat-Zedtwitz in 1964 and they had a son. He became a teacher in Munich and Vilshofen, later at Hilpoltstein and Schrobenhausen. From 1970 he taught at Dachau dealing mainly with biology and geography. He made his students study bees and other wild fauna in the field as part of studies. In 1961 he was advised by Walter Forster of the zoological collections at Munich to study the genus Andrena as it was very poorly studied. Warncke then spent 30 years examining these and other related genera. In 1964 he began to make trips to Anatolia to collect specimens. Along with Robert Wilhelm Gr\u00fcnwaldt, he also collected in Greece. He wrote several papers on the genera Andrena, Rophues, Anthidium, Halictus,  Pasites, Osmia, Sphecodes, Coelioxys and Slelis. He described nearly 57 new higher level taxa (mostly subgenus level) and 887 species.\nWarncke and his second wife Christa were killed in a car accident in Cairo.\n",

    "Town hall in Rouen, France\nThe H\u00f4tel de Ville (French pronunciation: , City Hall) is a historic building in Rouen, Seine-Maritime, northern France, standing on Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle. The garden fa\u00e7ade and roofs were designated a monument historique by the French government in 1948.\nHistory\nThe old H\u00f4tel de Ville on Rue du Gros-Horloge\nThe city council initially held its meetings in the Halle aux Marchands, close to the \u00c9glise Saint-\u00c9loi, in the mid-12th century. It then met in a building on Rue du Gros-Horloge, previously belonging to Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, which was granted to them by Philip II in 1220. After the second H\u00f4tel de Ville became dilapidated, a third H\u00f4tel de Ville was erected on Rue du Gros-Horloge to a design by Jacques Gabriel in the Renaissance style in 1607. After nearly two centuries of use, the third H\u00f4tel de Ville became inadequate and was sold for commercial use in 1796. In the late 18th century, the city council was briefly accommodated in the H\u00f4tel de la Premi\u00e8re Pr\u00e9sidence on Rue Saint-L\u00f4, which had been designed by Jean-Jacques Martinet and completed in 1721.\nThe current building was commissioned as a dormitory for the monks of Saint-Ouen Abbey on a site to the immediate north of the abbey. It was designed by Jean-Pierre Defrance and Jean-Baptiste Le Brument in the neoclassical style, built in ashlar stone and was completed in the mid-18th century. However, it became vacant in 1790 and the city council decided to acquire the former abbey dormitory and moved into the building in May 1800.  A programme of works to convert the former dormitory into a municipal building was carried out to a design by Charles-Felix Maillet du Boullay and was completed in 1825.\nThe design involved a symmetrical main frontage of 19 bays facing onto a new square, with the end sections of the three bays each projected forward as pavilions. The ground floor was rusticated and arcaded with a series of round headed openings. The central section of three bays, which was also projected forward, featured a tetrastyle portico on the first floor: it was formed by Corinthian order columns supporting an entablature and a modillioned pediment, with a coat of arms in the tympanum. The building was fenestrated by casement windows with moulded surrounds and cornices and, at roof level, there was a balustraded parapet. Internally, although the principal room was the council chamber, there was a public library on the first floor and a museum on the second floor.\nAn equestrian statue of Napoleon by the sculptor, Gabriel-Vital Dubray, was unveiled in front of the building by the industrialist, Henri Barbet, on 15 August 1865. The building was badly damaged in a fire on the night of 30 December 1926 and, although the paintings and statues were saved, the municipal archives were destroyed. The building was subsequently restored to a design by Edmond Lair.\nOn 19 April 1944, during the Second World War, the building was damaged by American aerial bombing. Following the liberation of France, the flag of France was hoist on the building by local residents in August 1944.\n",

In 1802, it was entirely rebuilt by the local stonemason James Smith, using stone from a redundant church in Bransdale.  The church was restored in 1880, from which time most of the details date.  In 1902, it was again restored, this time by Temple Moore, replacing the tower with a belfry.  It was grade II listed in 1955.\nView from the nave into the chancel\nThe church is built in limestone, rendered on the north side, and has a stone flag roof.  It consists of a continuous nave and chancel, and a south porch.  At the west end is a square timber belfry with louvred openings, surmounted by a lead broach spire and a weathervane in the form of a fish.  The porch is gabled, and has a round-arched opening, above which is a carving in high relief.  Inside, there is a plain 12th-century font, a 17th-century communion table, a communion rail dating from about 1700, and a west screen incorporating a rail dating from 1682.\nSee also\nListed buildings in Gillamoor",

The documentary depicts the construction of the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates. Amiralay made the film out of \"sincere admiration for Ba'ath-led modernization\", a position he would later reverse.\nProduction and content\nConstruction on the Tabqa Dam in 1961\nFilm Essay on the Euphrates Dam was commissioned by the Syrian Arab Television and Radio Broadcasting Commission and the Ministry of Information.  The film presents footage of young male laborers, machinery and construction scaffolding (in imitation of Soviet filmmaker Dziga Vertov, whom Amiralay admired), shots of the still water and boats moving across it, and footage of Bedouins living nearby to the construction site of the Tabqa Dam in the months before their evacuation from the region that would become the dam's reservoir, Lake Assad. Meghan Claire Considine characterizes this footage as being \"through the lens of salvage ethnography\", juxtaposing the rural Bedouins with the dam's construction to imply that the dam project would bring about the end of their riverine culture. A montage in the film juxtaposes the industrial machinery of the dam's construction with shots of a limestone statue of the ancient Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar, dated to the eighteenth century BCE and excavated near the Euphrates from Mari. Extended shots of dry and cracked feet are montaged with shots of mudcracks in the dry desert ground, \"communicating well-trodden logics linking indigeneity and the land\".\nFilm Essay on the Euphrates Dam montages shots of the Tabqa Dam's construction with footage of the soon-to-be-displaced Bedouin villagers and an eighteenth-century BCE life-sized statue of the ancient Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar excavated from Mari (above).\nR. Shareah Taleghani describes Film Essay on the Euphrates Dam as \"a wholesale celebration of the life-changing potential of the state\u2019s early modernization and development projects\".\nReception and legacy\nThe film was welcomed upon release by the Syrian National Film Organization.\nFilm Essay on the Euphrates Dam is the first installment in Amiralay's trilogy of films about the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates, followed by his second film, Everyday Life in a Syrian Village (1974) and his final film, A Flood in Baath Country (2003). Everyday Life in a Syrian Village was banned in Syria, as most of Amiralay's films would be, for its implicit criticism of the failures of the state. In A Flood in Baath Country, Amiralay repurposed footage from Film Essay on the Euphrates Dam as self-critique for his \"naive\" initial enthusiasm about the Ba'ath party, for which he felt deep shame in the aftermath of three decades of Ba'ath rule in Syria.\n",

    "Die Entstehung der Sirenen (Khmer: \u179a\u17bf\u1784\u178a\u17be\u1798\u1780\u17c6\u178e\u17be\u178f\u179f\u178f\u17d2\u179c\u1795\u17d2\u179f\u17c4\u178f; English: \"The Origin of the Sirenia\") is a Cambodian folktale published by R\u00fcdiger Gaudes, wherein a girl lives with a tree god in python form that provides her and her family with treasures, while another family tries to have the same fortune by finding another python and accidentally let their daughter be devoured.\nThe tale is related to the international cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom, wherein a heroine marries a husband in animal form who reveals he is man underneath. In this case, the heroine marries a husband in animal shape that becomes human, while another girl marries a real animal and dies. Variants of the narrative are located in India and Southeast Asia.\nSource\nThe tale was provided by a source named Koung Chandana, from Chrey Vien, in Prey Chhor district, Kompong Cham.\nTranslations\nFrench researcher Solange Thierry translated the tale, originally titled R\u00ffoe\u1e47 \u1e6doen ka\u1e41noet satv phsot, to French with the title Histoire de la naissance de l'animal phsot (\"The Tale of the Origin of the Phsot Animal\"), which she sourced from a Khmer person named Kong Chandan from Prey Vien. The tale was also translated into German by author Ruth Sacher as Die Geburt des Delphins (\"The Birth of the Dolphin\"), also sourced from the Khmer.\nSummary\nPeople in a village revere and worship a large fig tree (toem jrai, in Thierry's text), where they build an altar with a male and female figures (called \"Neak-ta\" in Gaudes's) to which they make offerings for fortune and prosperity. The tale also mentions that a \"king of the tree\" (a \"Waldgott\", 'forest deity', in Sacher's translation) has lived many years in the fig tree. In the village, a woman gives birth to a girl. When she grows old, she goes to make an offering to the altar, when the devat\u0101 (the spirit that lives in the tree) falls in love with her, as if he knows her from another time. He ponders on the meaning of this feeling and consults with god Indra (Preah En, in Gaudes's text). The deity explains that, in a previous life, both the devat\u0101 and the girl were husband and wife, and wished to reincarnate as husband and wife again. The tree god lived as a hermit, separated from his wife, and they drifted apart in this life.\nIn light of this revelation, the devat\u0101 thinks about begging Indra to die and be reborn as human, so he can be with his wife, but discards this course of action, since human lives are fleeting. Thus, he decides to manifest himself to the girl, but as a snake (a python), so he can explain to her he is her Ku-Preng, reborn as a tree spirit, and they can be together again. He turns into a python and slithers to the girl's room at night, where he reveals their past incarnations' lives. The girl questions the devata's claims, so, as proof of his powers, he changes back into a human shape, becoming a handsome youth and spending the night with her. The devata says she must not tell her parents about his secret, only that he is a python, saying he will come at night to be with her.\nHowever, the girl's parents hear some voices in their daughter's room and go to investigate, finding the large python coiled around their daughter. The python leaves, and the girl tells them everything, including the promise to keep his secret identity. The next night, the tree god comes back to be with his wife in human form again, and her parents spy on their rendevouz. They also worry the tree god will return to his python shape. The next morning, the tree god tells the girl her parents should dig at a certain location which is filled with treasures: gold and silver, jewels, and tableware. The girl's family does as instructed and becomes rich.\nIn another village, another family learns of the tree god's girl's good fortune and envy them, since the tree god has given them the means to buy cattle and servants. The wife tells her husband the tree god in python form was the one to provide them with riches, and asks her husband to find their daughter a serpent spouse, since she knows that in the forest the python is guarding a treasure. The man goes to the forest the next day and finds a coiled serpent on a small hill, which the story says coiled around itself to rest. The man brings the serpent home and treats it as a son-in-law, marrying the animal to his daughter in a grand feast. The man's neighbours notice the folly of his deed, but he goes on with it at any rate.\nOn the wedding night, the serpent, which is a real animal, wakes up and coils around the girl. It begins to devour her piece by piece: first, by the knees, then the waist, up to her neck and lastly the head. The girl tries to warn her mother about it, but the woman dismisses her daughter's pleas, until her daughter's voice is heard no more and she goes to investigate: the girl has been swallowed whole and the woman screams in horror. Her husband is alerted by the screams and discovers that his daughter has been swallowed whole. With the help of other villagers",

    "\nBalistoidei, or Sclerodermi,is a suborder of ray-finned fishes belonging to the order Tetraodontiformes, the order which includes the pufferfishes, ocean sunfishes, boxfishes and related fishes. This suborder comprises two extant and three extinct families, the extant species in this taxon are widespread throughout the tropical and temperate seas of the world.\nTaxonomy\nBalistoidei was proposed as a taxonomic grouping by Rafinesque in 1810 and is recognised by the 5th edition of the Fishes of the World as a suborder of the order Tretraodontiformes. Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes also recognises the Balistoidei but includes the Aracanidae and the Ostraciidae within it. On the other hand, other authorities do not recognise any taxa betweeen the level of family and suborder in their Tetraodontoidei.\nFamilies\nBalistoidei contains the following famlilies:\n\u2020Bolcabalistidae Santini & Tyler, 2003\n\u2020Moclaybalistidae Santini & Tyler, 2003\n\u2020 Eospinidae Santini & Tyler, 2003\nBalistidae Rafinesque, 1810 (Triggerfishes)\nMonacanthidae Nardo, 1843 (Filefishes)\nCharacteristics\nBalistoidei is characterised by typically having a laterally compressed body. The frontal bones extand well to the front of the joint between the lateral ethmoid and eithmoid bones. The head and body are covered in scales, often highly modified and sometimes embedded in the skin. They have no pelvic fins, although in some taxa pelvic spines or tubercles may be present and in other a pelvis is present. The first spine in the dorsal fin is lockable and the upper jaw is not protractile and has rows of protruding incisor-like teeth. The soft dorsal fin has between 23 and 52 fin rays while the anal fin has between 20 and 66 fin rays. These fishes have the ability to rotate their eyes independently of each other.

    "Church in Romford, England\nSt Edward the Confessor Church is a Catholic Parish church in Romford, Borough of Havering, London. It was built in 1856 in the Gothic Revival style. It was paid for by the William Petre, 12th Baron Petre and designed by Daniel Cubitt Nichols. It is located in the town centre on St Edward's Way, next to Romford Town Hall and Romford Central Library. It is a Grade II listed building and according to Historic England its design and architecture is reminiscent of Augustus Pugin.\nHistory\nFoundation\nBefore 1848, Catholics in Romford had to travel to St Mary Moorfields for Mass. From 1848, a priest would travel to Romford to minister to the Catholics there. That year, Mass was celebrated in a house in Romford, in a cottage on Church Lane. In 1852, a temporary church building was on the current site of the church. In 1854, a mission was started in Romford, with a priest being resident in the town. From the start of that mission, plans were drawn up for a permanent church to be built there.\nConstruction\nConstruction on the church finished in 1856. On 6 May 1856, the church was opened and dedicated by Cardinal Wiseman, the first Archbishop of Westminster. The land on which the church stands was donated by William Petre, 12th Baron Petre. The Petre were long-time supporters of the Catholic Church in England. William Petre also paid for the construction of Brentwood Cathedral. Of his twelve children, one became a priest and three became religious sisters. Baron Petre also paid for the building's construction, coming to \u00a31,800, which, with the cost of the land, came to a total of \u00a32,000. The church was designed by Daniel Cubitt Nichols. He also designed Holy Family Church in Witham, and the Clock Tower Of Little Ellingham Hall. The interior of the church was furnished by donation from Agnes Clifford, the sister of Baron Petre and wife of Charles Clifford, 8th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh. She donated the main altar, the reredos, various statues and stained-glass windows. The statues were made by Richard Lockwood Boulton, and the stained-glass windows by Hardman & Co. The church was dedicated to Edward the Confessor, because his summer house was located in nearby Havering-atte-Bower.\nParish\nIn 1918, the church was given its own parish. There is a parish centre. From 1890 to 1891, a small school was built. It closed in 1961, and the site became a social club and then the parish centre. The church is open from 8:30 am to 4:00 pm, Monday to Friday and it has three Sunday Masses at 6:30 pm on Saturday and at 9:30 am and 11:30 am on Sunday.\nSee also\nDiocese of Brentwood\nSt Edward the Confessor Anglican Church, Romford",

Canada utilizes a right-hand traffic pattern, requiring traffic to keep to the right. Some provinces, however, initially had left-hand traffic patterns, with the exception of Quebec and Ontario which always had right-hand patterns.\nUnless there is a sign indicating otherwise, drivers are permitted to turn right on red everywhere in Canada except the Island of Montreal.

On December 18, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (currently the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications) assigned a third frequency, UHF channel 23, to Fukui Prefecture.\nThe background behind the assignment of the third station to Fukui Prefecture is that in the early 1990s, Ishikawa Prefecture's TV Kanazawa (opened on April 1, 1990), Hokuriku Asahi Broadcasting (opened on October 1, 1991), and Toyama's Tulip TV (opened on October 1, 1990, then TV U Toyama) opened successively. Furthermore, before the opening of Hokuriku Asahi Broadcasting, the then director of the Hokuriku Telecommunications Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (currently the Hokuriku General Communications Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications) said in Ishikawa Prefecture, \"We would like to promote multicasting in Fukui Prefecture as well\".\nAfter frequency allocation\nAfter frequency allocation, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications began accepting applications.

Due to the high penetration rate of cable television such as Fukui Cable Television and Reinan Cable Network, they had expressed a reluctant policy to set up a station in Fukui Prefecture. Because of this, negotiations switched to TV Asahi, but they responded that they would deal with it through a cross-net network at Fukui Broadcasting.\nFurthermore, on March 29, 1995, the report of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' \"Council on the Multimedia Era\" stated that the introduction of digital television would be possible from the early 2000s. On April 25 of the same year, approximately one month after the report was released, the policy of four commercial television stations in one prefecture was changed, and the opening of new stations would end in May 1996 per a change in policy. Even if they were able to open a new station, they would have to immediately adapt to digitalization, which would increase the cost burden, so they gave up on opening one in Fukui Prefecture.\nOn March 18, 1998, the Private Broadcasting Establishment Preparation Office was dissolved. All businesses that applied by November 30 of the same year withdrew their applications, and on January 18 of the following year, 1999, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications canceled the UHF channel 23 license allocated to Fukui Prefecture.\n",

    "American painter\nStone Roberts, Interior Light, Oil on linen, 72\" x 96\", 2002.\nStone Roberts (born 1951) is an American representational artist known for figurative works, street scenes and still lifes. His art has been compared to European Old Masters and neoclassicists from Vermeer and Caravaggio to Jacques-Louis David and Ingres for its mastery of materials, precision of form and composition, complex play of light and detail, and heightened sense of texture and color. Nonetheless, critics also identify an equally strong contemporary strain in his inclination toward enigmatic or incongruous elements and formal choices, which raise unresolved questions involving action, time, memory and history in his paintings. American Artist critic Michael Burlingham wrote that rather than replicate things as they are, for Roberts \"realism is a language for conjuring images of subtle imagination, works that speak to the deepest levels of experience\".\nRoberts has appeared in surveys at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Drents Museum (Netherlands), Orlando Museum of Art and Delaware Art Museum, and had solo exhibitions at the Museum of the City of New York and New Britain Museum of American Art (2015), among other venues. His work belongs to the public collections of the Metropolitan Museum, de Young Museum and Asheville Art Museum, among others. After being based in Manhattan for most of his career, Roberts lives and works in Connecticut.\nEarly life and career\nJ. Stone Roberts was born in 1951 and raised in Asheville, North Carolina, the son of Camille Stone Roberts and Dr. Pearce Roberts Jr.; his maternal grandfather was the college athlete and coach, Stein Stone. In 1969, Roberts entered Yale University intending a career in law or business, but after taking a printmaking course his sophomore year, changed his focus to art. He studied drawing under the realist painter William H. Bailey, eventually turning his interest to painting and earning a BA degree in 1973. He married Elizabeth (Betsey) Barksdale Milligan in 1974 and continued his studies at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia and Rome, working respectively with the painters John Moore and Ronald Markman and earning an MFA in 1975.\nRoberts's inclinations toward old-master aesthetics and beauty ran contrary to the dominance of conceptualism and minimalism in contemporary art of the time. He moved to New York City in 1975 and worked in banking while painting in his free-time until 1981, when he decided to devote himself fully to art at his wife's urging. He refined his approach for a year while the couple lived at her family home in the Mississippi Delta before beginning his first large-scale work.\nAfter returning to New York, Roberts began exhibiting at Robert Schoelkopf Gallery, including his first solo show of figurative and still-life work in 1986. After a second show there in 1989, he exhibited at the Salander-O'Reilly (1993\u20132004), Leigh Morse Fine Art (2009) and Hirschl & Adler Modern (2014) galleries in New York, as well as at the Asheville Art Museum (2007), Museum of the City of New York (2012) and New Britain Museum (2015).\nWork and reception\nIn addition to European masters, influences on Roberts's art include Greek mythology, biblical and literary sources, Roman Classicism, and painters associated with specific genres, such as Henri Fantin-Latour and Balthus, among others. He has generally looked to these sources as launching points for new compositional and thematic ideas\u2014introducing enigmatic, private objects and details\u2014rather than for their direct subject matter or symbolic content. Critics suggest that Roberts's attachment to traditional sources expresses a desire to retain or retrieve timeless values (aesthetics, beauty, skill) that contemporary art seemingly rejected, as well as peculiarly American experiences, objects and ways of life. Charles Michener wrote, \"The driving concern in Roberts's art seems, more precisely, southern American in its yearning to arrest the reckless momentum of a democratic society that creates a spiritual vacuum.\"\nStone Roberts, English Forcer Still Life, Oil on linen, 27\" x 36\", 2005.\nUnlike the European masters, however, who used realism to factually document specific persons and settings, Roberts freely alters elements in his scenes, emphasizing contemporary senses of ambiguity, sensuality and the commonplace. While some writers detect a modern knack for narrative tension and psychological portraiture in his work, others point to enigmatic elements\u2014incongruous or eccentric details and juxtapositions, unnerving perspectives and offhanded arrangements. They regard his work as mysterious and irreducible to clear-cut explanation, or in Michener's words, less about revelation than reverberation. In this vein, Roberts has been compared to modern representational painters such as Lennart Anderson and John Koch, among others.\nFrom about 1982 to 2000, Roberts alternated between ambitious, time-consuming figurative tableau an",
    "Church in County Armagh, Northern Ireland\nBallymore Parish Church (2013)\nBallymore Parish Church is a 19th-century stone Church of Ireland in Tandragee, County Armagh, Northern Ireland.\nThe church was referenced in ecclesiastical records as far back as 1343 and maintained an association with the Dukes of Manchester, who were benefactors to the church, until the mid-1950s.\nThe previous church was demolished in 1812 to allow for the building of a bigger cruciform church.\nHistory\nIn 1343, Roger Sampford held possession of a Prebendary of Armagh for the Parish Church of Tamlackikieth (Tandragee) with its churches.\nDuring the Irish Rebellion of 1641, violence broke out in Tandragee which lead to Edmond O'Hanlon and his rebels setting fire to the church. In February 1812, it was recorded that the church located on the site was demolished to make way for a larger structure, as the previous building had become inadequate for the congregation's needs. During the construction, remnants of the old walls were uncovered, revealing a thickness of over four feet and constructed from brick. Additionally, the loopholes and embrasures showed signs of the fire that occurred in the 1641 Irish Rebellion.\nIn 1846, the transepts and chancel were constructed, followed by interior renovations in 1884, during which a new organ, donated by William Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester, was installed adjacent to the chancel. In 1889, the peal of tubular bells was installed in the tower. The structure features a cruciform design and initially included traditional boxed seating along with a gallery at the western end. Additionally, there were two prominent enclosed pews located in each transept: the Rectory pew on the north side and the Duke's pew on the south. A fireplace was positioned next to the Duke's pew, a luxury that was not extended to the Rectory family.\nSeveral renovation enhancements to the church were carried out in the early 20th century, which included the donation of some of the stained glass windows from the Dukes of Manchester as well as contributions from parishioners in memory of their loved ones. Throughout the 1900s, a number of external renovations and structural repairs were undertaken, such as the removal of pebble dash from the exterior walls in 1926, followed by repointing of the stones.\nThe wooden panelling in the sanctuary, on the organ loft, and on the wall adjacent to the font at the rear was acquired from Tandragee Castle in 1955. The identification of dry rot in 1962 led to significant repairs, including the complete replacement of the roof, during which the gallery was also dismantled. By the end of the 20th century, the external walls underwent repointing, and the damaged sandstone mullions surrounding several stained glass windows were replaced.\n",

The book details a starship extensively, :\u200a205\u200a and includes flowcharts for the gamemaster to adjudicate space travel. Fold-out deck plans for a free-trader starship are also included.\nPublication history\nGame Designers Workshop (GDW) first published the science fiction role-playing game Traveller in 1977. In 1987, GDW asked DGP for help in designing a major revision to the game called MegaTraveller. After GDW released MegatTraveller, DGP published several adventures and supplements for it under license. One of these was Starship Operator's Manual, Vol. 1, written by Joe D. Fugate, Sr., Gary L. Thomas, William W. Connors, and Rob Caswell. It was published as a 64-page book with foldout deck plans.\nReception\nIn Issue 27 of White Wolf (June/July 1991), Keith H. Eisenbeis called this book \"a product that truly achieves and surpasses its potential. This supplement explains and illustrates ... starships so well that you might begin to believe that the writers have actually gone on location to the future and taken notes.\" Eisenbeis concluded by giving this book a rating of 4 out of 5, saying, \"Whether a MegaTraveller enthusiast, a veteran Traveller player, or anyone with a imagination interested in starships, the Starship Operator's Manual is an unqualified must have.\"\nIn his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, game historian Lawrence Schick noted this book contained, \"just about everything you'd want to know about operating a MegaTraveller starship, maneuver and jump drives, flight controls, power, sensors, computers, weapons, etc.\"\nIn Issue 1 of Signal-GK, J.Duncan Law-Green used the information in this book to make a rough calculation of the amount of energy supposedly required by a starship's Jump net in order to enter Jumpspace. Law-Green decided to design the drive to be fitted to the external hull of ships, since, \"After a thorough reading of Starship Operator's Manual, I have found nothing which says that the means of generating the energy to charge the zuchai crystals has to be inside the Jump net.\"\nOther reviews\nTerra Traveller Times (Number 19 - Dec 1988)",

Two other inscriptions of Tindlu and Doddabommasandra belong to the 14th and the 15th century CE respectively. The inscription in Tindlu documents a donation made by medieval merchant guilds of the region called Ubhayananadesis and Salumule, while the Doddabommasandra inscription is a donatory inscription to a Agrahara (Brahmin settlement). Kodigehalli is also home to two Herostones also called Viragal in Kannada, which are erected in the memory of people who die in battles or other conflicts, the herostones present here are only with sculptures without any inscription.\nKodigehalli 1431CE Inscription of Prathaparaya's Donation to God Someyadeva\nThe earliest inscription from Bengaluru region to make a reference to an astronomical event, this Kannada inscription dated to 1431 CE records a generous grant made by Prataparaya, the son of Mangappa Dandanayaka by the order of Devaraya the erstwhile king of the Karnataka Empire, during the sacred occasion of Solar eclipse. The grant was given to the Someyadeva temple situated in Sakanasamudra, which includes the satellite village of Virupakshapura in Devasamudra, along with a specified income of 20 gadyana (Gadyana was currency in use during the period of the Karnataka Empire). Additionally, 5 khandugas (a unit measure of area) of wetlands located south of the vast Devasamudra lake were also bestowed upon the temple. these grants were given to organize various rituals and entertainment events for the deity, to be conducted twice a day\u2014once in the morning and once in the evening. The activities were anga-ranga vaibhoga, naivedya (ritual offerings of food and decorations), dance performances and other forms of entertainment. The performing team mentioned in the inscription included 2 actors, 1 dancer, 1 drummer, 1 sitar player, 1 upanga player and 1 kamsale dancer (as described in the inscription: p\u0101trada jana 2 na\u1e6d\u1e6davana jana 1 madda\u1e37ek\u0101\u1e5fana jana 1 sit\u0101rana jana 1 up\u0101\u1e43gada jana 1 ka\u1e43sas\u0101le jana 1). The donation was commanded by King Devaraya and executed by Parataparaya, with the intention of seeking the well-being and prosperity of King Devaraya. The inscription uses symbols to represent fractions such as one-fourth, one-half and three-fourths, denoted by the symbols |, || and |||. The donation quantities are written both in numbers and in words. The place name Kodigehalli is derived from the combination of two terms: \"Kodige\", meaning grant and \"halli\", meaning village. The Kodige in Kodigehalli was most likely inspired by this grant documented in the inscription and over the centuries, this name has gradually replaced the original name, Virupakshapura, to become known as Kodigehalli. The inscription mentions places which can be mapped to modern locations - 1) Vijayanagara (capital city of the Karnataka empire, Hampi), 2) Shivanasamudra (alias for Hessarghatta), 3) Yelahanka, 4) Devasamudra (MS Ramaiah hospital & RMV 2nd Phase), 5) Virupakshapura (Kodigehalli), 6) Vijaya Devarayapura (a new name given to Virupakshapura in the inscription) & 7) Devasamudra Hiriyakere (does not exist today - RMV Ph II is built over the lake bed). A children's story inspired by this inscription has also been published in the renowned Kannada magazine Mayura and is authored by Chitra Ramachandra and Vidya Murali.\nDiscovery and Dating\nThe Kannada inscription is published in Epigraphia carnatica, a compendium of Inscriptions in Karnataka by B.L Rice. The inscription was in a precarious condition on the roadside prior 2018 which was later shifted to a safe spot in the Halekote Anjaneya temple for its conservation, apart from this, it is also 3D scanned and archived by the Mythic Society's Bengaluru Inscriptions 3D Digital Conservation Project. The inscription has been dated to 08-Aug-1431CE Julian -  09-Aug-1431CE Julian, the clear reference to the date has been mentioned in the inscription. The two herostones present in Kodigehalli are dated to 15th and 16th century CE",
    "Thai restaurant in Toronto, Ontario, Canada\nFavorites Thai is a Thai restaurant in the Trinity-Bellwoods neighbourhood of Toronto's West End.\nHistory\nThe restaurant was opened in 2019 by Jonathan Poon and Monte Won, who also owns Toronto restaurants Khao San Road and Paris Paris. They cited wanting to open a Thai restaurant which could introduce their Toronto customer base to \"dishes that they didn\u2019t necessarily know about.\" Access to the restaurant can only be found through entering via a coffee shop.\nThe business employs the American spelling of \"Favorites\" in its name. According to the owners, this choice was made for aesthetic reasons, as the restaurant's logo was more visually appealing without the inclusion of the letter \"u.\"\nFavorites has an open kitchen, using binchotan charcoal to grill its dishes. It also uses local ingredients to create its Thai-inspired salads and grilled dishes.\nRecognition\nThe business was named a Bib Gourmand restaurant by the Michelin Guide at Toronto's 2022 Michelin Guide ceremony, and retained this recognition in 2023 and 2024. A Bib Gourmand recognition is awarded to restaurants who offer \"exceptionally good food at moderate prices.\" Michelin cited the restaurant's use of \"fresh herbs and fiery chilis\" in its dishes, including highlighting its appetizers and curries. The restaurant's owners cited the Bib Gourmand award helping to increase business to their location, and wanting to continue pushing the restaurant's cuisine to eventually receive a Michelin star.\nCanada portalFood portal",

    "Defunct Philippine political party\nThe Popular Front (Spanish: Frente Popular) is a defunct political party founded in 1934 to oppose the then-dominant Nacionalista Party.\nHistory\nFormation and early years\nAfter the 1934 elections, Popular Front was established by mainly poorly organized minorities (including some Democrata Party members), and was reorganized in 1937 to be an official opposition party. Popular Front hardly lacked leadership, and it lacked a program, even though one of its founders, Juan Sumulong, a former senator, with the membership of former president and general Emilio Aguinaldo and Philippine Independent Church head bishop Gregorio Aglipay. In 43 provincial governors, only 2 Popular Front members won.\n1941 elections\nHowever, in November 1941, left-wing and right-wing factions arose in the party ranks, as Sumulong led the right-wing faction while Pedro Abad Santos was the leader of the hard-left. Abad Santos challenged each other's right to enroll under the Popular Front banner. Abad Santos accused Sumulong's faction members as members of the Democrata Nacional or Democrata party, or being its identical twin, and being nationalists but  \"tools of the capitalists,\" with the contrast of Abad Santos' Marxist stance. While Sumulong, blasted Abad Santos for spreading Communist ideas, and stated that Communists and their believers should not identify themeseleves as member of the Popular Front. The elections commission settled the dispute, by recognizing the both factions, with Sumulong and Abad Santos as legitimate leaders of the party.\nBoth Sumulong, and Abad Santos have their own presidential ambition in 1941. Sumulong choose Emilio Javier as running mate, while Abad Santos picked Aglipay's wife as his running mate. Later Abad Santos withdrawn. But the two factions were defeated by incumbents Manuel L. Quezon (president) and Sergio Osme\u00f1a (vice president). In the return of senate chamber in 1941, no one won in the slate, and in the lower house, only 2 seat got. But Vicente Sotto, a Cebuano senator, who also lost in 1941, became senator in 1946 while in the party.\nElectoral performance\nPresidential and vice presidential elections\nLegislative elections\nNotes\n",

Three years later, in 2018, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals made a final ruling of \"actual innocence\" for Alonzo.\nLegal proceedings\nEscamilla admitted to the killing on a televised interview he gave while in prison. His defense attorney's did not deny that Escamilla killed James but said the murder of an off-duty policy officer did not qualify for the death penalty.

    "Dutch researcher\nTheo Sandfort is a Dutch professor, author and former president of the International Academy of Sex Research. He served as professor and postdoctoral training director at Columbia University and was designated a fellow status by the American Psychological Association.\nCareer\n2020 foster care research\nIn 2015, Sandfort was commissioned by the New York City Administration for Children's Services (ACS) to develop a landmark study about the state of the LGBT youth who were under care of the New York City foster care system. The study, in which Sandfort was the lead researcher, was conducted in 2019 and published in 2020. It found that about 8,000 foster youth in the city were LGBT, and that that population generally reported lower well-being metrics, which Sandfort said were similar to the lower well-being already observed among LGBT youth in general, although those metrics seemed to have been influenced by the unique negative experiences that the LGBT youth usually suffers while under foster care.\nThe results of the study were covered by the New York Times and The Imprint. After Sandfort's previous studies of pedophilia between 1979 and the 1990s resurfaced, the ACS cut ties with him.\nBooks\nThe sexual aspects of Paedophile Relations\nThe Sexual Aspects of Paedophile Relations: The Experience of Twenty-Five Boys (1982) is a book written by Sandfort and published, originally in Dutch, by Amsterdam-based publisher Pan. The book studies a sample, which Sandfort described as non-generalizable, of twenty-five males aged 16 or younger who did not report negative effects from being in relationships with adults.\nAmerican sociologist David Finkelhor stated that, although Sandfort's findings were probably replicable, they ran against more representative samples in which only a minority of Americans who experienced sexual contact with adults while they were minors expressed positive reactions. He said that Sandfort did not obtain, as he never professed to, a representative sample. Finkelhor further stated that boys tend to react less negative to sexual contact with adults than girls, and that some positive reactions to such events have been observed to erode over time.\nDavid Mrazek said that Sandfort's study presented in The Sexual Aspects of Paedophile Relations suffered from sample bias. He stated that, although Sandfort stated that the findings were not generalizable, he still sought to generalize the results.\nBoys on their Contact with Men\nBoys on their Contact with Men: A Study of Sexually Expressed Frienships (1987) is a book written by Sandfort following his publication of The Sexual Aspects of Paedophile Relations and the reactions thereto. It is introduced by John Money and was published by Global Academic Publishers.\nMale Intergenerational Intimacy\nMale Intergenerational Intimacy: Historical, Sociopsychological and Legal Perspectives (1991) is a book by Sandfort that compiles 16 research articles and three commentaries on homosexual intergenerational relationships.\nReception\nResearcher Gary Klein said that the title of Male Intergenerational Intimacy was confounding, since the book did not examine relationships between adult men of different generations. He criticized the book's lack of an index and said that the book lived up to its subtitle, as, he stated, it did provide a multifaceted analysis of pedophilia. Klein stated that, for all but one article, \"each contributor provided a comprehensive set of research notes which would be of immense help to anyone doing extensive research on pedophilia\".\n",
    "Church in Croydon, England\nSt Mary's Church or Our Lady of Reparation Church is a Catholic Parish church in Croydon. It was built from 1863 to 1864 and designed by E. W. Pugin and Frederick Walters. It is architecturally in the Gothic Revival style. It is situated to the north of the centre of Croydon on the junction of Wellesley Road and Station Road, next to St Mary's Roman Catholic High School, Croydon, but its parish extends to the west of the town. \nHistory\nFoundation\nIn 1837, a mission was started in Croydon. It was recorded that a Mass was celebrated in a house in Croydon, 20 Southbridge Road, that became a Mass centre for the mission. In 1841, a chapel was opened in Broad Green, on Handcroft Road. However, anti-Catholic sentiment led to it and the priest, Fr Patrick O\u2019Moore, being attacked. In 1850, a new priest took over the mission, Fr Alphonsus David.\nConstruction\nThe priest, Fr David, worked to get a new church built. In 1861, the current site of the church was bought for \u00a3742. The church was also given a \u00a32,000 donation for its construction by a Lady Elizabeth Lloyd Anstruther of Ryde. She was the granddaughter of Peter Burrell, 1st Baron Gwydyr, and niece of John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare.Her aunt, Countess Elizabeth Burrell (1793\u20131879), funded many of the Catholic churches on the Isle of Wight and in the then Diocese of Southwark after meeting and being friends with Thomas Grant, the first bishop of Southwark. She also donated some money and asked for the church to be dedicated to \"Our Lady of Reparation\". Elizabeth Lloyd Anstruther, after donating the money for the church's construction, would, a few years later, become a Benedictine nun in St Mary's Abbey, Colwich. Construction on the church start on 1 May 1863 and lasted until 1864. The architect was E. W. Pugin, son of Augustus Pugin, and a specialist in Gothic Revival architecture. The capacity of the church at the time of its opening was for 600 people.\nDevelopments\nIn 1876, plans were started to expand the church. The plans were made by Frederick Walters. At the time, he lived locally, and carried out the work early in his career, over twenty years before he would go on to design Ealing Abbey and Buckfast Abbey. He extended the chancel by adding side chapels, as well as north and south aisles to the church and the sacristy was enlarged. The plans were put into place in 1881 and on 26 November 1882, the church was reopened. Cardinal Manning, the Archbishop of Westminster preached at the ceremony. According to Historic England, the additions by Walters were designed and constructed \"in a seamless manner, such that it is not immediately obvious today where Pugin ends and Walters begins.\"\nIn 1968, Wellesley Road, in front of the church, was expanded, so the church lost part of its forecourt. So in 1972, the front entrance to the church was extended, a parish hall added and a new presbytery built. That year, the church interior was changed with the pulpit altar rails removed.\nParish\nNext to the church is St Mary's Roman Catholic High School, Croydon, it was built in parallel with the church. It was founded in 1851, in a school building alongside the chapel in Broad Green and moved to its current site when the current church was built, having a small school building alongside it. The church is in the centre of Croydon, but is closer to West Croydon station than East Croydon and its parish is mostly in the west of the town. It has seven Sunday Masses at 7:00 pm on Saturday and at 8:00 am, 9:15 am, 10:45 am, 12:15 pm, 3:00 pm, and 6:00 pm on Sunday.\nSee also\nArchdiocese of Southwark",
    "\nHistoric site in Queensland, Australia\nFortitude Valley Air Raid Shelters is a heritage-listed group of four air raid shelters at East Street and Wickham Street, Fortitude Valley, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. They were built in 1942 by Brisbane City Council. They were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 September 2020.\nHistory\nFour air raid shelters stand near the corner of East Street and Wickham Street, in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane, which is part of the traditional land of the Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Each shelter consists of a concrete floor, four central concrete columns, and a flat double-cantilever concrete roof. Constructed by the Brisbane City Council during early 1942, in the midst of World War II (WWII), these structures are among 20 surviving examples of public surface air raid shelters designed for post-war use as either park shelters or bus stops, after the removal of their brick or concrete walls. There are 27 public surface air raid shelters of all types, built by local governments, remaining in Queensland. The shelters in Fortitude Valley, the largest surviving group of public air raid shelters in Queensland, are important in demonstrating the impact of Japan's entry into the war on Queensland's civilian population. They were once arranged around the perimeter of a children's playground established in 1922.\nWhen World War II began In September 1939, the Queensland Premier's Department, as the agency responsible for co-ordinating civil defence works in the state, began implementing home security policies. Air Raid Protection Committees, usually consisting of the local mayor, inspector of police and government medical officer, formed in centres along the Queensland coast.\nAs the threat of war with Japan increased, construction of public air raid shelters was planned in main centres considered vulnerable to air attack (e.g. the Babinda Air Raid Shelter in Far North Queensland). These home security policies were outlined in the Commonwealth War Book, which was prepared before the outbreak of war and outlined measures to be taken by authorities in wartime.\nAustralia was under little threat of air attack until late 1941. On 8 December 1941, the United States of America entered the war, following the previous day's bombing of the American fleet at Pearl Harbor by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. Simultaneously, Japanese forces launched assaults on Thailand, the Philippines and the British colony of Malaya. The sudden fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942 and the rapid Japanese advance through the islands of the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) raised fears of air attacks on Australia. The first Japanese air raid on Darwin occurred on 19 February 1942; and Broome, in Western Australia, was attacked on 3 March 1942. Japanese air raids on other targets in Australia seemed likely, and an invasion of Australia was also feared. Japan briefly considered invading Australia (an idea promoted by the Imperial Japanese Navy, but rejected by the Imperial Japanese Army due to a lack of resources) before shelving that option in March 1942, in favour of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby, and later Fiji, New Caledonia and the Samoan Islands.\nAs a result of the growing fear of Japanese air raids, the Queensland Premier acted with powers conferred by Regulation 35a, an amendment to the National Security (General) Regulations of the National Security Act 1939-1940, which authorised each state premier to direct \"blackouts\" and to \"make such provision as he deems necessary to protect the persons and property of the civil population\". The Queensland Government issued the Protection of Persons and Property Order No. 1, gazetted 23 December 1941, which ordered the Brisbane City Council (BCC), and other local authorities near the coast, to build air raid shelters. The BCC was ordered to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Order No. 1 also required the owners of any building in the coastal areas, where over 30 people would normally be present at any one time (such as hotels), to build shelters within, or adjacent to, the building. Queensland Railways (QR) also instituted a shelter-building program at its railway stations.All Queensland coastal state schools were closed in late January 1942 and, although most reopened on 2 March 1942, student attendance was optional until the war ended. A policy of voluntary evacuation of women and children from Queensland coastal areas was also implemented on 27 January 1942.\nOrder No. 1 was applied state-wide, and another 24 local authorities in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public, to be built according to the Air Raid Shelter Code laid down in the Second Schedule of Order No. 1. Initially, 19 of these local authorities were expected to construct a total of 133 surface shelters able to withstand the blast of a 500-pound bomb bursting 50 feet away. A surfa",
    "Hot spring system in Hidalgo, Mexico\nPoza Tolantongo soaking pool\nTolantongo hot springs are a system of geothermal springs in the Valle del Mezquital, in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico.\nHistory\nThe hot springs are located on an ejido, the Ejido de San Crist\u00f3bal, a system of cooperative land ownership that restored rights to farmers and Mexico's Indigenous people to own their own land. During the 1970s, the site began to be developed through the construction of a road to the geothermal area, the caves, providing access to the hot springs, waterfalls and river. This was done in consideration of both commercial development and ecosystem sustainability. The construction was done by the local ejido residents. A resort has been built on site, and there are camping options available. The Cooperative Ejido Society of the Tolantongo Grottos owns the land and the resort facilities.\nDescription\nThe hot springs are located in a steep canyon accessible by a narrow road with hairpin turns. There are multiple sources where the hot spring water emerges from the ground and a series of caves. These flow into a network of pipes and into dozens of soaking pools that cascade down a hillside. The largest source is a cave located near the terminus of a canyon. As one descends the cliff face with multiple soaking pools, there is a tunnel at the base of the canyon containing additional soaking areas and small caves.\nThe hot springs infrastructure, and network of soaking pools are drained and cleaned every other day.\nWater profile\nAfter emerging from the underground sources, the spring water cools to approximately 37\u00a0\u00b0C (99\u00a0\u00b0F) in the soaking pools. The mineral water is high in calcium and magnesium which affects the color of the spring water, giving it a bright turquoise color.\n",

When the line was operated by Japan National Railways (JNR), the term \"Shonan Tram\" was used in passenger information to refer to regular trains in this section. The route symbol used in station numbering is JT.\nThe T\u014dkaid\u014d Line is one of JR East's services operating on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line, like the Yamanote Line (between Tokyo Station and Shinagawa Station) and the Keihin\u2013T\u014dhoku Line (between Tokyo Station and Yokohama Station). The T\u014dkaid\u014d Line runs parallel to these two services and their sections. In the parallel section, the Keihin\u2013T\u014dhoku Line and the Yamanote Line mainly provide all-station stops and short-distance transportation services, while the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line provides rapid and medium-distance transportation services, including local trains. Furthermore, the Yokosuka Line, which runs parallel to the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line, provides all-station stop service between Totsuka Station and Yokohama Station, while the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line provides rapid service on this section. The T\u014dkaid\u014d Line runs on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line's train rails, while the Yamanote Line (between Tokyo Station and Shinagawa Station) and Keihin-T\u014dhoku Line (between Tokyo Station and Yokohama Station) run on the Tokaido Main Line's electric train rails, and the Yokosuka Line runs on its own dedicated rails. Train rail has fewer station platforms, whereas electric train rail has more station platforms. The T\u014dkaid\u014d Line is in competition with the Keikyu Main Line, which runs parallel to the Tokaido Line between Shinagawa Station and Yokohama Station. As the oldest trunk line in Japan, factories and residential areas were developed along the line early on, and the urban area extends continuously from Tokyo Station to Odawara Station, which is over 80\u00a0km away. Some trains also run directly to Numazu Station via a section of the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line operated by Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central).

    "Australian television comedy series\nThou Shalt Not Steal is an Australian crime comedy drama television series created by Dylan River and Tanith Glynn-Maloney that premiered on 17 October 2024, on Stan. The series follows a pair of teenagers as they are chased across the desert by a sex worker and fraudulent preacher. It stars Sherry-Lee Watson, Will McDonald, Miranda Otto, and Noah Taylor.\nPremise\nThou Shalt Not Steal is a 1980s-set road drama that follows young Aboriginal delinquent Robyn, who escapes juvenile detention and visits her terminally ill grandfather, Ringer, in the hospital. Ringer demands to be taken back home, where he claims to have an important errand.\nAfter being unable to pay for a taxi, Robyn is confronted by the driver, Maxine, a madam who tries to recruit her as payment. After a scuffle, Robyn steals the taxi and flees with her Grandfather. Ringer's condition worsens during the drive and he tells Robyn her father is still alive and that he wants her to return a trophy to him. He passes away shortly before they reach the town.\nMeanwhile, a fraudulent preacher, Robert, and his son, Gidge, hold court throughout the town, conducting sermons and secretly selling booze. Gidge desperately wants to leave his father and return to his mother in Adelaide.\nShortly after finding the trophy, Robyn discovers that police have come looking for her and she makes a plan to escape in the stolen taxi. Sensing an opportunity to go home, Gidge hides, stowed away under the backseat. Unaware of his presence, she sets off to find her father in Coober Pedy.\nThe next day, Maxine arrives in the town and begins making enquiries about the whereabouts of her taxi. Robert offers her the use of his car to track the teenagers down and they set off in pursuit.\nCast and characters\nSherry-Lee Watson as Robyn, a young Aboriginal woman who has recently escaped juvenile detention\nWill McDonald as Gidge, an awkward son of a fraudulent travelling preacher\nNoah Taylor as Robert Snr, a fraudulent preacher on the run from his past\nMiranda Otto as Maxine, a cunning madam who manages sex workers around the outback from her taxi\nDarren Gilshenan as Mick, an Australian Federal Police (AFP) officer who pursues Robyn and Gidge with his partner, Tracey\nShari Sebbens as Tracey, an AFP Officer in pursuit of Robyn and Gidge with her partner, Mick\nNatasha Wanganeen as Mary, Robyn's alcoholic mother\nWarren H.

Dylan River and Tanith Glynn-Maloney (his cousin) were announced as the series creators, with River to direct all eight episodes. The series received financial investment from Screen Australia, production support from South Australian Film Corporation, Screen Territory and post production incentives from Screen Queensland.\nRiver wrote a 300-page treatment for the project over the COVID-19 lockdowns. The series was intended to build on the themes and tone explored by River in his 2019 series Robbie Hood. River explained he wanted to look at Aboriginal political issues \"but through comedy... sort of like bent, twisted ways of looking at some dire situations\". Part of River's motivation was to make a series which could reach a more mainstream audience, as he felt like he had been \"preaching to the converted\" with previous projects and that \"Indigenous filmmaking, for the most part, hasn't quite reached more of a commercial audience\".\nThe decision to set the series in the 1980s was based on River's love for the mechanical aesthetics of the era, stories he had heard from his family and the challenge of storytelling without mobile phones. He said: \"I love mechanical stuff... I own a couple of 1970s Fords... And storytelling before mobile phones, it's harder but more rewarding. Also, I grew up with a father who was a teenager in the '80s and I'd always hear stories and wish I was around at that time\". River also spoke about the \"wild\" nature of Alice Springs during the period and how petty crimes often became the basis of recreational activities.\nIn September 2023, Sherry-Lee Watson, Will McDonald, Miranda Otto, and Noah Taylor were cast in the series.\nShooting\nThe production began principal photography in Alice Springs during September 2023.\nThe series' exteriors were largely shot on the road in locations between Alice Springs and Adelaide, while interiors were shot in Adelaide. River was determined to film in real world locations that aligned with the character's journey through the story as much as possible.\nMusic\nThe soundtrack was a notable part of the production, with artists including Slim Dusty, the Warumpi Band, and the Yamma family.\nRelease\nThe series had its world premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, with a screening of",

    "Royal Navy fifth-rate frigate\nFor other ships with the same name, see HMS Diamond.\nHMS Diamond was a 42-gun Leda-class frigate of the Royal Navy. Launched in 1816 after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, she was initially placed in ordinary before being fitted for service in 1824. Sent to serve on the South America Station, she conveyed the diplomat James Justinian Morier to Mexico on her way out. Returning to Britain in 1826, the ship recovered and repaired the wreck of the merchant ship Frances Mary. Laid up at Portsmouth, on 18 February 1827 the ship was burned to the waterline in an accidental fire and then broken up.\nDesign and construction\nDiamond was a fifth-rate 18-pounder Leda-class frigate. The class was based off the lines of the captured French 38-gun frigate H\u00e9b\u00e9, a design by Jacques-No\u00ebl San\u00e9 vaunted as an all-rounder. The naval historian Robert Gardiner argues that the key characteristic of the design, leading to its adoption with the Royal Navy, was its \"unspectacular excellence\". One ship, HMS Leda, was built during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1800. With the Napoleonic Wars subsequently beginning, the design was revived as one of three mass-produced frigates, contrasting with the strategy of the previous war which had seen a much more sporadic choice of designs.\nDiamond was one of seven ships of the class ordered as a group between 1812 and 1815; not part of the emergency construction programme, none were completed before the wars ended. The frigate was ordered on 30 June 1812 to be built at Chatham Dockyard by George Parkin. Diamond was laid down in August the following year. The ship was launched on 16 January 1816 with the following dimensions: 150\u00a0feet 0+1\u20442\u00a0inch (45.7\u00a0m) along the gun deck, 125\u00a0feet 1+3\u20444\u00a0inches (38.1\u00a0m) at the keel, with a beam of 40\u00a0feet 2+1\u20442\u00a0inches (12.3\u00a0m) and a depth in the hold of 12\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (3.9\u00a0m). Her draught was 11\u00a0feet 2\u00a0inches (3.4\u00a0m) forward and 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) aft, and the ship measured 1,076 18\u204494 tons burthen. With the wars over, Diamond was not fitted out upon completion and was instead laid up at Chatham. The cost of her construction is not recorded.\nThe frigate had a crew complement of 315. Diamond held twenty-eight 18-pounder long guns on her upper deck. Complementing this were eight 9-pounder long guns and six 32-pounder carronades on the quarterdeck, and two 9-pounder long guns and two 32-pounder carronades on the forecastle. Originally classed as 38-gun frigates, in 1817 the ships were re-classed as 46-gun frigates. Sailing reports from ships of the Leda class record that they were generally very fast, reaching 13 knots (24\u00a0km/h) in strong winds. They were however not particularly weatherly and rolled heavily. Diamond was named after the merchant ship Diamond which had formed part of the British response to the Spanish Armada. She was the seventh Royal Navy ship to bear the name.\nService\nHaving spent eight years in ordinary at Chatham, Diamond was fitted for her first sea service between February and 24 July 1824.  Commissioned in May that year by Captain Lord Napier, she was sent to serve on the South America Station. The frigate reached St Kitts on 27 September and then sailed for Veracruz, conveying the diplomat James Justinian Morier to Mexico, where he served as ambassador to negotiate a treaty.\nThe wreck of Frances Mary is approached by HMS Blonde on 7 March 1826\nDiamond was ordered to travel from Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon on 10 May 1826, conveying the diplomat Sir Charles Stuart. While on passage on 7 June the frigate came across the wreck of the merchant ship Frances Mary. This vessel had been sailing from New Brunswick to Liverpool when she was de-masted in a storm and had her rudder destroyed on 4 February, leaving her unable to manoeuvre. The survivors of Frances Mary were rescued by the 46-gun frigate HMS Blonde on 7 March, with the vessel itself left to drift until discovered by Diamond.\nNapier sent a volunteer crew on board and had Frances Mary sailed to Santa Maria Island. Diamond continued on to Lisbon, arriving on 9 August, and then returned to Santa Maria where Frances Mary had been taken up by the local English consul. Napier had the ship refitted and repaired, travelling to S\u00e3o Miguel Island, followed by Faial Island and then Terceira Island. Diamond escorted Frances Mary from Terceira on 31 August, subsequently arriving at Milford Haven on 25 September.\nDiamond was paid off on 1 December the same year. The ship was laid up again, situated in Porchester Lake at Portsmouth Dockyard. At about 8:00 on 18 February 1827 a fire began on board her. The flagship at Portsmouth, the 104-gun ship of the line HMS Victory, fired warning guns and sent out boats to fight the growing fire. These were joined by others from the dockyard and efforts were made to quash the blaze, but a strong easterly wind caused the fire to spread quickly. The rescuers took off the fourteen people who had been living on Diamond, including some women and ",
    "RNLI Lifeboat station in Highland, Scotland\nKyle of Lochalsh Lifeboat Station is located next to the Fisheries Pier, on Kyle Prospect Road, in Kyle of Lochalsh, a village at the end of the Lochalsh peninsula in north-west Scotland,  formerly in Ross and Cromarty, now in the administrative region of Highland.\nA B-class (Atlantic 21) Inshore lifeboat was first stationed at Kyle of Lochalsh by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) on 23 April 1995.\nThe station currently operates the B-class (Atlantic 85) Inshore lifeboat, Spirit of Fred. Olsen (B-856), on station since 2011.\nHistory\nAt a meeting of the RNLI Executive Committee held on 23 November 1994, it was resolved that an Inshore lifeboat station be established at Kyle of Lochalsh in 1995, with an Atlantic B-class lifeboat placed on station for an evaluation period of one-year.\nThe Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes is the largest fraternal order in England. They are a charitable organisation, and have been supporting the RNLI since 1887. Their first lifeboat, R.A.O.B. (ON 130), was a 34-foot self-righting 'Pulling and Sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with oars and sails, and was the first lifeboat to be placed at Dungeness. In 1995, a B-class (Atlantic 21) Inshore lifeboat R.A.O.B. (B-535), which had already served at Hartlepool and Berwick-upon-Tweed since 1975, was the first lifeboat placed at the new Kyle of Lochalsh station. The R.A.O.B.

It provides housing for the lifeboat and launch tractor, crew facilities, workshop and a retail outlet, and also accommodates the harbour master's office.\nOne of the more unusual items to be found at Kyle of Lochalsh lifeboat station, is a Tigerfish Torpedo, converted to be a donation collection box. The torpedo was donated by the British Underwater Test and Evaluation Centre, who are based in Kyle of Lochalsh, and were established in the 1970s to test and evaluate equipment for the Royal Navy and the Ministry of Defence. It is reported that the propellers on top were hastily fitted replacements, when it was realised that the torpedo was still fitted with the top secret version. A brass plate reads \"This unusual collecting vessel was gifted to the R.N.L.I. (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) to symbolise the vital role B.U.T.E.C.(British Underwater Test and Evaluation Centre) played in the birth of the Kyle Lifeboat Station\".\nFred. Olsen Cruise Lines are the longest-running corporate partner of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). The company has been supporting the RNLI since 1971, and in 2011, its generous passengers raised \u00a395,424 for the RNLI. In 2011, Kyle of Lochalsh would receive a new Atlantic 85-class lifeboat, funded by guests onboard Fred. Olsen's four ships Balmoral, Black Watch, Braemar and Boudicca. At a ceremony in April 2012, the lifeboat was named Spirit of Fred. Olsen (B-856).\nOn Saturday 21 November 2020, Kyle of Lochalsh lifeboat was called to the aid of nine divers, when their dive boat lost power, and drifted away from the dive site. All divers were recovered, and the boat was later towed to harbour.\nKyle of Lochalsh lifeboats\nLaunch and recovery tractors\n",
    "Super hero role-playing game supplement\nCover art by George Perez\nThe Olympians is a supplement published by Hero Games/Iron Crown Enterprises in 1990 for the superhero role-playing game Champions.\nContents\nThe Olympians is a supplement that allows the gamemaster to add gods of the Greek pantheon to their campaign. During ancient times, the Greek gods found themselves once again at war with the Titans and closed the portal to Olympus to protect Earth from the war. When the gods had defeated the Titans, they reopened the portal but found it now led to 20th century Earth. The cost to open the portal has left all the gods very weak. Thirteen gods are given full-page write-ups that include their game statistics.\nTwo long adventures and two short adventures are also included.\nPublication history\nHero Games first published the superhero role-playing game Champions in 1981, and then published many supplements and adventures for it, including The Olympians in 1990, a 44-page book written by Kurt Dershem, and illustrated by George Perez, Jackie Sutherland, and Kevin Williams.\nReception\nIn Issue 27 of White Wolf (June/July 1991), Sean Holland commented, \"A beautiful cover by George Perez graces the cover, and though the interior art is not up to the standards of the cover, it is still quite good.\" Holland found some of the descriptions of what the gods now did for work on Earth \"most interesting\", but found none of the four adventures included in this book exceptional. Holland concluded by giving this book a rating of 4 out of 5, saying, \"I have problems with a few of the descriptions of the gods, but overall I am quite happy with this supplement and I recommend it for those who would like a mythical twist to their Champions campaign.\"\nOther reviews\nGamesMaster International (Issue 7 - Feb 1991)",
    "Portuguese business executive\nAna Figueiredo is the CEO of Altice Portugal, the largest telecommunications service provider in Portugal, formerly known as Portugal Telecom.\nEarly life and education\nFigueiredo was born in Lisbon in 1974 and lived for a time in Estoril before moving with her family to the Lisbon suburb of Benfica so that her mother could be closer to her parents, who had health problems. Her maternal grandfather had lost his hearing and she has said that she learned to read and write early to communicate with him. She attended the Beiral school in Benfica and then went to the Instituto Superior de Economia e Gest\u00e3o\u00a0 (ISEG), part of the University of Lisbon, where she obtained a degree in Business Administration and Management, following this with an MBA from the Catholic University of Portugal and Nova School of Business and Economics.\nCareer\nFigueiredo began her career as an auditor at Galp Energia, a Portugal-based, multinational energy corporation, and then moved to Ernst & Young, a major international accounting firm. In 2003 she joined Portugal Telecom, which since 2015 has been the fully owned subsidiary of the French multinational Altice, the owner of the MEO brand in Portugal. Between 2016 and 2018, she served as Executive Audit Director of the Altice Group in Switzerland, overseeing operations in France, the United States, Israel, Portugal, and the Dominican Republic. In 2018, she became CEO of Altice Dominicana S.A., the first woman to head a telecommunications company in the country. There she was responsible for the strategic and operational restructuring of the company. She was appointed CEO of Altice Portugal in April 2022. That year the company had a turnover of around \u20ac3 billion.\nAwards\nIn 2023 Figueiredo was ranked by Forbes magazine as the 7th most powerful businesswoman in Portugal, and the most powerful in the telecommunications sector.\nControversy\nA year after Figueiredo took on her role as CEO, the offices of Altice Portugal were raided by the police following the opening of a preliminary investigation by the French authorities into possible cases of corruption and money laundering in the Altice group worldwide. The police operation, known as Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Picoas, followed the arrest in 2022 of Altice co-founder Armando Pereira and his business partner Hern\u00e2ni Antunes. No blame was being attached to Figueiredo, however, who saw her role as being to restore the reputation of the company.\n",

    "Australian stockman and drover (1852\u20131892)\nSamuel Burns Croker (20 June 1852 \u2013 20 September 1892) was a stockman and drover in Queensland and the Northern Territory where he was well known as \"Greenhide Sam Croker, because of his skill working with greenhide (the untanned hide of an animal). He often worked alongside Nat Buchanan and, together, they 'pioneered' the Murranji Track in 1886.\nCroker was killed by Aboriginal stockman Charlie Flannigan on Auvergne Station.\nEarly life\nCroker was born at Dungowan Station, near Tamworth in New South Wales, and was the son of John and Martha Croker who were Scottish immigrants. The family moved numerous times during Croker's early life.\nLife in the Northern Territory\nCroker began working with Nat Buchanan in 1877, and became considered his 'right-hand man', and in the same year they became the first Europeans to cross the Barkly Tableland. Croker was then employed on a number of Buchanan's properties, including Wave Hill Station (which was established in 1882), where it is recorded that he was involved in reprisals and massacres of the Gurindji people living there. One such recorded incident, shortly after the establishment of the station, was when Croker shot a man in the back for attempting to take a bucket.\nIn 1882 he was also involved in the Red Lilly Lagoon Massacre on Elsey Station in which, in reprisal for the 15 July death of Duncan Campbell in which 20 Mangarayi people were killed. During this massacre Croker assisted Augustus Lucanus; Charlie Flannigan is believed to have been in this area and escaped them at the time \nAn earlier recorded incident was in December 1878, at Glencoe Station, where Croker led a reprisal massacre following the death of station hand William Travers. In this massacre Croker killed many local Aboriginal people whether they had been involved in Travers death or not.\nAt the time of his death Croker was 40 and was the acting manager of Auvergne Station, while the manager Jack Watson was away. He had brought with him Flannigan, who he had known for some time and had recruited from Wave Hill Station, to construct cattle yards; it was offered as a week of work. In their time together Croker bullied Flannigan and Flannigan later stated, in a statement to police, that Croker would often shoot at cattle close to him to intimidate him.\nOn the night of Croker's death the two men had an argument over cards and after death Flannigan handed himself over to the authorities and was later sentenced to death and executed at Fannie Bay Gaol on 15 July 1893; this was the first official execution in the Northern Territory. The trial and subsequent execution was covered by media around Australia and was regularly covered in the Northern Territory media.\nDescription\nGordon Buchanan, the son of Nat Buchanan, described Croker as:\nFair of medium height and wiry build ... a natural backwoodsman, hardy and accustomed to hunt for a live on \"bush tucker\" all kinds, from dingo and snakes to barramundi and wild duck ... Though not a good tracker, he had all the other bush craft of  ... Not a great stockman and horseman ... yet he was equal to any bush emergency ... never enthusiastic, yet never downhearted, he was generally cheerful, imperturbable, with a tendency to romance, and to chaff and banter.\u2014\u200aGordon Buchanan giving a description of Sam Croker, from Packhorse & Waterhole (1933)\nGrave\nCroker's grave is located at Auvergne Station, 59 kilometres (37\u00a0mi) from Timber Creek.\nLegacy\nCroker is remembered in the naming of a number of locations in the Northern Territory:\nCroker Creek, on Wave Hill Station, on Gurindji country, is named for Croker.\nCroker Street, in Katherine, Northern Territory.\nCroker Street, in Nakara, Northern Territory.",
    "Colbert dynasty of French origin\nThe Colbert family is a surviving family of the French nobility, originally from Reims, Marne. Descended from merchants and bankers established in Reims and Troyes in the 16th century, the family formed several branches which successively acceded to the nobility during the 17th century. The Troyes line, a cadet branch which is the only branch surviving today, was the first to be ennobled in 1603 by the purchase of a position as Counselor Secretary to the King.\nFollowing Jean-Baptiste Colbert, advisor to Cardinal Mazarin who, upon the death of the Cardinal, became minister to King Louis XIV, the Colbert family knew how to benefit from the social advancement of Louis XIV's minister and to give its members access to the highest offices and functions of the kingdom. In addition to the famous minister of Louis XIV, the Colbert family gave many dignitaries to the Kingdom of France, ministers, bishops, and general officers, from the second half of the 17th century to the end of the 18th century. From Louis XIV to the French Revolution, it belonged to the high nobility of the country.\nHistory\nThe first known Colbert, Jehan Colbert, was a masonry contractor in Reims, who married Marie Thuillier in 1492.

He attended Jakob Westholm High School\u00a0 and studied at the State Industrial Art School from 1923 to 1924. He trained further at Anatoly Kaigorodov's studio.\nCareer\nJaanim\u00e4gi first worked as a poster artist for cinemas in Tallinn and N\u00f5mme. In 1931, he traveled abroad, where he held exhibitions of his caricatures in Latvia and Lithuania. In 1929, he worked as a set design artist for the drama film Dollarid. From 1930 to 1931, he worked with the cinematographer and entrepreneur Voldemar P\u00e4ts at the studio of the well-known photographer Aleksander Teppor\u00a0 on Suur-Karja Street in Tallinn on the first Estonian animated film, Kutsu-Juku seiklusi (The Adventures of Juku the Dog). The film premiered at the Modern cinema in Tallinn on April 30, 1931.

    "Species of frog\nLeucostethus bilsa, the Bilsa white-chested frog, is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae.  It is endemic to Ecuador.\nDescription\nThe adult male frog measures 21.7\u201324.2\u00a0mm long in snout-vent length and the adult female frog about 27.4\u201328.2\u00a0mm. The skin of the dorsum is brown in color, with some darker brown to gray with some black marks. The flanks are brown to black in color with a cream-white stripe on each side from the middle of the body to the vent. The black color stops at a defined stripe between the white belly and the yellow color where the legs (all four) meet the body. The adult frog has a white belly, but it can have gray spots on the throat and chest. The male frog's testicles can be white or gray in color. The upper lip is cream-white in color with some light gray. The upper parts of the feet are brown in color with three dark brown bands and one line.The bottoms of the feet are yellow. Other parts of the frog are light brown in color. The iris of the eye is yellow-gold in color with some copper or brown, with some small black marks.\nEtymology\nScientists named this frog for its type locality, the Reserva Biol\u00f3gica Bilsa, which is itself named for the nearby Bilsa River, one of many water sources it protects.\nHabitat\nThis frog is diurnal. Scientists observed it on the leaf litter near streams and on stream banks in primary and secondary forest between 426 and 515 meters above sea level.  Scientists found it in the Reserva Biol\u00f3gica Bilsa, a private biological reserve.\nReproduction\nAfter the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to streams for further development. Scientists have observed the tadpoles in the water from August to June, so they infer the frog reproduces year-round.\nThreats\nThe IUCN classifies this frog as critically endangered. It has only been found in a small remnant of forest, the rest of which has been cut down for logging, palm oil plantations, and cattle grazing.\n",
    "Moroccan mathematician\nNajiba Sbihi (born 1953) is a Moroccan mathematician and operations researcher, known for her contributions to graph theory and graph algorithms.\nEducation and career\nSbihi earned a degree from the Faculty of Sciences of Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco in 1973. She continued her studies in France at Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble, first in computer science in which she earned a bachelor's degree in 1975. Continuing in operations research, she earned a dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes approfondies in 1976, a doctorat de troisi\u00e8me cycle in 1978 under the supervision of Michel Sakarovitch, and a doctorat d'\u00e9tat in 1987, supervised by Jean Fonlupt. Her doctoral study also included research in Canada with Jack Edmonds at the University of Waterloo and with V\u00e1clav Chv\u00e1tal at McGill University.\nShe worked with the Moroccan National Center for Scientific and Technical Research until, in 1992, becoming a professor of industrial engineering in the Mohammadia School of Engineering in Rabat. She headed the Department of Industrial Engineering from 1995 to 1997.\nContributions\nSbihi's contributions to graph theory and graph algorithms include the discovery that the maximum independent set problem can be solved in polynomial time on claw-free graphs. With Chv\u00e1tal, she proved a special case of the strong perfect graph theorem, for the graphs that have no bull graph as an induced subgraph. Their work in this area introduced a type of graph decomposition that was central to the eventual proof of the full strong perfect graph theorem. She and Chv\u00e1tal also devised efficient algorithms for recognizing the claw-free perfect graphs, and later she and Bruce Reed showed how to recognize the Bull-free perfect graphs.\nSelected publications\n",

    "Species of fish\nThe smallspine turretfish (Tetrosomus reipublicae) is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Ostraciidae, the boxfishes. This species is found in the Indo-Pacific region.\nTaxonomy\nThe smallspine turretfisj was first formally described as Triorus reipublicae in 1930 by the Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley with its type locality given as Moreton Bay in Queensland. Whitley based his desruiption on Based on Lactophrys reipublicae decsribed by James Douglas Ogilby in 1913, which is a nomen nudum, plus additional material. the taxon Tetrosomus concatenatus is regarded by some authorities as a synonym of the Western Atlantic Lactophrys triqueter, and that Indo-Pacific specimens assigned to T. concatenatus are actually this species. The 5th edition of Fishes of the World classifies the genus Tetrosomus within the family Ostraciidae in the suborder Ostracioidea within the order Tetraodontiformes.\nEtymology\nThe smallspine turretfish is a member of the genus Tetrosomus, this name being is a combination of tetra, meaning \"four\", and somus, which means \"body\", a reference to the quadrangular shape of the body of this fish. The specific name reipublicae means \"commonwealth\", an allusion to the Commonwealth of Australia, a name invented by Ogilby for the Australian populations of L. concatenatus.\nDescription\nThe smallspine turretfish is a greenish to brown or pinkish boxfish, the juveniles are marked with dark spots> As they grow the numbers of blue spots and lines increases. There are two spines on the dorsal ridge running along the back. The carapace has a triangular cross-section. The mouth is small and there is a pointed snout. The dorsal fin is located further forward in comparison to the anal fin. This species has a maximum published total length of 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in).\nDistribution and habitat\nThe smallspine turretfish occurs in the tropical, Indo-west Pacific, ranging from East Africa through Indonesia north to southern Japan and south to Australia. In Australia it ranges from Albany to norteast of the Monte Bello Islands, Western Australia and north Queensland as far south as Tathra, New South Wales, as well as in the Lord Howe Province in the Tasman Sea. This species occurs in inshore reefs and seagrass meadows.\n",

    "RNLI Lifeboat station in Highland, Scotland\nPortree Lifeboat Station is located at the Pier, on Quay Street, in Portree, the largest town on the Isle of Skye, one of the Inner Hebrides, overlooking the Sound of Raasay, on the north-west coast of Scotland, formerly in the county of Ross and Cromarty, now in the administrative region of Highland.\nA lifeboat was first placed at Portree by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) on 9 March 1991.\nPortree Trent-class Lifeboat 14-16 Stanley Watson Barker (ON 1214)\nThe station currently operates a Trent-class All-weather lifeboat, 14-16 Stanley Watson Barker (ON 1214), on station since 1996.\nHistory\nIn May 1989, at a meeting of the RNLI Committee of Management, it was decided that a station should be opened early in 1991 at Portree on the Isle of Skye. A 12-month evaluation period was set, after which it was hoped a permanent all-weather lifeboat station would be established. The nearest other lifeboat stations were Mallaig, 38 miles (61\u00a0km), Stornoway, 49 miles (79\u00a0km), and Lochinver, 56 miles (90\u00a0km).\nOn 9 March 1991, the Waveney-class relief lifeboat 44-007 Connel Elizabeth Cargill (ON 1006) was placed on service temporarily. Soon afterwards, she was replaced by another Waveney-class lifeboat, 44-016 Ralph and Joy Swann (ON 1042). Ralph and Joy Swann was built in 1976, and had previously served at Ramsgate and Tobermory. The lifeboat was named after Cmdr Ralph Swan and his wife. Swann was a former chairman of the RNLI, and was a life-vice-president, until his death in 1992.\nWith the station now permanently established, it was essential to provide a lifeboat house, with crew facilities, a workshop, and changing rooms and showers. A building on Portree Pier formerly operated by 'Moray Fish' was found to be an ideal location, and after suitable conversion work, was opened in 1994.\n7 June 1996 would see the arrival of Portree's first new lifeboat. The Trent-class lifeboat cost \u00a31,175,000, and was funded from the bequest of the late Mr Stanley Watson Barker, former Town Clerk for Barking and Dagenham, together with legacies from Mr Jack R Blaxland and Mrs Eileen Arabian. At a ceremony on 11 June 1997, the lifeboat was duly named 14-16 Stanley Watson Barker (ON 1214).\nIn 1991, Portree Lifeboat Station celebrated their 30th anniversary. Hamish Corrigall and John Nicolson were part of the original crew when the station was established in 1991, and progressed to become coxswain and mechanic respectively. In the 30-years of service to 2021, Portree RNLI had launched 520 times, helped 462 people, and saved 18 lives.\nPortree lifeboats\n",
    "Form of regional integration\nMulti-speed integration (Multi-level or a la carte integration) refers to an integration community where participants independently choose to advance to different levels of integration, resulting in varying degrees of integration among members (including Economic integration).\nMulti-speed Europe and Differentiated integration approaches are discussed in the framework of European integration.\nIn the context of European integration, the four freedoms are considered to be inseparable and inviolable. Countries hoping to share in the free movement of goods, services and capital must accept the free movement of labour as well.\nMulti-speed integration is proposed in Mercosur.\nMulti-speed integration was envisaged by the Treaty on the formation of a single economic space of Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.\nAfter the conclusion of the Agreement on free trade in services, the Information and Analytical Department of the CIS Executive Committee notes in October 2023 that at the moment a kind of pyramid of integration entities has developed in the CIS countries, differing in the depth of economic integration, and the implementation of free trade agreements and a number of other documents will lead to the formation of a full-fledged common economic space within the Commonwealth. Within its participant countries, state borders will cease to be an obstacle to the free movement of goods, services, labor and capital.

As an influential liberal official, Li played an instrumental role in the thought-liberation movement in the late 1970s and in the 1980s, and was called the \"Thought Liberation Vanguard\" and the \"Flag Bearer for China's New Enlightenment movement\".\nBiography\nLi Honglin was born in Gaizhou, Liaoning in 1925. He graduated from Northwestern Agriculture College, and joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1946 while in college.\nSince 1948, Li worked at a number of universities, including Yan'an University, the Revolutionary University of Northwest in Xi'an, and the Northwest Normal College in  Lanzhou. In 1954, he began a two-year study at the college of Marxism-Leninism in Beijing, which later became the Central Party School of the CCP. Since 1956, Li worked at the Political Research Office of the CCP Central Committee (\u4e2d\u5171\u4e2d\u592e\u653f\u6cbb\u7814\u7a76\u5ba4), until the beginning of Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976) during which he was purged and persecuted. Li and his family were sent to the countryside at the shore of Bohai (near Tianjin) to do farm work and manual labor.\nAfter the Cultural Revolution ended, Li was rehabilitated and held several key positions in Beijing since 1977, including the director of the Communist Party History Department of the National History Museum, deputy director of the Theory Bureau of the CCP Publicity Department, and President of the Fujian Academy of Social Sciences. He was also a visiting scholar and Henry Luce Fellow at Princeton University in the United States in 1986.\nIn the late 1970s and the 1980s, Li played an important role in China's New Enlightenment movement. In his famous talk \"The Leader and the People\" at the CCP Theory Conference in January 1979, Li argued that state leaders must be loyal to the people\u2014not the other way around, as was commonly believed in China. In the same year, he published an article titled \"No Forbidden Areas for Reading Books\" in Dushu magazine, arguing that there should be no forbidden areas in reading books and calling for elimination of all restrictions on reading books.\nLi was arrested during the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989 and was jailed for almost a year.

    "American software company\nScripto Enterprises Inc. is an American computer software company based in Studio City, Los Angeles. It offers screenwriting, television production, and narrative video game development software. The company was founded in 2014 by comedian Stephen Colbert, former The Colbert Report writer and coder Rob Dubbin, and Colbert's wife Evie McGee-Colbert. The company offers a screenwriting software, also called Scripto, a cloud based collaborative writing platform, developed to address shortcomings in the writing program they were using at the time. The software is used by shows like The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, The Daily Show and SNL's Weekend Update.\nHistory\nConception\nIn 2010, Rob Dubbin was a writer for The Colbert Report. To develop its scripts, the show used the Electronic News Production System (ENPS), a suite developed by the Associated Press, which was originally created to be used by news programs and journalists. Host Stephen Colbert and the writing staff were often frustrated by the program, as it did not allow for work to be made by several people, on a document, at the same time. Dubbin described the AP software as \"almost more  like a networked Word document\". Because of the scripted comedy format of the Report, they needed a different workflow than what the ENPS offered. The need for a new software became evident after a mishap on the show, where a script originally featured a joke involving a real life goat, a significant production expense. The bit was cut during revisions, but the production team was not made aware beforehand, and booked the goat anyway. They only realized once the animal was on its way to the studio. At the end of that year Colbert and Dubbin first discussed making a bespoke drafting program for the staff.\n2011\u20132014: Development\nIn 2011, Aside from his writing duties, Dubbin started the process of creating an alternative inspired by Etherpad, and he and Colbert split the costs to hire a team of outside programmers. Following a friend's advice, Dubbin posted a banner ad on Reddit saying The Colbert Report was looking for programmers, among the people who responded were Paul Ford and Aaron Swartz. A rough version of the software was introduced slowly and used on the show, \"Once every couple weeks, we fixed the thing that went horribly wrong\", Dubbin said. By 2013, the software was stable enough that it was used daily for the last two years the show was on the air.\nTheir first outside show to use the software was Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, after one of The Colbert Report producers had left the show to work on Last Week Tonight, and had recommended Scripto to the staff. At that point, Dubbin saw that other shows were getting interested, and in January 2014, Colbert, Dubbin, and Colbert's wife, Evie McGee-Colbert founded Scripto Enterprises Inc. as a way to commercialize the software. Scripto's first employee was programmer and media critic, Rusty Foster, who joined the staff at the suggestion of Ford, in January 2014. Dubbin said of Foster, \"He became sort of the eyes and ears person for all the other shows that were gonna start to use it\". That year The Daily Show also incorporated Scripto. Foster noted the software was not SaaS at first: \"The first batch of clients got two servers each. It wasn't a cloud thing. We installed a pair of physical servers in their studio\".\n2015\u20132020: Establishment\nWhen Colbert replaced David Letterman as host of The Late Show on CBS he took the software with him. Dubbin also joined the show through pre-production, and the first season of the show, but left in late 2016 to focus on his job as CEO of Scripto. By late 2015 other shows had licensed the software, including: Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, The Opposition with Jordan Klepper, and The Jim Jefferies Show, among others. An ad for the company ran during the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, which Colbert hosted, and the software itself was used to write the script for the ceremony.\nBy late 2017, Dubbin, Foster and their team were beta-testing a new scriptwriting software named Showrunner. The software intended for scripted television, was described by Dubbin as an alternative to Final Draft, \"People work in more collaborative teams. They work across the country from each other. There are more people working remotely. And that\u2019s true for creative projects in addition to technological ones. We wanna make a product for those people. So we\u2019re working on it\". In 2019, the company hired Alice DuBois to supervise the development of Showrunner, overseeing product and project management, among other things. During the pandemic Scripto was benefitted by the lockdowns as the platform allowed many companies to work remotely. In late 2020 Foster left the company, of his exit, he said: \"Like, if the servers at the Late Show die in the middle of the production day I get a text, and it's very stressful. It's been very stressful for a long t",

    "Iran's leader Khamenei's opinion about Israel\nIsrael won't exist in 25 years is a statement of Ali Khamenei (Supreme Leader of Iran) in a speech about Israel after the Iran nuclear deal framework, which was published on his Twitter. According to Khamenei's official website, this sentence was chosen as \"the most important and memorable sentence of Khamenei\" in 2015. This slogan is used in propaganda and also in the Quds Day.\nKhamenei has explained that the destruction of Israel is aimed at enmity with the Israeli government. At the same time, this slogan was installed on the calendar board in Tehran city.

In response to Israel's statement, Khamenei said in a statement: \"I tell you first that Israel will not see the next 25 years; Second, during this period, Iran will maintain the spirit of championship, seriousness, and jihad, and you will be worried every moment.\" On December 14, 2016, Khamenei repeated this sentence in his meeting with Ramadan Abdullah and said: \"As we have said before, the Zionist regime will not have a foreign existence in the next 25 years under the condition of the general and united struggle of the Palestinians and Muslims against the Zionists.\"\nIsrael's reaction\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Khamenei does not even allow the supporters of the agreement to move so that they can fantasize about it.\" He also stated: \"This will not happen.

His main works were on the theory of strength of structures and constructions. Of great importance for the practice of design and construction are the theoretical foundations of calculating building structures for limit states, developed under his supervision. He also developed the principles of typification of transport and industrial structures. A number of large metal railway bridges were built according to his designs.\nBiography\nStreletsky's grave at Novodevichy Cemetery\nBorn September 2 (14), 1885 in the Osowiec Fortress of the Belostoksky Uyezd of the Kingdom of Poland. His father, military engineer Stanislav Streletsky, built defensive structures in Vilnius, Riga, Khabarovsk and Vladivostok.\nIn 1904, Nikolai Streletsky graduated from high school in Vladivostok and entered the St. Petersburg Institute of Railway Engineers, where he graduated with honors in 1911. To improve his knowledge of bridge construction, he was sent on a two-year business trip to Germany, where he attended lectures at the Charlottenburg Higher Technical School, worked in a design bureau, and participated in the construction of bridges.\nAfter returning from abroad, Streletsky began working at the Moscow\u2013Kazan Railway Society, where, under his leadership, projects were developed for bridges across the Oka River and a tunnel under the Volga in Nizhny Novgorod.\nIn 1915, Streletsky became a teacher at the Faculty of Civil Engineering at Moscow Higher Technical School; In 1917, he headed the bridge department and simultaneously began teaching at the Moscow Institute of Railway Engineers. In 1918, he received the title of professor.\nIn 1927, on his initiative, a test was conducted on a 33.2 m long railway span structure made of shipbuilding steel, manufactured in 1909, which was not allowed by the Ministry of Railways to be installed on a bridge and had been stored at the Kolomensky Plant all these years. Experimental static and dynamic studies under load showed its satisfactory qualities. Then followed projects developed under Streletsky's supervision for railway bridges across the Tsipa River on the Transcaucasus Railway, across the Noni and Sungari Rivers on the Chinese Eastern Railway (1927), as well as arched bridges across the New and Old Dnieper in Zaporizhzhia during the construction of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station. The latter had a span of 224 m, the largest in Europe at that time. These bridges confirmed the advantages of span structures made of low-alloy steels of high quality.\nIn 1930\u20131935, he headed the bridge department at the Military Engineering Academy. He combined his teaching work with extensive research and engineering activities.\nIn addition to bridge construction, Streletsky was interested in metal structures of industrial and civil construction. In 1927, he became one of the organizers of the State Institute of Construction, which was transformed five years later into TsNIIPS, where he first headed the laboratory, and in 1935-1936 he was the director.\nStreletsky created the \"triangle of metal construction development\" that later became widely known, which included Proektstalkonstruktsiya, the metal structures department of TsNIIPS and the corresponding department of the Kuybyshev Moscow Institute of Civil Engineering. For thirty years, he carried out the interaction between these three organizations. Under his leadership, regional creative centers for the development of metal structures were created in Novosibirsk, Leningrad, Makeyevka, Novokuznetsk, Gorky, Voronezh and others. From 1932, he headed the Department of Metal Structures at MISI, where he studied in depth the issues of their calculation, including taking into account the development of plastic deformations.\nIn 1931, Streletsky was awarded the title of Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.\nHe died on February 15, 1967, and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.\n",

    "\nSMS Iltis was the third and final member of the Wolf class of steam gunboats built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s.\nDesign\nMain article: Wolf-class gunboat\nGerman economic activity in Qing China in the 1870s faced significant threats from piracy and resistance from local officials, so the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) stationed warships in East Asia to protect its trade interests. At the same time, the old J\u00e4ger-class gunboats that had been ordered in 1859 needed to be replaced. The two Albatross-class gunboats and the rebuilt Cyclop were too few for the task of patrolling the Far East, so another three vessels were ordered according to the fleet plan that had been approved in 1872. The design for the new ships was completed in 1876, and it called for reusing the engines from three of the Cam\u00e4leon-class gunboats that had also been ordered in the 1859 plan. These three ships became the Wolf-class gunboats. They were to be used extensively abroad to support the fleet's larger cruising screw corvettes and screw frigates.\nIltis was 47.2 meters (154\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 7.66\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.1\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in). She displaced 490 metric tons (480 long tons) as designed and 570\u00a0t (560 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 5\u00a0officers and 80\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a marine steam engine that drove a 2-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by two coal-fired trunk fire-tube boilers. Her propulsion system was rated to produce a top speed of 8.5 knots (15.7\u00a0km/h; 9.8\u00a0mph) at 340 metric horsepower (340\u00a0ihp), but she reached 9.2 knots (17.0\u00a0km/h; 10.6\u00a0mph) in service. At a cruising speed of 9 knots (17\u00a0km/h; 10\u00a0mph), she could steam for 1,640 nautical miles (3,040\u00a0km; 1,890\u00a0mi). To supplement the steam engine on long voyages, the ships were fitted with a barque sailing rig.\nThe ship was armed with a pair of 12.5\u00a0cm (4.9\u00a0in) K L/23 built-up guns, which were supplied with a total of 270\u00a0rounds of ammunition. She carried an additional pair of 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) K L/24 built up guns and three 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon.\nService history\nThe contract for Iltis was awarded to the Kaiserliche Werft Danzig (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig on 26 May 1877, and she was laid down in June that year. She was launched on 18 September 1878, and Kapit\u00e4n zur See (Captain at Sea) Otto Livonius, who was the director of the shipyard, gave a speech at the launching ceremony. Work on the ship was delayed to allow the navy to gain experience with the rebuilt gunboat Cyclop. Iltis was commissioned and manned with shipyard personnel on 2 March 1880 to move the ship to Kiel. She was decommissioned on 15 March, and then reactivated on 9 April to transfer the ship to Wilhelmshaven. During that period, the ship was initially commanded by Kapit\u00e4nleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) Wilhelm B\u00fcchsel, but he was replaced by KL\u00a0Oscar Klausa later in April. The ship was then decommissioned again on 22 May.\nFirst overseas deployment, 1880\u20131886\nIltis was recommissioned on 1 July, again under Klausa's command, for a deployment to East Asia, where she was to replace Cyclop in the East Asia Cruiser Squadron. She arrived in the region on 19 September, allowing Cyclop to return home. In late January 1881, she and the screw corvette Freya, along with several Chinese gunboats, searched unsuccessfully in Mirs Bay for a group of pirates who had attacked the German barque Occident. Beginning on 20 March, Iltis began a tour of the Philippines, steaming as far south as the Sulu Archipelago. She returned to Chinese waters on 24 April, and visited several southern Chinese ports in June before returning to northern China at the end of the month. On 28 July, she stopped in Yantai. There, she took part in training exercises on 3 September with the screw frigate Hertha and the corvette Stosch. Over the following month and a half, she cruised in northern Chinese waters, at times with the other two vessels and at times alone. She steamed up the Hai River in late October to visit Tianjin.\nIltis under way, by Willy St\u00f6wer\nIn early January 1882, Iltis sailed for southern Chinese waters once again. She was sent to relieve her sister ship Wolf in early May, which had been conducting surveys in the Paracel Islands but had been ordered elsewhere. Iltis then took over survey operations in the area, with the probable intention of searching for a suitable location to establish a coaling station. Later that year, Iltis returned north, but on 28 August, she was ordered south again; the Anglo-Egyptian War had broken out in July, and Iltis was to be transferred to the Mediterranean Sea to protect German interests. But the move proved to be unnecessary, and the ship was instead diverted to the Pescadores Islands, where the German brig August had run aground and her crew had been robbed by pirates. A landing party was sent ashore, and with assistance from the Chinese army, they recovered mo",

    " Historic site in Queensland, AustraliaThe Fort is a heritage-listed monastery, spiritual retreat and house at 199 Fort Road, Oxley, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built in 1882. It is also known as Regina Coeli Retreat and St Mary's Retreat. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 September 2020.\nHistory\nThe Fort, located at the north end of Fort Road in Oxley is a c.\u20091882 timber house situated on a high bluff on the south bank of the Brisbane River. It was constructed for the retired pastoralist Henry William Coxen (1823\u20131915), one of the early European settlers on the Darling Downs, on a 9 hectares (22 acres) property he had purchased in 1865. The Fort was sold to the Corkran family in 1906, then to the Passionist Order of the Catholic Church (the Congregation of the Passion, or the Passionists) in 1955, at which time the property became the order's only Queensland retreat (monastery), and a base for their local community outreach. It is officially known as St Mary's Retreat. The majority of The Fort property, not including the house, was sold to the Brisbane City Council (BBC) in 2005, and is now The Fort Bushland Reserve.\nOxley, traditionally the land of the Turrbal and Jagera people, is about 11 kilometres (6.8\u00a0mi) south-west of the Brisbane central business district. In the 1850s, the area was known as Boyland's Pocket, after the pastoralist Thomas Boyland, and in the early 1860s it was subdivided into small farms. Churches, a post office and a hotel were built in the 1860s, near Ipswich Road between Brisbane and Ipswich, and Oxley Primary School opened nearby in 1870. The Main Line railway towards Brisbane, over a bridge at Indooroopilly, opened as far as Oxley West (Sherwood) on 1 October 1874. Although the completion of the Main Line railway between Brisbane and Ipswich in 1876 boosted settlement in the district, Oxley remained largely rural until after World War II, with two small areas of settlement: one near Ipswich Road, and the other to the north near the Oxley railway station.\nIn January 1865, the site of \"The Fort\" (Portion 189 in the Parish of Oxley) consisting of 22\u00a0acres 1\u00a0rood (9.0\u00a0ha), was purchased by Henry William Coxen and William Sim of \"Bendemere\" for \u00a359 15s. Located on the south bank of the Brisbane River, less than 1 kilometre (0.62\u00a0mi) northwest of the later location of the Oxley railway station, the land was transferred to Coxen alone in 1866. It has previously been claimed that the site of The Fort was purchased by Coxen in 1873, after he passed the property while travelling by boat to Ipswich and its position reminded him of a Fort in Bombay (now Mumbai), India.\nHenry William Coxen (1823\u20131915) was born in Croydon, England, on 3 March 1823, the son of  Lieutenant Henry Holman Coxen, of the 14th Light Infantry. A firearms accident in 1836, during his time at Eton College, badly injured Henry's right hand. In 1838, aged 15, Henry travelled to Tasmania with his uncle and aunt, noted ornithologist John Gould and his wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Coxen), where they were guests of Governor John Franklin. They soon moved to New South Wales. After learning about sheep and cattle management on various stations owned by his paternal uncle, Stephen Coxen, and under the tutelage of his uncle Charles Coxen, Henry was sent north in 1842 to the Darling Downs, where Patrick Leslie and his brothers had begun European settlement in March 1840. Accompanied by Lieutenant Irving, three men and an Aboriginal boy, Henry took two drays and 300 head of cattle and selected Jondaryan station in the northern Darling Downs on behalf of his uncle Charles. Jondaryan station was first selected by Henry Dennis in 1841, while he was in the area to select Jimbour for Richard Todd Scougall, and Myall Creek for Charles Coxen.\nHenry returned to England in 1845 to work for a mercantile firm. He married Mary Ann Shelton in London in January 1848, and after some time in the Cape Colony (now within South Africa) the couple returned to Sydney in April 1852. He then took up further pastoral stations in what became Queensland, becoming the owner or part-owner of at least 17 large grazing leases, including Bendemere near Yuleba. Bendemere was advertised for sale in 1864, and was later sold to the Macfarlane family. He divorced in 1865, and married Margaret Moorhead in Victoria in February 1866. Henry disposed of his pastoral interests, and he and Margaret had returned to England by 1867. After unsuccessful investments in foreign securities and the South African sugar industry, Coxen and his family returned to Queensland in 1880. By this time, Henry and Margaret had four children. Henry and Margaret's eldest child was Sarah Moorhead Coxen (b.1861). Their eldest son, Henry Charles Coxen (b.1869) became the chief of staff of the Queensland Department of Public Works. Their younger son, Major-General Walter Adams Coxen CB, CMG, DSO (b.1870) fought in Wo",

    "\nHistoric site in Queensland, Australia\nMareeba Uniting Church is a heritage-listed former church at 189 Walsh Street (corner of Rankin Street), Mareeba, Shire of Mareeba, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Eddie Oribin and built in 1960 by L. Tinslee. It was originally Mareeba Methodist Church. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 June 2021.\nHistory\nThe former Mareeba Uniting Church  was built in the town of Mareeba on the Atherton Tableland in 1960 and is one of a series of innovative buildings designed by Queensland architect Edwin Henry (Eddie) Oribin (1927-2016). Originally established as Mareeba Methodist Church, it was built during a period of Christian modernisation and growth, and served as its congregation's place of worship from its dedication in August 1960 until January 2021.\nThe Atherton Tablelands, west of Cairns in Far North Queensland, was named after squatter John Atherton, who was the first person to establish a cattle run in the area in the late 1870s. In the 1880s, the Atherton family established a wayside inn and store at the crossing of Granite Creek, supplying goods to traffic passing between Port Douglas to the north and the new tin mining township of Herberton to the south. A settlement developed on the southern side of Granite Creek, on the traditional lands of the Muluridgi people, and was surveyed by E. B. Rankin as the town of Mareeba in 1891. In 1893, it became a railhead when the Cairns-to-Kuranda railway line was extended, and by 1919 Mareeba was the district's most important town. Owing its prosperity to a diverse agricultural economy, post-World War II (WWII) Mareeba grew to become the largest tobacco-growing centre in Australia, and in 1954 the town's population reached 3,369.\nThe earliest church services in Mareeba were conducted by visiting clergymen in the 1890s, from temporary premises such as the Mareeba State School (completed in 1893). The first church built in Mareeba was a United Protestant Church, constructed in 1896 on Walsh Street and shared by the Methodist and Presbyterian congregations for more than 60 years. In 1954, the combined population of Methodists and Presbyterians in Mareeba was 752, of which just over half (388) identified as Methodist.\nMethodism arose as a group movement within the Church of England in the early 18th century during the industrial and agrarian revolutions. It spread rapidly throughout the United States of America in the late 18th and early 19th centuries through itinerant preachers and later throughout the world through Methodist missionaries. The term \"Methodism\" arose from the methodical way the Christian faith was approached and included an emphasis on preaching, evangelism, a love for singing, and social activism.\nThe 1950s were a period of substantial change and reform within the Methodist and other Christian denominations throughout Australia, as they sought to become more relevant to modern society. Developments in theology and liturgy, coupled with an expansionary building program, led to a radical departure from established architectural traditions. Reflecting international trends, church designs moved away from historical revival styles and became increasingly influenced by Modernism. However, it was expected that a church would still be recognisable as such, resulting in a wide range of variations combining traditional church elements, symbols, and functions with new construction techniques, materials, and forms. A new flexibility in the spatial organisation of modern churches resulted in an immense variety of plan arrangements that broke away from the traditional cruciform or rectangular plan. These altered church interiors reflected the community celebration of worship, without distance between clergy and people.\nMany new Methodist churches, Sunday school halls, and parsonages were constructed throughout Queensland in the 1950s, replacing older buildings and meeting demand in new suburbs and growing regions. In addition, the church constructed new buildings to support its various charities and organisations including aged-persons homes, hostels, Young People's Department (YPD) Camps, and Kings College (opened 1955) at the St Lucia campus of University of Queensland.\nMethodist optimism in the post-WWII period was demonstrated in \"a series of nationalistic  evangelistic campaigns, which climaxed in the \"Mission to the Nation\"\". Carried out between 1953 and 1957, the Mission was the largest attempt ever made by the Methodist Church to reform the nation, emphasising the Christian faith as the only answer to social and industrial problems. Meetings were held in capital cities and main provincial centres throughout the country, conducted by campaign leader Reverend Alan Walker. Attracting large crowds, the crusade received wide newspaper and radio coverage. During his Queensland tour in 1954, Rev. Walker visited the Atherton Tableland on Sunday 4 July, where a massed service was held in Atherton in ",

    "\nMilitary unit\nThe 13th (Service) Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps, (13th KRRC) was an infantry unit recruited as part of 'Kitchener's Army' in World War I. It served on the Western Front from July 1915 until the Armistice, seeing action at the Somme and the Ancre, at Arras and Ypres, against the German spring offensive, and in the victorious Hundred Days Offensive. It was finally disbanded on the Rhine in August 1920.\nRecruitment and training\nAlfred Leete's recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army. The newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. Men flooded into the recruiting offices and the 'first hundred thousand' were enlisted within days. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'. K2 and K3 followed shortly afterwards.\n13th (Service) Battalion was formed as part of K3 at the Kings Royal Rifle Corps' regimental depot at Peninsula Barracks, Winchester, on 7 October 1914. It was designated as 'Army Troops', ie not assigned to a specific formation, but it was attached to 21st Division. After initial training at the crowded barracks at Winchester, the new battalion went by rail to 21st Division's tented camp at Halton Park, near Wendover in Buckinghamshire. In November the battalion moved out of tents into billets in nearby Amersham and Great Missenden.\nIn April 1915 it moved to Windmill Hill on Salisbury Plain to join the new 37th Division. As authorised in March, 37th Division consisted of Kitchener battalions that had originally been allocated as Army Troops to the New Armies. 13th KRRC was assigned to 111th Brigade in the new division; the brigade also included 10th (Stockbrokers) and 13th Battalions, Royal Fusiliers (RF), and 13th Bn Rifle Brigade (RB). By the time the division assembled, all its units had been training for some months, and it soon began final battle training.\nIn July orders arrived for the division to move to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. 13th KRRC landed at Boulogne on 3 July 1915 under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Chester-Master, a retired KRRC officer who had been Commandant-General of the British South Africa Police and was Chief Constable of Gloucestershire. By 2 August the division had completed its concentration by rail around Tilques, near Saint-Omer. It then began marching towards the front, where it went into billets in the rear area.\nService\n37th Division's 'gold horseshoe' insignia.\nThe battalions of 111th Bde began providing working parties and then in mid-August went up by companies to be attached to units of 12th (Eastern) Division near Armenti\u00e8res for their introduction to trench warfare. On 25 August they marched to Godewaersvelde and entrained for Doullens where the division took over a section of the Somme front from the French. The battalions of 111st Bde carried out their first spells in the trenches near Hannescamps, from the beginning of September, suffering a few casualties: 13th KRRC relieved 13th RB in the front line on 10 September. When not in the front line the battalions provided working parties. On the evening of 24 September the brigade was moved a few miles north and next day waited in full fighting order in case it was called upon to join in the Battle of Loos that began that day. However, it was not employed, and a few days later it returned to its previous trenches. The battalions settled into a routine of six days in the line, six in reserve and 12 at rest (though often providing working parties). When in the from line, they occasionally mounted trench raids, and there was a trickle of casualties. This routine continued until the end of January 1916, the trenches often being flooded during the winter.\nIn February the brigade went back into the line, taking over from the French some trenches at Le Gastineau, a few miles north of the Gommecourt Salient. Duty here was six days in the front line and six out of it; 13th KRRC and 10th RF took turns to man the line in their sector. It was quiet sector, apart from occasional artillery bombardments and raids, though the uneven nature of the ground meant that snipers could find good vantage points on the higher ground. On 19 March 41st Division was withdrawn and marched back to the Doullens area to undergo a month's training. It then returned to billets in Humbercamps, just behind the line, where the usual working parties were supplied to the REs until it took over the line again on 1 May. A working party of 13th KRRC heavily shelled one night while digging a new front line trench.\nSomme\n13th KRRC had been in France almost a year and had still not participated in any major action, but the BEF was ",

    "Boxing match\nMarlon Starling vs. Mark Breland II was a professional boxing match contested on April 16, 1988, for the WBA welterweight title.\nBackground\nOn August 22, 1987, then-WBA welterweight champion Mark Breland and top welterweight contender Marlon Starling had fought for the first time with Starling upsetting the undefeated Breland to capture the WBA welterweight title. Breland hoped for an immediate rematch with Starling, but WBA rules at the time prevented a rematch from happening for the time being. Breland would instead return to the ring in December, defeating Javier Suazo on the undercard of his former Olympic teammate Evander Holyfield's rematch with Dwight Muhammad Qawi. In February 1988, in what was expected to be a precursor to their rematch, Starling and Breland both participated in a tripleheader event (along with Roberto Dur\u00e1n, who defeated Ricky Stackhouse) in a tripleheader event billed as Furious Friday. Breland would defeat Juan Alonso Villa by third-round TKO, while Starling would successfully defend his WBA welterweight title against Fujio Ozaki, winning by unanimous decision. With their respective victories, Starling and Breland's rematch was set for April 16, 1988.\nThe Fight\nIn a largely tactical fight, Starling started off strong, pressing forward, dodging Breland's jabs and effectively counterpunching. Starling took a lead on the judge's scorecards through the first seven rounds, however, Breland would come on strong in the later rounds, losing only the 10th round from the eighth round on. After the fight went the fill 12-round distance, judge Jerry Roth had Starling the winner 116\u2013113, another had Breland the winner 115\u2013114 while the third scored it even 114\u2013114, thus the fight was declared a split draw.\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For WBA Welterweight title ^Note 2 For WBA Lightweight title\nBroadcasting\n",

    "Family of computer vision models designed for efficient inference\nEfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for computer vision published by researchers at Google AI in 2019. Its key innovation is compound scaling, which uniformly scales all dimensions of depth, width, and resolution using a single parameter.\nEfficientNet models have been adopted in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\nCompound scaling\nEfficientNet introduces compound scaling, which, instead of scaling one dimension of the network at a time, such as depth (number of layers), width (number of channels), or resolution (input image size), uses a compound coefficient  to scale all three dimensions simultaneously. Specifically, given a baseline network, the depth, width, and resolution are scaled according to the following equations:subject to  and . The  condition is such that increasing  by a factor of  would increase the total FLOPs of running the network on an image approximately  times. The hyperparameters , , and  are determined by a small grid search. The original paper suggested 1.2, 1.1, and 1.15, respectively.\nArchitecturally, they optimized the choice of modules by neural architecture search (NAS), and found that the inverted bottleneck convolution (which they called MBConv) used in MobileNet worked well.\nThe EfficientNet family is a stack of MBConv layers, with shapes determined by the compound scaling. The original publication consisted of 8 models, from EfficientNet-B0 to EfficientNet-B7, with increasing model size and accuracy. EfficientNet-B0 is the baseline network, and subsequent models are obtained by scaling the baseline network by increasing .\nVariants\nEfficientNet has been adapted for fast inference on edge TPUs and centralized TPU or GPU clusters by NAS.\nEfficientNet V2 was published in June 2021. The architecture was improved by further NAS search with more types of convolutional layers. It also introduced a training method, which progressively increases image size during training, and uses regularization techniques like dropout, RandAugment, and Mixup. The authors claim this approach mitigates accuracy drops often associated with progressive resizing.\nSee also\nConvolutional neural network\nSqueezeNet\nMobileNet\nYou Only Look Once",

    "1979 live album by Carmen McRae\nJazz Gala 79 is a double live album recorded by American singer and pianist Carmen McRae with the participation of singer Joe Williams, trumpeters Thad Jones and Cat Anderson, as well as French pianist Claude Bolling at the March\u00e9 International du Disque et de l'\u00c9dition Musicale Festival in Cannes on January 22, 1979. The album was released the same year in France by America Records and Personal Choice Records in the United States.\nCritical reception\nKen Dryden of AllMusic gave the album three and a half stars and wrote that McRae effectively performs ballads such as \"Body and Soul\" and \"Tis Autumn\", along with the perky \"Bye Bye Blackbird\", although her vocals suffer from reverberation caused by poor engineering. He also noticed that she also takes the rare opportunity to accompany herself on the piano for a restrained, conversational performance of \"A Beautiful Friendship\", where the problem with reverb magically disappears. Another AllMusic reviewer, Jason Birchmeier, gave the album three stars and stated that if you like the music of these musicians or other performances by the Thad Jones band, there is a high probability that you will like this performance, even if there is nothing special or new in it. Billboard magazine called the album a \"wonderful record\", where the rich baritone Joe Williams sang along with Carmen McRae.\nTrack listing\n\"Bowling Green\" (Holmes Daley, Terrence Callier)\u00a0\u2013 4:30\n\"Suivez le chef\" (Claude Bolling)\u00a0\u2013 3:00\n\"Body and Soul\" (Frank Eyton, Johnny Green, Edward Heyman, Robert Sour)\u00a0\u2013 3:30\n\"This Autumn\" (Henry Nemo)\u00a0\u2013 4:20\n\"Bye-Bye Blackbird\" (Mort Dixon, Ray Henderson)\u00a0\u2013 2:16\n\"End of a Beautiful Friendship\" (Donald Kahn, Stanley Styne)\u00a0\u2013 2:50\n\"61st & Richard\" (Thad Jones)\u00a0\u2013 8:00\n\"Back Bone\" (Thad Jones)\u00a0\u2013 6:45\n\"Work Song\" (Nat Adderley, Oscar Brown Jr.)\u2013 2:50\n\"Blues in My Heart\" (Benny Carter, Irving Mills)\u00a0\u2013 3:00\n\"Just the Way You Are\" (Billy Joel)\u00a0\u2013 6:15\n\"It Don't Mean a Thing\" (Duke Ellington, Irving Mills)\u00a0\u2013 3:12\n\"Jungle Trap\" (Claude Bolling)\u00a0\u2013 5:12\n\"Rock Rhythm\" (Duke Ellington)\u00a0\u2013 4:45\n\"Them There Eyes\" (Maceo Pinkard, Doris Tauber, William Tracey)\u00a0\u2013 3:40\n\"Far Jammers\" (Claude Bolling)\u00a0\u2013 1:10\nPersonnel\nCarmen McRae \u2013 vocals, Joe Williams\nGuy Pedersen \u2013 bass\nEmile Vilain \u2013 bass Trombone\nMaurice Bouchon \u2013 drums\nJohn J.

    "Spanish noble, Carlist, and Cuban journalist\nNot to be confused with his son, Nicol\u00e1s Rivero Alonso, or the Mayor of Madrid, Nicol\u00e1s Mar\u00eda Rivero.\nCount Nicol\u00e1s Lino del Rivero Fern\u00e1ndez y Mu\u00f1iz Cueli was a Spanish noble, made the 1st Count of Rivero by Alfonso XIII. He was a Carlist guerrilla fighter who, after his failure in the Carlist Wars, was forcibly expelled from Spain. He did not remain away for long, sneaking back into Spain and eventually rising to the rank of Comandante and participating in the Battle of Montejurra. However, he soon returned to Cuba where he was made an editor of Diario de la Marina, the oldest newspaper in Spanish colonial America, by the newspaper's creator. He was then promoted to become the newspaper's 13th Director, and transformed it into one of the most important newspapers in the history of Cuba, obtaining the unofficial title of Decano de a Presna (Decan of the Press).\nRivero's first son, Nicol\u00e1s Rivero Alonso, the 2nd Count of Rivero, became Cuba's first Ambassador to the Holy See in 1935. Rivero's second son, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Rivero Alonso, inherited the management of Diario de la Marina and the title of Decan of the Press.\nFor most of his life, Rivero was only known as Don Nicol\u00e1s Rivero, and was only given the title of the 1st Count of Rivero several weeks after his death, on August 13, 1919.\nEarly life\nRivero was born in 1849 in Las Callejas, Carda, Spain. He was born into the low classes of Spain, and his parents were in the Spanish peasantry.\nWhen he was old enough, he entered the minor Catholic Seminary in Villaviciosa, Asturias. He then studied at the Catholic Seminary in Oviedo, but did not complete his studies, abandoning the priesthood to fight in the Carlist Wars.\nThird Carlist War\nIn 1872, Rivero joined the Carlist Army in rising up against the government of Spain during the Third Carlist War. Rivero, however, was captured and sentenced to six months in prison. After his initial prison sentence, he was deported to the Canary Islands.\nIn 1873, Rivero was then deported from the Canaries to Cuba, which was his first time on the island. He spent several months here, but spent time planning, communicating, and regrouping with his fellow Carlists.\nIn 1873 or 1874, he secretly returned to Spain and rose to the rank of Comandante in the Carlist Army, and fought in several battles. One of the most famous battles that he took part in here was the Battle of Montejurra, in Montejurra.\nHowever, Rivero's unit was defeated in battle, and Rivero was almost captured, and he fled to exile in France.\nIn 1876, at the conclusion of the Third Carlist War, Rivero returned to Spain.\nEarly career as a civil servant and journalist\nUpon returning to Spain in 1876, Rivero studied at the University of Oviedo for a brief time in the notary public program, but was again unable to complete his studies and did not graduate.\nIn 1880, Rivero returned to Cuba, where he lived and worked in the town of Bauta, Cuba. He worked for roughly a year as the Secretary of the Bauta City Council.\nIn 1881, Rivero created and became the Editor-in-Chief of El Rel\u00e1mpago (The Lightning), the Havana-based weekly newspaper. This newspaper was quickly suspended by the colonial government of Cuba after Rivero used it to attack the Captain General of Cuba. After only a few months in Cuba, Rivero was then deported back to Spain.\nIn 1882, Rivero returned to Cuba and created the newspaper El Rayo (The Thunderbolt). Rivero used this newspaper to denounce the idea of Cuban autonomy and again attack the colonial rulers of Cuba. For this, he was again imprisoned by the government on several occasions.\nBeginning in 1883, Rivero created several other short-lived publications;\nLa Centella (1883)\nEl General Tac\u00f3n (1884-1885)\nEl Espa\u00f1ol (1886)\nEl Pensamiento Espa\u00f1ol (1888)\nCareer at Diario de la Marina and elected office\nIn 1890, Rivero was elected to the office of Provincial Deputy for the district of G\u00fcines.Management of Diario de la Marina.

Rivero continued to have problems with the law, and started writing from seclusion in his home at the Castillo de Morro.\nIn June 1895, he was promoted to the position of director of Diario de la Marina. The newspaper was suffering with low distribution as a result of the start of the Cuban War of Independence. As director of this newspaper, he dedicated much of his attention and many of his arti",

    "Bangladeshi open letter\nOn February 19, 2013, Shah Ahmad Shafi, leader of Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh, published an open letter to the public and the government on the front page of Amar Desh. In the letter, he condemned the ongoing Shahbag protests, claiming they were tied to anti-Islamic activities. He accused the Ahmadiyya community and an anti-Islamic online group of involvement, naming individuals such as Shahriar Kabir, Muntassir Mamoon, Zafar Iqbal, Gholam Rabbani, and Ajoy Roy as responsible. Shafi called on the government to take action against these activities and urged the public to speak out against them. This letter marked Hefazat-e-Islam's entry into the political landscape, initiating the Islamist response to the Shahbag protests and leading to the development of its 13-point demand.\nContext\nAfter the Awami League-led 14-party alliance assumed power in 2009, the government established the International Crimes Tribunal on March 25, 2010, with the aim of prosecuting those accused of committing war crimes during the Bangladesh Liberation War, including members of Jamaat-e-Islami. On February 5, 2013, the tribunal sentenced Abdul Quader Mollah to life imprisonment. The verdict, however, was met with dissatisfaction from the 14-party coalition government, which had hoped for harsher punishment.\nIn response to the ruling, the Blogger and Online Activist Network organized a sit-in protest at Shahbag, demanding the death penalty instead of life imprisonment. Within days, the movement gained widespread attention, receiving both government endorsement and substantial media coverage.\nHowever, the Shahbag protests sparked controversy, as some demonstrators were accused of showing disrespect toward Islamic symbols, including the hijab and the beard. One incident reportedly involved a staged performance in which an actor, dressed in Islamic attire, was struck with a shoe, and a dummy dog was similarly dressed in religious clothing. Such actions provoked significant public outrage, especially after it was revealed that many of the protest organizers were atheists and held views critical of religion.\nOn February 14, 2013, during the annual gathering at Darul Uloom Hathazari, several speakers voiced their opposition to the behavior exhibited during the Shahbag protests. Shah Ahmad Shafi, in his keynote address, stated, \"While we do not oppose the trial of war crimes, the religious community will not remain passive in the face of any conspiracy targeting the ulama, madrasas, Islamic attire, and values.\" Junaid Babunagari echoed these concerns, noting that since the constitutional amendments introducing secularism, there had been increasing attacks on mosques and Islamic practices. He called for unity among scholars and the general public to counter what he termed \"anti-Islamic behavior.\" Abdul Malek Halim accused the Shahbag protesters of distorting the spirit of the Liberation War to further an agenda aimed at erasing Islam from the country.\nTensions escalated on February 15, 2013, when Rajib Haider, one of the bloggers and key organizers of the Shahbag movement, was killed. Following his death, several national newspapers, i.e., The Daily Sangram, Daily Inqilab, Daily Naya Diganta, and Amar Desh, published his writings, which were widely perceived as Islamophobic. This intensified public anger, prompting Shah Ahmad Shafi to issue an open letter. He tasked Muinuddin Ruhi, Munir Ahmad, and Azizul Haque Islamabadi with drafting the letter, which was published on the front page of Amar Desh on February 19, 2013.\nCore material\nThe open letter begins with a brief overview of Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh, outlining its objectives. It then presents 14 allegations concerning various anti-Islamic activities associated with the Shahbag protests. These charges include:\nChildren of Muslims participating in candle-lighting ceremonies at Shahbag, which were seen as imitating practices of fire-worshippers and pagans.\nContinuous playing of music through loudspeakers, including during prayer times.\nBlogs authored by self-identified atheists and founders of Gana Jagaran Mancha, such as Asif Mohiuddin, which contain highly derogatory content and offensive remarks about Islam, Allah, and the Prophet.\nPublic gatherings involving mixed-gender dancing, along with moral corruption, including illicit behavior, obscenity, and the use of alcohol and drugs.\nProtesters wearing attire typically worn by the Imams and Khatibs of Mecca and Medina, known as \"koba,\" while performing mock executions.\nThreats of violence and the use of vulgar language directed at prominent figures in the media and public life from the Shahbag protests stage.\nThe act of tying a rope around the neck of a man wearing a beard and a traditional Muslim cap, which is seen as disrespecting Islamic symbols and mocking the Sunnah of the Prophet.\nIndoctrinating young children with aggressive slogans, encouraging divisive behavior.\nPromoting elements of Indian culture that are",

The hike is one of the most popular in the park, and can be crowded between late July and September, and it can be difficult to find parking at the trailhead. It has been rated both easy and strenuous.

At around 6,750 feet (2,060\u00a0m), the gap is the highest point on the Wonderland Trail encircling the mountain. South of the gap, the Wonderland Trail continues towards Indian Bar and Box Canyon, as the terrain drops off into Ohanapecosh Park, which drains into the Ohanapecosh River. The most popular climbing routes to Banshee Peak and the Cowlitz Chimneys arrive via Panhandle Gap, and while Banshee is a walk-up, the Middle Cowlitz Chimney can be climbed using a Class 2 scrambling route and the Main Chimney is Class 3. On a clear day, Mount Adams is visible from Panhandle Gap, but Mount Rainier itself is largely blocked by the ridge to the west. Some through-hikers deviate to the Eastside Trail, an alternate route to avoid snow and potentially dangerous conditions around the gap.\nPanhandle Gap is above the tree line and the terrain largely consists of rock and ice past Summerland.

    "American neuroradiologist, nuclear medicine physician, and academic administrator\nCarolyn Cidis Meltzer (born c.\u20091961) is an American neuroradiologist, nuclear medicine physician, and academic administrator serving as the dean of the Keck School of Medicine of USC since 2022. She has made significant contributions to neuroimaging research, particularly in brain aging and Alzheimer's disease, and has held leadership positions at University of Pittsburgh, Emory University, and University of Southern California (USC).\nEarly life and education\nMeltzer was born c.\u20091961. Her father, an immigrant from Greece, aspired to be a physician but became an optometrist, while her mother worked as a secretary. Inspired by her father\u2019s interest for math and science, Meltzer pursued an undergraduate degree at Cornell University, where she graduated with honors in biology and neurobiology.\nMeltzer earned a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where she also completed her residency in diagnostic radiology and a fellowship in neuroradiology at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Her medical training laid the foundation for her subsequent specialization in neuroradiology and nuclear medicine. During her medical education, Meltzer was introduced to positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, which greatly influenced her career. She worked in some of the earliest studies involving PET imaging, including as a control subject, and later completed a PET research fellowship.\nCareer\nMeltzer began her academic and research career at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, where she held various academic and administrative appointments including director of the PET center. She worked on developing quantitative assessment methods for PET imaging and participated in early evaluations of PET/CT scanners, contributing to advances in imaging technology. Her research during this period focused on brain structure and function, particularly as it relates to aging, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and psychiatric disorders.\nIn 2007, Meltzer was recruited to Emory University, where she served as the William P. Timmie Professor and chair of the department of radiology and imaging sciences for fifteen years. At Emory, she expanded research initiatives, acquiring one of the first PET/MRI scanners in the country, and conducted research on brain aging, dementia, and psychiatric disorders. In 2010, Meltzer and her colleagues started the Emory Radiology Leadership Academy, a nine-month program designed to transition mid-career faculty and staff into the next phase of their careers. The program was established with the explicit goal of increasing diversity in each cohort. Meltzer also served as executive associate dean of faculty academic advancement, leadership, and inclusion, as well as chief diversity and inclusion officer at Emory University School of Medicine. During her time at Emory, she was awarded the Radiological Society of North America's outstanding researcher award in 2018 and the American Society of Neuroradiology\u2019s gold medal in 2019.\nMeltzer has been at the forefront of radiological research, contributing significantly to the understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders and the aging brain through the use of imaging technologies. Her work with PET imaging and the combined PET/CT scanner has been widely recognized. She developed methods to address challenges in PET imaging, such as partial-volume corrections to enhance the accuracy of brain imaging in older populations. Meltzer was also honored with the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Award from the American Association for Women Radiologists in 2021, further recognizing her impact on the field. In addition, she received the gold medal award from the Association of University Radiologists in 2018 and the distinguished service award from the American Medical Association in 2021.\nIn March 2022, Meltzer became the dean of the Keck School of Medicine of USC at the University of Southern California (USC). As dean, she oversees 26 basic and clinical academic programs and 16 major research institutes. She has been instrumental in fostering interdisciplinary research collaborations and expanding the school's clinical services. Her vision for the Keck School emphasizes diversity, inclusion, and community engagement, reflecting her long-standing commitment to social justice initiatives. Meltzer is also the May S. and John H. Hooval M.D. dean's chair and a professor of radiology.\nIn 2023, Meltzer was awarded the American College of Radiology's (ACR) gold medal, which is considered one of the highest honors in the field, recognizing her exceptional contributions to radiology. She was the fourteenth woman to win the award since its inception in 1927. The same year, Meltzer was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\nPersonal life\nMeltzer is a fine-art photographer. Her artwork has been featured in over fifty solo and group exhibitions across the Un",
    "A woodcut by Albrecht D\u00fcrer depicting the descent of the Holy Spirit\nThe Eternal procession of the Holy Spirit is a theological concept in trinitarianism that describes the relationship of the Holy Spirit within the Holy Trinity. The doctrine of the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit is related to the doctrine of the eternal generation of the Son; however, in Christian theology procession (or spiration) is viewed as being mysteriously different from generation in order to distinguish the Holy Spirit from the Son.\nIn Western Christianity, the Holy Spirit is viewed to proceed from the Father and the Son. This is in contrast to the Eastern churches, which argue that the Holy Spirit proceeds only from the Father. This issue has led to the filioque controversy and was a large question in the East-West schism. However, despite being affirmed within the Nicene creed, the doctrine of the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit (alongside the eternal generation of the Son) is today denied by some social trinitarians, such as William Lane Craig.\nScripture\nThe doctrine of the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit is a corollarry doctrine which flows from the eternal generation of the Son (which is based on texts such as Proverbs 8:25, Psalm 2:7, Hebrews 1:3-5, and John 1:18). However, other texts such as John 15:26 have been argued to explicitly refer to the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit, as it states that the Holy Spirit \"proceeds\" from the Father. Thus, unbegottenness is viewed as the unique personal property of the Father, begottenness as the unique personal property of the Son and spiration as the unique personal property of the Holy Spirit. However, the Western Church also contended that passages like Galatians 4:6 and Romans 8:9, which describe the Holy Spirit as the \"Spirit of his Son\" or the \"Spirit of Christ,\" imply that the Holy Spirit also proceeds from the Son. In contrast, Eastern Orthodox theologians will dispute that these texts should be understood as referring to the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit.\nEternal procession (alongside generation) has however been critiqued by some modern theologians as being based upon weak texts, instead arguing that John 15:26 should be understood as the coming of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost and not an eternal procession. Although those who hold to the Nicene view of procession often argue that because John 15:26 uses the present tense instead of the future tense, it is unlikely a reference to Pentecost.\n",

    "RNLI lifeboat station in County Down, Northern Ireland\nPortaferry Lifeboat Station is located directly opposite the slipway for the Portaferry\u2013Strangford ferry on The Strand, in Portaferry, a town located at the southern end of the Ards Peninsula, at the entrance to Strangford Lough, in County Down, Northern Ireland.\nA lifeboat was first stationed at Portaferry in 1980 by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).\nThe station currently operates the B-class (Atlantic 85) Inshore lifeboat, Blue Peter V (B-833), on station since 2009.\nHistory\nIn the 1970s, concerns were raised about the lack of lifeboat coverage for Strangford Lough. Strangford Lough is the largest sea inlet in the British Isles, and covers an area of 150\u00a0km2 (58\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Lifeboats based at Newcastle and Cloughey, capable of approximately 10 knots (12\u00a0mph), could take several hours to reach an incident. In 1978, the Cloughey-Portavogie lifeboat Glencoe Glasgow (ON 857) was withdrawn from service, due to development works at Portavogie Harbour, causing even greater concern.\nAfter strenuous lobbying by Portaferry Sailing Club, and other local boatmen, an inquiry was led by Capt. A. G. Course, Inspector of Lifeboats for Ireland. A single-engined D-class lifeboat was trialled at Portaferry in 1979. On 1 May 1980, a larger twin-engined lifeboat (D-508) was placed on extended trials, establishing the station at Portaferry.\nAt 18:40 on 19 December 1982, in gale-force conditions, Portaferry lifeboat was launched into Strangford Lough, to the aid of the yacht Frieda, stranded with her keel wedged between to rocks, on the west side of Jane's Rock. One man was recovered to the lifeboat, but one was missing, and a search continued, unsuccessfully, until the lifeboat was stood down at 22:00. Fortunately, the man was found the next day on Dunsy Island. For this service, Helm John Desmond Rogers was awarded the RNLI Bronze Medal. Crew members William Ellison and Francis Rogers were accorded 'The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum'.\nIn 1984, the larger twin-engine D-class lifeboats were re-classified as the C-class (Zodiac Grand Raid IV), with D-506 becoming C-506.\n1987 lifeboathouse, Portaferry\nThe 1984 appeal by the BBC TV children's programme Blue Peter far exceeded its expectations. In addition to replacing four earlier lifeboats, the appeal was able to provide two extra lifeboats, one placed in the relief fleet, and an B-class (Atlantic 21) for Portaferry, which arrived on station in 1986.\nA ceremony was held on 9 May 1987, to name the Atlantic 21, Blue Peter V (B-569), and also to formally open the new lifeboat house at Portaferry. The boathouse was funded through the generosity of the local community, and from donations to the Mountbatten Ulster Appeal.\nOn 13 June 1994, the Atlantic 21 Blue Peter V was withdrawn, and a new Atlantic 75-class was placed on service. Once again funded by an appeal by the TV programme Blue Peter, the name Blue Peter V was retained for the new boat (B-706). The 'Pieces of Eight' appeal raised over \u00a31.4m, enough to provide seven new Inshore lifeboats, and an All-weather Trent-class lifeboat to be placed at Fishguard. At a ceremony on 17 September 1994, the lifeboat was handed over to the care of the Portaferry Lifeboat Station by Blue Peter presenter Tim Vincent.\nBlue Peter V was out on a training exercise on 10 January 2006, when they received a call to the fishing vessel Greenhill, which had sunk suddenly. In the cold dark night, and extremely poor conditions, one man, of the three crew, was rescued. Searches for the remaining two men continued the following day, but just one body was found. Helm Simon Rogers was accorded the 'The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum', and thanks were formally given to the station. The lifeboat crew, including Sinead Breen, on her first shout, Philip Sands-Robinson and Andrew Edwards, received 'The Walter and Elizabeth Groombridge Award 2006, for the outstanding inshore lifeboat rescue of the year.\nA double celebration was held on Saturday 5 June 2010 at Portaferry. A new Atlantic 85-class Inshore lifeboat, costing \u00a3165,000, was again funded from the BBC's Blue Peter programme appeal. On station since 2009, the lifeboat was named Blue Peter V (ON 833), by Blue Peter presenter Andy Akinwolere. Also part of the event, was the formal handover of the new lifeboat house. Modelled in the shape of an upturned boat, and clad in stone with a copper roof, it was designed to fit in with surrounding buildings, and is estimated to have cost \u00a3750,000. The station was funded through a local appeal, and from the legacy of Ms Elsie Sturgeon, a native of Liverpool, who retired to nearby Killowen. Ten limited edition commemorative plates were specially designed for the occasion and presented to Blue Peter and the family of Elsie Sturgeon. Made by local ceramicist Donald Nelson, the remaining plates were auctioned in aid of the RNLI.\nPortaferry RNLI has had a Blue Peter lifeboat at the ",

    "The Guarani Language and Culture Athenaeum (Guarani: Guarani \u00d1e\u2019\u1ebdte ha Arandu Anamandaje; Spanish: Ateneo de Lengua y Cultura Guarani) is an autonomous Paraguayan philanthropic institution founded by David Galeano Olivera on September 23, 1985, whose main objective is the recovery, valuation, and dissemination of the Guarani language, folklore, and culture. Headquartered in Fernando de la Mora, it brings together students, professors, graduates, teachers, doctors, personalities, and institutions such as cultural centers, institutions, and universities.\nActivities\nSince its beginnings, the institution has sought to create citizen awareness in favor of the Guarani people through research and learning methodology. This methodology seeks to create scientific educational processes to achieve the understanding, updating, and improvement of the Guarani language, and the systematization of its cultural heritage through the contributions of its members and collaborators.\nAs an institution, it achieved the inclusion of the bachelor's degree in Guarani Language in higher institutes and collaborated in the creation of the teaching methodology for basic and middle level institutions in Paraguay. This bore fruit until achieving a bilingual teaching of the areas of study in schools, a vital aspect mainly for schools and colleges outside the areas of Asunci\u00f3n and border capitals where Guarani is the predominant language. Likewise, it was decentralized for the promotion and systematized diffusion of the language, achieving the creation of branch centers in all the departmental capitals and important cities of Paraguay. As well as in many cities of Argentina and Brazil (due to the cultural influence), the United States, Spain and Italy, places with Guarani cultural influence due to the emigration of Paraguayans.\nThe Ministry of Education and Science of Paraguay, with Resolutions 369/1995 and 37/1999, recognized the work of the institution, taking advantage of its publications and those of its members for national education. Likewise, the Chamber of Senators recognized the \u201cInstituto de Formaci\u00f3n Docente del Ateneo de Lengua y Cultura Guaran\u00ed\u201d as a formal institution of higher level with the decree law 2574/2005. Likewise, different institutions have declared its work to be of national interest. Thanks to the work of the members, the National Secretariat of Linguistic Policies of Paraguay issued Resolution 80/2012 creating the Academy of the Guarani Language.\n",

The season began on 24 April and concluded earlier than scheduled on 7 August, comprising a 14-match home-and-away season, followed by a two-week finals series.\nCollingwood District won the MAFA premiership for the first time, defeating Leopold by 15 points in the 1915 MAFA Grand Final.\nThis was the final MAFA season until 1920, with the 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1919 seasons cancelled due to the impacts of World War I.\nAssociation membership\nLike the previous season in 1914, a total of ten teams competed in the MAFA.\nOn 16 October 1914, three weeks after the end of the 1914 season, the University Football Club dropped out of the Victorian Football League (VFL). The club had competed in the MJFA/MAFA with a senior team in 1906 and 1907, and had been fielding a \"2nd\" (reserves) team in the competition since 1908. After leaving the VFL, University's senior team returned to the MAFA in 1915, with several of its VFL players staying with the club.\nAdditionally, the Caulfield Football Club combined with Malvern prior to the start of the 1915 season and became known as \"Caulfield-Malvern\".\nWorld War I\nThe 1915 home-and-away season was originally scheduled to end on 26 August.

Prior to the final games held in round 14, some clubs had already struggled to find players as a result of enlistments.\nFollowing the conclusion of the season, officials from the VFL sought to have the MAFA become a reserves competition to the VFL for the 1916 season. At least two clubs \u2013 Beverley and South Yarra \u2013 reported the MAFA that they had been \"approached\" about becoming reserves teams to Richmond and St Kilda respectively. The MAFA announced in late 1915 that they would not resume competition until the war had ended, while also stating that they were not prepared to be absorbed by the VFL. Ultimately, no MAFA seasons would be held until 1920.\nAs of 30 July 1915, 164 MJFA players had been enlisted in the Australian Army:\nBeverley \u2013 11\nCarlton District \u2013 26\nCaulfield \u2013 8\nCollegians \u2013 15\nCollingwood District \u2013 13\nElsternwick \u2013 32\nFitzroy Juniors \u2013 13\nLeopold \u2013 12\nSouth Yarra \u2013 27\nUniversity \u2013 7\nHome-and-away season\nRound 1\nRound 2\nRound 3\nRound 4\nRound 5\nLadder\nSource:   (P) Premiers\nFinals\nAt the time, the MAFA used the Argus finals system, which gave the club that finished first on the ladder at the end of the home-and-away season (the minor premiers) the right to challenge the winner of the finals series for the premiership.\nSemi-finals\nGrand Final\n",

    "\nChristine Elizabeth Adamson Essenberg (1876-1965) was a Swedish-American marine zoologist, teacher, and advocate for women\u2019s education. She became one of the first women to earn a PhD in Zoology from the University of California, Berkeley, and is known for her expertise in polychaetes and plankton studies. Essenberg conducted research at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and made significant contributions to marine biology by discovering and describing several new species of polychaetes within the Polynoidae and Amphinomidae families, thereby expanding the taxonomy and understanding of marine invertebrates along the Pacific Coast.\nIn addition to her scientific achievements, Essenberg was a dedicated advocate for women's education. In 1925, she established the American School for Girls in Damascus, Syria, the region\u2019s first nonsectarian American girls\u2019 school. The school offered a wide range of educational programs and became a center for women\u2019s empowerment, health, and literacy. Despite facing the challenges of the Great Syrian Revolt and World War II, she remained committed to improving educational opportunities for women in the region.\nEarly life and education\nChristine Elizabeth Adamson was born on April 6, 1876 to Swedish parents on a farm in Livonia, then part of the Baltic provinces of the Russian Empire. As a young child, she was adopted by a German noble family and educated by private tutors. Her adopted family discouraged her interest in studying science, adhering to the belief that such subjects were not suitable for girls.\nShe lived with her adopted family for 20 years on a semi-feudal estate. In 1904, as unrest leading up to the 1905 Russian Revolution spread through the provinces, the estate was burned down. Adamson escaped and stayed with nearby friends for a time. Eventually, she moved to St. Petersburg, where she worked as a language teacher. Up until this point, Adamson had given little thought to the possibility or meaning of revolution, as her background and sheltered upbringing left her disconnected from both the aristocracy and local population.\nThe upheaval of the First Russian Revolution had a lasting impact on her, shaping her commitment to promoting knowledge and fostering understanding. During this period, as the revolutionary movement continued to grow, Adamson learned that one of her brothers had been executed, and another had fled to America. In 1908, she followed him to the United States, where she began a new chapter of her life.\nIn America, Adamson found opportunities to pursue the scientific studies that her adoptive family had previously denied to her. She attended Valparaiso University in Indiana, where she studied pedagogy along with various sciences, including zoology and botany. While at Valparaiso, she married fellow student Jacob Essenberg in 1910, but the relationship ended after a few months. After graduating in 1913, she taught at a rural school for a year before continuing her education.\nEssenberg pursued graduate studies in Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned her master's degree in 1914 and her doctorate in 1917 at the age of 41. She became the sixth woman at the University of California Berkeley to obtain a PhD in Zoology. Eventually, she became a naturalized citizen.\nResearch and scientific career\nEssenberg worked as a research biologist at the Zoological Laboratory of the University of California and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Her research centered on marine zoology, with a special focus on polychaete worms and plankton. During her graduate studies, she made substantial contributions to the field, notably discovering several new species of marine polychaetes. She discovered and described several new species of polychaetes within the Polynoidae and Amphinomidae families. Essenberg's research proved instrumental in expanding the taxonomy and knowledge of marine invertebrates along the Pacific Coast. Despite her significant contributions, she faced challenges funding and publishing her work compared to her male peers. To support herself, she worked part-time at the Scripps Library. Essenberg eventually earned a faculty position at the University of California and became a member of the California Academy of Sciences.\nIn 1922-1923, Essenberg undertook a year-long research trip to visit marine laboratories around the globe to advance her plankton studies. She visited marine laboratories such as Woods Hole, Plymouth Marine Laboratory, and the Fort Erin Marine Laboratory on the Isle of Man and met with German scientists in Naples. Upon her return, she began studying appendicularians and co-authored several papers on other marine topics.\nLater career and educational reform\nAt the height of her career as a scientific researcher, she took a sabbatical to teach biology at the Constantinople Women's College in Turkey.\u00a0 During a conversation with a Syrian student, Essenberg became aware of the lack of opportunities for ",

He was capped by the Republic of Ireland at youth level.\nClub career\nDundalk\nAfter beginning his career in the River Valley Rangers and Malahide United youth systems, Adedokun moved into the Dundalk academy in 2017 and progressed to sign his first professional contract in January 2020. He won his maiden first team call up for a League of Ireland Premier Division match versus Shamrock Rovers on 27 September 2020 and made his debut as a substitute for Will Patching late in the 4\u20130 defeat. Adedokun signed a new two-year contract in January 2021. During the 2021 season, Adedokun was a regular inclusion in matchday squads as a substitute and made seven appearances (four of them starts), before departing Oriel Park in August 2021. During his time with Dundalk, Adedokun was converted from a winger to a left back.\nBrentford\n2021\u20132023\nOn 24 August 2021, Adedokun transferred to the B team at Premier League club Brentford and signed three-year contract, with the option of a further year, for an undisclosed fee. During the 2021\u201322 season, he gained experience as a left wing back, participated in first team training sessions and was a member of the B team's London Senior Cup-winning squad.\nAfter missing much of the 2022\u201323 pre-season due to COVID-19 and a dislocated shoulder, Adedokun's 37 appearances during the regular season was the most of any B team player. He appeared in every minute of the B team's victorious 2022\u201323 Premier League Cup-winning campaign and made a first team mid-season friendly appearance.\n2023\u201324\nAdedokun's first team involvement continued during the 2023\u201324 pre-season, with one substitute appearance.

    "Skyscraper in Winterthur, Switzerland\nThe Red Tower (German: Roter Turm) also known as the Swisscom Tower is a high-rise office building in Winterthur, Switzerland. Built between 1998 and 1999, the tower stands at 90\u00a0m (300\u00a0ft) tall with 25 floors and is the current 16th tallest building in Switzerland.\nHistory\nConcept\nThe Wincasa company intends to continue rejuvenating the location known as \"Turm Areal Winterthur\". The renovation of the space is a collaborative effort between Wincasa and Swiss Prime Site Immobilien AG, who owns the building. The first step was to standardize the signage to make the area's identity more prominent.\nTo enhance the visibility of the area's identity, a new uniform signage visitor guidance system will be implemented starting in November 2019. This will be completely set up by the spring of 2020. The SV Group manages the food service at ZHAW and it is available to other tenants and the public. Another advancement in enhancing the region is the introduction of greenery in the central courtyard. The entire construction project will be finished by spring 2021. Since the completion of the Red Tower in late 1999, the requirements of the residents and the community have evolved.\nArchitecture\nThe tower was designed by Baden based Burkard Meyer Architekten studio and is located in Winterthur. It is part of a multi-building complex consisting of lower-rising volumes forming small quartals put together. These shorter buildings share the same funcionality of office spaces with the Red Tower. A restaurant operated the top levels of the building until late 2015 when it was closed down.\nThe building's materiality ballance alternate in the favour of the facade decorative brickstone, keeping the curtain wall glazing made of insulated glass panels at a more reduced proportion. All of the tower's facades have been renovated as the works consisted of the external glazing being statically reinforced with a total of 210 fixed pieces, 3400 movable vertical slats and 1650 movable horizontal slats.\nThe tower houses office spaces which can vary in terms of gross usable areas between 200 and 500\u00a0m2 (5,380\u00a0sq\u00a0ft).\nSee also\nList of tallest buildings in Switzerland",

    "British naturalist (1899\u20131972)\nFrederick Archibald Sowter (30 August 1899 \u2013 16 November 1972) was a British botanist, bryologist, and lichenologist. He made contributions to the study of cryptogams, particularly in Leicestershire and Rutland.\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Leicester, Sowter attended Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys from 1909 to 1914. After leaving school, he worked for two years at a textile firm in Leicester, preparing for a business career. During World War I, he joined a Cadet Battalion, spending time at Bulwell Hall, Nottingham, and Keble College, Oxford, before serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in France during the latter part of the war. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in November 1918 and served for an additional year in Germany after the war.\nCareer\nFollowing his military service, Sowter studied textile chemistry at the University of Nottingham. He then joined Courtaulds, where he spent most of his professional life, retiring as assistant sales manager of their Leicester office in 1958. Despite his career in textiles, Sowter's passion for natural history, nurtured from an early age by Arthur Reginald Horwood, sub-curator at Leicester City Museum, shaped his contributions to botany.\nBotanical contributions\nEarly work and \"Horwood's Boys\"\nSowter was part of a group known as \"Horwood's Boys\", young men who accompanied Horwood on field excursions in Leicestershire. This early experience contributed to his later work in compiling data for Horwood and Gainsborough's Flora of Leicestershire and Rutland (1933), for which he collected and listed flowering plants throughout these counties. In September 1933, during the British Association's visit to Leicester, Sowter led a botanical excursion, demonstrating his growing expertise in the field.\nBryology\nSowter's interest in bryophytes intensified in the 1930s, culminating in his 1941 publication on the bryophytes of Leicestershire and Rutland. He served as editor of the Transactions of the British Bryological Society from 1947 to 1955 and was elected president of the society in 1958.\nLichenology\nIn the 1940s, Sowter turned his attention to lichens, at a time when British lichenology was at its lowest ebb. His comprehensive account of Leicestershire and Rutland lichens, published in 1950, was the first detailed work on county lichens since Walter Watson's 1930 treatment of Somerset. In 1953, Sowter organised a lichen study group that exchanged named specimens, with the goal of promoting the study of lichens in Britain; it soon included members who would later become prominent in British lichenology, including Jack Laundon and Peter Wilfred James.\nSowter's contributions to lichenology extended beyond his local area. He traveled widely across Britain in the 1940s and early 1950s, building up his collections and knowledge of British lichens. In 1945, he prepared an account of some of his Cumberland and Westmorland collections. He also contributed data to various publications, including the Census Catalogue of British Lichens (1953), the Collins New Naturalist volume on The Peak District (1962), and Rimington's section on lichens in The Natural History of the Scarborough District (1953).\nFlowering plants and slime moulds\nSowter's botanical interests were diverse. His work on Arum maculatum in the Journal of Ecology in 1949 was one of the first accounts in the Biological Flora series. His interest in slime moulds was encouraged by the mycologist Cecil Terence Ingold, who proposed he document the local Myxomycetes. In 1958, he published an account of the Myxomycetes of Leicestershire and Rutland. Sowter's 1960 paper \"Our diminishing flora\" drew attention to the disappearance of interesting and rare species in the region.\nLater life and legacy\nDespite suffering from a bronchial condition in his later years, Sowter continued his botanical work until shortly before his death. His herbarium, containing approximately 3,500 lichen and 1,500 bryophyte specimens, along with his notebooks and other documents, was bequeathed to Leicester City Museum. His extensive cryptogamic library was divided between the British Bryological Society and the British Lichen Society.\nIn his younger days, Sowter played tennis for Leicestershire and was also interested in philately, serving as President of the Leicester Philatelic Society in 1937. He served on the Council of the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society from 1933 until his death and was on the Museums, Libraries and Publicity Committee of Leicester City Council from July 1952.\nSowter's enthusiasm and willingness to assist others made him a key figure in British lichenology during the first half of the 20th century. His work provided valuable records during a period when little lichen recording was carried out in Britain.\nPersonal life\nSowter was married twice. His first wife was named Muriel, and his second wife was Marion G. Sowter (n\u00e9e Lewis).\nHonours and affiliations\nFellow of ",
    "War of 1812 battle\nThe Battle of Kingston Harbour, was a naval battle of the War of 1812 fought on November 10th, 1812 between American and British naval forces in Kingston harbour, as well as Canadian militia from Kingston.\nIt was the only time the British stronghold at Kingston was attacked during the war, and the only time that shots were ever fired from Fort Henry.\nBackground\nThroughout the summer and autumn of 1812, American and British forces on Lake Ontario conducted small scale raids and attacks, focussing on the main American stronghold at Sackets Harbor. The Americans had planned to attack their British counterpart at Kingston.\nOn November 9, the USS Oneida, under command of Commodore Isaac Chauncey, with a squadron of six ships, sailed from Sackets Harbor to intercept British ships conveying supplies to the army stores at Kingston. The sloop HMS\u00a0Royal George, under Commodore Hugh Earle, was sighted and chased into the Bay of Quinte.\nAn American sailor, Ned Myers, later recounted: \n\u201cwe made such a show of schooners, that though  had herself a vessel or two in company, she did not choose to wait for us.\u201d\nChauncey followed Earle into the bay but lost sight on her as darkness fell. Earle knew the waters well and slipped past Chauncey\u2019s squadron and headed for the safety of Kingston harbour, arriving around 2am. The Americans anchored in the Bay of Quinte until early on the morning of November 10.\nAs soon as he arrived in Kingston, Earle met with Col. John Vincent, the army commander at Kingston, and told him of Chauncey\u2019s squadron and their possible attack on Kingston. The British garrison was put on alert and the militias from the surrounding area were called to muster and gathered in the town. One witness recalled:\nIn a moment every person was under arms, detachments were sent to the different bridges over Cataraqui creek, each attended by a field piece, and every other necessary precaution taken with the greatest alertness.\u201d\nCompanies from the 1st Frontenac Militia, 1st Lennox Militia, and 1st Addington Militia mustered and marched to the town, some arriving without arms and requiring weapons and ammunition from the town stores.\nThe Kingston Garrison of regular soldiers consisted of 200 men from the 49th Regiment of Foot, 100  men from the 10th Royal Veterans, and 100 men from the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles, who were detached to serve as marines aboard the Royal George and other ships.\nBattle\nAt sunrise on November 10, Chauncey\u2019s squadron weighed anchor and sailed along the Canadian shore in search of the Royal George. Passing by Ernestown, now Bath, Chauncey spotted a merchant schooner and sent a boat to seize it. The Americans threaten to attack the town of the residents did not hand over the ship, and the schooner was soon captured and taken with the squadron. Slowed by the captured schooner, Chauncey ordered her burned, and Lt. Joseph Macpherson  set fire to the vessel between Ernestown and Collins Bay.\nAround 1pm, as the Americans reached Collins Bay, they spotted the Royal George anchored in Kingston harbour, protected by the militia shore batteries in Kingston. \nWhile the militia and army in Kingston believed the Americans to be an invasion force, Chauncey\u2019s main goal was the destruction of the Royal George, and Myers recalled:\nwe ran down into the bay, and engaged the ship and batteries, as close as we could well get.\u201d\nIneffective fire from a British gunboat in Collin\u2019s Bay greeted the American squadron as they neared Kingston, which was returned without effect by the Americans. A brass 6-pdr artillery piece, manned on Everett Point by Addington Militia, five miles west of Kingston, was next to try and inflict some damage on the lead schooner USS Conquest, under the command of Lieutenant Jesse Elliot.\nAs Chauncey\u2019s fleet passed Everett Point and bore down on the Royal George\u2019s position in the harbour, Commodore Earle weighed anchor and pulled back in line with the shore batteries, closer to the Cataraqui river. Batteries in town, manned by the Frontenac Militia, began firing on the American ships, with one witness stationed at Mississauga Point battery recalling: \n\u201cThey all came onwards, as far as  when to their great mortification, they experienced so heavy a cannonading from a battery of 2 nine pounders \u2026 as threw them into the greatest confusion.\u201d \nThe batteries were manned with 9-pdr cannons, and being of small calibre did little to inflict damage on the ships, but deterred the Americans from sailing close to the town or landing an invasion party.\nAbout 3pm, the militia shore batteries at Mississauga Point and Fort Frederick began opening up on the American squadron. Earle believed the Royal George was safe under the protection of the batteries, but Chauncey continued the attack into the harbour. The American vessels sailed past the town and Kingston peninsula, firing at the Royal George and the batteries. The four lead vessels crossed the harbour and turned back for another run at t",

    "Polish footballer (born 2007)\nAdrian Przyborek (born 1 January 2007) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Ekstraklasa club Pogo\u0144 Szczecin.\nClub career\nEarly career\nBorn in Koszalin, Przyborek's first introduction to football came as a child, when his grandfather took him to a local football tournament. After telling her that he would \"be a great footballer one day\", Przyborek's mother Iwona took him to join the Sian\u00f3w Sports Academy at the age of five. His first coach at Sian\u00f3w, Piotr Starzecki, advised the academy that he should train with older players, and despite the physical difference, he began to play with teammates three years older than him.\nAt an indoor football tournament in Rewal, Przyborek played in a match against Ba\u0142tyk Koszalin, and following the tournament, a coach from the club invited him to join the club. While at Ba\u0142tyk, he was invited to represent both Lech Pozna\u0144 and Pogo\u0144 Szczecin in youth tournaments, and was eventually offered a place in the academy of the latter. Starzecki later revealed that Przyborek's first choice had been Lech Pozna\u0144, and that Legia Warsaw had also shown interest.\nPogo\u0144 Szczecin\nHaving joined Pogo\u0144 in 2021, he signed his first professional contract for the club in January of the following year. After featuring for the first team in two friendlies in Autumn 2022, he extended his contract in January 2023.\nThe following month he became the second-youngest Pogo\u0144 Szczecin player, behind Kacper Koz\u0142owski, when he made his debut aged sixteen against Warta Pozna\u0144. Having come on as a second-half substitute for former Poland international Kamil Grosicki, Przyborek was distinguishable on the pitch as his shirt did not have any advertisement, as Pogo\u0144 were sponsored by a bookmaker and it is illegal for underage people in Poland to be promoting gambling.\nThe following season, having established himself in the club's first team, he signed another extension to his contract in March 2024, tying him to the club until July 2027. He scored his first goal for the club the following month in a 5\u20130 win against Ruch Chorz\u00f3w, flicking on a corner from Kamil Grosicki into the corner of the goal.\nIn September 2024 he was recognised by the CIES Football Observatory as one of the most promising young football talents, due to his experience in senior football. A month later, he was named by English newspaper The Guardian as one of the best players born in 2007 worldwide.\nInternational career\nIn March 2021, while still with Ba\u0142tyk Koszalin, he received his first call up to a Poland national youth training camp.\nCareer statistics\nAs of match played 6 October 2024.\nNotes\n",

It is best known for the \"Ghost Fleet,\" 118 historic shipwrecks in Mallows Bay in the sanctuary's northeast corner which is the largest shipwreck fleet in the Western Hemisphere. They are among more than 200 shipwrecks in the sanctuary, some of which date as far back as the American Revolutionary War and others to the American Civil War.\nIn addition to shipwrecks, the sanctuary preserves historical sites related to Native Americans, some of them as much as 12,000 years old, as well as a lengthy span of United States history, including the American Revolutionary War, the American Civil War, steamboat and steamship actvity during the Industrial Era, and what was once an important Potomac River fishing industry. It also protects sites dating as far back as the 17th century related to African-American history, as well as an ecologically and biologically important area of the Potomac River and its Maryland shoreline that supports many species of plants and animals.\nDesignated on September 3, 2019, the Mallows Bay\u2013Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary was the 14th national marine sanctuary, the first in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and the first one designated since the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in 2000.\nDescription\nThe Mallows Bay\u2013Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary is located in an 18-square-mile (47\u00a0km2) portion of the Potomac River in Charles County, Maryland. It lies off the Nanjemoy Peninsula, about 40 miles (64\u00a0km) south of Washington, D.C.\nThe sanctuary stretches from the Charles Country shoreline on the eastern side of the river to the border between Maryland and Virginia on the western side. The sanctuary's eastern boundary starts at a point just north of Sandy Point in Charles County and follows the Maryland shoreline of the Potomac River south around Mallows Bay, Blue Banks, and Wades Bay, cutting across the mouths of creeks and streams until it reaches a point just south of Smith Point. From there, the sanctuary's southern boundary crosses the Potomac River to the west in a straight line until it reaches a point just north of the mouth of Aquia Creek in Stafford County, Virginia, near Brent Point. The western boundary of the sanctuary approximates the border between the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of Maryland along the western side of the Potomac River, continuing to the north and cutting across the mouths of streams and creeks until it reaches a point north of Tank Creek. The sanctuary's northern boundary then runs east across the Potomac River in a straight line until it intersects with the Maryland shoreline just north of Sandy Point. The Maryland-Virginia border, which also serves as both the boundary between Charles County and Virginia's Stafford County and the western boundary of the sanctuary, is demarcated by the mean low tide mark on the Virginia shoreline, placing nearly the entire river in Maryland and the entire sanctuary in Maryland waters in Charles County.\nPublic access to the sanctuary is primarily through Mallows Bay Park, a Charles County park adjacent to the sanctuary which offers direct access to the river, including Mallows Bay. Access is also possible from the Maryland shoreline via Smallwood State Park. Because the sanctuary's western boundary runs along the Virginia shoreline, visitors to Widewater State Park in Stafford County, Virginia, have easy access to the western edge of the sanctuary's Potomac River waters.\nMallows Bay was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 24, 2015, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation lists the area as a \"National Treasure.\" The sanctuary is a part of the Southern Maryland National Heritage Area, and it lies along the Chesapeake Trail.\nHistorical resources\nShipwrecks\nA kayaker among shipwrecks in Mallows Bay.\nShipwrecks and a kayak in the sanctuary.\nThe Mallows Bay\u2013Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary includes more than 200 historic shipwrecks, some of them dating as far back as the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131773) and others to the American Civil War (1861\u20131865). However, it is best known for a group of 118 partially submerged shipwrecks nicknamed the \"Ghost Fleet\" located in Mallows Bay in the sanctuary's northeastern corner. These wooden-hulled steamships were among nearly 300 built at more than 40 shipyards in 17 U.S. states by the United States Shipping Board's Emergency Fleet Corporation between 1917 and 1919, intended for use in World War I.

The winners of this event will represent Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics, should Canada qualify.

This rule change also was part of the rationale to change the timing of these trials to be held 14 months in advance of the Olympics, so there would be little disruption to the training and preparation of four-person teams for the 2025 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, held in November 2025.\nQualification process\nTeams qualified for these Olympics Trials through either their performance at the most recent national championships, their Canadian Mixed Doubles Ranking (CMDR), or through a Direct-Entry Qualifier event.

    "2001 video game\n2001 video game\nCroc 2 is a 2001 platformer video game developed by Natsume Co., Ltd. and published by THQ for the Game Boy Color (GBC). It is part of the Croc series and the second game in the series for the GBC after Croc (2000). It is an adaptation of Croc 2 (1999) for the PlayStation and Windows. The game utilizes 2D sprite graphics, in contrast to the 3D polygon graphics featured in the 1999 game.\nGameplay\nThe game is presented from an overhead perspective, instead of the side-view of the previous GBC game.\nCroc 2 is a platformer with a faux-3D top-down perspective similar to The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. The game begins with Croc receiving a message in a bottle from his mother, prompting him to embark on a quest to locate her. During his journey, he learns that Baron Dante and his minions, the Dantinis, are wreaking havoc across the land and capturing the Gobbos. The objective of the game is for Croc to assist the Gobbos, thwart the baron, and reunite with his mother. The player must navigate through four distinct villages\u2014Sailor Village, Cossack Village, Caveman Village, and Inca Village\u2014each comprising three levels and a boss battle. Each level has a Golden Gobbo to collect that is needed to complete the game perfectly. Enemies are defeated using Croc's tail attack. Gems can be collected to purchase various items, such as Jump Jellies and Robo Gobbos, which enable access to previously unreachable areas. The game also features puzzles that, for example, involve pushing boulders or guiding droplets of water through a pipe system. Unlike the first game for the GBC, the sequel doesn't have any minigames.\nReception\nReception\nCroc 2 received reviews ranging from average to positive. Games Domain liked the audiovisual presentation and puzzle design. Overall, they called it a great game. AllGame criticized the visuals but called the gameplay solid and unique, and compared Croc 2 very favorably to the previous GBC game which was said to be \"average at best\". GamesMaster liked the graphics but the gameplay was said to be walking though mostly empty labyrinthine levels. GameSpot liked the puzzle design but felt they were reused too often. They also criticized the combat system for its poor collision detection. Overall, the game was noted as \"painfully bland\". IGN said that \"As a sequel, Croc 2 blows away the original effort \". Gamereactor liked the graphics but called sound and music annoying, the gameplay was said to be monotonous. The combat was noted as frustrating due to the short range of the tail swipe. Jeuxvideo.com mentioned that the controls are somewhat impractical and take some getting used to since, for example, running requires pressing the directional button twice. MeriStation praised the music as catchy and its suitability to the events unfolding on the screen, although it was noted that the songs exhibited a lack of variety. The Electric Playground said the puzzles are too complex for the target age group. Game Informer wrote: \"Croc 2's control is solid, but platforming from an isometric view is limiting, so the game boils down to a little exploration game with limited environments.\" Hardcore Gaming 101 said the game is too big because the scenery appears identical regardless of the location and there is no map. Music was noted as terrible and the combat was said to be hampered by inaccurate hit detection.\n",

    "Skyscraper in Mexico City, Mexico\nCuarzo Towers (Spanish: Torres Cuarzo) is a mixed-use skyscraper building complex in the Cuauht\u00e9moc district of Mexico City, Mexico. Built between 2014 and 2017, the complex consists of two towers, with the tallest one standing at 180\u00a0m (590\u00a0ft) tall with 40 floors, which is the current 15th tallest building in Mexico City and the 22nd tallest in Mexico.\nHistory\nArchitecture\nThe towers were designed by Richard Meier & Partners studio and is located in the Cuauht\u00e9moc district of Mexico City. The project shares its neighborhood with the township's Historic Center. The initial plans saw the construction of two towers, a 40-story and a 27-story tower from which the main onw was set to become the tallest building in the area, second only to the Torre Latinoamericana. The building is protected against earthquakes using more than 450 friction dissipators in line, which dissipate the energy at the time of an earthquake.\nThe design of the building is the work of the Richard Meier architectural firm in partnership with Di\u00e1metro Arquitectos and will have a total of 47 thousand square meters of type A plus office space, commercial premises, a hotel, restaurants and a gym. The building's foundations began to be laid in 2013 by the company CIMESA. According to the firm Di\u00e1metro Arquitectos, headed by David Cherem and Isaac Sasson, as well as the engineering firm WSP Group, they expect the construction of the towers to be completed in 2015.\nA strategically placed empty space in the center of the tower reorganizes the building's structure and layout, creating unique and efficient configurations that increase daylight exposure in all areas. The new opportunities provided by this internal logic are improved by extra volumetric cut-outs on the building's outer surface, increasing natural light and air flow in the offices inside and highlighting views of the historic city center.\nThe Office tower received its LEED Golden Certificate January 2022.\nBuildings\nSee also\nList of tallest buildings in Mexico\nList of tallest buildings in Mexico City",

In New Zealand they are known as ground w\u0113t\u0101 due to their burrowing lifestyle.   Ground w\u0113t\u0101 adults are smaller than other types of w\u0113t\u0101, and females of all Anderus species have long ovipositors.\nTaxonomy\nThe genus Anderus was named for the Swedish entomologist Kjell Ander in 2024. Six species previously in the genus Hemiandrus were shown to be sister the Australian winged species Transaevum laudatum,  based on analysis of DNA sequences. In the genus Anderus there are six described species and at least one undescribed species from Rakiura/Stewart Island.\nMorphology\nPilosity of palps distinguishes this genus\nThe genus Anderus includes the smallest w\u0113t\u0101 species, with adult individual body size no more than 7 millimetres, and weighing less than a gram. These w\u0113t\u0101 have no tympanum, and instead are able to detect sound through their cuticle, which is adaptive for their underground lifestyle. Species in the genus Anderus can be distinguished from other New Zealand ground w\u0113t\u0101 (Hemiandrus) using the covering of short fine setae over the whole of the surface of segment  4 of their maxillary palps.\nEcology\nGround w\u0113t\u0101 seal the entrance of their burrow during the day with a soil plug or door so that their burrow is concealed. The diet of only two species is know; A. maculifrons and A. nox are carnivorous\nSeveral ground w\u0113t\u0101 species have been recorded drumming, despite lacking the tympanum 'ears' present in other w\u0113t\u0101 genera. The sounds produced are inaudible to humans and is detected through the cuticle.\nThe species of Anderus are eaten by native bird species such as robins, saddlebacks kiwi, but also by introduced species such as mice, stoats, cats, and hedgehogs.  Most species are common and widespread in native forests, and are not thought to be endangered (as per the New Zealand Department of Conservation).\nDistribution\nThis genus are found throughout the North and South Island, and even on some of the offshore islands of New Zealand.  They are found in lowland forests.\nSpecies\nAnderus brucei (Taylor-Smith, Trewick & Morgan-Richards, 2016)\nAnderus fiordensis (Salmon, 1950)\nAnderus luna (Taylor-Smith, Trewick & Morgan-Richards, 2016)\nAnderus maculifrons (Walker, 1869)\nAnderus nox (Taylor-Smith, Trewick & Morgan-Richards, 2016)\nAnderus subantarcticus (Salmon, 1950)",

    "1993 song by The Katene Sisters\n\"Keeping Up the Love Thing\" is the debut single and sole release by New Zealand novelty group The Katene Sisters, consisting of singer Annie Crummer alongside actresses Nancy Brunning and Lisa Crittenden. Created as part of a 1993 storyline in the soap opera Shortland Street, a show in which Brunning and Crittenden played major roles, the song was later released commercially through WMG and reached the top 3 of the New Zealand singles chart in August 1993.\nBackground and development\nBrunning and Crittenden belonged to the sixteen original cast members of Shortland Street present from its 1992 inception. Respectively, they starred as nurses Jaki Manu and Carrie Burton. \"Keeping Up the Love Thing\" transpired from a story involving Manu's past involvement in a vocal trio called The Katene Sisters with two of her cousins, one of which (Marlene Katene) was played by Crummer. Plans for the trio to reunite for a talent show at a bar were put into jeopardy, however, when the other cousin fell ill at the last minute. Burton took her place for the group's performance of \"Keeping Up the Love Thing,\" a past hit of theirs, though they wound up ultimately not winning the contest.\nThe track was written by Crummer and Barbara Griffin, formerly of the Holidaymakers. Brunning initially felt hesitant about it receiving a commercial release but was convinced of its merit by Crittenden; \"Keeping Up the Love Thing\" went on to additionally receive a music video, portraying The Katene Sisters performing the song in a recording studio.\nTrack listing\nNew Zealand cassingle\n\"Keeping Up the Love Thing\" (radio edit)\n\"Keeping Up the Love Thing\" (Wireless remix)\n\"Keeping Up the Love Thing\" (karaoke mix)\nCharts\n",

    "Cadastral territory of Brno in South Moravian Region, Czech Republic\nTrnit\u00e1 is a cadastral territory in Brno, Czech Republic, southeast from the city center. It has an area of 1.90 km\u00b2. The current district consisted of the territory of several villages, which were annexed to Brno in 1850, and is now has a highly urban character. Since November 24, 1990, most of Trnit\u00e1 has been part of the city district of Brno-st\u0159ed, a smaller part falls into the district of Brno-jih. About 4,400 inhabitants live here.\nEtymology\nThe name Trnit\u00e1 is derived from the name of the former village, formed by the street of the same name.\nHistory\nOn July 6, 1850, the entire original Trnit\u00e1 cadastral territory, Nov\u00e9 Sady and the cadastral territory north of the original Trnit\u00e1 cadastral territory were annexed to Brno. In the years 1854\u20131856, Rosick\u00e9 n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed ('Rosice railway station') was built at the southern end of Trnit\u00e1 Street, from which a link to the main station was built in 1868\u20131870, along a high embankment (only a small part of it has been preserved due to the recent construction of the Va\u0148kovka shopping center) . In 1864, the initially small Va\u0148kovka factory was established between this junction and Trnit\u00e1 Street. In the years 1883\u20131886, the Vl\u00e1rsk\u00e1 line was built. The construction of the aforementioned railway corridors marked the end of the development of Trnit\u00e1 Street, as it became a dead end street. In 1889, the Trnit\u00e1 cadastral territory was slightly expanded at the expense of Kom\u00e1rov, whose territory it divided into two territorially unrelated parts until 1940. In 1898, the cadastral territory of Trnit\u00e1 was expanded at the expense of \u010cernovice to the east as far as the left bank of the river Svitava, where part of the border of newly expanded Trnit\u00e1 and at the same time Brno was formed by the later streets of Eli\u0161ka Kr\u00e1snohorsk\u00e1. In the late 19th century, a municipal slaughterhouse area was built primarily on the annexed territory, and in the years 1912\u20131913 a substation was built on the left bank of the annexed territory, which today houses the Archives of the city of Brno. In 1900, for a change, the Trnit\u00e1 cadastral territory was slightly reduced in favor of Kom\u00e1rov north of Jeneweinova street, when the border here was moved to the bed of the Svitavsk\u00fd n\u00e1hon (Svitava mill race). In 1905, the border between Trnit\u00e1 and Kom\u00e1rov in today's Konopn\u00e1 street was further modified, when the border that had previously passed through the plot of the current house Konopn\u00e1 12 was moved to the eastern border of this plot, so that it continued to run between the houses Konopn\u00e1 12 and Konopn\u00e1 10. North of the house Konopn\u00e1 12, during this change of the border, it was further straightened. In 1906, Trnit\u00e1 and Brno were further expanded south of the original area of the city slaughterhouse.\nWhen Greater Brno was created on April 16, 1919, parts of the modern Trnit\u00e1 cadastral territory were also annexed to Brno. \nThe western part currently forms the main development zone of Brno, in which a new modern development is to be built in connection with the planned relocation of the Brno main railway station. Its form was determined in more detail by the development company Crestyl at the end of 2019. According to it, it should be completed in 2024.\nNeighboring cadastral territories\nTrnit\u00e1 borders Star\u00e9 Brno in the west, Brno-m\u011bsto in the northwest, Z\u00e1brdovice in the north, \u017didenice and \u010cernovice in the east, Kom\u00e1rov in the south, and \u0160ty\u0159ice in the southwest.\nDescription\nTrnit\u00e1's entire residential development fell into disrepair during socialism and was demolished during the 1990s and after 2000, has a distinctly urban character, marked by the development of industry in the past, and above all in the times of communism by the insensitive construction of roads, and by neglecting the maintenance and repair of houses. The residential development of the district is currently mainly concentrated around K\u0159enov\u00e1 and Ml\u00fdnsk\u00e1 streets. The Pon\u00e1vka river flows through the district from north to south.

    "Sanskrit poet\nRatn\u0101kara (fl.\u20099th-century) was a Sanskrit poet in ancient India. His magnum opus, the Haravijaya, containing 4,351 verses, is the longest extant mah\u0101k\u0101vya. His work has been praised in many Sanskrit anthologies and works on rhetorics.\nLife\nVery little is known about Ratn\u0101kara's life. He's referred to as a dependent of B\u0101lab\u1e5bhaspati\u2014generally assumed to be an epithet of Cippa\u1e6dajay\u0101p\u012b\u1e0da\u2014in the colophons of the Haravijaya's cantos. In the pra\u015basti of the Haravijaya he speaks of himself as the son of Am\u1e5btabh\u0101nu, a descendant of Durgadatta from Gang\u0101hrada in the Himalayas. Kalha\u1e47a's R\u0101jatara\u1e45gi\u1e47\u012b lists him as one of the poets active at the court of Avantivarman (r.\u2009855\u2013883\u00a0CE).\nWorks\nHaravijaya\nMain article: Haravijaya\nThe Haravijaya, described as Ratn\u0101kara's magnum opus, is the longest extant Sanskrit mah\u0101k\u0101vya, containing a total of 4,351 verses in fifty sargas (cantos). The poem narrates \u015aiva's victory over the Andhaka and also describes \u015aiva's iconographic features and gives an exposition of \u015aaiva philosophy. Peter Pasedach lists three commentaries on the poem: Vi\u1e63amapadoddyot\u0101 by Alaka, Laghupa\u00f1cik\u0101 by Ratnaka\u1e47\u1e6dha, and Haravijayas\u0101ravivara\u1e47a by Utpala. An edition of the work was published in 1890, prepared by Pandit Durgaprasad and Kasinath Pandurang Parab for the K\u0101vyam\u0101l\u0101 series.

    "French-Cameroonian political scientist and writer (born 1964)\nCharles Auguste Onana (born 18 February 1964) is a French-Cameroonian political scientist, investigative journalist, essayist, and publisher. He is known for his controversial writings concerning the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\nEducation\nA graduate of Sorbonne University, Onana obtained a Ph.D. in political science in 2017 from Jean Moulin University Lyon 3, with a doctoral thesis entitled Rwanda\u00a0: l'op\u00e9ration Turquoise et la controverse m\u00e9diatique (1994\u20132014) (trans: \"Rwanda: Op\u00e9ration Turquoise and the Media Controversy (1994\u20132014).\nRwandan genocide\nSince 2002, Onana has published several books about the African Great Lakes region and the tragedies that have affected the four nations that border it: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Rwanda, with particular emphasis on the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\nOnana has questioned the use of the term \"genocide\" in reference to the events that took place in Rwanda, and he has accused Paul Kagame of orchestrating the massacre of Tutsis and Hutus as well as the 6 April 1994 downing of the aircraft carrying Rwandan president Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira, a theory he details in his 2002 book Les Secrets du g\u00e9nocide rwandais\u00a0: enqu\u00eate sur les myst\u00e8res d'un pr\u00e9sident (trans: \"secrets of the Rwandan genocide: investigating the mysteries of a president\"). According to political scientist Ren\u00e9 Lemarchand, the book reveals few secrets and contains many biases.\nIn 2004, journalist Christophe Ayad published an article in the French daily Lib\u00e9ration, in which he called Onana and the French-Canadian journalist Robin Philpot, who were invited to participate in an international conference on Rwanda at Sorbonne University, \"denialists\". The authors subsequently filed a defamation suit against Lib\u00e9ration.\nIn 2005, Onana led a conference entitled \"Silence on an attack: the scandal of the Rwandan genocide\". He proceeded to investigate the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and published a book on the topic the same year, containing information he supposedly obtained from the international jurist Carla Del Ponte.\nOnana's 2009 essay \"Ces tueurs tutsi au c\u0153ur de la trag\u00e9die congolaise\" (trans. \"These Tutsi killers at the heart of the Congolese tragedy\") was cited by French historian of genocide H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Dumas in an article in which she notes Onana's racist accusations about Tutsi women and his validation of a supposed \"plan for the conquest of the Great Lakes of Africa\", a false narrative circulating since 1962.\nIn 2019, Onana published the book Rwanda, la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur l'op\u00e9ration Turquoise (trans. \"Rwanda, the truth about Operation Turquoise), in which he declared that \"the conspiracy theory of a Hutu regime planning a 'genocide' in Rwanda constitutes one of the biggest scams of the 20th century\". In an article for the Fondation Jean-Jaur\u00e8s think tank, academic Serge Dupuis calls the book an \"investigation conducted exclusively to exonerate\", very poorly supported by sources, and whose objective is \"the pillorying of the RPF\" (Rwandan Patriotic Front).\nAt an international conference held at the French Senate on 9 March 2020 on \"60 years of instability in the Great Lakes region of Africa\", Onana denounced the French-led 1994 Op\u00e9ration Turquoise and called out the crimes committed by the RPF during and after the genocide, as well as the inertia of the United Nations following the RPF's refusal of any humanitarian intervention in Rwanda.\nLegal issues\nIn 2019, the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism filed a complaint against Onana for contesting crimes against humanity during a television interview about his book Rwanda, la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur l'op\u00e9ration Turquoise.\nOnana was indicted in January 2022, following a complaint filed in 2020 by the non-governmental organizations Survie, International Federation for Human Rights, and Human Rights League for breach of freedom of expression in his denial of crimes against humanity in the book. He was put on trial in October 2024.\nThe rationale for the trial has been contested by two Nobel Peace Prize laureates, Denis Mukwege and Adolfo P\u00e9rez Esquivel.\nOn 4 October 2024, Onana filed a complaint against the current Rwandan head of state, Paul Kagame, with the Paris public prosecutor, following \"public threats\" made against him.\nOther activities\nOnana is the manager of \u00c9ditions Duboiris, the publishing house that has issued most of his books.\nHe has written on the role and actions of African soldiers during the Second World War, on Ren\u00e9 Maran, on Josephine Baker and her involvement in counter-espionage on behalf of Charles de Gaulle from 1940, on the involvement of the charitable organization Zo\u00e9's Ark in the 2007 kidnapping of 103 minors in Chad (co-written with the Chadian politician Ngarlejy Yorongar), on the downfall of the former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo, on the diplomatic relations between France, Israel, and the PLO ",

    "Swedish psychologist\nDavid Natanael Magnusson, born in 1925 in N\u00e4ssj\u00f6, Sweden, died in 2017 in Liding\u00f6, Sweden was a Swedish psychologist. He was professor in psychology at Stockholm University from 1969 to 1992. \nDavid Magnusson is known for several theoretical, methodological and empirical contributions to psychological science. Theoretically, he developed an approach to psychological research called holistic interactionism. The basic assumption is that each person is seen holistically, with multiple systems that interact with the environment in various unique ways. Methodologically, this means that developmental processes are idiosyncratic. He therefore argued for a person-oriented approach as an alternative, or at least as a complement, to the traditional variable-oriented approach in psychological research.\nMagnusson is also known for his longitudinal study Individual Development and Adaptation (IDA), which he started in the 1960s and led until 1996. This research program targeted two whole cohorts of school children in \u00d6rebro, Sweden. These individuals were then followed through more than 20 data collections over more than 50 years. After Magnusson's retirement, the IDA program was led by professor Lars R. Bergman, Stockholm University, and after Bergman's retirement by professors Henrik Andershed and Anna-Karin Andershed at \u00d6rebro University. The IDA program has led to more than 500 scientific publications.\n",

    "\nCurtis C. Rogers Jr. is an American genetic genealogist, digital forensics specialist, and executive known for established GEDmatch, a genetic genealogy website.\nEarly life and education\nCurtis C. Rogers Jr. was born in Jamestown, New York, and was raised in Dunkirk, New York. He developed an interest in genealogy during his early teenage years. Rogers obtained graduate degrees in business (MBA) from Michigan State University and psychology (MS in Counseling Psychology) from Barry University.\nCareer\nAfter his university studies, Rogers initially worked at Corn Products, known for Hellmann's Mayonnaise and Skippy Peanut Butter. During this period, he lived in Hong Kong and the Philippines. He later became the Director of the Far East for Quaker Oats, living in Singapore, and subsequently served as the Far East and Canadian Manager for The Mennen Company.\nGEDmatch and genetic genealogy\nIn 2010, Curtis Rogers and John Olsen established GEDmatch as a hobbyist project. Rogers served as the CEO, while Olson served as the technical manager. Currently, it is a website that specializes in the development and application of genetic genealogy for law enforcement. GEDmatch was the first platform to enable the use of genetic genealogy to solve violent crime cases and identify unidentified human remains.\nCurrently, GEDmatch is a website that has two databases. The primary database has the information of all the members who have submitted their information to GEDmatch and is used strictly for genealogical purposes. The second database contains the information of those who have given their permission for their information to be available to law enforcement if their genetic information matches information gathered at the scene of a violent crime. It is also used to identify unidentified human remains. The first publicized use of GEDmatch for law enforcement was in the arrest of the Golden State Killer on April 25, 2018. It was later announced that the site was previously involved in the capture of the Chameleon Killer.\nInitially, GEDmatch had the only database available for law enforcement use, and Rogers was responsible for developing guidelines for the complicated ethical and operational issues. Today, GEDmatch is also widely used by family genealogists.\nPublications\nRogers authored the book A Forensic Revolution, which documents the introduction of genetic genealogy in law enforcement. His work compares the use of genetic genealogy to the introduction of fingerprinting over a century ago.\nPersonal life\nHe is married to Janet Siegel Rogers, an artist known for her color interaction paintings.

    "\nCity District of Brno in South Moravian Region, Czech Republic\nBrno-st\u0159ed (lit. 'Brno-Center') is one of the 29 city districts of Brno, the second largest city in the Czech Republic. It consists of the cadastral territories of Brno-m\u011bsto (the historic center of the city), Star\u00e9 Brno, Str\u00e1nice, \u0160t\u00fd\u0159ice and Veve\u0159\u00ed and parts of \u010cern\u00e1 Pole, Pis\u00e1rky, Trnit\u00e1 and Z\u00e1brdovice. Its extent thus overlaps to a certain extent with the area of the city of Brno in the years 1850\u20131919 (the so-called Inner Brno). The cadastral area is 15\u00a0km2. The city district was established on November 24, 1990, its office is located in Brno-m\u011bsto. Over 70,000 people live here, also making it the most populated city district in Brno.\nMost of the territory of the district lies between the rivers Svratka and Svitava. For the purposes of the senate elections, Brno-st\u0159ed is included in electoral district number 59 of Brno-City District.\nHistory\nThe oldest documents (charm burial sites) of the Slavic settlement of the modern Brno-st\u0159ed district come from the modern cadastral territory of Pis\u00e1rky from the 6th century. The core of the city district is the Brno-m\u011bsto cadastral territory, but the oldest development of the modern city district was already established in the times of the Great Moravian Empire in the territory of modern Star\u00e9 Brno (lit. 'Old Brno') and in the northern part of \u0160t\u00fd\u0159ice, which originally also partly belonged to Star\u00e9 Brno.\nIn 1641, after the conquest of Olomouc by Swedish troops, Brno became the de facto capital of Moravia, among other things, because the Zemsk\u00e9 desky was quickly moved here from Olomouc. However, it was not until 1782 that the Margrave and Emperor Joseph II put an end to the dispute between the two cities, who definitively recognized Brno as the capital city. In 1643 and 1645, Brno was unsuccessfully besieged by the 18,000-strong Swedish army of General Torstenson, who wanted to use Brno as a base for the final attack on Vienna. During the first Swedish siege of Brno, its defenders set fire to the Franciscan monastery under Petrov to prevent the Swedes from possibly using it during the siege of Brno. But the fire also spread to the monastery of the Franciscans of St. Joseph and finally hit the cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, where he destroyed, among other things, the library and archive. The Swedes themselves did not do much damage at that time. Later, Torstenson's army was joined by the ten-thousand-strong army of George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi of Transylvania, part of which was soon recalled to Lednice. During this siege, the city was defended by only 1,476 inhabitants, with soldiers making up less than half. However, thanks to the hardness and commitment of the defenders and the brilliant organization of the defense by Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches, the Swedes did not succeed and with eight thousand losses they were forced to end the siege.\nIn the 18th century, industrial development took place in the territory of the modern Brno-st\u0159ed district, which led in the last third of the 18th century to the creation of new suburbs: Horn\u00ed Cejl, Hr\u00e1ze, Jirch\u00e1\u0159e, Josefov, Ko\u017een\u00e1, P\u0159\u00edkop, Silni\u010dn\u00ed. In 1786, by the decision of Joseph II founded in the northeast of the territory of today's Brno-st\u0159ed district, in the-then cadastral territory of Velk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ulice, the largest park in Brno to date, Lu\u017e\u00e1nky.\nOn July 6, 1850, the territory of Brno was expanded to include 19 other cadastral territories (Doln\u00ed a Horn\u00ed Cejl, Josefov, Ko\u017een\u00e1, K\u0159enov\u00e1, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eov\u00e1, Mal\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ulice, N\u00e1hon, Na Hr\u00e1zi a P\u0159\u00edkop, Nov\u00e9 Sady, Peka\u0159sk\u00e1, Silni\u010dn\u00ed, Star\u00e9 Brno, \u0160pilberk, \u0160v\u00e1bka, Trnit\u00e1, U Svat\u00e1 Anna, V Jirch\u00e1\u0159y, Velk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ulice a \u010cerven\u00e1 and Z\u00e1brdovice) and its area increased to 17.32 square km; its extended territory (the so-called Inner Brno) roughly overlapped with the modern city district of Brno-st\u0159ed. With this expansion, the land of the modern city district began to be connected to Brno, which was completed in 1919. The original city itself, together with the neighboring cadastral territory of \u0160pilberk, became the first of 4 newly established city districts, which were headed by district committees headed by a superior and a deputy. In the years 1859\u20131864, almost the entire city fortifications of Brno were gradually demolished, of which only short sections, adjacent to the streets of Husova, Ba\u0161ta, Denisovy Sady and in the courtyard of the Jezuitsk\u00e1 13 house, have been preserved to this day, together with the rebuilt M\u011bn\u00edn Gate. After the demolition, the construction of a new development began in 1864 in its place, and in addition to it, several parks were created in the northeast of the district. Furthermore, there was a rapid industrial development in Brno. In August 1869, the horse-drawn railway began operation. The year 1873 brought the first university in Brno, the technical institute. In 1881 and 1882, the newly built city theater was the first European theater to be lit with Thomas Edison's electric bulbs, and the very next year, the fi",
    "Map of the Sea of the Southern Zone with points A, B, C, D, E, and F defined in the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Argentina and Chile, used to delimit their maritime boundary.\nThe Sea of the Southern Zone (Spanish: Mar de la Zona Austral) or Southern Zone Sea is the name given by Argentina and Chile to the maritime area whose boundaries were undefined, located south of the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. This maritime space was subject to delimitation in the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina, which ended the Beagle conflict or \"Southern Zone conflict.\"\nThe definition of this maritime area was constrained by the necessity for the parties ratifying the treaty to avoid referring to the area under delimitation as part of either the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, since the two countries could not agree on its affiliation to one ocean or the other. After the signing of the treaty in 1984 and its ratification in 1985, the name \"Sea of the Southern Zone\" has been largely ignored in both countries, which continue to use their traditional names in cartographic representations of the area. For this reason, parts of this sea are sometimes linked to the Argentine Sea, Chilean Sea or the Drake Passage.\nThe name \"Sea of the Southern Zone\" has not been adopted internationally, and the International Hydrographic Organization did not include the Sea of the Southern Zone in the draft of the 4th edition of its publication Limits of Oceans and Seas, issued via Circular CL55 of 7 November 2001 (the 3rd edition dates from 1953). In this draft, Chile, in agreement with Russia and the United Kingdom, proposed as the northern limit of the Drake Passage the line connecting Waterman Island, Cape Horn, Cape San Bartolom\u00e9 on Isla de los Estados, and the southern coast of that island to Cape San Juan de Salvamento, clearly overlapping areas under the delimitation of the Sea of the Southern Zone.\nBoundaries\nThe boundaries of the Sea of the Southern Zone have only been precisely defined in its northern part, where it reaches the shores of Isla de los Estados from its eastern extremity, the mouth of the Le Maire Strait, and the coast on the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego to the eastern mouth of the Beagle Channel at Cape San P\u00edo. To the west, it extends at least to the Chilean straight baselines \u2014 though it is unclear whether it extends further west \u2014 which skirt the southeast coast of Isla Nueva, the Evout and Barnevelt islets, Deceit Island, and Hornos Island, continuing south to the meridian of Cape Horn. The eastern boundary has not been defined, reaching at least the polygonal line defined in the treaty between points A and E, leaving the connection between point F of the polygon and the eastern extremity of Isla de los Estados undefined. It is not specified whether it extends to the limit of the Argentine exclusive economic zone that was part of the conflict.\nNatural delimitation between the Pacific and South Atlantic oceans by the Shackleton Fracture Zone\nMain article: Shackleton Fracture Zone \u00a7\u00a0Natural delimitation between the Pacific and South Atlantic oceans\nMap showing the proposal presented by the thesis entitled \"Natural delimitation between the Pacific and South Atlantic oceans by the Shackleton Fracture Zone\".\nThe researchers Juan Ignacio Ipinza Mayor and Cedomir Marangunic Damianovic put forward the scientific theory that the separation of the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean oceans \"could be confirmed from the so-called Shackleton Fracture Zone ... the boundary is then located east of the so-called Cape Horn Meridian\".\nDispute over the extended continental shelf\nMap of the dispute.\nThis section is an excerpt from Dispute over the extended continental shelf in the Southern Zone Sea between Argentina and Chile \u00a7 History.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) of April 30, 1982, which entered into force on November 16, 1994, established the regime of the continental shelf in Part VI (Articles 76 to 85), defining in Article 76, paragraph 1 what is understood as a continental shelf.\nArgentina ratified the convention on January 12, 1995, and it came into force for the country on December 31, 1995.\nOn August 25, 1997, Chile signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and it entered into force for the country on September 24, 1997.\nIn 2009, Argentina submitted a presentation to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which was accepted in 2016 by the UNCLOS. The map in the submission included the disputed territories with the United Kingdom, such as the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and South Sandwich Islands, a crescent-shaped area south of Argentina's territorial sea as defined in the 1984 treaty with Chile. This area was also claimed by Chile as part of its Presential Sea, and the sea surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula, which is claimed by all three aforementioned countries. That same year, on May",

His grandmother was sister to Anne Charles Fran\u00e7ois de Montmorency, 5th Duke of Montmorency.\nAs a child during the French Revolution, Fernand and his parents left to emigrate in 1790 and did not return to France until 1800.\nCareer\nCh\u00e2teau de Josselin in Morbihan\nRohan entered the French Imperial Army in 1809 as a second lieutenant of Cuirassiers. He fought in the campaign against Austria in 1809, then the campaign against Russia in 1812, where he was aide-de-camp to General Narbonne, himself aide-de-camp to Emperor Napoleon I. In 1813, he took part in the Battle of Dresden. Taken prisoner on the Elbe in 1814, he was released, joined the French army and was promoted to Squadron leader.\nHaving joined the Restoration in the spring of 1814, he was made a Staff colonel and Knight of the Order of Saint Louis. He then served as aide-de-camp to the Duke of Berry, whom he accompanied to Ghent during the Hundred Days. In 1820, he became first aide-de-camp and gentleman-in-waiting to the Duke of Berry's son, Henri, Duke of Bordeaux. In 1824, he was made Colonel of the Hussars of the Guard, first equerry of the Duke of Bordeaux. In 1828, he was made Mar\u00e9chal de camp. During the July Revolution of 1830, he refused, out of loyalty to the elder branch of the Bourbons, to swear an oath to Louis-Philippe, then remaining, with his wife, in opposition to the July Monarchy.\nDuke of Rohan\nHis elder brother, Louis-Fran\u00e7ois de Rohan-Chabot, had married Marie Georgine Armandine de S\u00e9rent, granddaughter of the Duke of S\u00e9rent, in 1808. After her death from a fire in 1815, he devoted himself to the church, becoming a Catholic prelate, serving as Archbishop of Auch, then Archbishop of Besan\u00e7on and Cardinal before his death on 8 February 1833. When his brother entered religious orders, Fernand took the title, Prince of L\u00e9on. Louis-Fran\u00e7ois, who had succeeded their father as Duke of Rohan in 1816, died without issue in 1833, therefore, Fernand succeeded as the 9th Duke of Rohan and inherited the family seat, the Ch\u00e2teau de Josselin, which had been damaged during the Revolution but restored by his elder brother in 1822 upon the insistence of Caroline, Duchess of Berry.\nPersonal life\nOn 19 May 1817, he married Jos\u00e9phine Fran\u00e7oise de Gontaut-Biron de Saint-Blancard (1796\u20131844), a daughter of Lieutenant-General Charles Michel de Gontaut, Viscount of Gontaut-Biron-Saint-Blancard, and Marie-Louise-Jos\u00e9phine de Montault de Navailles, governess of the Children of France. Before her death in 1844, they were the parents of seven children:\nCharles-Louis-Josselin de Rohan-Chabot (1819\u20131893), who married Octavie Rouill\u00e9 de Boissy, daughter of Hilaire-Etienne-Octave Rouill\u00e9, Marquis of Boissy, in 1843.\nLouise-Jos\u00e9phine-Isabelle de Rohan-Chabot (1822\u20131844), who married Marie Alfred Charles Gaston de B\u00e9thisy, Marquis of M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, in 1841.\nLouise-Anne-Fran\u00e7oise de Rohan-Chabot (1824\u20131868), who married Austrian ambassador Georg Alexander Esterh\u00e1zy von Galantha, Count of Esterh\u00e1zy, in 1846.\nCharles-Guy-Fernand de Rohan-Chabot (1828\u20131908), who married Marie-Augusta Baudon de Mony, in 1858.\nAlexandrine-Am\u00e9lie-Marie de Rohan-Chabot (1831\u20131907), who married Henri Charles Louis de Beurges, Count of Beurges, in 1851.\nHenri-Raoul-L\u00e9onor de Rohan-Chabot (1835\u20131922), who married Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Berthe de Chabrol-Tourno\u00ebl, in 1860.\nJeanne-Charlotte-Cl\u00e9mentine de Rohan-Chabot (1839\u20131929), who married Arthur d'Anthoine, Baron of Saint-Joseph (a great-grandson of Fran\u00e7ois Clary), in 1865.\nThe Duke died at the Ch\u00e2teau de Reuil-en-Brie on 20 September 1",

Retirement home 2) is a 2024 French comedy film directed by Claude Zidi Jr. It serves as a sequel to Maison de retraite (2022).\nPremise\nThe Lino Vartan Home for young orphans and elderly has to close for sanitary reasons. Milann Rousseau, manager of the facility, decides to accept an invitation from a retirement home in the South of France that proposes to host them for the summer. All the residents of the Lino Vartan Home are transferred by bus to the Bel Azur Club, which is set in an idyllic villa by the sea. But the persons who live there soon express their strong dislike for the newcomers.\nThe Bel Azur Club is managed by Claude Masson and his daughter, Cl\u00e9mence, is the main nurse. Milann and her gradually fall in love. For the sake of the budding couple, the two groups of residents decide to make peace. However, one of the children discovers that Claude is in league with a big EHPAD nursing home chain, Major Sant\u00e9, with a bad reputation, and that the whole invitation was just a scheme. She cannot warn Milann in time: he has signed an agreement to have his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s hosted by Masson, and, as a consequence, the elderly residents are all sent to one of Major Sant\u00e9's nursing homes near Paris while the children are taken to an orphanage.\nMilann is helped by Cl\u00e9mence, who was unaware of her father's intentions, and they trap Major Sant\u00e9's  COE, Reine Montrosier, by selling her an old mansion pretending it is a new top-notch facility that big investors are about to buy.

    "Chilean restaurant in Los Angeles\nRinc\u00f3n Chileno (transl.\u2009Chilean nook) is a Chilean restaurant, delicatessen, and bakery in Los Angeles, California. Established in 1973, it is owned by Chilean immigrants Ricardo and Cristina Flores. After the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat, it became a gathering place for the Chilean immigrant community in the Los Angeles area, who nicknamed it the \"second Chilean consulate\".\nHistory\nRicardo and Cristina Flores, Rinc\u00f3n Chileno's owners, first came to the United States as newlyweds from Chile in 1969. Originally their intentions were to stay in the United States temporarily, then return to Chile in order to raise their family. However, upon their return the country was in an economic depression caused by the Vuskovic plan and American opposition against the presidency of Salvador Allende. Ricardo and Cristina Flores chose to immigrate permanently to the United States; Ricardo later brought his mother and stepfather.\nRinc\u00f3n Chileno was established in 1973. It had originated from Ricardo's mother and stepfather, who prepared and served traditional food to the members of a local Chilean club in Los Angeles. When a pair of commercial spaces on Melrose Avenue became available, they rented them and set up a restaurant with an adjoining delicatessen and bakery.\nInitially, Rinc\u00f3n Chileno had few customers. Business improved after the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat, which led many Chileans to immigrate to the Los Angeles area. Because many of the newly arrived immigrants had been both supporters and opponents of Allende, Flores resolved to maintain his business politically neutral. \"I tell my children and my wife, we don't talk politics here\", he said in 2018. \"We have to serve this and that side\".\nIn the years immediately following the coup, Rinc\u00f3n Chileno became a gathering place for the Chilean community in the Los Angeles area. Aside from food, it also sold Chilean periodicals, became a source for exchanging news about Chile, and provided Chilean immigrants with help in acclimating to the United States. As a result, it was nicknamed the \"second Chilean consulate\" in Los Angeles. In a 1993 review for the Los Angeles Times, the food critic Jonathan Gold said that \"Rinc\u00f3n Chileno is as much community center as it is a restaurant\". \"Thank God that Rinc\u00f3n Chileno fulfilled a task in that time of unifying Chileans a bit and that makes me feel good\", Flores said in 2023.\nA second Rinc\u00f3n Chileno location opened in Lawndale.\nMenu\nRinc\u00f3n Chileno specializes in traditional Chilean cuisine. Among the dishes that have received commentary from the press include its congrio frito, a dish of fried cusk-eel. Gold, who praised the dish, described it as \"like nothing so much as something off an oversize fish 'n' chips platter, sided with a chopped tomato salad that is like a Chilean pico de gallo\".\nIn 1987, the Los Angeles Times referred to Rinc\u00f3n Chileno's pastel de choclo as its most popular item. It also said that it was probably the only place in the Los Angeles area where one could order erizos al matico, a sea urchin dish served with pebre. Gold wrote in 1993 that it was \"delicious, crammed full of aphrodisiac nutrients, but really too rich to eat more than a few bites of\u2014even if you are trying to preserve the honor of your country\". Its humitas and pan amasado have also been favorably commented on. The latter was described by the Los Angeles Times in 1984 as being \"like expanded versions of the baking powder biscuits your mother and/or grandmother probably used to make\".\nRinc\u00f3n Chileno's empanadas were listed among the best in Los Angeles by LAist in 2016.\nReception\nExterior of Rinc\u00f3n Chileno's restaurant\nIn a 1977 review for the LA Weekly, Jack Livingston wrote that he felt as if he had \"stepped into a time warp\" upon entering Rinc\u00f3n Chileno, which he described as being like \"some local cafe on a summer street in Valpara\u00edso, circa 1937\". A 1985 Los Angeles Times review said that Rinc\u00f3n Chileno attracted business from students at Los Angeles City College.\nGold described the restaurant in 1993:\nRinc\u00f3n Chileno is an old-fashioned ethnic restaurant on the eastern end of Melrose, famous in its day as a place for an exotic date, closer in atmosphere to the Latin restaurants in New York's West Village than to the divier yet ultra-authentic places you now expect in Hollywood.\nHe added that the wait to get seated without a reservation would permit him the opportunity to browse the delicatessen and bakery next door for a \"car picnic\". Because of that he said that it was \"conceivably the only restaurant in  where it can be pleasurable to be turned away\".\n",

    "American politician\nRachel Ruelas is an American politician elected Mayor of Mabton, Washington in November 2021 in a write-in campaign. In 2024, two separate recall campaigns were filed, one by members of the city council and one by citizens, over allegations of gross incompetence.\nPolitical career\nRuelas first entered politics in 2017 when she and her son each ran for a seat on the Mabton city council. She lost in the general election to incumbent Sophia Gutierrez-Sotelo, 37% to 63%.\nAfter the 2021 primary election, Ruelas coordinated a write-in campaign for mayor of Mabtom with two other individuals running for city council positions. She posted regularly on Facebook concerning the Mabton staffing and direction. The three candidates won their elections, with Ruelas defeating incumbent mayor Laura Vazquez 109 votes to 58 votes. When Ruelas took office, the city of Mabton faced years of poor water quality along with the city government plagued with financial and budgetary problems.\nIn a June 2024 council meeting, councilmembers and the public expressed frustration with Ruelas's failure to release a city budget and council minutes, as well as a failure to oversee city personnel, including the deputy clerk who was arrested for allegedly stealing $22,000 from the city. The council called on Ruelas to resign and she refused, stating \"We are not talking about anything that is going on in the community.\" Ruelas then ended the meeting early and refused to take questions from reporters. The following day, the city council voted 4\u20131 to initiate a recall campaign against Ruelas over gross incompetence and unethical use of city resources to promote her business. The sole no vote was from councilmember Diana Casteneda, Ruelas' mother, who told the council and audience, \"I am disappointed in some of you people that are here for this meeting.\"\nA separate recall petition was submitted by Mabton resident Ruben Olivarez in August 2024, with two charges, convincing the previous city council to approve a $8,000 a year pay increase for her and not releasing a city budget. A Yakima Superior Court ruled, in separate cases, that two charges from each petition could move forward: the lack of notice over the budget process and use of the city website to promote her bridal businesses from the first petition, and both charges from the second petition. In both cases, Ruelas appealed the rulings to the Washington Supreme Court.\nRuelas did provide a preliminary budget to the council in October 2024, nearly a month past the deadline she gave the court, and city council members and staff struggled to create a budget due to incomplete and inaccurate city financial reports.\nIn October 2024, a fight broke out at the Mi Casa 2 restaurant between two groups: Ruela, her husband, and son on one side and Ruben Olivarez and his wife on the other. Olivarez's family criticized the police response to the incident, saying the police did not call them after the incident and only talked to Ruelas after she called the officers. An officer met Olivarez the following day and took an incident report; he and Reulas filed protective orders against the other. In the Yakima Superior Court case addressing both the protective orders, the judge denied Oliverez's order because \"  was the aggressor because he escalated by demanding to know, 'Who are you looking at?'\" The judge granted Ruelas' protective order, but allowed Oliverez to attend city council meetings.\nSince the recall efforts began, Ruelas has not given a statement to or answered questions from any media outlet regarding the budget or other city issues. In the October protective order case, Ruelas complained about her coverage in the media, saying \"(Olivarez has) been on the news and he\u2019s referred to me several times with the news media that you have here today, so I feel that Apple Valley News has always attacked me in the news media...\" The judge in the case responded in part to Ruelas \"...you need to toughen up a little bit and recognize that if you\u2019re going to be in public office, you\u2019re going to deal with people who are being passionate and so on.\"\nPersonal life\nRuelas is married, and she has six children. Before running for city council, Ruelas owned L.A. Style, a wedding and quincea\u00f1era dress store in Toppenish, Washington, which is now closed. She now owns Forever Bridal and Decorating in Prosser, Washington.\n",

After finding this arrangement inadequate and, following receipt of authorisation from Charles IX in 1566, the city council decided to acquired a dedicated building for use as their meeting place. The building they selected, which had originally formed part of the Dervalli\u00e8res Castle Estate, was known as the Manoir de Derval. The city council acquired the manor house on 27 March 1578. The building was modest; there were two rooms on the ground floor, two rooms on the first floor and an attic.\nIn the early 17th century, the city council, under the leadership of the mayor, Claude de Cornulier, decided to remodel the building. It was rebuilt to a design by H\u00e9lie R\u00e9migereau in the neoclassical style in 1606. This programme of work established the main frontage of the building, on the north side, and the western wing. The main frontage of five bays was arcaded on the ground floor and fenestrated with tall casement windows with masks on the first floor. There was a frieze with ornate plasterwork between the floors, and the windows on the first floor were flanked by Corinthian order pilasters supporting an entablature and a modillioned cornice. The western wing of four bays contained four doorways on the ground floor and four casement windows interspersed with niches on the first floor. The niches contained statues representing faith, hope and charity. The wing was decorated with plasterwork in a similar style to the main frontage.\nA landscaped garden, designed by Jacques Goubert, was laid out behind the building in 1727. Further works on the courtyard were completed to a design by Fran\u00e7ois-Jean-Baptiste Og\u00e9e in 1822. The western wing was extended by the addition of one extra niche, and a new eastern wing was erected to mirror the western wing. Towers with ogee-shaped domes were erected in the northeast and northwest corners of the courtyard. Internally, the principal room was the Salle des F\u00eates (council chamber) on the first floor.\nThe complex was extended to the north, beyond the landscaped garden, by the construction of B\u00e2timent Garde-Dieu to accommodate the municipal archives in 1901. It was extended to the northeast by acquiring and integrating the H\u00f4tel de Rosmadec, which dated back to the 17th century, and to the east, adjacent to Rue de Strasbourg, by the acquisition of the H\u00f4tel de Monti de Rez\u00e9, which dated back to the 17th century, in 1923.\nA new annex was erected on Rue Garde-Dieu in 1957. A monumental portal at the entrance to the courtyard, which had been designed by Mathurin Peccot and completed in the early 19th century and which had been badly damaged during the Second World War, was replaced by a fine iron gate, designed by Raymond Subes, in 1962. A public-facing building was erected on Rue Garde-Dieu, to a design by Georges Evano, in 1979.\nWorks of art in the building include a series of busts of former mayors, including one by the sculptor, \u00c9mile Guillaume, of Gabriel Guist'hau, in the Salle des Bustes (Hall of Busts).\n",
    "Species of moth\nCabera subalba is a species of geometrid moth, found on the islands of  S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe in West Africa. It belongs to the monophylectic Cabera subalba Group.\nTaxonomy\nThis moth was previously named Thysanopyga subalba (Warren,1901).\nDescription\nCabera subalba is a medium sized Cabera species. The length of the forewing is 12\u201315\u00a0mm (0.47\u20130.59\u00a0in), and it is broad and pointed. The hindwing resembles the forewing, except it has a shorter point at the anal angle.\nIt differs from the other species in its group due to its darker overall ground coloration. Although  the prominence of the white discal spot on the forewings varies among individuals, it is occasionally considered a key feature for identifiction. Cabera limbata is the only other moth in the group that has a single cornutus (spine-like structure) in the vesica. To differentiate between these two, variations in the valvae and socci are considered, as they are narrower and smaller in C. limbata, respectively.\nAppearance\nAdults bear a primarily dark brown-grey ground color. The forewings contain faint, slightly convex, darker grey striations, though these are not discernible in most specimens. A prominent characteristic of the forewings is the presence of discal spots, which are bold and white in nearly all the moths, except occasionally, where they are reduced in size, and less pronounced in color. The underside is significantly lighter than the upperside.\nThe hindwings also contain minuscule discal spots which are white, encircled in a black outer ring. While the terminal shade on the underside is pronounced on the forewing, it is less prominent on the hindwing. The cilia and the body vestiture are consistent in color with the wings.\nMale genitalia\nMales contain a long and sharply pointed, setose uncus, a hook-like structure at the terminal end. The soccii lobes are also densely covered with setae. Their genital capsule is elliptical, while the 9th ventral segment, or the vinculum, contains a notable median suture, and relatively weak transtilla (band of connective tissue at the base of valvae) is present. The pair of valvae are elongated and slender, with no swelling along the centre of dorsal margin. While these claspers lack the medial group of setae, there is a group of stout setae on the apical region. There is a poorly developed sacculus and the inseminating organ, aedaegus, is short and spindle-shaped. The sheath that surrounds it, the vesica, contains a single nail-like cornutus at its apex.\nFemale genitalia\nAdult females have a normal papillae anales. Both, the anterior and posterior apophyses have are lengthy and slender. The anterior apophyses extends nearly two-thirds the length of the posterior ones, with the protruded sterigma being substantially unmodified. The posteriormost part ductus bursae (the tube where the sperm is released) broadens into a wide antrum. Its site of copulation, the bursa copulatrix, itself is long and tube-like without a distinct boundary separating the ductus, and corpus bursae or receptacle. Unlike other related species, C. subalba differs by lacking the sclerotized structures on the inner wall of corpus bursae, referred to as the signum.\n",

    "Spatial biology is how biological molecules and cells are organized, interact, and function in their native 2 and 3 dimensional environment.\nMany fields within biology are studied for their individual contribution to spatial biology.\nSpatial biochemistry\nSpatial biochemistry refers to the study of biochemical processes in their 3 dimensional cellular state. Biochemical reactions require molecular interactions for a process to proceed. Spatial biochemistry determines the spatial distribution that dictates these biochemical processes in the cell. \nFor example, enzymes require access to their substrate for a biochemical reaction to proceed. In a cellular environment an enzyme can be compartmentalized or sequestered away from its substrate and then activated by substrate presentation. Enzymes activated by this type of spatial biochemistry include phospholipase D and gamma secretase.\nWithin the membrane, the spatial distribution is controlled by clusters of lipids including PI(4,5)P2 and saturated lipids that bind palmitate.\nSpatial proteomics\nSpatial proteomics is the localizations of proteins and their dynamic expression at the sub-cellular level. A spatial map of proteins and their modifications in 3-D space generates a spatial proteome. Both how much of a protein is present and the types of modification to the protein are important.\nSpatial genomics\nSpatial genomics utilizes the spatial readout of gene transcripts to determine the 3-dimensional biological function of a cell. The technique spatial transcriptomics was introduced in 2016 \n",

    "Species of lichen\nCollybiopsis affixa, the little stinker, is a species of fungus in the family Omphalotaceae. It occurs in Asia and Australia. While it has been considered a basidiolichen by some researchers, its status as a lichenised fungus remains uncertain.\nTaxonomy\nIt was described as a new species in 1848 by Miles Joseph Berkeley, who initially classified it in the genus Agaricus. The type was collected in 1846 by Ronald Campbell Gunn from Penquite at Launceston, Tasmania, where it was growing on the bark on a young Eucalyptus amygdalina tree. The taxon has been shuffled to several genera in its taxonomic history, including Marasmius, Pleurotus, and the now-superceded genus names Chamaeceras, and Dendrosarcus. In more recent history, Rolf Singer transferred it to Marasmiellus in 1973, and it has been generally known by that name for about five decades. Following a molecular phylogenetics-led resurrection and restructuring of Collybiopsis, Jerry Cooper transferred it to this genus in 2023.\nIt is colloquially known as the \"little stinker\" due to its characteristic odour, described as resembling \"strong rotting cabbage\" or \"old-wet-nappy\".\nDescription\nThe thallus of this basidiolichen comprises a thin greenish-coloured film from which mushroom-shaped fruiting bodies arise. These structures are up to about 10\u00a0mm in diameter and have a buff to pinkish-buff cap and a short stipe. The thallus has a distinct odour or rotting cabbage or stale urine, which persists even if fruiting bodies are not present.\nLichen status\nThe classification of C. affixa as a basidiolichen has been a subject of debate. In 1970, Rolf Singer first suggested that this species was lichenised, noting its association with a crustose lichen on Eucalyptus saplings in Australia. Singer later provided more detailed observations in 1973, describing a crustose organism consisting of Coccomyxa algal cells embedded in basidiomycete hyphae, which produced fruiting bodies identified as Marasmiellus affixus (now C.\u00a0affixa).\nSinger's observations suggested a possible lichenised state, noting variability in the association between fungal hyphae and algal cells. He observed that in some areas, algal accumulations contained few mycelial threads, while in others, the mycelium was so dense that it completely covered the algal cells. However, these observations have not been conclusively confirmed by subsequent studies. The fungus-algal connection was not examined in detail, and the presence of algal cells in the fruiting body trama is not considered definitive evidence of lichenisation, as foreign bodies can occasionally appear in fungal fruiting bodies. As of 2011, the lichenisation of C.\u00a0affixa was considered plausible but not proven. The species was not included in more recent molecular analyses of basidiolichens, leaving its status uncertain.\nHabitat and distribution\nIn Tasmania (Australia), Collybiopsis affixa grows in sclerophyll forest, on dead woody material, especially that which has lost its bark. It has also been recorded in cool-temperate rainforest habitats growing on dead Dicksonia antarctica fronds. Its Australian distribution also includes Queensland, South Australia, and Victoria. The basidiolichen has also been reported from India, and from North Sumatra (Indonesia). A local name used by the Dayak ethnic group to refer to the basidiolichen is kulat kerang, which translates to  \"shell mushroom\" or \"shell fungus\".\n",

According to film historian V. A. K. Ranga Rao, this marked a significant milestone in Telugu cinema, as it was the first instance where a playback singer received explicit credit for their work on songs featuring Kamala Kotnis, highlighting the distinction between the singing voices and the actors on screen.\nReception\nDespite the presence of popular actors and a melodious score, Bhagyalakshmi did not perform well at the box office. Nevertheless, its significance in Indian cinema history is marked by its status as the 100th talkie in Telugu.\n",
    "Portrait of Che Guevara in Cuba (1990). Guevarism was a prominent ideological justification for the rectification process.\nThe rectification process was a series of economic reforms in Cuba, officially titled the Rectification of Errors and Negative Tendencies. The process began in 1986, and lasted until 1992. The reforms were aimed at eliminating private businesses, trade markets, that had been introduced into the Cuban law and Cuban culture, during the 1970s. The new reforms aimed to nationalize more of the economy and eliminate material incentives for extra labor, instead relying on moral enthusiasm alone. Castro often justified this return to moral incentives by mentioning the moral incentives championed by Che Guevara, and often alluded to Guevarism when promoting reforms.\nAfter the conclusion of the rectification process, the Cuban economic went into decline, and after the end of soviet aid due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Cuban economy devolved into a crisis known as the Special Period.\nBackground\nEconomic planning in Cuba\nMain articles: Agrarian reforms in Cuba, Great Debate (Cuba), and Revolutionary Offensive\nCubans chopping sugarcane in 1970. This harvest was the end goal of the 1968 economic plan known as the Revolutionary Offensive.\nSince the 1959 revolution, Cuba had engaged in various methods of economic reform and planning. Immediately after the revolution, there was an attempt to nationalize large businesses, from 1966 to 1970 there was an internal debate as to whether to implement a soviet style of economic planning (with material incentives for workers), or a Guevarist style of economic planning (with only moral incentives for workers). After 1971, there was a moderate effort to reintroduce some market mechanics back into the economy.\nIn 1982, Fidel Castro would criticize the legal farmers' markets in Cuba. He condemned the speculation in the market, and the enrichment of merchants. He intended to highly tax the merchants, but his approval did not gain support in the Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba.\nReforms in the Soviet Union\nFurther information: Perestroika and Glasnost\nAfter the advent of Perestroika and Glasnost in the Soviet Union, certain sectors of the Communist Party of Cuba began contemplating similar reforms in Cuba. The rectification process was enacted by Castro in defiance of these reformist tendencies in the party, that admired reformism in the Soviet Union.\nHistory\nIn February 1986, at the Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, Castro announced \"Now, we are going to build socialism\", and criticized material incentives for laborers. Over the next months continued to criticize the Cuban bureaucracy and  laziness. Economic reforms also included restructurings of party management. In 1986, the System of Direction for Economic Planning was made to obey the command of the Politboro of the Communist Party of Cuba.\nOn October 8, 1987, at the anniversary of Che Guevara's death, Castro gave a speech inferring Guevara would be horrified at the bureaucracy in Cuba, and the lack of patriotic enthusiasm of common workers.\nThroughout the rectification process, private businesses became more heavily regulated, farmers markets were banned, material incentives were ended, and the minimum wage was increased.\nAlong with political consolidation, investigations into drug trafficking among political officials began. The most famous investigation was into General Arnaldo Ochoa who after denying his guilt, was executed by firing  squad.\nSince private construction was banned, micro-brigades were introduced. Micro-brigades were small self-managed construction units, were mobilized during the rectification process, and heralded by Fidel Castro a step away from economic bureaucracy, which was highly condemned. In a 1986 comment to the Granma newspaper, Fidel Castro stated:\nThese technocrats and bureaucrats are infected with a kind of ideological AIDS, a kind of AIDS that was destroying the defense of the revolution.\nAftermath\nMain article: Special Period\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, soviet aid ended, and a severe economic crisis termed \"the Special Period\" began in 1991. Despite the condemnation of markets during the rectification process, foreign businesses were soon encouraged to help build a tourist industry in Cuba. Eventually, foreigners and Cuban nationals would be legally bound to different economic policies, that even prevented Cubans from entering certain hotels.\n",

    "Musical artist\nVirtue were an English heavy metal band from Oxford, founded in 1981 and disbanded in 1988.\nHistory\nThe band was formed in 1981 by brothers Matt (guitar) and Tudor Sheldon (vocals). In early 1984, Adrian Metcalfe joined as another guitarist, while Brian Reader played bass and Ian Lewington played drums. A first demo cassette titled Virtue-Defenders followed. As the band was not satisfied with the results, the group almost broke up. However, a new line-up was achieved, so that in addition to the Sheldon brothers, the group now consisted of guitarist Boz Beast, bassist Darren Prothero and drummer Simon Walters. This was followed by a number of local gigs across Oxfordshire. \nIn 1985 the band recorded a single at Matinee Music in Reading, which was released on Other Records under the name We Stand to Fight. The single was played on the radio and sent to various labels. Among them was the major label EMI, which showed interest; however, the band was unable to sign a contract. As the first edition sold out after a short time, a second edition was pressed the following year. Towards the end of 1986, the band prepared the EP Fools Gold, which was to be released on Hatchet Records. Due to a number of problems, however, the label was unable to release the EP, so the EP was only released as a demo on cassette in 1987. More gigs followed and the band's line-up changed. Due to the frequent line-up changes, the band split up in 1988. Bob Duffy, who had been the new bassist in the band before the split, later joined Lou Taylor's Tour De Force. Matt Sheldon would later form the band The Shock with Boz Beast and a few other members. Duffy would later join the band as well.\nIn 2013, No Remorse Records released the EP We Stand to Fight, which contained remastered versions of the single \"We Stand to Fight\" and the demo \"Fools Gold\", as well as an interview and photos.\nMembers\nFinal lineup\nBob Duffy (bass)\nSimon Walters (drums)\nBoz Beast (guitar)\nMatt Sheldon (guitar)\nTudor Sheldon (vocals)\nPrevious members\nDarren Prothero (bass)\nBrian Reader (bass)\nIan Lewington (drums)\nAdrian Metcalfe (guitar)\nDiscography\nDemos\nVirtue-Defenders (1984)\nFools Gold (1987)\nSingles\nWe Stand to Fight (1985)\nEPs\n2013: We Stand to Fight (2013)",

    "Unusual US scheduled airline 1945\u20131960\nDC-4 at Oakland 1954. Note \"Flying Houseparty\" behind cockpit\nResort Airlines was an unusual United States scheduled international airline certificated in 1949 by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the now-defunct Federal agency that, at the time, tightly regulated almost all commercial air transport in the United States. Resort's scheduled authority was restricted to offering all-expenses paid escorted tours to nearby foreign destinations (e.g. the Caribbean), known as sky cruises. Resort could offer conventional charter service but no other scheduled service. The market for sky cruises was limited and quite unprofitable, so the vast majority of Resort's business was charters, and for several years, only charters. At the time, the US did not have pure charter carriers, but rather supplemental air carriers (known, until 1955, as irregular air carriers), which at the time had a limited ability to offer scheduled service. Since Resort was functionally a pure charter carrier, it had in some ways the most restrictive certificate in the US airline industry. The airline ceased operations in 1960 at which time it tried selling its certificate to Trans Caribbean Airways. But in 1961 the CAB rejected the deal and revoked the moribund carrier's certificate.\nResort is sometimes referred to as supplemental or irregular air carrier. It was briefly an irregular air carrier before CAB certication, but from 1949 onward the CAB regulated it as a scheduled carrier, albeit an unusual one. The term \"supplemental\" came into existence in 1955, Resort was thus never a supplemental.\nHistory\nEarly years\nResort was incorporated 11 September 1945 by Lewis C. Burwell Jr., a former U.S. Army Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, as a North Carolina corporation headquartered in Pinehurst originally focused on owning airports. By November, Resort had purchased Knollwood Army Airfield in Pinehurst, renaming it Pinehurst-Southern Pines Airport. By December, Resort was offering flights on light aircraft to the public. By June 1946 Resort was offering service from New York to Miami but also experimenting with sky cruises. For instance, it offered a 16-day tour across the United States and back from New York City, all expenses paid, including 12 stops, for $785 (over $12,500 in 2024 dollars) on a 20-seat Douglas DC-3.\nBy November 1946 Resort had applied to the CAB for authority to offer such sky cruises from Northern US cities to the Caribbean and Latin America. While the CAB deliberated, Resort continued to offer sky cruises under a CAB exemption. The CAB rejected the application, but since it involved foreign travel, under the law at the time, the US president had the final say and President Harry S. Truman liked the idea, seeing it as a good for US foreign policy. He overruled the CAB and Resort's application was approved in June 1949 to offer sky cruises to points in Canada, the Caribbean, Central and northern South America and Mexico for a five-year term. However, the CAB had the last word on a parallel application to offer sky cruises domestically, and rejected it. The scheduled certificate superseded Resort's \"letter of registration\", received from the CAB in 1947, what CAB provided irregular air carriers in lieu of a certificate.\nScheduled airline\nC-46 at Oakland July 1952. This aircraft, N66534, crashed 14 months later at Louisville, Kentucky with the deaths of 25 on board. See Accidents\nResort received its scheduled certificate in August 1949, but sky cruising did not start until 1951. In September 1950, ownership ownership and management changed, with the company becoming controlled by Fiduciary Counsel, Inc., a fund manager controlled by Clinton Davidson. In 1951 the CAB launched an investigation into Resort's activities. Competitors challenged whether Resort could offer charters and any other kind of scheduled service. The answer, handed down in 1952, was yes to charters, no to scheduled service outside of sky cruising. At the time, irregular carriers (Resort's status before it was certificated) had substantial flexibility to offer charters and a certain, ill-defined amount of \"individually ticketed\" (i.e. scheduled) service, so long as it was \"irregular\" (standardized to 10 flights per month in any city pair in 1955). Resort lost this flexibility by becoming a scheduled carrier. On the operational side, the CAB (and its operational alter-ego, the Civil Aeronautics Administration, predecessor to the Federal Aviation Administration) allowed Resort to continue to follow operational regulations that applied to irregular (and later supplemental) carriers rather than those that the scheduled carriers needed to follow.\nFlying houseparty\nMeanwhile, sky cruising, under a scheduled certificate, was deeply unprofitable. Resort calculated that from 1951 through September 1955, it had total sky cruise-related revenue of $0.95 million, on which it had an operating loss of $1.68 million, or an operating margin of",

She has been the head coach of Dundee United Women since March 2024.\nPlaying career\nRaised in Edinburgh, Robertson did not play organised football until the age of 19. She joined Hibernian around the time the team was formed in 1997, and was a major part of their success in the first decade of the 21st century, winning three Scottish Women's Premier League championships, three Scottish Women's Cups and one SWPL Cup. She also spent time on loan in the United States with New Jersey Wildcats (alongside compatriot Debbie McWhinnie) and in Iceland with \u00cdBV (with fellow Scot Suzanne Malone).\nIn 2007, Robertson was recruited to be part of the new women's football setup at Celtic \u2013 the team reached the Scottish Cup final in their first season but were defeated by Hibs, and were unable to dethrone the increasingly dominant Glasgow City in the league.

    "\nChemical compound\nProfluralin is a dinitroaniline herbicide used pre\u00ebmergently to control annual grasses and broadleaf weeds, in cotton, soybeans, peanuts, sunflower, cabbage, cauliflower, tomato and others. Profluralin has largely fallen out of use. It rose out of the related, still in common use, trifluralin.\nEnvironmental decomposition by micro\u00f6rganisms happens in soil and water. Typical soil half-lives for profluralin are 80-160 days. Profluralin is adsorbed into plantmatter, so there is potential that it stay in crops after harvest. It is practically non-toxic to birds and mammals, though bees and fish are affected. If applied in high doses to rats, they may exhibit ataxia, slower breathing, salivation, prostration, hyperactivity or dyspnea.  It interacts with dsDNA via electrostatic binding.\nIt was sold under the tradenames \"Pregard\" and \"Tolban\" (Syngenta), registered in August 1975 and expiring in April 1984. Tolban was a 45% profluralin emulsifiable concentrate.\nProfluralin's mode of action is by binding to tubulin microtubules as they form, blocking further growth. It shares the same mechanism and resistance properties of trifluralin, and other dinitroanlines.\nSafety\nProfluralin is not toxic, not considered a carcinogen. Human harm is not expected, outside of eye irritation. Profluralin is very toxic to fish though, and is theorised to bioaccumulate in them.\n",

    "\nThe building, in 2015\nHartforth Hall is a historic building in Hartforth, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe manor of Hartforth was recorded in the Domesday Book and descended through various families.  The current country house was built in 1744, and a northwest range was added in 1792, probably to a design by John Foss.  In about 1900, the right-hand bays were rebuilt and a new range added at that end.  The building was grade II* listed in 1969.   The house passed to Sheldon Cradock, MP for Camelford, whose grandson, Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock, was born at Hartforth in 1862 and who died at the Battle of Coronel. The property was operated as a hotel and wedding venue from 1986 to 2017, but the hotel is now permanently closed.\nThe house is built of sandstone with a Westmorland slate roof and it has two storeys.  The south front has eight bays, a plinth, quoins, a floor band, a modillion cornice, a balustered parapet with square pedestals, and urn finials at the ends.  Three of the bays project slightly, and contain a doorway with an architrave, a fanlight, and a tripartite keystone in a rusticated quoined surround, with a pediment.  The windows are sashes in architraves.  The left return has ten bays, and contains a two-storey bow window.  The right return has seven bays, and contains a tetrastyle prostyle Doric portico.  Inside, the south central ground floor room retains decoration from 1744, while the sitting room, bedroom above, and east staircase, all have decoration of 1792.\nThe gateway to the hall\nThe gateway to the hall consists of a stone arch crossing the drive.  It is made from fragments of a medieval chapel, and has a four-centred arch with two orders.  Above the arch is a small window, and low walls extend to the south.  It is a grade II listed building.\nNext to the house is a grade II listed water tower, dating from the late 19th century.  The tower is built of stone, with a square plan and three stages.  It contains quoins, bands, a cornice, and a parapet with ball finials on the corners.  In the ground floor are two open round-arched openings with architraves and piers.  The top stage contains a clock face on each side, all in oculi with keystones.\nSee also\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\nListed buildings in Gilling with Hartforth and Sedbury",

It is a community choice aggregation authority, purchasing power on behalf of ratepayers, while Southern California Edison operates local transmission infrastructure and billing.\nIt currently procures renewable electricity from solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass sources, and non-renewable energy from nuclear and fossil gas sources. Three energy rates are provided, \"100% Renewable\", \"Smart Choice\" at 72% renewable, and \"Basic Choice\" at 44% renewable.\nHistory\nIn 2019, the Irvine City Council voted unanimously to consider forming a CCE authority with other cities. In 2021, Irvine approved the creation of the Orange County Power Authority. In 2022, Irvine and Buena Park approved the default use of 100% renewable energy for their ratepayers, while Fullerton selected 70%. Service began for commercial customers in April 2022 and residential customers in October 2022.\nIn February 2023, the California State Auditor conducted an audit, highlighting lack of board oversight and qualified staff, and the loss of customers, and poor administrative processes. 3 other audits were conducted with similar results. In April 2023, the board of the power authority fired CEO Brian Probolsky in a split vote after audits found Probolsky approved $1.8 million in contracts without board approval. In May 2023, Huntington Beach voted to withdraw from the OC Power Authority, which was completed on July 1, 2024.\nThe Power Authority completed its improvement plan following the recommendations, which included improving transparency and oversight, along with the hiring of more qualified personnel for power procurement and administration. It also improved processes for reviewing contracting proposals to ensure fair bidding and track project completion.\n",
    "Taiwanese journalist (born 1945)\nFrank Wu Feng-shan (Chinese: \u5433\u8c50\u5c71; born 24 January 1945) is a Taiwanese journalist and politician. Wu worked for the Independence Evening Post between 1968 and 1994, then led the Public Television Service from 1998 to 2004. He was twice elected to the National Assembly and was a member of the Central Election Commission before serving as a minister without portfolio within the Executive Yuan from 2006 to 2007. Wu sat on the Control Yuan from 2008 to 2014, and was named chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation in 2024.\nMedia career\nWu worked for the Independence Evening Post from 1968 to 1994, serving successively as chief editor, then president, of the publication. During his tenure with the paper, Wu helped arrange the 1982 visit of Aleksander Solzhenitsyn to Taiwan. Shortly after the end of martial law in Taiwan in 1987, Wu sent Hsu Lu and Lee Yung-te to China. The pair became the first Taiwanese journalists to visit China. Between 1998 and 2004, Wu chaired the Public Television Service, and was succeeded by legal scholar Louis Chen. During the 2004 Taiwanese presidential election, Wu was the moderator for a series of debates between candidates Chen Shui-bian and Lien Chan. These were the first presidential debates in Taiwanese history in which all candidates agreed to participate. During the first free and direct election for president in 1996, incumbent Lee Teng-hui did not partake, and, in 2000, the field of candidates could not agree to debate terms, resulting in a televised series of policy presentations for each set of running mates.\nPolitical career\nNational Assembly and Executive Yuan\nWu served on the National Assembly from 1973 to 1981, and 1987 to 1993. In 2000, Wu proposed the \"three acknowledgements\" and \"four suggestions\" while he was a member of a task force convened to reach a consensus on the One-China policy. Wu was named to a second task force in 2004, convened to advise on the peaceful development of cross-strait relations. Additionally, Wu served on the Central Election Commission during the 2004 election cycle, and resigned the position in April of that year. He then joined the first cabinet led by Su Tseng-chang as a minister without portfolio.\nControl Yuan\nIn 2008, Wu relinquished an Australian visa to accept a nomination to the Control Yuan. While serving on the Control Yuan, Wu led investigations into the construction of an airstrip on Taiping Island, a development project near the Zhaoping railway station, and the selection of Public Television Service board members. He supported a 2009 Control Yuan motion against the Department of Health, after restaurants were found to be using the same cooking oil for a week.\nIn October 2013, Wu aided a Control Yuan investigation into the September 2013 power struggle, former justice minister Tseng Yung-fu, and prosecutor-general Huang Shih-ming, which also later affected Taiwan High Prosecutors\u2019 Office head prosecutor Chen Shou-huang. In January 2014, an impeachment measure against Huang and supported by Wu was split 6\u20136.\nAfter his six-year tenure ended, Wu was not renominated for a second term.\nStraits Exchange Foundation\nIn October 2024, Wu was appointed chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation. On 4 November 2024, he formally succeeded acting chair Rock Hsu\u00a0, who had served since the resignation of Cheng Wen-tsan in July 2024.\n",

    "\nNizam al-Din Ahmad al-Husayni (Arabic: \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a: 7 July 1618 \u2013 May 1674) was the prime minister of the Sultanate of Golconda from 1656 to 1672.\nBorn to a sayyid family (descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad) in Taif in the Arabian Peninsula, his lineage traced back to prominent scholars and Safavid royalty in Iran. Educated in fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), hadith, Arabic and logic, he married the daughter of a distinguished Meccan jurist and later a daughter of Abdullah Qutb Shah (r.\u20091626\u20131672), the ruler of the Golconda. This second marriage facilitated his rise to prominence, and in 1656 he was appointed prime minister of Golconda. Following Abdullah Qutb Shah's death in 1672, Nizam al-Din Ahmad's influence waned, leading to his imprisonment and eventual death, likely by poisoning.\nBackground and early life\nHe belonged to a sayyid family (descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad) who had long settled in Iran. He was descended from the religious scholar and landowner Sadr ad-Din Dashtaki (died 1498), who finanically supported the Islamic school Mansuriyya Madrasa in the Iranian city of Shiraz. Nizam al-Din Ahmad's great-grandfather Ibrahim ibn Salam Allah (died 1582/83) had married the Safavid princess Gawhar Shad Begum, the daughter of Ibrahim Mirza. A global network was established by the offspring of this union. Nizam al-Din Ahmad's father Muhammad Ma'sum (died 1622/23) and uncle Nasir al-Din (died 1614/15) left the country for Taif and Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula, while another branch of the family stayed in the Iranian region of Fars. Surviving archival evidence, including letters and legal papers, demonstrate that Nizam al-Din Ahmad knew and used Persian, despite appearing to have written poetry only in Arabic.\nNizam al-Din Ahmad was born on 7 July 1618 in Taif. He was taught a variety of subjects, including fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), hadith, Arabic and logic. He reportedly had a great memory that enhanced his capacity to convey knowledge. He married the daughter of the distinguished Meccan jurist and merchant Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Manufi (died 1634/35), who had been supported by the Ottoman sultan Murad IV (r.\u20091623\u20131640).\nCareer in the Sultanate of Golconda\nIn the 17th-century, an area of exchange emerged among the polities of the western Indian Ocean, where mass migration was fueled by the interaction of religion, trade, and state-building. Journeys between the Arabian Peninsula, Iran, and India became routine during this period. Since the start of the 17th-century, the Sultanate of Golconda was also home to immigrant Arabic scholars from Iran and the Arabian Peninsula. Upon reaching the Deccan Plateau in 1645/6, Nizam al-Din Ahmad married a second wife, a daughter of Abdullah Qutb Shah (r.\u20091626\u20131672), the sultan of the Sultanate of Golconda.\nThe marriage paved the way for Nizam al-Din Ahmad's ascent to prominence, which in turn led to his patronage of Arabic literary culture. When the prime minister Muhammad Sa'id Ardistani shifted allegiance to the Mughal Empire (India's leading power at the time) in 1656, Nizam al-Din Ahmad further solidified his authority, being appointed as the prime minister the same year. At the Golconda court, Nizam al-Din Ahmad became a leading figure, alongside Hayat Bakhshi Baygum (died 1667), the mother and regent of Abdullah Qutb Shah. Elevated to the role of \u02bfAyn al-Mulk (\"Eye of the Kingdom\"), his authority allegedly surpassed that of the other ministers.\nAccording to reports from Golconda's capital Hyderabad, he also had the role of a gatekeeper, introducing foreign merchants to the sultan. The Golconda citadel, the seat of government and home of the ruling dynasty, served as the residence of Nizam al-Din Ahmad for a period. In 1658/59, he had a palace built for him in Hyderabad. Following Abdullah Qutb Shah's death in 1672 and the struggle for succession, Nizam al-Din Ahmad's authority diminished. He was subsequently imprisoned by Sayyid Muzaffar, a military commander who had immigrated from Iran. Nizam al-Din Ahmad was killed in May 1674, likely due to poisoning.\nNizam al-Din Ahmad made an effort to exploit his position of power in Golconda to increase his family's political and financial ties to the states bordering the Arabian Sea. During the zenith of his power, he was in contact with Khalifeh Soltan and Mirza Mohammad Karaki, two of the leading religious statesmen in Safavid Iran. Several petitions were submitted by him, claiming ownership of landed property in Iran.\n",

Texts of Samsu-iluna indicate R\u00eem-Anum was captured but are uncertain about whether he was put to death or spared. The beginning of the reign of R\u00eem-Anum is generally taken as being the 8th regnal year of Samsu-iluna (c. 1742 BC), in the eighth month. Within a few years Uruk was back under the control of Babylon. While it \nis traditionally assumed that R\u00eem-Anum ruled from Uruk, at least part of the\ntime, it has also been proposed that he ruled from Malgium.\nMany tablets of R\u00eem-Anum were found at the temple of S\u00een-k\u0101\u0161id during excavations at Uruk and are now held in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad and in Heidelberg. A number of R\u00eem-Anum texts, illegally excavated, came, via the antiquities market, from the \"house of the prisoners of war\" (b\u012bt as\u012br\u012b) at Uruk, many of which are held at the British Museum. Prisoners came from a number of cities including Eshnunna, Akkad, Malgium, N\u0113rebtum, and Mutiabal. Many were dispersed to gods (the priests and temples thereof) such as An-Inanna, Kanisura, Ramm\u0101num, \u0160ama\u0161, Lugal\u2019irra and Meslamtaea. Others were put to work in a flour milling operation.\nThe seals of some of R\u00eem-Anum's servants have been found on tablets. One, found on a number of texts, \"Nabi-il\u012b\u0161u,  archivist, son of Lakita-remeni, servant of R\u00eem-Anum.\" includes the name of Nabi-il\u012b\u0161u, the same as that proposed as the successor of R\u00eem-Anum.\nMesopotamia at the time of Samsu-iluna\nFour year names of R\u00eem-Anum are known, their order, and whether one is a duplicate,  is uncertain:\nYear R\u00eem-Anum (became) king\nYear in which R\u00eem-Anum the king defeated the land of Emutbal, the troops of Esznunna, Isin and Kazallu who marched together against him to make booty ... which was not counted since ancient times ... and defeated them\nYear R\u00eem-Anum the king, the eternal name of his lordship\nYear (R\u00eem-Anum the king) put in order his dispersed people\nAnother version of the 2nd year name has become available:\n\"The year in which King R\u00eem-Anum, the (forces of) the land of Emut-balum, the armies of Eshnunna, Isin and lu, as if all together\n(with him), presented themselves a for war. , since time immemorial, had never experienced (such) a dust storm (raised by a foreign army), \u2026 by his power he inflicted defeat upon them (\u2026)\"\nSee also\nList of Mesopotamian dynasties\nChronology of the ancient Near East",

    "City District of Brno in South Moravian Region, Czech Republic\nBrno-Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec is a city district of Brno, Czech Republic, located on the southwestern edge of the city. It consists of most of the cadastral territory of Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec (German: Alt Leskau, lit. 'Old L\u00edskovec'), which has all of the city district's population, along with a small part of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec (German: Neu Leskau), originally the municipality of L\u00edskovec (German: Leskau), which was annexed to Brno in 1919. The total area is 3.28\u00a0km2. The city district was established on November 24, 1990. Over 12,000 people live here.\nFor the purposes of the senate elections, Brno-Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec is included in electoral district number 59 of Brno-City District.\nHistory\nIn 2020, an archaeological survey of another part of the settlement took place here, which preceded the construction of the tram line to the faculty hospital in Brno. The edge of this settlement was found near it and in it the remains of two houses and between them construction pits, from where clay was taken for plastering the walls. Settlement pits and storage pits were also found, as well as various objects, such as ceramic fragments, remains of various tools or fragments of animal bones. Signs of fire were also found in the house made of wattle and daub.\nThe first mention of the village of L\u00edskovec dates back to 1314. The village was formed by the core of the current urban district, the still existing original village development in the vicinity of Klob\u00e1sova street. The municipality of L\u00edskovec became a part of Brno on April 16, 1919.\nIn 1972, panel construction was started in Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec. In contrast to the neighboring Bohunice, it was carried out much more sensitively in Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec, because it did not affect the original infrastructure in any way. The overlap of the Bohunice part of the built housing estate on the-then Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec cadastral territory became the reason for a significant change of the border between Bohunice and Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec, carried out at the end of the 1970s. The current city district of Brno-Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec was established on November 24, 1990.\nFurther changes to the cadastral boundaries of Star\u00fd Liskovec took place in 2002 and 2011. First, on February 28, 2002, a minor change to the border with Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec at the northern edge of the road in Jihlavsk\u00e1 street came into force, when 23 m2, located under the southern part of the building with the Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec reference number 441, passed to Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec. On February 17, 2011, it entered another border change between Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec and Bohunice came into force, this time at the intersection of Osov\u00e1 and Jihlavsk\u00e1 streets, when 4221 m2 passed from Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec to Bohunice, while 3609 m2 went from Bohunice to Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec.\nTo another minor change in the administrative boundary of Brno-Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec and Brno-Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec in 2012, when the marginal part of the Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec cadastral territory was transferred to the territory of the Brno-Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec district, which in turn transferred a small marginal part of the Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec cadastral territory.\nDescription\nThe residential development of Brno-Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec consists mainly of panel houses built at the end of the 1970s to the north and west of the village houses of the original municipality. From the development of the Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec cadastral territory, only the eastern part of the gas station in B\u00edte\u0161sk\u00e1 Street, together with the multi-lane road in this street, belong here. There is also a swimming pool, as well as and sports club Tatran Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec in the district. The cinema is no longer in operation, the building now houses sports facilities under the management of the workers' physical education unit, and a restaurant has recently opened in the building.\nThe area of the Bohunice faculty hospital, including the central high-rise main building, extends into the northernmost part of Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec. In the years 2007\u20132008, west of it, initially free land was built up. First, in 2007, the new building of the Moravian Land Archives was built here, and at the end of 2008, the new Campus Square shopping center was opened here, but it also extends into the neighboring district of Brno-Bohunice.\nThe Roman Catholic church of St. Jan Nepomuck\u00fd, which was built in 1923\u20131925. A short distance below the church, directly opposite the school building, was the local cemetery. It was abolished in the 1970s.\nTerritorial divisions\nThe cadastral territory of Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec is further divided into 6 basic settlement units, while the part of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec in this district is divided into 1, marked in italics.\nDemographics\nTransport\nThe connection with the rest of the city is provided by the Brno transport company via tram lines no. 6 and 7 running from the Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec loop to Kr\u00e1lovo Pole, the railway station from \u010cern\u00e1 Pole to Zem\u011bd\u011blsk\u00e1, or line no. 8, which provides a connection between the Bohunice faculty hospital and L\u00ed\u0161e\u0148, further using trolleybus ",

The museum stands as a prominent example of Syria's rich heritage and is recognized for its architecture, crafted from local black basalt, which reflects the area's volcanic nature. The surrounding gardens act as an open-air museum, featuring additional archaeological elements.\nHistory\nThe origins of the museum date back to 1923-1925 when the collection began in an outdoor display on the southern side of the current government seat building. Initially, the collection was modest, but over the years, it expanded as local people from Jabal al-Arab contributed basalt sculptures and archaeological discoveries. Significant items were also moved to the museum after the discovery of ancient mosaics in nearby Shahba.\nDuring the French Mandate, the museum was housed in a cinema hall adjacent to the government building, until the need arose for a dedicated space. In 1990, a new building for the museum was inaugurated.\nArchitecture and Design\nThe museum covers a total area of 4,650 m2, including a basement and two floors. Its exterior is clad in local basalt stone, which complements the volcanic nature of the region. The museum's central hall is illuminated naturally by a fiberglass dome. Surrounding the building, the garden space of 3,650 m2 forms a complementary outdoor museum.\nCollection\nThe museum's collection consists primarily of basalt stone sculptures, ancient stone tools, mosaics, pottery, glassware, jewelry, and coins dating back to the Nabataean, Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic periods. A highlight of the museum is its collection of mosaics depicting mythological Greek scenes, as well as its gold, bronze, and copper coin collections.\nSee also\nList of museums in Syria",

    "Tusuubira Ibrahim Lubega (1970 \u2013 May 6, 2023), also known as Jajja Iculi or Isma Olaxess, was a Ugandan vlogger, a social media influencer and a music critic who served as president of Uganda Bloggers Association until his death in May, 2023. He came to be known for his plain-spokenness and candor communication style. His fully-televised funeral followed his public expressions of support, a day after the demise of Ugandan Minister Charles Engola, who was shot by his own bodyguard William Sabiiti, with bodyguard's action reportedly motivated by the Minister's silence over government's human rights violation.\nCareer & influence\nAs a youth, Tusuubira's main job was initially house painting but he later transitioned to influence peddling and music criticism. In 2005, he migrated to Sweden's capital Stockholm, where he later began his blogging career in 2014. A year after (2015), he returned to his home country, Uganda. However, he rose to fame in 2020, when he began actively campaigning for Uganda's ruling party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM). His influence grew when he became president of the Uganda Bloggers Association. Every morning at around 7 a.m., he consistently inspired his audience with live videos on Facebook while sharing his thoughts on various topics which among others included: politics, entertainment and social lifestyles. Through his work, he expanded his reach and engagement with more celebrities.\nPersonal life\nIsma Olaxess was a Muslim of the Tabligh faction. He was approximately 5.7 feet in height. In his daily routine, he chose to keep most aspects private, for example, he had multiple wives although he rarely spoke about them publicly. One of the few personal details he shared was about his infertility when he openly announced that he was informed by doctors about his \u201cinability to have children\u201d. His father, Hajji Muhammad Kasajja, who came out to confirm this, was a significant figure in his life \u2014 supporting him through various challenges and achievements. The father also noted that Olaxess was a humatarian, who always prioritized other people's well-being other than his personal desires and interests.\nNet worth\nTusuubira's financial journey was dynamic. He was estimated to have a net worth of about 113 million Uganda shillings. During his tenure as Chairperson of the Uganda Bloggers Association, a position that he held from August 8, 2021, he earned a monthly payment of 7 million Uganda shillings (approximately US$2,000). Many people believed this role, that he won with 83% of the total votes, would amplify his voice and reach within the community of bloggers and content creators from the East African country, and his expertise would enable him help them recover some suspended platforms. He proclaimed himself holder of this position through a self-administered oath, later disclosing his motivation to sustain the devotion of his fan base.\nControversies\nIchuli faced numerous contentious issues throughout his career. On October 4, 2017, when a Ugandan producer Danz Ku Mapeesa was succumbed to head injuries that led to his death, Isma was linked to this event hence some influential figures came out to request for his arrest \u2014 following his comments. In the aftermath, he also came out and clarified never to have confessed to Danz's death.\nIn 2020, while campaigning for NRM, a ruling party led by one of the world's longest serving presidents, Yoweri Museveni, Isma's passport was revoked when the opposition wrote to Swedish embassy for his support to some acts of oppression. Despite these challenges, he remained consistent in expressing his views and continuing his work.\nIsma Olaxess on November 21, 2021, like many outspoken individuals, was remanded at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) headquarters in Kibuli, Kampala, along with three journalists for using offensive language and inciting violence. However, on November 25, 2021, just after four days, he was charged and finally granted bail.\nOn March 23, 2022, Spamania, a wellness center in Uganda, terminated its ambassadorial contract with Jajja Iculi. This decision was precipitated by his public statements, made during a Facebook Live video, endorsing a school's exclusion of Solomon Kampala, son of opposition leader Bobi Wine, from school leadership opportunities. The exclusion was reportedly motivated by government influence.\nDeath\nWearing a Lakers jersey, Tusuubira's life was cut short at 9:20 p.m.; Saturday, May 6, 2023 when he was shot dead while nearing his home's gateway in Kyanja, a suburb in Kampala. The unmasked killer, who used a motorbike to vacate soon after the incident, waited for 2 hours to ensure the act was completed \u2014 firing eight bullets into his upper body and head. These found him on a passenger seat in his Toyota HiAce drone, UBK 213D, that was earlier gifted to him by a Ugandan businessman, Hamis Kiggundu.\nAccording to a BBC News reporter, his discussions on diverse sensitive topics made it hard to tr",

    "Outdoors bathing area in Oxford\nTumbling Bay, also known as Tum, is an outdoors bathing area in Oxford, England. Fed by the River Thames, the bathing spot opened in 1853 and closed formally in 1990. Subsequently, it has been known as a wild swimming location.\nDescription\nThe Tumbling Bay bathing area is formed of two constructed concrete bathing areas, with steps, fed by the River Thames via the Bulstake Stream. Weirs at either end enable the water level to remain stable. Access to the bathing area is either via the Thames itself, or by a path from Botley Park. Downstream the waterway feeds into the Isis. It is also known locally as \"Tum\".\nHistory\nTumbling Bay was the second, after Fiddler's Island near Port Meadow, public bathing space in Oxford to be authorised by the County Council. It opened in 1853, originally for men only, and was extended in 1866. Facilities included a changing room and toilets. In 1881 John Salter, in his book The River Thames: A Guide, stated the Tum was a \"fine public bathing place\". Its' most popular year was 1947, when 86,000 people visited the bathing spot. Archaeological investigations, conducted in 2019 in preparation for a fish ladder, identified 16 structures on the site.  These included locker room and toilet facilities, a guard house, and toll house and ferry house to the east for crossing the River Thames.\nTumbling Bay was closed officially in 1990, though swimmers often used it subsequently, and the concrete pools and the foundations of the changing rooms remained. In 2021, due to the ongoing collapse of the northern concrete bank, the area was closed off to the public due to health and safety concerns. In 2022 the Tumbling Bay Preservation Society was formed.\nIncidents\nA 17-year-old youth died while bathing in Tumbling Bay in June 1895. In 2007 the body of a 15-year-old boy was found at Tumbling Bay, after falling into the River Thames in Port Meadow. In 2010 a 29-year-old man, Daniel Lewis, died while swimming at the spot.\nSee also\nParson's Pleasure\nDame's Delight\nBotley Road",
    "\nMirza Fattah Khan Garmrudi (Persian: \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u0641\u062a\u0627\u062d \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u06af\u0631\u0645\u200c\u0631\u0648\u062f\u06cc; c.\u20091786 \u2013 1848) was a scribe and author in Qajar Iran, mainly known for his travelogue about his diplomatic missions to Europe, entitled Chaharfasl.\nBiography\nHe was born in c.\u20091786 in the Kasalan village near the city of Tabriz. He belonged to a family of clerics, and his father was against his entry into government service, where he served in Mianeh as an accountant. Garmrudi was eventually moved to Tabriz, where he benefited from the support of Mirza Masud Khan Ansari and subsequently the crown prince Abbas Mirza. After the Russians conquered Tabriz at the end of the Russo-Iranian War of 1826\u20131828, Garmrudi, as part of Abbas Mirza's staff, was sent to negotiate with the Russian general Ivan Paskevich. He was also involved in the negotiations at Dehkvaraqan and Torkamanchay, which cemented Iran's defeat. In 1834, when Mohammad Shah Qajar ascended the throne, Garmrudi was called to Tehran and made lashkar-nevis (chief clerk) of the army.\nIn 1838, following a dispute with England over the Herat and other issues, an Iranian delegation headed by Hossein Khan Ajudanbashi was dispatched to the European courts. Garmrudi was included in this mission, likely due to the support of Mirza Masud Khan Ansari, who served as the minister of foreign affairs during this period. Garmrudi's notability primarily stems from his travelogue of the journey, entitled Chaharfasl. The Ottoman Empire, Austria, France, and England are the nations that they traveled through, and each is covered separately in the book's four chapters. The Chaharfasl is regarded as an important record that documents early Iranian views on Europe as well as the activities of the Iranian mission.\nGarmrudi's Shabnama, a defamatory tale accusing the British of sexual depravity and debauchery, was another work created due to his travels throughout Europe. The book was possibly meant as a counter to the The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan by James Justinian Morier, which portrayed a negative image of Iranians. When the Iranian delegation went back in 1840 to Iran, Garmrudi stayed in retinue of Hossein Khan. The latter was given the governorship of Yazd shortly after their return, and in 1844, he was made governor of Fars. Hossein Khan demonstrated his trust in Gamrudi by entrusting him with the administration of the Kohgiluyeh and Mamasani. The tribes of the region, along with their genealogies and histories, are recorded in Garmrudi's Safarnama-ye Mamasani.\nGarmrudi died in 1848 at Behbahan, and was buried in Shiraz.\n",

    "Albert Methfessel, founder of the choir\nHamburger Liedertafel is a choir in Hamburg, Germany, founded in 1823. The choir is one of the three oldest associations in Hamburg, and is entitled to have the city's coat of arms as its emblem.\nHistory\nThe choir was founded on 19 April 1823 by Albert Methfessel, who earlier in that year had organized the musical programme for the tenth anniversary festival in Hamburg of the Hanseatic Legion. It was the first men's choir in the city. The first \"Liedertafel\" had been the Berliner Liedertafel, founded in 1808, followed by others in Germany and Austria; it was a group of men who regularly met to socialize and sing.\nThe choir took part in important events in the city, and organized charity concerts. On 5 October 1841 the choir premiered the Deutschlandlied by Hoffmann von Fallersleben, which became the German national anthem. After the Great fire of Hamburg in 1842, the choir collected donations for victims, and later sang at the laying of the foundation stone of Hamburg City Hall.\nPresent day\nThe choir has a varied repertoire, performing traditional and modern songs. It remains socially committed, and gives concerts in churches, local festivals, hospitals and retirement homes. Hamburger Liedertafel remained a men's choir until recently: a ladies' choir was formed in Hamburg in October 2023, and became part of the Liedertafel in June 2024.\n",

    "British researcher\nKenneth George Budden was a British physicist with a research focus in plasma physics, best known for the publication of several textbooks on radio waves in the ionosphere. Budden was one of the first pioneers in computational physics, using EDSAC to find solutions of the Appleton\u2013Hartree equation. He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1999.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nKenneth George Budden was born on 23 June 1915 in Portsmouth to George Easthope Budden and Hannah Gertrude Homer Rea. His father and grandfather had a naval background, and his mother was a pianist. In 1923, the family moved to Barrow-in-Furness, and returned to Portsmouth in 1926. Kenneth attended Portsmouth Grammar School. Kenneth went on to study Natural Sciences at St John's College, Cambridge in 1933, studying under scientists including G.F.C. Searle, John Cockcroft,Philip Ivor Dee,Charles Drummond Ellis and Mark Oliphant. He graduated with First Class honours in 1936, and moved on to a PhD working in the radio research group under J. A. Ratcliffe alongside Maurice Wilkes. Budden completed his thesis in 1939 or 1940.\nThe Second World War\nOn the outbreak of war, Budden was released from his upcoming job working for the British Coal Utilisation Research Association and joined the Air Ministry working on the development of radar, where he did the early research on heightfinding that would lead to Height finder radars and improve Ground-controlled interception. From 1941 to 1944 Budden was posted in Washington D.C. to assist with the development of radar in the United States. From 1944 Budden was posted to Kandy in Sri Lanka as the Director of Communications Development representative in South East Asia, with an honorary position as Squadron Leader in the Royal Air Force. Budden left service in 1945.\nScientific career\nAfter the war, Budden joined a coal company called Delanium Ltd. as Director of Research, but left in 1947. He rejoined the University of Cambridge as a demonstrator, where he taught Abdus Salam. He became a fellow of St. John's College in 1947.\nBudden moved towards more theoretical research. He was one of the early users of EDSAC, using computation to solve ionospheric problems (in particular the Appleton\u2013Hartree equation), and was one of the first pioneers of computational physics. In 1957, he briefly worked at National Institute of Standards and Technology during a sabbatical. In the 1950s, Budden worked with computer scientist David W. Barron on early computing problems, and also worked with Jenifer Haselgrove on ray tracing in a cold plasma under a magnetic field, which he would expand upon into \"complex ray tracing\", using imaginary numbers in calculation. In 1961, Budden published his first major textbooks, Radio Waves in the Ionosphere and The Wave-guide mode theory of wave propagation. He worked at the Defence Research Telecommunications Establishment in 1963. In 1965, Budden was promoted to Reader in Physics.\nDuring his career, Budden worked mostly in magnetoionic theory, in which he contributed extensively. In 1993, Budden received the IEEE Heinrich Hertz Medal for \" for major original contributions to the theory of electromagnetic waves in ionized media with applications to terrestrial and space communications.\" He worked mostly at the Cavendish Laboratory for the majority of his career.\nBudden retired in September 1982. In 1985, he published his textbook The propagation of radio waves. He received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1999, with the citation mentioning his work on the propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere and his theory on the conversion of energy between different wave modes in a non-uniform magnetised plasma.\nPersonal life\nBudden married Nicolette Longsdon in 1947. The couple had no children. Budden was a devout Christian, and enjoyed gardening and beekeeping. Budden was a supporter of Portsmouth Football Club. He died on 4 September 2005 with Parkinson's disease.\nAwards\nFellow of the Royal Society (1966)\nHonorary doctorate, University of D\u00fcsseldorf (1985)\nIEEE Heinrich Hertz Medal (1993)\nGold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1999)\nBibliography\nRadio Waves in the Ionosphere (1961)\nThe Wave-guide mode theory of wave propagation (1961)\nLectures on magnetoionic theory (1964)\nThe propagation of radio waves (1985)",

    "Manx researcher\nKenneth Midworth Creer (1925\u20132020) was a British and Manx geophysicist who was the head of the geophysics department at the University of Edinburgh. He was the president of the European Geophysical Society from 1992 to 1994 and won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1996 among other accolades. Creer was an early pioneer of the theory of paleomagnetism, and was instrumental in producing the first paleomagnetic surveys and the first polar wandering curve.\nBiography\nEarly life and military service\nKenneth Midworth Creer was born in Douglas, Isle of Man in 1925. He went to Douglas High School. In 1944, immediately after leaving high school, Creer entered military service, becoming a 2nd lieutenant in the King's Regiment in June 1945. He would go on to serve in the Royal West African Frontier Force (1945\u201346) as well as the High Commission Territories Corps in Egypt (1946\u201347).\nScientific career\nFrom 1948 to 1951 Creer studied at Queens' College, Cambridge. He would go on to complete an MSc (1953) and PhD (1955) at Cambridge as well. From 1954 Creer worked for HM Geological Survey as a senior geologist. in 1956 Creer was given a lectureship at Newcastle University, and in 1963 he was appointed as Reader of Geophysics. In 1966 Creer was given professorship. During his time at Newcastle, Creer was the supervisor of Subir Kumar Banerjee. From 1971 to 1972 Creer was a visiting professor at Columbia University. In 1973, Creer was appointed head of the geophysics department at the University of Edinburgh, and held the role until his retirement in 1993.\nIn his early career, Creer worked mainly on demagnetisation in a laboratory setting. At Newcastle, he showed that for Iron oxide minerals, the direction of the secular variation of the Earth's magnetic field could be deduced from the residual magnetisation. Creer was a supporter of the Expanding Earth theory and applying cosmology to geological problems, publishing a paper in 1965 entitled \"Tracking the Earth\u2019s Continents\", in which he suggested that the Earth could be expanding at the same rate as the Hubble constant, and that the gravitational constant could be weakening on a universal scale.\nDuring his scientific career, Creer was given credit for some of the earliest paleomagnetic surveys, conducting surveys of the Palaeozoic in Great Britain and the Phanerozoic in South America. He also produced the first polar wandering curve (for Great Britain) along with Edward A. Irving and Keith Runcorn, and was a pioneer of making continental reconstructions from plate tectonics using solely paleomagnetism.\nIn later life, Creer worked on the paleomagnetism of sedimentary basins.\nFrom 1994 to 1995, he was a visiting professor at the University of Wisconsin. Creer died on the 19th August 2020.\nLeadership roles\nCreer was the vice president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1986 to 1987. He became the President of the European Geophysical Society from 1992 to 1994. Creer was instrumental in the merging of several journals to form the Geophysical Journal International, and was the last editor of the Geophysics Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society. He founded the UK Geophysical Assembly in 1977, a now inactive conference aimed at early career scientists.\nAwards\nCreer received fellowships of the Academia Europaea, the American Geophysical Union and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He received a Prix mondial Nessim Habif for Science from the University of Geneva in 1987, the John Adam Fleming Medal from the American Geophysical Union in 1990, and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1996.\n",

    "\nThe building, in 2010\nGillingwood Hall is a historic building in Gilling West, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe first Gillingwood Hall was a country house, built by the Wharton family in the early 17th century.  It was partly rebuilt in the mid 18th century, possibly to the designs of Daniel Garrett.  The house burned down in 1750, although various outbuildings survived.  In about 1800, a farmhouse was built on the site, also named \"Gillingwood Hall\".  The farmhouse was grade II listed in 1969.\nThe farmhouse is built of stone, with a T-shaped plan.  The main block has two storeys, three bays, and a stone slate roof with stone coping.  It has a sill band, and in the centre is a re-used doorcase with an architrave and a fanlight, over which is a blank panel, and a pediment on consoles, and in the upper floor are sash windows.  To the right is a lower two-storey bay that has a pantile roof with stone slates at the eaves.  Further to the right is a single-storey bay, and at the rear is a wing on the right.\nThe front doorway of the old hall survives, set into a wall.  It has a rounded arch, and an archivolt rising from capitals.

    "Mexican paramilitary group involved in suppressing the 1968 Student Movement\nMilitary unit\nThe Batall\u00f3n Olimpia was a counterinsurgent paramilitary group created by the Mexican government to surveil, spy on, pursue, sabotage, execute, murder, and disappear members of Mexican Movement of 1968 and to infiltrate the movement itself.\nBackground\nThe battalion was under the command of general Luis Guti\u00e9rrez Oropeza and consisted of elements from the Estado Mayor Presidencial and Direcci\u00f3n Federal de Seguridad, the Polic\u00eda Judicial Federal (Federal Judicial Police), the Polic\u00eda Judicial del Distrito Federal (Mexico City Federal Judicial Police), and the Inspecci\u00f3n Fiscal Federal (Federal Tax Inspection). It is estimated to have had around 1,500 to 2,000 members.\nThe Batall\u00f3n Olimpia took an active part in various moments of the 1968 Movement, including:\nThe Occupation of the UNAM Ciudad Universitaria on September 18, 1968\nThe occupation of Casco de Santo Tom\u00e1s, an Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional campus, on September 23, 1968\nOperaci\u00f3n Galeana on October 2, 1968 in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco, Mexico City\nBecause members of the battalion were undercover soldiers and police officers dressed in civilian clothes, they identified each other through white handkerchiefs or gloves. The battalion played an active part in these events, orchestrating a simulated confrontation near the armed student movement and the Mexican military. To that effect, the battalion had, in addition to its members mobilized throughout the plaza and neighboring buildings, snipers posted beginning the morning of October 2 in the plaza and the surrounding area. In addition to these armed actions, there is a record of the battalion allegedly performing illegal detentions, abuse, torture, and raids of people's homes.\nThe night of October 2, 1968, the Batall\u00f3n Olimpia had orders to fire on both the students and the soldiers to confuse the situation and make the army fire on the students. They infiltrated the protest until it arrived on the third floor of the Chihuahua building. The army arrested some of the battalion's members who were later freed on presidential orders. The order to fire against the army and the protesters came from Secretary of the Interior Luis Echevarr\u00eda \u00c1lvarez. Responsibility for this event is divided between Luis Guti\u00e9rrez Oropeza and President Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz, but the person who was truly responsible was Luis Echevarr\u00eda \u00c1lvarez.\nIn 1971, the group became active again, now under the direction of Luis Echevarr\u00eda \u00c1lvarez, who became president of Mexico in 1970. This new attack was known as El Halconazo (The Falcon Strike). It occurred on June 10, 1971 when the paramilitary group the Halcones killed 120 people who were protesting in support of the Monterrey students.\nCultural References\nFilms\nThe movie Rojo Amanecer (1989), in which members of the Batall\u00f3n Olimpia appear at the end of the movie.\nThe channel 6 documentary Batall\u00f3n Olimpia, which aired July 6, 1999.\nThe movie Olimpia (2019) references the group in a scene in which the Tlatelolco Massacre is happening and a soldier gives one of the main characters' fathers a white glove to put on his son so that he will not be a target.\nLiterature\nThe poem 'Las voces de Tlatelolco (1968) by Jos\u00e9 Emilio Pacheco",
    "Studies of a genus of palaeothere\nPhotograph of a P. crassum skull, 1917\nThe anatomy of Palaeotherium has been historically well-studied due to at least several of its species being known from common and good fossil material. As the type genus of the Palaeotheriidae, one of two families within the Equoidea, it shares common traits such as orbits that are wide in its back plus located in the skull's midlength, long nasal bones, selenodont form molars, and the presence of diastemata between the canine and other teeth between it. Palaeotherium itself differs from other palaeotheres primarily based on various cranial and dental traits; the subgenus Palaeotherium is likewise distinguished from the other subgenus Franzenitherium based on specialized and specific cranial traits. While not as often studied, Palaeotherium is also known by viable limb bone material, leading to the locomotion of different species being hypothesized. P. magnum, unlike other species, is known by complete skeletal material such as that from Mormoiron in France that is informative about its overall anatomy, sharing similar and different traits from equines and other perissodactyls.\nSkull\nIllustrations of the craniums of P. medium (left) and P. crassum (right) with labeled cranial and dental portions, 1878\nThe Palaeotheriidae is diagnosed in part as generally having orbits that are wide open in the back area and are located in the middle of the skull or in a slight frontal area of it. The nasal bones are slightly extensive to very extensive in depth. Palaeotherium is characterized as having calvaria that range in base length from 150\u00a0mm (5.9\u00a0in) to 520\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) depending on the species. The pterygoid crest, which is located on the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone, does not cover the optic foramen, which is separated from other cranial cavities at the temporal fossa. The zygomatic process of the squamosal bone is elongated and extends to the maxilla at a back angle of the orbit. The genus is also diagnosed by the presence of an anastomosis (anatomical connection between two passageways) roughly at the sphenoid bone and prominent temporalis muscle developments.\nPalaeotherium spp. skulls, National Museum of Natural History, France. Clockwise from upper left: P. medium, P. curtum, P. magnum, and P. crassum.\nAccording to Remy, the subgenus Palaeotherium is the more specialized one of the two, characterized by the orbit being located more in front of the skull's middle length. The optic foramen is separated by a bony wall, and there are two optic canals in total. The cranium is constricted in its front area behind the postorbital processes and close to the suture for the frontal bone and parietal bone. The other subgenus Franzenitherium in comparison has more generalized skull traits, its orbit being aligned within the middle length of the head. It has a front constriction of the cranium near the postorbital processes, and the optic foramen crosses through the skull from one side to the other. Not all species are placed in any subgenus due to having inadequate skull evidence for further analyses.\nThe height and weight proportions of the skull of Palaeotherium are roughly equivalent with those of other taxa within the Equoidea. In comparison to other equoids where the skull's maximum width extends above the front root of the parallel zygomatic arches, those of Palaeotherium and most other palaeotheres (except Leptolophus) extend back to the joint of the squamosal bone and mandible. Unlike that of Plagiolophus, the maxillary hiatus, or an opening of the maxillary sinus, in Palaeotherium is wide, diamond-shaped, and has oblique back edges. Palaeotherium differs from most other palaeotheres by the nasal opening stretching up to the P3 tooth at minimum (noticeable in P. duvali and P. siderolithicum) or up to the front edge of the orbit above M3 in the case of P. magnum. Similar to other palaeotheres, the back process (tissue projection) of the premaxilla is reduced, but its morphology can vary. The maxilla can extend to the nasal opening but can also vary in proportions. While the shapes and proportions of the nasal bones vary by species, they extend beyond P1 in adults and sometimes even the canine like in equines. The nasomaxillary suture, which unites the maxilla and nasal bones, is short and strongly curved.\nThe jugal bone and lacrimal bone, both located in front of the orbit, are weak in development. The latter bone is elongated in its back and touches the posterolateral process of the nasal bones. Members of the Equoidea have relatively shortened front areas of the face.  The orbits of Palaeotherium, unlike those of other equoids, are proportionally smaller and are situated somewhat in front of the skull's mid-length area; they might be more forwards in the case of P. medium. Similar to other Palaeogene equoids, the front edge of the orbit is aligned with M1 or M2 while the back area is wide. In most species, the infraorbital foramen ",

He taught a wide range of subjects at the University of Jena including some of the first academic lectures in stenography. His son Sixtus Armin Thon became an engraver.\nThon was born in Eisenach and after graduating from the local gymnasium he went to the University of Jena where he studied mineralogy. In 1811 he received a doctorate for a new system of mineral classification. He worked as a docent and in 1813 he moved to Eisenach becoming a registrar of the Grand Duchal State in 1816. In 1821 he moved to Weimar where he began to draw and produce copper engravings. In 1827 his position at the University of Jena was renewed and he gave private lectures in science. He took an interest in natural history, mineralogy and began to organize lectures in stenography. He modified the system of shorthand developed by Karl Gottlieb Horstig (1763\u20131835). In 1834 he was promoted to extraordinary professor. He contributed drawings and engravings to the works of others. He published works on a wide range of topics including cooking, illustration, specimen collecting, stenography, economics, and home decoration. He also founded an entomological periodical calledEntomologisches Archiv of which only two volumes were produced between 1827 and 1830.\nThon was married thrice. One of his sons Sixtus Armin Thon became a director of a drawing school in Weimar while another, Guido became a physician in Queensland, Australia.\n",

    "The extended continental shelf, scientific continental shelf, or outer continental shelf, refers to a type of maritime area, established as a geo-legal paradigm by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Through the process known as the extension of the outer limit of the continental shelf or establishment of the outer edge of the continental margin, every coastal state has the privilege, granted by the international community of nations, to acquire exclusive and perpetual rights to exploit the biotic and abiotic resources found on the seabed and subsoil of these maritime areas. These areas are located beyond the 200 nautical miles that make up the state's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and would otherwise be considered international waters.\nIn these deep-water areas, resource exploitation was either technically impossible with available methods or economically unfeasible. Thanks to sustained scientific and industrial progress, these oceanic waters have become increasingly accessible through new technologies, which gives these areas extraordinary geopolitical and geoeconomic importance.\nDifferences with other concepts of continental shelves\nIn the case of the scientific or extended continental shelf, the coastal state to which it has been granted is the only one entitled to exploit the natural resources found in the seabed and subsoil, whether mineral resources or other non-living resources, as well as living organisms. This includes those organisms that penetrate the seabed or have sedentary habits, defined as those that remain immobile on the seabed during exploitation or move in permanent physical contact with it.\nThis type of maritime space differs significantly from the geomorphological concept of a continental shelf, which is similar to an epicontinental sea. This concept identifies the submerged extensions of the landmass of the coastal state up to depths of 200 meters.\nIt also differs from the concept of the legal continental shelf, which refers to the right of states to exploit their maritime projections up to the limit of 200 nautical miles (regardless of the characteristics of the seabed or its depths, and whether or not there is an extension of the coast under the sea) measured from their baselines (exclusive economic zone or EEZ). In this concept, the rights to exploit the seabed and subsoil are combined with rights over the water column and surface.\nScientific or extended shelves are always located in maritime areas more than 200 nautical miles (370.4\u00a0km) from the straight baselines from which the width of the territorial sea is measured, and they do not extend beyond 350 nautical miles at the maximum.\nHistory and characteristics\nThe creation and implementation of this legal concept, which allows coastal states to enjoy exclusive rights over vast oceanic territories, stems from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), specifically in Part VI. This multilateral treaty was approved in April 1982 and came into force on November 16, 1994, a year after its ratification by Guyana, which fulfilled the requirement that at least 60 signatory states ratify it.\nThe regulations developed and issued by UNCLOS have global application. The meeting of the states that are part of the convention established the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), and the validation of the commission gives political and legal legitimacy. This commission is based at the United Nations headquarters in New York.\nFor a coastal state to acquire rights over scientific continental shelves, it must rigorously follow specific steps. First, it must submit a detailed report to the CLCS, in which the state must demonstrate its rights over a specific area, outlined in a cartographic presentation.

    "\nThe siege of Jailolo (1550\u20131551) was a successful military expedition launched by Bernaldim de Sousa, a Portuguese commander, against the Sultan of Gilolo, supported by the King of Ternate and the Prince of Batjan, lasting three months.\nBackground\nConflicts between the leaders of Ternate and Gilolo drew the Portuguese and missionaries into insular warfare during 1550-51. Gilolo, situated seven leagues (28 miles) from the Portuguese fortress at Ternate on the island of Halmahera, had held its own stronghold for seventeen years, dating back to around 1533. During this time, the sultan of Gilolo had seized guns and artillery from the local Christians, using them against the Portuguese and their converts. Known as a great tyrant, he caused many of the converts to suffer martyrdom. Hostilities between Ternate and Gilolo, which had previously been intermittent, became regular starting in 1549.\nBernaldim de Sousa, a Portuguese commander, led an expedition to Jailolo with 180 soldiers, supported by the King of Ternate and the Prince of Batjan, with 5,000 men to the effort. Their objective was to destroy a fortress being built by the King of Jailolo, which posed a threat to Portuguese interests in the region.\nAmbush\nAs Bernaldim de Sousa's forces approached Jailolo, they encountered strong resistance. Balthasar Velloso, leading the vanguard, was ambushed by a force under the Prince of Jailolo, who had concealed his men in a carefully laid trap. Despite the surprise attack, Velloso managed to rally his troops and defend his position with remarkable courage. His forces inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, forcing the attackers to retreat. Meanwhile, Bernaldim de Sousa was also engaged by the forces of Jailolo but succeeded in driving them back into the fortress.\nThe siege\nFollowing these clashes, Bernaldim de Sousa laid siege to the fortress of Jailolo. He cut off the water supply and blockaded the stronghold, preventing any resupply. The siege lasted for three months, with both sides suffering significant losses. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the defenders of Jailolo held out with remarkable tenacity, enduring starvation and a lack of resources. Finally, their provisions exhausted, the defenders were forced to capitulate. The Portuguese entered the fortress in the presence of the King, committing numerous atrocities during the sacking of the stronghold, killing 300 of them, and 18 of their own, with the number of wounded being greater still. The fortress itself was razed to the ground.\nAftermath\nAfter the siege, the Jailolo were forced to capitulate and agree on harsh treaty for peace, with such hard terms that the King of Jailolo was compelled to give up his royal title and accept himself as a vassal to Ternate, and pay tribute to the Portuguese.\nThe king was later said to have committed suicide by poison due to grief, and was succeeded by his son, Cachilguzarate.\n",
    "Illustration of several barbette ships from the 1880s, showing the degree of experimentation with armament arrangements\nThe barbette ship was a type of ironclad warship that was built by several navies between the 1860s and 1890s. The defining characteristic was the use of armored barbettes to partially protect the ship's main battery guns, rather than heavy gun turrets or inflexible box batteries.\nDevelopment\nFollowing the introduction of ironclad warships in the early 1860s, naval designers grappled with the problem of mounting heavy guns in the most efficient way possible. The first generation of ironclads employed the same broadside arrangement as the old ship of the line, but it was not particularly effective for ahead or stern fire. This was particularly important to designers, since the tactic of ramming was revived following its successful employment at the decisive Austrian victory at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. Ramming required a ship to steam directly at its opponent, which greatly increased the importance of end-on fire. Designers such as Cowper Phipps Coles and John Ericsson designed the first gun turrets in the 1860s, which gave the guns a wide field of fire. These turrets were exceedingly heavy, which required them to be placed low in the ship to reduce top-weight\u2014and produced a dangerous tendency to capsize in heavy seas, amply demonstrated by the loss of HMS\u00a0Captain and Coles himself with the ship in a gale in 1870.\nIn the 1870s, designers began to experiment with an en barbette type of mounting. The barbette was a fixed armored enclosure protecting the gun. The barbette could take the form of a circular or elongated ring of armor around the rotating gun mount over which the guns (possibly fitted with a gun shield) fired. The barbette system reduced weight considerably, since the machinery for the rotating gun mount, along with the mount itself, was much lighter than that required for the gun house of a turret. The savings in weight could then be passed on to increase armor protection for the hull, improve coal storage capacity, or to install larger, more powerful engines. In addition, because barbettes were lighter, they could be placed higher in the ship without jeopardizing stability, which improved their ability to be worked in heavy seas that would have otherwise rendered turrets unusable. This also permitted a higher freeboard, which also improved seakeeping.\nIronclads equipped with barbettes were referred to as \"barbette ships\" much like their contemporaries, turret ships and central battery ships, which mounted their heavy guns in turrets or in a central armored battery. Many navies experimented with all three types in the 1870s and 1880s, including the British Admiral-class battleships, the French Marceau-class ironclads, the Italian Italia-class battleships, and the German Sachsen-class ironclads, all of which employed barbettes to mount their heavy guns. All of these navies also built turret and or central battery ships during the same period, though none had a decisive advantage over the other. The British and the Russian navies experimented with using disappearing guns afloat, including on the British HMS\u00a0Temeraire and the Russian ironclad Vice-Admiral Popov. They were not deemed particularly successful and were not repeated.\nReplacement\nIn the late 1880s, the debate between barbette or turret mounts was finally settled. The Royal Sovereign class, mounted their guns in barbettes, but the follow-on design, the Majestic class, adopted a new mounting that combined the benefits of both kinds of mounts. A heavily armored, rotating gun house was added to the revolving platform, which kept the guns and their crews protected. The gun house was  smaller and lighter than the old-style turrets, which still permitted placement higher in the ship and the corresponding benefits to stability and seakeeping. This innovation gradually became known simply as a turret, though the armored tube that held the turret substructure, which included the shell and propellant handling rooms and the ammunition hoists, was still referred to as a barbette. These ships were the prototype of the so-called pre-dreadnought battleships, which proved to be broadly influential in all major navies over the next fifteen years.\nUse in service\nSketch of Dingyuan and Zhenyuan at the Battle of the Yalu River during the First Sino-Japanese War\nShips equipped with barbette mountings did not see a great deal of combat, owing to the long period of relative peace between their appearance in the 1870s and their obsolescence in the 1890s. Some barbette ships saw action during the British Bombardment of Alexandria in 1882, and the French ironclad\u00a0Triomphante participated in the Battle of Fuzhou during the Sino-French War in 1884. The two Chinese ironclads, Dingyuan and Zhenyuan, that took part in the Battle of the Yalu River during the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, carried their main battery in barbettes, though they were equ",

    "Mass-killings in Mousiotitsa, Nazi-occupied Greece\nThe Massacres of Mousiotitsa (Greek: \u039f\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03b3\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2; German: Massaker von Mousiotitsa) refer to Nazi war crimes perpetrated in the summer of 1943 by soldiers of the 1st Mountain Division in the village of Mousiotitsa, Greece, during its occupation by the Axis in World War II. Mousiotitsa endured two assaults by the same German unit, separated by a one-month period. The first took place on 25 July and the second on 27 August 1943.\nBackground\nGeography\nThe village of Mousiotitsa is situated 33\u00a0km south of the city of Ioannina and 55\u00a0km northwest of Arta in the Epirus region. It is located on the east slopes of Mt. Tomaros, near the springs of the Louros river. Mousiotitsa consists of two distinct neighborhoods that are two kilometers apart (i.e., Ano and Kato Mousiotitsa). According to the 1940 Greek census, the village had 816 residents who were engaged in free-range livestock farming and subsistence agriculture.\n1st Mountain Division transfer to Epirus\nThe 98th Regiment of the 1st Mt Division during the invasion of Poland, 1939\nAfter the defeat of the Axis in North Africa, the Wehrmacht feared an Allied amphibious landing in western Greece. Hence, in June 1943 the elite 1st Mountain Division Edelweiss was transferred to Epirus from the Caucasus. Under the command of Generalleutnant Walter Stettner, the Division was tasked with countering partisan activity and was given explicit orders to act with extreme brutality. Since partisans relied upon civilians for food and intelligence, the Wehrmacht systematically used mass reprisals to terrorize local communities, labeling their population as \"bandits\". On 7 July 1943, Stettner issued an order stipulating that villages deemed to be of use to partisans should be wiped out and their population executed or deported. Many Division personnel, having previously fought on the Eastern Front, were accustomed to carrying out ruthless reprisals against local populations. Mousiotitsa was the first victim of a series of mop-up operations that in the coming months would result in the deaths of hundreds of civilians and the destruction of their property in villages such as Kommeno and Lingiades.\nJuly 1943 in Mousiotitsa\nBy the summer of 1943, villagers from Mousiotitsa had joined the armed bands of the EDES partisan organization which harassed the German occupation forces. Soon after the arrival in the region of the 1st Mountain Division, reports of the presence of partisans west of the Arta - Ioannina road reached its headquarters. On 18 July, a force commanded by Oberst Josef Salminger\u00a0 advanced south towards Arta and clashed with partisans near Kopani, leaving behind 9 dead Germans. This engagement prompted Salminger to request an even harsher stance in dealing with the locals, which was ultimately approved by Stettner and hence Mousiotitsa was targeted. On 24 July, leaflets were thrown above Mousiotitsa from a low-flying German aircraft, demanding residents to refrain from abandoning their homes.\nFirst massacre (25 July)\nGerman mountain troops after destroying a village in Epirus\nOn Sunday 25 July, a coordinated attack was initiated by troops of the 98th Regiment of the 1st Mountain Division. Transported to Mousiotitsa on lorries, the troops were divided into four distinct groups. Oberleutnant Willibald R\u00f6ser, known by the nickname \"Nero of 12/98\", commanded one group from the 12th Company. By encircling the village, the four groups blocked all exits and attacked the village from different directions on its periphery. During their sweeps, they captured hostages and burnt homes after looting them. The hostages were mustered in Spithari (Greek: \u03a3\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9), a plateau above the village that had served as a refuge for locals during the era of Ottoman rule. In the late afternoon, the hostages were lined up and executed with machine guns. A total of 136 civilians were killed. Due to the scarcity of men able of digging graves, the bodies of those killed at Spithari were subsequently interred in a dry well.\nSecond massacre (27 August)\nA second attack on Mousiotitsa was carried out on 27 August 1943 in reprisal for the killing of a German officer by partisans near the village. In this second attack, which was again carried out by the 98th Regiment, an additional 17 individuals who were members of two families assisting the partisans with cooking were murdered.\nAftermath\nThe combined list of casualties from the two attacks on Mousiotitsa totals 153 individuals, among which 63 children under the age of 16.\nThe German troops did not encounter any partisans nor any resistance in Mousiotitsa. Their official report about the events claimed that a platoon of the 12th Company led by Willibald R\u00f6ser was fired upon from a detached dwelling. The building was surrounded and destroyed along with \"100 bandits\". The credibility of this report is disputed.\nSalminger was killed in an ambush by partisans on 1 October 1943.

    "Mexican novel chronicling the 1968 student movement\nLos d\u00edas y los a\u00f1os (English: The Days and the Years) is a political novel and narrative account by Mexican author Luis Gonz\u00e1lez de Alba. \nThemes\nThe novel describes the events surrounding the 1968 Mexican Student Movement from the author's point of view, including two of the incidents that preceded the massacre:\nThe formation of the National Strike Council, the protests, and the rallies.\nThe events leading to the Tlatelolco massacre, specifically the jailing of students, leaders, and professors in the Palacio de Lecumberri.\nThe first edition, published in 1971 and limited to just 2,000 copies, had the following description on the back cover:\nThis book is a testimony as well as a reflection. The conflict between students and the state, such as the one that arose in Mexico in 1968, is depicted here from the perspective of one of its participants, a student from the College of Philosophy and Letters and member of the National Strike Council, who, in order to analyze the events, does not abide by just his vision and demands, though the dialogue, his classmates' vision. We see how the Student Movement's moral, ideological, and political choices grow like waves that start from a single point and grow larger, from the individual to the collective, from the specific to the general. The author moves freely, dialectically, through the time that his story spans, confronting moments of the past and the present.\nThus, we discover in a realistic, objective, and, at the same time, intimate way, the reasons and questions from a young conscience that decided to take action, leave behind an individualistic outlook and embrace a collective one. Without a doubt, this is the first literary work born of the Student Movement, facing the crystallization of a conscience nourished on its own commitment: before the interior wound heals, it is necessary to come to terms with it. Thus, on mediating on itself, on meditating on its collision with reality, a generation prepares itself for imminent maturity.\nContext\nGonz\u00e1lez de Alba wrote the novel during the two years that he spent imprisoned in the Palacio de Lecumberri. Some of the central themes that surround the process of writing this novel include fights, marches, rallies, skirmishes, pursuits, defamation, corruption, state-sponsored terrorism, imprisonment, and lawsuits against political leaders.\nPlot\nA 24-year-old man, Luis Gonz\u00e1lez de Alba, representative of the College of Philosophy and Letters before the National Strike Council as a member of the Committee of Philosophy and Letters, recreates life in the Black Palace of Lecumberri for the 1968 Student Movement's political prisoners. Gonz\u00e1lez de Alba narrates from his own experiences, reporting on events occurring in the context of Mexico's 1968 Student Movement. The National Strike Council convenes the entire student community in Mexico so that the government can fulfill the demands of the movement's petitionary suit, which included:\nFreeing political prisoners.\nDismissing Generals Luis Cueto Ram\u00edrez and Ra\u00fal Mendiola, and Coronel Armando Fr\u00edas.\nDisbanding the grenadier corp, a direct instrument of repression, and prohibiting the creation of similar corps.\nRepealing Article 145 and 145 B of the Federal Penal Code (which establishes the crime of social dissolution), a method used for judicial aggression.\nProviding compensation from that point on to the families of the dead and injured who were victims of the Friday, July 26 attack.\nDefining responsibility for the acts of repression and vandalism committed by the authorities through the police, grenadier, and the army.\nGustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz, Mexico's president in 1968, decides to ignore the National Strike Council's petitions despite the myriad persons who have joined the cause, from politicians and celebrities to artists and writers, like Juan Rulfo and Juan Jos\u00e9 Arreola. Instead of responding to the requests for petitionary suit, and given the approach of the 1968 Summer Olympics that were held in Mexico, D\u00edaz Ordaz decides to respond with violence, repression, and infringing on the autonomy of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. These events set off a series of tragedies, which the author narrates, in search of freedom in a country with a great lack of it.\nContents\nThe novel consists of three parts, with two interwoven accounts. The first account narrates the events that occurred in the 1968 Student Movement and prior to the Tlatelolco massacre, seen from Gonz\u00e1lez de Alba's perspective and experience. The second account is a meta-narration by Gonz\u00e1lez de Alba in Lecumberri prison after the Tlatelolco massacre, during which he was arrested, that narrates Gonz\u00e1lez de Alba's experiences with his fellow inmates while he writes this very book, Los d\u00edas y los a\u00f1os.\nChapters\nI. The tragedies of the riots between prisoners and guards inside Lecumberri prison following Gonz\u00e1lez de Alba's arrest.\nII. This chapter contains an in",

    "Extinct species of mammal\nPalaeoloxodon turkmenicus is an extinct species of elephant belonging to the genus Palaeoloxodon, known from the Middle Pleistocene of Central Asia and South Asia.\nTaxonomy\nThe species was described in 1955 based on a partial adult skull (ZIN 27052), as well as an associated atlas vertebra and partial femur, found in Khuday-Dag near Krasnovodsk in what is now western Turkmenistan (then the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic in the Soviet Union) in Central Asia, dating to the early Middle Pleistocene. Its validity was historically considered uncertain, with a 2004 study suggesting that it was a synonym of the largely European straight-tusked elephant (Palaeoloxodon antiquus). In 2024, a skull of a mature bull (WMNH-VP-F1), around 45-55 years of age was attributed to the species from Galander near Pampore in the Kashmir Valley located in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent (probably also of Middle Pleistocene age), with this study affirming the validity of P. turkmenicus as a distinct species of Palaeoloxodon. Other remains from the site probably attributable to the specimen include the mandibles, the altas, a partial scapula, some fragmentary thoracic vertebrae, ribs and limb bone fragments, with the fragmentary remains of several other elephants (including a juvenile) also known from the site. The 2024 study proposed that Palaeoloxodon turkmenicus may represent the ancestor of other Eurasian Palaeoloxodon species, but noted that given the current paucity of skull remains of early Middle Pleistocene Palaeoloxodon that this hypothesis was tenative.\nDescription\nThe species had a large body size, comparable to that of other mainland Eurasian Palaeoloxodon species. In contrast to most other Eurasian species of Palaeoloxodon (such as the European Palaeoloxodon antiquus and the South Asian Palaeoloxodon namadicus) the parietal-occipital crest in the forehead region of the skull is only weakly developed, similar to the African-West Asian Palaeoloxodon recki, with the anatomy of the stylohyoid bone found at Pampore strongly differing from that of P. recki,  P. antiquus and the Japanese P. naumanni, supporting its placement as a distinct species.\nEcology\nRemains of other animals found at the Pampore site include those of the Kashmir stag (Cervus hanglu).\nRelationship with humans\nThe elephants at Pampore were found to have had their bones deliberately fractured by archaic humans via hammering using stone tools, possibly for the purposes of extracting marrow. At the site stone tools made of basalt were found, which were likely used for butchery. These tools were made using stone-knapping techniques reminiscent of the Levallois type, suggesting a late Middle Pleistocene age (possibly around 400-300,000 years ago) for the site. There is no evidence that the elephants were hunted, and they may have been scavenged after dying of natural causes. Abnormal bone growth within the sinuses suggests that the main Pampore bull had a severe, perhaps septic chronic sinus infection at the time of its death.\n",
    "\n2024 single by Ros\u00e9 and Bruno Mars\n\"Apt.\" is a song by New Zealand and South Korean singer Ros\u00e9 and American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars. It was released through The Black Label and Atlantic Records on 18 October 2024, as the lead single from Ros\u00e9's upcoming debut studio album, Rosie (2024). \"Apt.\" marked Ros\u00e9's first solo single in three years and her first release since departing from YG Entertainment and Interscope Records in 2023.\n\"Apt.\" was written and composed by various contributors, including Ros\u00e9 and Mars. It is a pop, pop-punk, and pop rock track, featuring indie rock and electropop influences. Inspired by a South Korean drinking game, the song's chorus is built around the game's rhythmic chant of apateu (Korean:\u00a0\uc544\ud30c\ud2b8; lit.\u00a0apartment). Critics lauded \"Apt.\" for its catchy production and broad cross-cultural appeal.\n\"Apt.\" was an immediate commercial success worldwide, spending two weeks atop the Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. US charts and earning Ros\u00e9 and Mars their second number-one single on both charts. In South Korea, it became both artists' first track to attain a \"perfect all-kill\" and peak at number one on the Circle Digital Chart. The song also topped the charts in New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the MENA region, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. It entered the top ten on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, becoming the first song by a K-pop female soloist to do so on either.\nBackground and promotion\nOn 29 December 2023, Ros\u00e9 announced her departure from YG Entertainment to its associate company The Black Label for her solo work, while remaining with YG to continue her activities as a member of Blackpink. Prior to her departure, Ros\u00e9 released her debut solo single album, R, in March 2021, featuring tracks \"On The Ground\" and \"Gone\". These releases garnered critical acclaim and commercial success.\nOn 16 August 2024, Ros\u00e9 was seen attending a concert of Mars in Los Angeles and later that month sharing a picture of her wearing a shirt with Mars on it. In September, Ros\u00e9 announced via her social media that she signed a new global solo deal with Atlantic Records. On 16 October, Ros\u00e9 posted a polaroid picture of her sitting next to Mars and taught him a Korean drinking game, according to the caption of her post. Mars also shared an Instagram story of Ros\u00e9 supposedly trying to kiss him that night, promoting a possible upcoming release.\nOn 17 October, Ros\u00e9 announced the release of the single on her social media, just a day ahead of the release. An accompanying artwork was revealed alongside the announcement, featuring a black-and-white rose-tinted photo of Mars behind a drum set and Ros\u00e9 lying in front of the set with a black leather jacket and skirt on. The news of the release arrived a few weeks after the announcement of Ros\u00e9's upcoming debut studio album Rosie, slated for release on 6 December 2024.\nComposition and lyrics\n\"Apt.\"\nInspired by the apateu rhythmic chant of a South Korean drinking game, the song's chorus received praise for its catchiness and energetic sound.\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\n\"Apt.\" was written by Ros\u00e9, who was credited as Chae Young Park, Bruno Mars, Amy Allen, Christopher Brody Brown, Rog\u00e9t Chahayed, Omer Fedi, Philip Lawrence, Theron Thomas, Henry Walter, Michael Chapman, and Nicholas Chinn. It was produced by Mars, Cirkut, Fedi, and Chahayed. The track also interpolates Toni Basil's 1982 single \"Mickey\", written by Chinn and Chapman. \"Apt.\" has been described as a pop, pop-punk, and pop rock track, featuring indie rock and electropop elements. It opens with a rap verse, transitions to a \"melodious\" pre-chorus, and builds to an energetic chorus influenced by the Apartment game chant.\n'APT' is actually my favourite Korean drinking game that I play with my friends back home. It's so simple, puts a smile on your face, and breaks the ice at any party. One night in the studio, I taught my crew how to play the game. Everyone was fascinated, especially when I started the chant, so we played around with it, and I said we should make a song out of it... and after Bruno joined the track, the rest became history!\u2014\u200aRos\u00e9 on the song's origins.\nInspired by a popular South Korean drinking game named Apartment, from which the title of the song is also derived, the track employs the game's rhythmic chant of apateu (Korean:\u00a0\uc544\ud30c\ud2b8; lit.\u00a0apartment) to create a \"playful\" and \"addictive\" chorus. In an interview with Vogue, Ros\u00e9 revealed that she was initially \"kind of freaked out\" how people would react to a song about a drinking game. Moreover, Ros\u00e9 \"asked her team to delete the song from their phones\", only to find out \"that they were already obsessed with it\". She later proposed a collaboration to Mars and sent him three songs, including \"Apt.\". When Mars heard the track for the first time, he asked what the title meant, prompting Ros\u00e9 to explain that \"it was a Korean drinking game\". Ros\u00e9 also express",
    "2024 video game\n2024 video game\nNeva is a puzzle-platform game developed by Nomada Studio and published by Devolver Digital. It follows a young woman named Alba who must travel with her wolf companion Neva across four seasons in a world corrupted by darkness. The game was released for Windows, macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S in October 2024.\nGameplay\nThe game follows a young woman named Alba who forms a lifelong bond with a wolf companion named Neva as the pair explore and cleanse a world corrupted by dark forces. The game is divided into several chapters which sees Neva grow from a young cub to a full-grown adult.\nNeva is a side-scrolling platform game in which players need to solve environmental puzzles and fight creatures of the darkness to progress. The player character controls Alba, who can call Neva's name to encourage it to reach the player's desired location. Neva features a combat system. Alba is equipped with a sword and she has two basic combat moves: a horizontal slash and a downward slash. She can also jump, double jump, perform a short air dash, and dodge hostile attacks. By chaining attacks together, Alba's lost health will slowly regenerate. Healing cairns can also be found in each level. Alba's skills cannot be upgraded, but Neva will become stronger and assist Alba in both combat and transversal.\nDevelopment\nNeva was Spanish game development company Nomada Studio's second game, following Gris (2018). The studio recruited a larger team for the project, and the game's length was about twice as long as Gris. As with Gris, the game had nearly no dialogue, with the exception of Alba calling Neva's name in various intonations. The team felt that the game being wordless left room for players to freely interprete the events of the game. The story originally revolved around two humans, though the team scrapped this plan as they were impressed by the early drafts for Neva. Princess Mononoke served as an important inspiration for the game's visual design. Unlike Gris, the studio's previous game, the game features a combat system, though the team introduced a story mode to ensure that the game is approachable for all players.\nAccording to Adrian Cuevas, the founder of Nomada Studio, the team wanted explore the relationship through parents and their children, how these relationships change gradually over time, and \"how a parent feels when raising a kid, as the kid grows and changes\". The team was inspired by their own experience raising a child. In the game, which was divided into four chapters, Neva slowly turns from a timid young cub, to a teenager eager to jump headfirst into dangers, into a fully-grown adult. While Neva gains a lot of new ability, Alba's core abilities remained unchanged throughout the game. The team wanted players to have mixed emotions: to feel scared when Neva's life is at risk, and to be delighted when Neva performed well. The enemies in the game were inspired by the envirnomental challenges faced by the Earth. They are the embodiment and a visual cue of fears that one may have raising children. While the earlier segments of the game had a more delightful tone, the later segments of the game contrasted it by having both characters threatened by this corruption.\nNeva was announced by Nomada Studio and publisher Devolver Digital in May 2023. The game was released on October 15, 2024, for Windows PC, macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S on October 15, 2024.\nReception\nReception\nNeva received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to review aggregator Metacritic. According to OpenCritic, 94% of 50 critics recommend the game.\nKeza MacDonald from The Guardian strongly praised the game, commending its \"extraordinary visuals and elegant animation\" and \"chest-tighteningly effective music\". She also praised the seasons in the game for being distinct from each other, as each has its own distinct tone and gameplay challenges. She compared the game to Journey and praised its ability to evoke strong emotions during its short runtime. Writing for Polygon, Nicole Carpenter wrote that the combat encounters show \"the evolution of Alba and Neva\u2019s relationship rather than existing as an element of sheer challenge\", and that its runtime was suitable for game that was \"ethereal\" and \"devastatingly beautiful\". Christopher Cruz from Rolling Stone described Neva as the \"most heartbreaking game of 2024\". He compared it to films by Studio Ghibli, applauding its art design and its ability to tell a story that is \"highly accessible and deeply affecting\". The last segment of the game set in winter, in particular, received critical acclaim.\nEcho Apsey from Push Square strongly praised the game's combat and puzzles, and wrote that the boss encounters in the game were \"memorable, challenging, and visually impressive\". While she noted that the game kept introducing new gameplay mechanics, some of them did not last l",
    "Spanish occupation of Larache in 1911\nThe Larache Landing refers to the military action that led to the occupation of the Moroccan city of Larache by the Spanish Marine Infantry, establishing a precedent for the military intervention in Morocco and the subsequent Rif War.\nHistorical context\nMain articles: Scramble for Africa, First Moroccan Crisis, and Second Moroccan Crisis\nSee also: Algeciras Conference, Second Melillan campaign, and Pact of Cartagena\nArea where the Spanish camp was set up, with the castle of San Antonio in the background.\nThe north-west of the Maghreb, where the Sultan of Morocco exercised his influence, was plunged into disorder and violence at the beginning of the 20th century. According to the British ambassador to Spain at the time, Arthur Nicholson, the existence of a country, a state and a Moroccan sultan with power beyond Tangier was a fiction, since the only thing there was a group of independent and warlike tribes and Kabyles.\nIn 1904, the power of the Sultan of Morocco was limited by the powers that looked after the interests of their nationals in the area. Thus, for any crime, foreign residents could only be tried by the courts of their country of origin, and according to their own legislation. They were generally exempt from paying taxes, and their indigenous employees had the status of \"protected\", enjoying the same legal status as their employers. When the Sultan dictated any measure that affected foreign residents, he had to have the agreement of the consulates of the nations concerned. On the other hand, the authority of Sultan Abdelaziz was undermined by the actions of sheriffs such as Bou Hmara in the eastern Rif or Raisuni - the leader of the mountains - and disputed by his own brother Abd al-Hafid, who would end up overthrowing his brother.\nThis circumstance was exploited by the colonial empires to extend their influence there by using it as a trump card in the balance of power, which led to the First Moroccan Crisis and the increase in tensions that would end with the outbreak of the First World War.\nThe crisis was temporarily resolved at the Algeciras Conference, where Germany prevented the Maghreb from falling under the sole influence of France, and an agreement was reached to exercise a protectorate in Morocco with two areas of influence, Spanish and French.\nThe French military intervention in response to the revolts against the Sultan forced the Spanish government to rush to take positions in the places of the Protectorate where Spain was to exert its influence and begin to develop the mining industry and trade in accordance with the Franco-Spanish pacts of 1904 and 1905 and the conditions of the Algeciras Conference. In the agreed zone of Spanish influence there were already settlements with a Spanish presence, and in the same zone of Larache there was an indigenous police tabor under the command of Captain Ovilo y Castelo. Spain and France were tasked with improving the administration of the sultanate, for which they had a police force, but they could not intervene militarily.\nIn this situation, Jos\u00e9 Canalejas y M\u00e9ndez's Government intervened without delay in order to maintain its political and economic influence in the region. With this action, Sultan Abdelaziz saw an opportunity to nullify Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni's power, while the latter hoped that the Spanish intervention would favor his interests against the Sultan.\nThe agreements of the Algeciras Conference did not prevent the \"Second Moroccan Crisis\" or Agadir Crisis, which began with the French occupation of Fez on 21 May 1911, the Spanish military occupation of Larache, Asilah and Ksar el-Kebir a few weeks later, and was unleashed with the arrival of the German gunboat SMS Panther at the port of Agadir on 1 July.\nDevelopment of operations\nThe Larache souk in 1911.\nIndigenous police of the Tabor of Larache.\nThe cruiser Catalu\u00f1a.\nThe increase in riots and disorders in 1911 led to a violent revolt in Fez, which led to the military occupation of the square by the French army, from where it began to spread to the Spanish zone of influence, which contravened what had been agreed in the Algeciras Conference. The French action in Tunisia aroused the indignation of Spanish public opinion, which saw it as a flagrant attack on the Algeciras agreements, which only provided for the presence of 2,500 indigenous police under the command of 20 Spanish and French officers in the eight ports open to free trade; it was suspected that France wanted to repeat what it had done in 1864 to take over Tunisia (that time it had been \"taken\" from Italy). Canalejas warned that if France maintained the occupation, Spain would do the same in the strategic places under its influence, an area also heavily punished by the violence of some tribes. According to the Count of Romanones, there were agents of the highest authority who told him that they were convinced that if the Spanish response had been delayed only a few hours, those place",
    "2024 killing of Hamas leader\nOn 16 October 2024, during their operations in the Israel\u2013Hamas war, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. His killing was the result of a routine patrol and a chance encounter in the southern Gazan city of Rafah. He had been one of Israel's most wanted men after the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel.\nIn the lead-up to the shootout, members of the 828th Bislamach Brigade reported activity they deemed suspicious and received orders to engage. When their drone spotted three militants leaving a building, the soldiers fired upon them, not knowing that Sinwar was among them. The militants scattered, with Sinwar entering a nearby building alone. A firefight ensued, in which an IDF soldier was severely injured. An IDF tank fired at Sinwar's location and troops advanced into the building, but they pulled back after he threw grenades at them. IDF then sent the drone to survey the interior, detecting the injured Sinwar, his identity still unknown to engaging troops. After entering again the following day, they found Sinwar's body in the wrecked building and suspected it could be his, based on resemblance. They cut a finger from the body and sent it to Israel for identification purposes; later in the day, the body was dispatched as well.\nSinwar's body was identified through dental records and DNA testing, and his death was confirmed by Israeli officials soon afterward. An Israeli pathologist reported that the body showed various injuries from different causes, and that Sinwar died from being shot to the head, causing severe traumatic brain injury. Hamas also acknowledged his death on 18 October. In the subsequently released footage made by the Israeli drone, seen by many, Sinwar is seen wounded as he throws a stick at the drone. Some in Israel characterized the imagery as showing defeat, while Sinwar's supporters interpreted his conduct as emblematic of defiance. Critics questioned Israel's choice to release the footage in the first place, based on concerns that it contributes to Sinwar's post-mortem heroization.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the killing of Sinwar \"settled the score\", but warned the war would continue with full force until Israel's hostages were returned. U.S. President Joe Biden stated \"This is a good day for Israel, for the United States, and for the world\", comparing Sinwar's death to the killing of Osama bin Laden and emphasizing that it presents an opportunity for a \"day after\" in Gaza without Hamas. In Hamas's statement confirming Sinwar's death, Basem Naim said: \"Hamas becomes stronger and more popular with each elimination of its leaders. It hurts to lose people, especially unique leaders like Yahya Sinwar, but we are sure we will win in the end.\"\nBackground\nIn September 2015, Yahya Sinwar was designated a terrorist by the United States government. Sinwar had served as Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip since February 2017. His leadership was characterized by a focus on military strengthening and alliances with Iran and Hezbollah. Committed to the destruction of Israel, he is thought to be, alongside Mohammed Deif, one of the main architects of the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel in 2023. The group, under his leadership, had been planning this assault for two years prior to its execution. By launching the attack, the deadliest day in Israel's history, Sinwar initiated the Israel\u2013Hamas war\u2014one of the deadliest conflicts in the Israeli-Palestinian struggle\u2014triggering a military response that resulted in widespread destruction, casualties, and displacement to his homeland of Gaza, all of which Sinwar considered to have been \"necessary sacrifices\". He also drew Iran and other members of the Axis of Resistance, including Hezbollah\u2014whose capabilities have significantly diminished due to Israeli actions\u2014along with the Houthi movement and Iraqi militias, into direct conflict with Israel.\nIn February 2024, a video was published of Sinwar moving in a tunnel with his family. There was also speculation in August that he would emerge above ground dressed as a woman. The International Criminal Court (ICC) was scheduled to issue a war crimes indictment against Sinwar, as announced in May. Sinwar was chosen as head of the movement's political bureau on 6 August 2024 after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The following month, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed the criminal indictment it had filed against Sinwar.\nOn multiple occasions throughout the war, residents of Gaza criticized Hamas, Sinwar, and economic conditions both through demonstrations and with online media. Prior to his death, Sinwar stated in his speeches that he would rather be killed by Israel than die by a heart attack or in a car accident. In one instance, he said that \"the best gift the enemy and the occupation can offer me is to assassinate me and that I go as a martyr at their hands\".\nThe Israeli security establishment was reportedly aware for months ",

    "1974 live album by Carmen McRae\nAs Time Goes By: Live at the Dug is a live album by American singer Carmen McRae. The album was recorded at the Tokyo jazz club Dig and originally released in Japan in 1974 by the Victor label. Two years later, the album was released in the United States by the independent label Catalyst Records. The peculiarity of the album is that it was the only time when McRae accompanied herself on the piano, and other musicians did not take part in the recording.\nCritical reception\nAllMusic reviewer Stephen Cook found it impressive that MacRae accompanies herself, noting that if someone is not quite sure whether to put her in the same company as Sarah Vaughan or Dinah Washington, then this collection of numbers should definitely tip the scales. Paul Kresh of Stereo Review stated that the album culminated in a delightful and dramatic rendition of \"Supper Time\", which focuses more on smoldering humility, as opposed to the bitter despair in Ethel Waters' version\u2013but it still has an original poignancy.\nTrack listing\n\"As Time Goes By\" (Herman Hupfeld) \u2013 5:49\n\"I Could Have Told You So\"\u00a0(Carl Sigman, Jimmy Van Heusen) \u2014 4:21\n\"More Than You Know\" (Edward Eliscu, Billy Rose, Vincent Youmans) \u2013 5:27\n\"I Can't Escape from You\" (Leo Robin, Richard A.

    "\nSherkat Omana  (or Omana Company, literally 'The Trustees\u2019 Company') was a for-profit corporation in Iran that the Iranian Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community utilized to legally hold ownership of their communal assets. Incorporated in form of a holding company, it possessed over a thousand properties nationwide, which included shrines, cemeteries, community centers, and welfare facilities.\nAfter the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Iranian government confiscated all these assets, which were then taken over by the Mostazafan Foundation. The authorities defended their actions with official allegations that Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds were Zionist agents working with Israel, a claim that Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds view as a form of excuse for persecution.\nOne of Sherkat Omana's most important subsidiaries was Sherkat Nawnahalan (literally 'The Children\u2019s Company'), an investment company founded in 1917. The latter had a capital of some $5 million in 1979 (amounting to $22.5 million in 2024), and was involved in importing, retailing, industrial projects and mortgage. It also provided student loans and assistance to the elderly of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community.

    "1976 Lockheed C-130 crash in Portugal\nThe Tragedy of the Azores or Tragedy of the University Orfe\u00f3n, as it was known by the press at the time, was an accident that occurred on 3 September 1976 when a Lockheed C-130H Hercules aircraft of the Venezuelan Air Force crashed on a hill just outside the runway of Lajes Field on Terceira Island in the Azores Archipelago, while carrying out approach maneuvers under heavy rain, associated with Hurricane Emmy. The Hercules was transporting members of the University Choir of the Central University of Venezuela to Barcelona, Spain to participate in a choral event.:\u200a3\u200a\nAircraft\nThe aircraft involved was a Lockheed C-130H Hercules with registration FAV-7772, serial number 4408, property of the Venezuelan Air Force. It was manufactured in 1971 and had been operating in the country for five years and was assigned to Air Transport Group No. 6.\nAccident\nBackground\nThe reason for the University Orfe\u00f3n's trip was to go to Barcelona, Spain, for the International Festival of Choral Singing, to begin on 4 September 1976, an invitation received two years earlier. The total cost of the ticket with the flag airline Viasa amounted to the sum of 300 thousand bolivars and the Central University of Venezuela did not have such resources. The total number of members of the Orfe\u00f3n was about 52 people, which resulted in a cost per ticket of between Bs 5,500 and Bs 6,000.\nGiven the impossibility of paying for the trip, the orfeonistas, with the approval of their director Vinicio Adames, organized themselves into a commission, and through the representative of the Federation of University Centers, in a meeting with the president of the republic Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez, They requested the support of the Venezuelan Air Force, who offered a FAV plane, a Lockheed C-130H Hercules transport, to fly to Europe. It was not the first time that the FAV supported the Orfe\u00f3n Universitario on a tour, something that had already happened in 1959, and it was also a commonly used route for refueling spare parts for the military aeromotor fleet of the time.\nFlight\nThe Air Transport Group No. 6 received the order to schedule a flight to Europe in which the members of the University Choir would go as passengers at the end of August 1976. When requesting the weather reports they found out that there was a tropical storm parked over the Azores and that the Lajes Airbase(mandatory stopover of the transfer) was closed. This forced the flight to be suspended several times. But, due to pressure from the director of the Orfe\u00f3n towards the rector of the university and the president of the republic, the Venezuelan Air Force (in search of a solution to the situation) drew a route with a stopover at the North American Naval Air Base Bermuda, today L.F. Wade International Airport, on Saint David Island, Bermuda. From there, they continued towards the Azores, 1866 nautical miles away. From the Azores they planned to go to Barcelona, 1,347 nautical miles away. From there the FAV C-130H would continue its flight to France and the United Kingdom, where they would drop off another of its passengers, Colonel Alfredo Ram\u00edrez G., aeronautical attach\u00e9 in London, along with his wife and son. If they had been unable to reach the Azores, the alternate airport would have beeb Lisbon Airport, located 841 nautical miles from Lajes, for a total of 2,707 nautical miles from Bermuda. The flight would have been carried out by 2 full crews, of 5 members each.\nThe Hercules left Maiquet\u00eda for the Libertador Base, in Palo Negro, Edo. Aragua, for a technical touch, and from there it continued as planned to Bermuda. Upon arrival in Bermuda, fuel was supplied, the flight plan was registered and the weather forecast was requested, which reported that the storm was continuing and that at the time of arrival at Lajes the airport would be below minimum levels. This led to the decision to begin distributing crew and passenger personnel in the accommodation available on the base and in the residences located around it. Shortly before finishing the distribution, the air base personnel informed the C-130H pilots that, according to a report received, at the time of arrival of the flight to the Azores the runway was going to be clear. With this new information, the personnel are picked up, taking off from the Bermuda Naval Air Base.\nNine hours later, upon arriving at Terceira Island, they faced adverse conditions: zero visibility and the base below minimum levels. According to the press of the time, when the pilots communicated with the control tower, they were answered by a Portuguese soldier who did not know English. On the third attempt to land, the aircraft crashed 200 meters from the runway. There was no explosion since there was no fuel in the tanks, but due to the violence of the impact there were no survivors.\n",
    "\nChristian Socialist Fellowship was an international religious society of Protestant ministers and other believers in Christian socialist principles. It was formed at Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. in 1906, for the purpose of \"permeating the churches, denominations, and other religious institutions with the social message of Jesus; to show that Socialism is the necessary economic expression of the Christian life; to end the class struggle by establishing industrial democracy, and to hasten the reign of justice and brotherhood upon earth.\"\nThe Christian Socialist Fellowship was one of the many organizations in England and the U.S. devoted to the propagation of the social religious teachings. Charles Kingsley, Archbishop Whately, Bishop van Ketteler, and Bishop Fripple were clergymen both Protestant and Catholic, who lead the movement In Europe. Drs, Lyman Abbott, Washington Gladden, and Professor Ely were leaders in the movement in the U.S. Out of the broad term \"Christian Socialism\" some half dozen organizations evolved, But the Christian Socialist Fellowship was the most active at present of any of these.\nMembership was open to all who agreed to the objectives of the fellowship. \"The Golden Rule Instead of the Rule of Gold\" is the slogan of the organization. For a number of years, the Fellowship published The Christian Socialist at Chicago, Illinois.\nHistory\nThe Fellowship was formed at Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. in 1906. Starting in the first place chiefly by Unitarians, its membership embraced many Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists, Lutherans, Congregationalists, Universalists and even Roman Catholics.\nThe Christian Socialist Fellowship set itself the task of removing prejudice by showing the followers that Socialism presented the most scientific and wise plan so far devised, for conforming modern industry and business to the teachings of Christianity. The convictions impelled the members of the Fellowship to carry on their work of persuasion and appeal to an arousing religious conscience toward social problems. The object of the Fellowship, as specified in its constitution was \"To permeate churches, denominations and other religious institutions with the social message of Jesus; to show that Socialism is the necessary economic expression of the Christian life; to end the class struggle by establishing industrial democracy, and to hasten the reign of justice and brotherhood upon earth.\"\nAs showing the relation of the Fellowship to the Socialist party, the following resolution addressed to that body was important: \"As active members of the Socialist party we thoroughly accept the economic interpretation of social and political causes, and have no desire to qualify it by any revisionist demand; and we are fully convinced that, as a matter of policy, the party ought strictly to avoid every form of religious and anti-religious theory or dogma on the lecture platform and in the party publications; and that such opinion should be regarded as a private matter, every one having the fullest liberty of belief and expression as an individual. In other words, that the Socialist party stands for economic and in no sense whatever for religious or anti-religious propaganda.\"\nThe importance of this resolution was constituted in a two-fold way. In the first place, attempts were made in the U.S. as well as in other countries, by a few members of the party, to force upon the Socialist movement the brand of \"atheism\" which the ellowship firmly combated. In the second place, the so-called \"Christian Socialist\" movements in European countries, Austria and Denmark, for example, were sometimes vehemently hostile to genuine Socialism, and those masquerading as sympathizers. The U.S. movement, therefore, had to overcome a fear on the part of old members of the Socialist party, that the Fellowship intended to do all it could to break down the proletarian revolution already far advanced. The Fellowship did well to express its clear-cut position on both these issues.\nOrgan\nThe burden of editing and financing The Christian Socialist in the days when it struggled for its existence, and the toil of organizing the Fellowship, were exceedingly heavy. To Rev. Edward Ellis Carr, minister of the Methodist church, and his wife were instrumental in this work. Although receiving a large salary from the parish he was serving, Rev. Carr left all to labor for Socialism, and though always supported by his wife, he was obliged for some years to fight for existence for himself and family.\nInternational spread\nSuccessful conferences of the Fellowship during 1908 were conducted in New York City, Baltimore, Asbury Park, New Jersey, and Old Orchard, Maine, and a tent was erected and maintained through the summer at Coney Island, presenting lectures and entertainments bearing upon Socialism. By 1909, the Fellowship had district secretaries in 26 states, the District of Columbia and the province of New Brunswick, Canada, and was represented by its membershi",

Perhaps this readability derives from their \"mystery\"\u2014even if we never come to understand it.\nHe adds: \"The stories give you a few clues and the rest is up to you.\"\nNovelist and short story writer Eudora Welty in the New York Times offered this assessment of the collection:\n Each story's truth is distilled by Pritchett through a pure concentration of human character...The paradoxes, the stratagems, the escapes, the entanglements, the humors and dreams, are all projections of the individual human being, all by himself alone. In its essence, Pritchett's work, so close to fantasy, is deeply true to life.\nNotes\n",

Recorded in a similar fashion to Milia's debut solo album Alone at St. Hugo, it was once again produced in the Ypsilanti home studio of Ben Collins to a Tascam 388 reel-to-reel tape recorder. The album cover features Milia and his wife, Lauren, standing in front of Sylvan Lake\u2014with Keego Harbor and Waterford in the background.\nReception\nGiving the album four stars, the United Kingdom's Morning Star claimed: \"Milia is one of the great American songwriters working today... delightful, bittersweet stuff.\"\nDescribing Milia as \"the poet laureate of disillusioned suburban romantics,\" the Columbia Tribune wrote that \"the songwriter beautifully, bleakly documents the people, places and casual ruin that comprise our image of home\u2014holding out the flickering light of solidarity as he keeps vigil for what used to be.\" They continued: \"Keego Harbor\" features the most realized arrangements of Milia's solo career, a subtly-layered folk-rock sound that casts him as a Harry Nilsson figure for the indie generation. The album is both a wonderful entry point into Milia's songwriting, and a soulful next step for listeners keeping stride all along.\"\nSpeaking on Milia's literary tone of voice and Keego Harbor's emotional themes, Hour Detroit wrote: \"That voice has always been unapologetically rooted in Detroit\u2019s suburbs, referencing things like I-75, the Franklin Cider Mill, and northbound Lions traffic (to the Silverdome) in his lyrics. Though most people consider these outlying areas\u2014with their strip malls and fast food corridors\u2014blandly interchangeable, Milia mines their poetic complexity.\"\nA live session and interview for Acoustic Caf\u00e9 aired in March of 2022, during which host Rob Reinhart commented on the album's poignant depiction of suburban decay and bittersweet indictment of the American dream: \"It\u2019s interesting that your songs kind of capture them for ever in this particular state of decline.

Karen said the lyric of that song was inspired by the \"transportive quality\" of objects found in the \"natural world\", explaining that a \"sewing thread when I'm mending something could remind me of a street map.\" She said that while writing the song, she was \"envisioning the landscape as a world of doorways that might allow us to locate memory, or to be nearer in some way to people we miss.\" Karen related this lyrical concept to the song's recording, explaining that the band were seeking to \"find the half-remembered beauty of sing-alongs of our 1970s childhoods.\"\nKaren said the song \"Midwinter Swimmers\" was about \"looking ahead to the arrival of a loved and dear person\". She said the contrast between the two words in the title reminded her of how \"fragile-looking, small and pale winter flowers like snowdrops are actually so hardy and enduring that they can bloom in the snow. And this seemed to connect also with the bravery of the person who has been away.\"\nRelease and promotion\n\"This Thread Is a Green Street\" was released as a one-track digital download and streaming single on September 3, 2024.

    "\nPedro Romero de Terreros\nThe 1766 Real del Monte strike or 1766 miners' strike was a strike that occurred in the mines of Pachuca and Real del Monte when Pedro Romero de Terreros abolished the workers' party, reduced wages from 4 reales to 3 reales, and increased the workload to gain more profits.\nThe miners were protesting for this reason, and they expressed their discontent to the authorities in Pachuca, but they did nothing to resolve it and told them to speak to the viceroy Joaqu\u00edn Juan de Montserrat y Cru\u00eflles. This statement led to violent conflicts on August 15, 1766.\nBackground\nThe mines of Pachuca and Real del Monte\nView of Real del Monte\nLocated in the north of the Gulf of Mexico, its mines contained silver, lead, zinc, copper, and gold. The district was divided into two parts, Pachuca and Real del Monte.\nDue to its proximity to Mexico City, it received special interest in the search for precious metals. Thus, it became the closest mine to the capital that produced silver, facilitating its exploitation.\nThe discovery of the mines was made on April 25, 1552 by Alonso Rodriguez de Salgado. Between 1544 and 1555, after many attempts, Bartolome Medina found a way to extract silver. From that moment on, many workers moved there.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, most of the local mines were flooded, and operations were halted. The towns became depopulated, and workers migrated to other mining areas. Jose Alejandro Bustamante and Bustillo and Pedro Romero de Terreros signed a contract to collaborate in draining the mines. As a result, the minerals of Real del Monte could be exploited again, and consequently, the Pachuca district ranked fourth in New Spain in silver production. This made De Terreros the richest man in New Spain.\nThe Pachuca district was the fourth largest in New Spain in terms of silver production, behind Guanajuato, Real de Catorce, and Zacatecas. Pedro Romero de Terreros was the wealthiest person in New Spain.\n",

Little is known about how the attack developed, but a Burkinabe press release stated that there was \"particularly intense\" fighting between the jihadists and the soldiers. The press release also stated that the Burkinabe soldiers were overpowered by a larger group of jihadist reinforcements.

Michels also studied architecture at Harvard.\nCareer\nAnt Farm\nMichels met Chip Lord in 1968, when Michels gave a guest lecture at Tulane University, where Lord was attending school. The two met again in August 1968 at an architecture workshop directed by Lawrence Halprin in San Francisco. It was at this workshop where Michels and Lord founded Ant Farm.We wanted to be an architecture group that was more like a rock band.  We were telling Sharon  that we would be doing underground architecture, like underground newspapers and underground movies, and she said, 'Oh, you mean like an Ant Farm?' and that's all it took.  It was very Ant Farm.  The founding of the name was indicative of how Ant Farm worked: the right idea comes, everybody acknowledges it is the right idea and instantly adopts it.\u2014\u200aDoug Michels\nThe group's initial goal was to reform education, but with little funding, Michels and Lord relocated to Houston, Texas, where they both became visiting professors at the University of Houston. It was in Houston where the group first began putting on performances, including their \"inflatables.\"  Eventually, Lord and Michels were joined by Hudson Marquez and Curtis Schreier.\nThe group was a self-described \"art agency that promotes ideas that have no commercial potential, but which we think are important vehicles of cultural introspection.\" In addition to their architecture works, the collective was well known for their counter-cultural performances and media events, such as Media Burn.

The club fields teams in both hurling and Gaelic football.\nHistory\nLocated in the village of Rathdrum, County Wicklow, Avondale GAA Club was founded in 1886. Nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell made the grounds of Avondale House available to the club in the early days, while his brother, John Howard Parnell, became club president. Avondale had its first successes in 1908 when the club secured a SHC-SFC double. The club continued to win championship titles in all grades and in both codes throughout its history, including in the Wicklow SHC. In 1964, Avondale won its 12th Wicklow SHC title to lead the all-time roll of honour for the first time in their history. The club's last SHC triumph was in 1983, however, Avondale has since won several JAHC and IHC titles. Avondale amalgamated with neighbouring club Barndarrig for a brief period and contested the SHC before being relegated to the IHC as separate clubs.\nHonours\nWicklow Senior Football Championship (1): 1908\nWicklow Senior Hurling Championship (14): 1908, 1915, 1931, 1936, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1960, 1964, 1966, 1983\nWicklow Intermediate Football Championship (3): 1977, 2004, 2012\nWicklow Intermediate Hurling Championship (2): 2018, 2024\nWicklow Junior Football Championship (3): 1942, 1953, 1996\nWicklow Junior Hurling Championship (4): 1931, 1955, 1995, 1997\nNotable players\nJimmy Kearns: All-Ireland JHC-winning captain (1967)",

    "A motto against Israel\nThe slogan of Down With Israel in three languages: Persian, Arabic and English; Written on a poster related to a march in Iran. (2017, Bojnord, march condemning the transfer of the capital of Israel to Jerusalem)\nDown with Israel or Death to Israel is a political slogan against Israel, which is also used in Iran and other countries such as Iraq and Mexico. Every year, Iranian pilgrims sing the slogan of \"death to Israel\" during the Hajj rituals and the ceremony of disavowal of polytheists. This slogan is especially chanted against Israel by demonstrators on Quds Day and is often accompanied by the burning of the Israeli flag. This slogan has also been used in the atmosphere of the Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran. In the film released from Iran's missile exercise during Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency, the slogan \"Death to Israel\" was written on ballistic missiles that were fired at replicas. This slogan in Iran does not mean a mere political slogan, but an expression of the vision of the Iranian government towards Israel's current in the region.\nOther uses\nHouthi movement\nThe slogan on the flag of the Houthis in Yemen is as follows: \"God is greater, Death to America, Death to Israel, curse to the Jews, victory to Islam.\"\nThe slogan of the Houthis, the Shiite rebel group in Yemen, which Iran also supports, is \"God is greater, death to America, death to Israel, curse to the Jews, victory to Islam\". This slogan is also one of the slogans used by Hezbollah in Lebanon. Tariq Alhomayed believes that the slogan of death to Israel in the Arab world has lost its function and holding reconciliation agreements between the Arab countries of the region with Israel is proof of this claim. This slogan, as one of the symbols of hatred against Israel, has been noticed by the rulers of the Middle East region.\nReactions\nOpponents\nNikki Haley, the former representative of the United States in the United Nations, in a tweet, considered this slogan, along with the slogan of death to America, as a reason to oppose Iran. She believes that Iran is looking for nuclear weapons and is seeking to realize these two slogans. Akram Meknes, one of the Arabic language writers, considers the slogan of death to Israel as an erosion slogan that does not convince even children these days and has lost its effectiveness. Karim Sadjadpour considers the slogan of death to America, along with death to Israel, as well as the hijab, to be the main foundations of the Islamic Republic of Iran's ideology, which remains for them in the 2020s. Benjamin Netanyahu, referring to this slogan, considers it a proof of the radical atmosphere ruling in Iran.\nThe slogan of death to Israel in the parade of the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran\nSupporters\nAccording to the Islam Quest website, this slogan is permissible due to the \"tyranny of the Israeli government\". Ali Al Bukhaiti, the former spokesman and the official media face of the Houthis, said: \"We really do not want anyone's death. This slogan is only against the intervention of those governments .\" Ali Khamenei also considered this slogan as the \"slogan of the Iranian nation\" and does not consider it specific to one of the Iranian cities. Masoud Jazayeri, the spokesman of the Iranian Armed Forces, also claimed in an interview that: \"Cries of death to America, death to England, death to Israel, etc. did not arise overnight; That by saying this reason and that reason, it should be removed from the political discourse of nations wounded by imperialism and arrogance and domination regimes.\"\nMargins\nOne of the students of the University of Adelaide in Australia, named Habibah Jaghoori, who was the editor of that university's magazine, was expelled from the university for publishing an anti-Semitic article titled \"Death to Israel\" in it. This incident is related to September 15, 2022.\nIn an article entitled \"Death to Israel\" dated August 4, 2022, Jaghoori wrote in the journal of this university:\nThe solution to achieving peace and establishing justice for Palestine is to demand the destruction of Israel.\nFree Palestine and death to Israel.\u2014\u200aJaghoori, The Times of Israel\nSee also\nIran\u2013Israel relations\nNeither Gaza nor Lebanon, My Life for Iran\nLittle Satan\nPolitical slogans of the Islamic Republic of Iran\nCarthago delenda est\nDeath to America\nThe Zionist regime\nThe law countering the hostile actions of the Zionist regime against peace and security\nIsrael won't exist in 25 years\nReactions in Iran to the Gaza War (2008-2009)\nOperation Tyre\nOperations attributed to Israel in Iran\nIsrael and the nuclear program of Iran",

    "The 1986 Lower Saxony state election was held on 15 June 1986 to elect the members of the 11th Landtag of Lower Saxony. The election result was reportedly affected by the Chernobyl disaster which happened two weeks earlier.\nBackground\nIn the 1982 state elections\u00a0, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Minister-President of Lower Saxony Ernst Albrecht achieved its best result ever in Lower Saxony with 50.7 percent of the vote, while the Social Democratic Party (SPD) under Karl Ravens suffered heavy losses.\nSince this was already Ravens' second loss against Albrecht, he decided not to run as a candidate again in 1986.\nWhen the SPD was looking for a candidate, the SPD leadership originally favoured former Federal Minister Anke Fuchs. However, after the former Federal Chairman of the Juso and then-Hanoverian MP Gerhard Schr\u00f6der announced his candidacy and secured the support of several SPD district associations, Fuchs gave up being top candidate.\nThere were some disputes within the SPD over the coalition question: While chancellor candidate Johannes Rau had ruled out a coalition with the Greens for the federal election planned for January 1987 and was counting on the SPD having its own majority, Schr\u00f6der did not want to rule out a red-green coalition in general.\nThe disputes between Rau and Schr\u00f6der on this issue were one of the election campaign issues.\nParties and candidates\nThe state electoral committee approved 706 candidates (567 men and 139 women). The 623 district nominations consisted of 508 men and 115 women from 10 parties and individual candidates, the 389 state nominations consisted of 309 men and 80 women. Of these, 306 (56 women) also ran for a district nomination.\nResults\nWhile the CDU lost its absolute majority, the SPD again exceeded the 40 percent mark thanks to significant gains. In addition, around a third of the CDU's direct mandates went to the SPD. The Greens and the FDP only recorded minimal gains. Even though there was renewed circulation of candidacies from the other parties and some new parties were eligible, the small parties again received less than one percent of the votes together. The DKP's votes also halved compared to the last election.\nFormation of a government\nThe CDU formed a coalition with the FDP, which had a majority of one vote. \u00a0Albrecht was then confirmed as Minister President. Schr\u00f6der resigned from his Bundestag mandate and moved into state politics as SPD parliamentary group leader and opposition leader.Main article: Cabinet Albrecht V\nIn December 1988, a constructive vote of no confidence against Albrecht, brought by the SPD parliamentary group because of the casino affair, failed by 76 votes to 79. At least one member of the opposition parties SPD and Greens must have voted for Albrecht.\nSee also\nList of members of the Lower Saxony State Parliament (11th electoral term)\u00a0\nFurther reading\nForschungsgruppe Wahlen: Wahl in Niedersachsen.

    "1994 film by Tibor Takacs\nBad Blood (known in most international territories as Viper) is a 1994 American neo-noir action film directed by Tibor Tak\u00e1cs, starring Lorenzo Lamas, Frankie Thorn, Hank Cheyne, Joe Son and John P. Ryan. Lamas stars as a bitter ex-cop who, after losing his badge and serving time to protect his crook brother, is asked by their father and his ex\u2014now the brother's girlfriend\u2014to defend him once more against a powerful mobster he has defrauded. Like MDP's earlier Joshua Tree, Bad Blood mixes noir with Hong Kong influences, and it shares some personnel with that film.\nPlot\nUnrepentant shyster Franklin Blackstone is ambushed on a parking lot by two mobsters who accuse him of defrauding their organization, with the help of an associate named Ricardo. Franklin escapes the hit, but Ricardo, his wife and their young daughter are cruelly executed by a lone killer while picnicking at a public park. Meanwhile, Franklin's brother Travis, who works for a motor scrapyard, notices a woman observing him at a baseball diamond. The woman is accosted by members of the same gang that earlier targeted Franklin. Travis takes her defense but she leaves hurriedly. Later, she reconnects with Travis at a bar, where she is revealed to be Rhonda, his ex-girlfriend. Travis' current girlfriend Lindee, an employee of the bar, is displeased to see the two hanging out. Rhonda informs Travis that his brother has run into trouble once again.\nTravis is unsympathetic, but agrees to visit him when he learns that he has taken in the brothers' ailing father, John. Travis has an uneasy reunion with Franklin and their father, who pleads with him to help his younger sibling buy enough time with the mob to reimburse the money he owes, ostensibly $100,000. It is revealed that Travis is a former cop who was expelled from the force and served time in prison after taking the fall for Franklin in a previous scam, as he wanted to protect him from prison violence. While he was away, Rhonda started dating Franklin, although she hints that she might still be interested in him. Franklin's house is attacked by more henchmen looking to abduct the senior Blackstone, but Travis again helps repel them. Traumatized by the intrusion, Franklin reveals that he has implicated the father's companies in a money laundering scheme for the cartel, and that the money he stole actually amounts to $5 million. He has since lost it after entrusting it to a shifty friend who swore he squandered it in a get-rich-quick scheme of his own.\nMeanwhile, one of the henchmen who escaped the confrontation reports back to \"Buddha\" Chang, the cartel's boss and the sadistic killer of Ricardo and his family. Chang is informed that their efforts were thwarted by the same man they saw with Rhonda at the baseball park. Travis moves his father to the home of an old friend, nicknamed \"Preacher\", while the rest of the group rent rooms at a downtown hotel. The brothers then pay a visit to Franklin's former partner who, under duress, reveals that he still has much of the money Franklin invested with him. Now flush with cash again, Franklin balks at actually giving it back to the mob. Meanwhile, a suspicious Lindee visits Franklin's place looking for Travis and Rhonda. Although they have left the place, she finds Chang there. She offers the kingpin an alliance. In exchange for information leading him to Franklin, Chang will kill Travis as punishment for going back to Rhonda.\nCast\nLorenzo Lamas as Travis Blackstone\nFrankie Thorn as Rhonda\nHank Cheyne as Franklin Blackstone\nJoe Son as \"Buddha\" Chang\nKimberley Kates as Lindee\nJohn P.

McKay as Baggy\nBeau Starr as Bo\nVinnie Curto as Will Sharp\nSimon Rhee as Thug Lee\nStanley Yale as \"Preacher\"\nChuck Zito as Toots\nKent Bryant and Kurt Bryant as Sacs\nProduction\nThe film was written by Neil Ruttenberg, before director Tibor Takacs' frequent collaborator and fellow Canadian Brian Irving took a pass at the screenplay. Although he went uncredited for his rewrite, Irving received mention as an associate producer. The script's title, also the filming title, was Smoke on the Water. The IMDb, based on unspecified sources, puts filming circa June 1993, with the budget coming in at close to US$2,000,000. Gordon Hessler, who had directed several action films for producer Alan Amiel while the latter worked for Trans World Entertainment in the 1980s, served as second unit director. Principal photography took place in the Los Angeles agglomeration. Some sources mention Indianapolis, Indiana, as an additional location, but there is no such indication in the credits.\nAfter filming, the title was changed to Viper for international markets, and Bad Blood for North America, which star Lorenzo Lamas said was the intended title. In the U.S., the film was substantially edited to secure an R rating from the MPAA. The original cut remained intact in a number of international territories.\nRelease\nTheatrical\nTh",

(2024) scored Emiliasaura in a phylogenetic analysis and found it to be the most basal member of the Rhabdodontomorpha. This makes it the oldest known member of the clade and the first one known from South America. Their results are displayed in the cladogram below:\nPaleoenvironment\nThe Mulichinco Formation where Emiliasaura was found also produced the remains of an indeterminate diplodocid, the dicraeosaurid Pilmatueia, the carcharodontosaurid Lajasvenator, and podocarp trees. \n",

    "\n2024 studio album by Yeat\nLyfestyle is the fifth studio album by the American rapper Yeat, released through Lyfestyle Corporation, Field Trip Recordings and Capitol Records, on October 18, 2024. The album features guest appearances from Don Toliver, Kodak Black, Lil Durk, and Summrs, while the production was handled by Empathy, Primo, Synthetic, and Yeat himself, with support from Oscar4400XY, Quincy Sxbra, Sharkboy, and several other producers. The album serves as a follow-up to his previous studio album, 2093 (2024).\nBackground and recording\nUpon the release of the album, Yeat appeared in an interview with The Fader, during which he revealed he had 4,800 beats shortlisted for the album. Yeat's manager, Zack Bia stated that Yeat would wake up at \"7 in the morning my time, 4 in the morning on the West Coast\" to FaceTime him and record tracks on his bedside. Yeat admitted that \"this time it  longer than it normally ever has\" to decide upon the album's final tracklist and that the album is \"a little bit more curated\" than his previous bodies of work. In the interview, Yeat expressed that \"Lyfestyle  basically just my normal rap shit\", and that \"it\u2019s not futuristic, it\u2019s not like a whole different world\" while noting that it's more \"polished\" than his previous records. Bia added that \"Noah's  music-making process is so insulated because he makes music only by himself\" and that \"there's no outside noise when he's actually making music. Even when I'm with him, he'll be like, \u2018Okay, I'm gonna go make music now, you guys can leave\".\nDuring the interview, the album's executive producer Synthetic revealed that Yeat asked him to produce the entirety of the album:When it comes to creating something new with an artist and you're really trying to push to that next level, it's complicated, because you don't want to push too hard.  2093 was very experimental, right?  the feedback on that was very mixed. When we were trying to craft this album, we wanted to make sure that we were delivering what the fans wanted but also creating something that the fans hadn't heard yet but felt familiar.\nRelease and promotion\nFollowing the release of 2093 in February of the same year, Yeat would begin to tease \"a year worth of music\". On September 17, 2024, Yeat's label, Lyfestyle Corporation shared a video of \"Lyfestyle\" being spray painted in graffiti style on a Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n, parked on Rodeo Drive. Two days later, on September 19, he released the SoundCloud-exclusive single \"TurnMeUp\", the song's cover art being the spray-painted Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n. On October 9, Yeat released the official trailer for Lyfestyle. On October 14, Yeat shared the album's cover art, soon followed by the release of the album's official tracklist on October 17.\nCritical reception\nLyfestyle received generally favorable reviews from music critics. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 60, based on four reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Writing for Clash, Robin Murray wrote that \"Yeat manages to conjure a form of explicit subtlety\", however, \"there\u2019s so much to absorb\" and at times, the album can become \"overwhelming\". Concluding his review, Murray wrote that \"continuing his game of tension and release, revelation and disguise, Lyfestyle reinforces Yeat's singular status\". Rolling Stone's Mosi Reeves wrote that the album \"details distorted in a cacophony of electronic noise\" and that \"it\u2019s an album that invites fast-forwarding to one\u2019s favorite cuts, not deep and focused listening\". Paul Attard for Slant stated that the album \"is Yeat\u2019s giddiest release to date\" and that \"each song ably  off the momentum of the one before it\", allowing the album to \"feels like one constantly mutating track\". Attard noted that the album \"might be too cohesive, despite periodic genre switch-ups\", before concluding that \"the quality and sleekness of Lyfestyle should mark the definitive end of any doubts about Yeat\u2019s musicianship\".\nCommercial performance\nIn the United States, Lyfestyle debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, earning 89,000 album-equivalent units (including 60,000 in pure sales) in its first week. Thus causing Lyfestyle to become Yeat's first number one album on the chart, alongside his fifth consecutive top ten. The album accumulated a total of 39.67 million on-demand streams of its songs. In its second week, Lyfestyle set the record as the seventh largest drop from number one in Billboard 200 history, as the album descended 69 spots to number 70 in its second week.\nContributing factors for Lyfestyle\u2019s pure album sales count to relatively high could be because Lyfestyle is Yeat\u2019s first album to be released on CD, as well as on his official website different box sets that include merchandise such as T-shirts, balaclavas, and hoodies were released. Signed Insert CD\u2019s of Lyfestyle were also selling on Discogs when the album was first released",

He is the son of former longtime Fairfax County Board of Supervisors chairman Jack Herrity. He obtained a bachelor's degree in accounting from Virginia Tech.\nHerrity has held senior management positions in a number of Northern Virginia government contracting and technology companies.\nPolitical career\nA member of the Republican Party, Herrity was first elected to the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in 2007. In 2009, Herrity ran in a special election for the position of chairperson vacated by newly elected congressman Gerry Connolly. He lost to Democrat Sharon Bulova by a close margin of 1,206 votes out of 103,972 cast. In 2010, Herrity ran in the Virginia's 11th congressional district election against Connolly, but lost the Republican primary to Keith Fimian, a more conservative candidate.\nHerrity was reelected in 2011 and 2015 without major-party opposition. In 2019, he narrowly defeated Democrat Linda Sperling by around 600 votes out of more than 40,000 cast. Since 2020, Herrity has been the only Republican on the Board of Supervisors. In 2023, Herrity was endorsed by The Washington Post editorial board and Democratic state senator Chap Petersen. He defeated Democratic challenger Albert Vega by 14 percentage points.\nIn October 2024, Herrity revealed he was strongly considering running in the 2025 Virginia lieutenant gubernatorial election.\nPolitical positions\nHerrity was described by The Washington Post in 2019 as a \"voice of fiscal restraint on the board\". In office, Herrity advocated for reforming Fairfax County's employee compensation and pension programs. He vocally opposed a proposed 4 percent county tax on prepared food and beverages, which voters defeated in a 2016 referendum. In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Herrity supported allowing for optional in-person learning in schools and opposed Northern Virginia easing restrictions later than the rest of the state.\nIn 2022, Herrity was the only member of the Board to not vote for a climate resilience plan, abstaining due to concerns about its cost. He voted to put a list of reproductive health resources on the county's website in 2022, and called for the list to also include adoption resources and support for full-term pregnancies. Herrity was one of two board members to vote against a 30% member pay raise in 2023. In 2024, Herrity called on Fairfax County to end sanctuary county policies for undocumented immigrants and honor detainment requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n",

    "Species of plant\nCommelina madagascarica is a monocotyledonous, herbaceous plant in the dayflower family from Madagascar. It is commonly known as nifin'akanga in Madagascar, where it is used medicinally as an abortifacient, a galactogogue, and a treatment for conjunctivitis and acne. It is also used for ritual purposes in joro or ancestral invocation around the Lake Alaotra region.\nIt has delicate, richly blue flowers, narrow leaves, and bushy stems. Its roots are fibrous, fleshy, and fusiform. These roots, and the plant's buried rhizome, make it very resistant to prairie fires.\nThe species was first described by Charles Baron Clarke in 1881. Commelina madagascarica is one of the most common plants found in the pseudo-steppe grasslands formed anthropogenically by grass fires in Isalo Massif. Generally, it is common to dry prairies and rocky areas between 1,500 meters (4,900\u00a0ft) and 2,000 meters (6,600\u00a0ft) above sea level.\nThe Malagasy Nifin'akanga abortion-rights movement group takes its name from the plant, since it is commonly used in illicit abortions.\n",
    "German politician (born 1944)\nJ\u00fcrgen Kleditzsch (born 26 January 1944) is a German physician and former politician of the East German Christian Democratic Union (CDU).\nHe served as the GDR's last Minister of Health in the cabinet of Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re.\nLife and career\nEarly career\nKleditzsch completed his high school diploma (Abitur) in 1962 and subsequently undertook a one-year nursing internship at the Sebnitz District Hospital. From 1963 to 1969, he studied medicine at Karl Marx University in Leipzig.\nAfter earning his doctorate in medicine (Dr. med.), he trained as a specialist in physiotherapy from 1969 to 1974 at the Occupational Health Service at uranium mining company SDAG Wismut and the Kneipp Health Resort in Berggie\u00dfh\u00fcbel. He completed his training as a specialist in physiotherapy in 1974. Three years later, he was recognized as a specialist in orthopedics.\nIn 1981, he earned his habilitation (Dr. sc.) with a thesis on bone healing.\nFrom 1974 to 1989, he worked at the Medical Academy of Dresden, initially as the head of the Physiotherapy Department at the Orthopedic Clinic, and in 1978, he was appointed senior physician of the clinic. In 1985, he took on a teaching position in physiotherapy at the Medical Academy of Dresden and was appointed associate professor in 1987. From 1988, he led various work and research groups.\nSince 1972, he was involved in the Society for Physiotherapy of the GDR, first as a board member and from 1979 as the society's secretary.\nBloc party politician\nKleditzsch joined the East German Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a bloc party beholden to the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED), in 1977.\nFrom 1984, he was a member of the Bezirk Dresden CDU board, and from 1987, he was the head of its Health Policy Working Group.\nIn December 1989, during the Peaceful Revolution, he was appointed Bezirksarzt of Bezirk Dresden, making him the full-time head of the Bezirk's health department and a member of the Bezirk government.\nde Maizi\u00e8re Government\nIn the first free elections in the GDR, Kleditzsch was elected to the Volkskammer in March 1990 for Bezirk Dresden, being the first-placed candidate on the CDU's list. He was thereafter appointed as Minister of Health in the cabinet of Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re, serving from April until October 1990.\nKleditzsch had to deal with the GDR's crumbling health care system during his tenure, many hospitals being in a state of disrepair and suffering from severe labor and material shortages. These problems were exacerbated by the wave of refugees in the summer of 1989. His main concern was to ensure the stability of medical care and at the same time to push ahead with the restructuring of structures. In the few months leading up to the unification of the two German states, around a dozen laws and regulations are passed that create the legal framework for the transfer of the GDR's health care system to a unified Germany.\nFrom August 1990, he also served as acting Minister for Labor and Social Affairs in the aftermath of the SPD and their ministers leaving the coalition government.\nReunified Germany\nKleditzsch was one of 144 Volkskammer members co-opted to the Bundestag following German reunification on 3 October 1990.

In 1992, he left the Medical Academy at his own request.\nHe left the CDU in 2002.\nKleditzsch worked as a specialist physician in the Neu-Ulm district of Gerlenhofen and now runs a private orthopedic practice in a Bad W\u00f6rishofen hotel.\n",
    "An Iranian politician and university professor\nHossein Samsami Mazra'eh Akhound (born 1967 in Najaf) is an Iranian politician and institutionalist economist, an assistant professor in the Department of Economics at Shahid Beheshti University and a representative of the 12th term of the Islamic Consultative Assembly from Tehran, Rey, Shemiranat, Eslamshahr and Pardis constituencies. In 2008, he was the interim head of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance for a while, but he was not nominated to the parliament for the ministry. In 2019, he was appointed to the position of the deputy chairman of the Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation.\nSamsami has worked on the issue of exchange rates in Iran and defended his doctoral thesis entitled \"A model for calculating the appropriate exchange rate during the structural reform of Iran\" with the guidance of professor Mohammad Naser Sherafat Jahromi. Samsami has published several articles in this field. According to Samsami, the free currency market is a corrupt, fake market and a place of enemy influence, and until it is dissolved, the price will increase and there will be no stability in the currency market.\nThe most important economic idea of Samsami is that the price of the dollar is not real and hence he is also known as Mr. Cheap Dollar. He does not consider the dollar and other foreign currencies to be affected by the inflation rate like other goods in the domestic economy, and he does not accept that high inflation and low productivity in the use of resources lead to a decrease in the value of the rial, but on the contrary, he believes that the unrealistic price of the dollar leads to an increase in the inflation rate. Therefore, even though he was known as a fundamentalist and a critic of the Rouhani government, he seriously supported the method of calculating the price and taking action to implement the policy of allocating 4,200 Toman dollars (known as the Jahangiri currency). In several interviews, Samsami expressed his opposition to the attempt to remove this plan in the government of Ebrahim Raisi, who was forced to do it so after the shortage of foreign exchange resources, and considers this action to be the root cause of the increase in inflation in his government. In another similar approach, Samsami is against the plan of targeting subsidies for a fairer distribution of government subsidies, which was implemented in the fundamentalist government of Ahmadinejad, and says, \"Our economy was wounded with purposefulness.\" Samsami introduced the payment of cash subsidy in this plan as a cause for the worsening of the condition of the poor after its implementation, and he considered the reason for this to be the inflation created by this plan, and rejected the Central Bank's estimate that its implementation only caused 5% inflation without presenting his own estimate of the created inflation. He does not accept the short-term and long-term anti-inflationary effects of this plan, caused by the increase in productivity, which was not included in the Central Bank's estimate. In a research, Samsami had predicted that with the implementation of this plan in 2010, assuming the stability of other conditions in the model of targeting subsidies with cash payment, the Gini coefficient would first decrease from 39% to 35% and then increase again to 42% in 2011. So, the net effect of this plan is to increase the Gini coefficient and inequality becomes more in Iran economic system. But in practice, despite the occurrence of sanctions against Iran in 2011, the Gini coefficient index continued its downward trend until 2014, and then the slope of its graph increased.\nSupervisor in the Ministry of Economy\nAfter the resignation of Davoud Danesh-Jafari from the head of the Ministry of Economy in May 2008, the president appointed Samsami as the acting minister of economy at the request of Parviz Davoodi. His tenure in the Ministry of Economy exceeded the statutory 3 months due to the entry of the 8th Parliament into the summer vacation, and the government obtained permission from the Leader of the Revolution to continue to carry out his responsibilities in this position.\nDuring Samsami's three-month tenure in this ministry, he had a challenge with the president, one of the reasons for which was the unsuccessful experience of Samsami's attendance at the meeting of the economic committee of the parliament, which caused the dissatisfaction of the members due to his lack of planning and his failure to answer the questions of this commission. The controversial issues that arose during this period between Samsami and the rest of the economic team and the president include Samsami's proposed plan to merge the country's commercial banks to solve the problems of the banking system, the dismissal of Hamid Pourmohammadi from the Ministry of Economy due to a disagreement with Samsami on the merger of banks, which by order of the president Pourmohammadi returned to the Ministry of Economy, ",

He studied under a monk at the Thommayut pagoda of Wat Botum from 1868 to 1874, where he was introduced to the rich traditions of Khmer art. His grandfather was a sculptor, further embedding him in the artistic lineage of Cambodia. After leaving the monastery in 1875, he became a renowned painter:\nArtistic Career\nTep Nimit Mak became a renowned painter, known for his murals and artistic contributions to the Royal Palace of Cambodia. He led the project to paint the walls of the palace with scenes from the Reamker between 1903 and 1904, working alongside Cambodian artists under his direction. Despite the French colonial context, he maintained creative autonomy in these projects.\nHe was also recognized for his architectural contributions, having built significant structures such as the Royal Pagodas of Chruy Ta Keo and Phnom Del. By 1883, he was referred to as the head craftsman of the Royal Palace, and in 1897, at the age of 41, he was elevated to the title of Oknha by the king, signifying his high status and influence. He was later awarded the French Legion of Honor for his services.\nWhile the ceiling paintings of the Salle des Danses are sometimes attributed to Tep Nimit Mak, they were in fact the work of French artists Francois de Marliave.\nTep Nimit Mak contributed to many other landmarks in Cambodia as he built the Royal Pagodos of Chruy Ta Keo, Phnom Del (Chong Prei), Phnom Kruong (Longvek) and Samret Thichei (Anluong Reach).\nTeaching and Influence\nIn 1917, Groslier appointed Tep Nimit Mak as an administrator of the School of Cambodian Arts, where he played a pivotal role in teaching and mentoring young artists. He utilized diagrams from the bas-reliefs of Angkor Wat in his teaching, influencing a new generation of Cambodian artisans. His legacy continued through his students, many of whom became master craftsmen in their own right.\nHowever, his tenure was not without controversy. Allegations arose regarding his favoritism towards certain students, with claims that he manipulated evaluations to benefit those who provided him with gifts. Critics accused him of stifling the development of true artistic talent among Cambodians. Mak's motives were clear to the writers o f the letter: \u201c does not seek to allow the development of progress among Cambodians. He does not wish Cambodians to be instructed; he wants all the services to be solely directed by himself in the interest of preventing the loss o f his benefits\u201d.\nPersonal life and later years\nTep Nimit Mak suffered from Parkinson's disease in his later years, which affected his ability to continue creating art. He retired in 1923 and faced declining health, becoming almost blind by the end of his life. His death marked the end of an era in Cambodian traditional arts.\nLegacy\nTep Nimit Mak is celebrated as an \"old and faithful native collaborator\" of the George Groslier, reflecting his deep commitment to the preservation and promotion of Khmer arts. His influence persists in the ongoing appreciation of Cambodian culture and artistry. \nAs many court artists, Tep Nimit was infuenced by the training he had received in Thailand, where he had studied along with the first Patriarch, Nil Teang. on the occasion of a commission. Ok\u00f1\u0101 Tep Nimit Mak went to perfect his painting knowledge in Bangkok before fulfilling the Royal Palace commission and the frescoes of the walls of the enclosure-gallery of Vat Prah Keo Morokot.\n",

    "Fortress in Sabirabad, Azerbaijan\nJavad was a medieval fortress city of Shirvan in Javad village of Sabirabad District located at the confluence of Kura and Aras. It was founded in the 9th century.\nEtymology\nThe name \"Javad\" is derived from the Arabic word \"jawz\" which means \"crossing\".  Since the toponym is Arabic, it can be concluded that the city was founded in the 9th century during the Shirvanshahs state.  The name of the city of Javad is mentioned in sources in the 16th century.\nJavad (Tsawat).  Author Adam Olearius (1599\u20131671).  The map was drawn in the first quarter of the 18th century.\"\nJawat (Jawat).  Map by Emanuel Bowen (1694\u20131767).  The description dates back to 1747.  The map was drawn up in 1750.  \nHistory\nAncient Javad was considered one of the main points on the trade route between European and Eastern countries.\u00a0 A number of European and Russian travelers and diplomats whose writings have come down to us - English Anthony Jenkinson (October 6, 1561), Russian Artemi Sukhanov (1551-1552), Fyodor Kotov (August, September 1623), German Adam Olearius (March 31, 1637).  ), the Dutchman Jan Janszoon Struys (1671-1672), the Scotsman Bel (December 7, 1716) visited Javad and crossed the bridge built over the ships connected by chains to Iran.  Some of them wrote that there is a settlement here that resembles a city, houses built of bricks and reeds and plastered with mud, gardens, and very famous artisans who produce carpets and various silk fabrics live here, and they even saw their weaving looms. Antony Jenkinson, a merchant-traveler who is an agent of the \"Moscow Company\", reports: \"Again, on the same October 6, 1562, I left Shamakhi with my companions, and after walking 60 miles, the king (meaning Abdollah Khan Ustajlu, the governor of Shirvan) with all kinds of fruits  I reached the city of Javad, where there is a beautiful palace with many gardens.\nAccording to the traveler Adam Olearius, it comes from the word \"javaz\", which means crossing-ferry.  On his way back from Iran in 1563, on April 6, he met Abdulla Khan Ustajlu, the beylarbey (governor) of Shirvan in Javad, in his palace in Javad.  He also receives a document allowing free trade from Beylerbayi.  In this document, a copy of which is kept in A. Jenkinson's memoirs, Beylarbayi states that it was written in his palace in the city of Javad, it was confirmed with a seal in the 12th year of his reign, and he calls himself \"the reigning king of Shirvan and Girgan\".\u00a0Javad was a large settlement in the XVII-XVIII centuries.\nIn the 1720s, they destroyed Javad and the surrounding villages as well as other regions of the historical Shirvan land.  In the fall of 1726, Russian troops headed by General-Lieutenant Shtof entered the Javad settlement on the Kura River.  The settlement was located on Kura and was severely destroyed by the rebels. \u00a0 The border passed through the mulberry groves around the Kura and Aras rivers.\nJavad (Tzawat). It was compiled in 1730. The author is Matth\u00e4us Seutter (1678\u20131757).\nIn 1778, the ruler of Gilan, Hidayat khan by Karim Khan, attacked Javad and captured Hasan Khan.  On April 6, ruler of Gilan attacked Javad after capturing Salyan. The city was fired 7 times. The townspeople were in panic.  It could not be defended.  After that, Hasan Khan left the city with his brother and son and came to ruler of Gilan and begged for forgiveness.  According to historical sources, the population of Javad between 900 and 7500 people was transferred as captives to Rasht.\nThey were taken in the direction of Rasht and Anzali for use in heavy earthworks, fort construction and agricultural work. This event had a negative impact on the historical demographic situation of the population of Javad Khanate. The city of Javad was destroyed and never recovered.\nSources\n\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432, \u0413.\u0411.

    "\nThe 1991 Albanian presidential election marked the second presidential election held on 30 April 1991 in Albania. The transition from the communist regime to a multi-party democracy culminated in the 1991 parliamentary elections, following the death of Enver Hoxha and growing discontent under his successor, Ramiz Alia. The Democratic Party's emergence and subsequent electoral success, alongside protests in response to the results, led to the adoption of a provisional constitution on 29 April 1991, establishing Albania as a parliamentary republic and reintroducing the presidency one day before Alia was elected. Following the elections, Albania experienced significant political upheaval, social unrest, and economic hardship under President Alia, culminating in widespread strikes led by independent trade unions demanding better wages and conditions. The resignation of prime minister Fatos Nano on 4 June, and subsequent government failures, including a severe food shortage that sparked panic and looting, fueled mass emigration as discontent grew, ultimately leading to the Democratic Party's decisive victory in the 1992 elections and Alia's resignation.\nBackground and history\nThe transition from a communist regime in Albania, marked by Enver Hoxha's stringent adherence to Marxist-Leninist principles and authoritarian governance, to a multi-party democratic system reached a pivotal phase during the 1991 parliamentary elections. Following Hoxha's death in 1985, his successor, Ramiz Alia, encountered escalating economic difficulties and widespread social discontent, particularly in the context of significant political changes across Eastern Europe resulting from the Revolutions of 1989. In December 1990, the Democratic Party was founded, signaling the beginning of legislative reforms that dismantled the entrenched one-party system. This development facilitated the collapse of communism in Albania. In the elections, the Party of Labor secured 162 seats in the Kuvendi Popullor, falling just short of the two-thirds majority required for constitutional amendments. Conversely, the Democratic Party garnered substantial support in urban regions, whereas rural constituencies exhibited a tendency to remain loyal to the Party of Labour. Following the elections, significant protests erupted in Shkod\u00ebr in response to the unexpected electoral outcomes, resulting in violent confrontations that led to multiple fatalities and underscoring the fraught political climate of the period. During the inaugural session of the Kuvendi Popullor on 10 April 1991, members of the Democratic Party boycotted proceedings, protesting the lack of thorough investigations into the unrest in Shkod\u00ebr. Subsequently, on 29 April, the parliament adopted a provisional constitution that encompassed the Basic Constitutional Provisions. This act established the parliamentary republic of Albania and reintroduced the presidency as the head of state. Significantly, this development took place one day prior to the official announcement of Alia's election to the presidency.\nElection process\nThe constitution of 29 April marked the first formal foundation of the presidency in Albania following the collapse of the communist regime. The president was elected by the Kuvendi Popullor from at least two candidates for a term of five years. The election process began with the parliament conducting a secret ballot, where a two-thirds majority of all deputies was required in the first round. If no candidate secured this majority, a second round was held in which the two candidates with the highest votes from the first round competed, and an absolute majority was needed to win. Candidates for the presidency had to be proposed by a group of at least 30 deputies. To be eligible, a candidate had to be an Albanian citizen, at least 40 years old, and meet the qualifications necessary to be elected as a deputy. The election of the president had to take place no later than 30 days before the end of the outgoing president's term, and an individual could not serve as president for more than two consecutive terms. If a deputy was elected president, they had to resign from their legislative role. The mandates of the president included ensuring compliance with the constitution and other laws, convening the first session of the newly elected parliamenty, and setting dates for general and local elections. Additionally, the president had the authority to promulgate laws and referendums passed by the parliament, return laws for reconsideration within 15 days of their adoption, and appoint or accept the resignation of the prime minister. In cases where the parliament could not convene, the president could declare states of emergency or war and mobilise national defense efforts. Moreover, the president could issue individual decrees and, in urgent situations, normative decrees that required subsequent approval from the parliament. The president enjoyed immunity for actions taken while in offi",

    "\nAlfred John Aghan (b. 19 July 1890- d. 1961) also known as Alfred or Alf Ah Gan was an Australian Chinese WWI soldier who fought in the New Zealand Army.\nAghan was born in Victoria, Australia on 19 July 1890, to mother Elizabeth Southgate and father William Ah Gan and was one of eleven children.\nLife and First World War\nIn 1904 the 'Ah Gan' family anglicised their name to Aghan during The White Australia Policy. Despite being Australian born with Chinese heritage, the brothers were unable to enlist for service in Australia. The Defence Act in place during WWI meant that some Australians with Chinese ancestry were able to overcome barriers of discrimination that were put in place to deter Chinese and other minority groups from the war effort.\nAt age 25, Aghan left his job in Melbourne as a French polisher and with his brother David and moved to New Zealand.

    "Chinese Semiconductor Company\nTongfu Microelectronics (TFME; Chinese: \u901a\u5bcc\u5fae\u7535; pinyin: T\u014dngf\u00f9 W\u00e9idi\u00e0n) is a partially state-owned publicly listed Chinese semiconductor company headquartered in Nantong, Jiangsu.\nIt is one of the largest Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) companies in mainland China. It has a focus on developing advanced packaging for HPC, new energy, automotive electronics, and memory sectors.\nBackground\nThe origins of TFME can be traced to Nantong Transistor Factory, a state-owned enterprise established in 1966 to produce transistors. After the Chinese economic reform, overseas products came into the market and state-owned enterprise like Nantong Transistor Factory which lacked competitiveness would go into financial distress. By the end of the 1980s, the factory was one of the poorest enterprises in Nantong and was close to bankruptcy.\nIn 1990, Nanjing University graduate, Shi Mingda who was a long term employee of the factory and had become the factory manager decided along with several other employees to acquire the factory. The factory was restructured to a joint-stock company and renamed to Nantong Huada Microelectronics.\nIn 1994, Nantong Huada Microelectronics entered a partnership with Fujitsu where it would transfer the technology to it to assemble logic chips, including microcontrollers and linear integrated circuits, for consumer electronics. Originally a joint venture was suggested but rejected as Fujitsu wanted to try a partnership first.\nIn 1997, Nantong Huada Microelectronics and Fujitsu established a joint venture named Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics (NFME) to assemble and test integrated circuit products. Nantong Huada Microelectronics held 60% to take lead in its management while Fujitsu held 40%.\nOn 16 August 2007, NFME held its initial public offering becoming a listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\nA significant amount of business for NFME came from Fujitsu. However, due to the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis, the amount of business from Japanese Markets decreased so NFME started expanding to expand its business in the United States and Europe.\nIn October 2015, AMD agreed to sell the majority of its interests in two of its Asian manufacturing operations (Suzhou and Penang, Malaysia) to NFME for $371\u00a0million. The deal would involve spinning out the operations into a joint venture with NFME with NFME holding 85% and AMD holding 15%. 1,700 AMD workers at the two factories would become employees of the joint venture.\nIn December 2016, NFME changed its name to Tongfu Microelectronics and removed the Fujitsu branding.\nIn 2018, due to change in business strategy, Fujitsu sold its holdings in TFME to various Chinese stakeholders which included the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund.\nIn May 2024, it was reported that ChangXin Memory Technologies was partnering with TFME to produce High Bandwidth Memory semiconductors to reduce foreign reliance.\nSee also\nAMD\nFujitsu\nJCET\nHuatian Technology\nSemiconductor industry in China",

Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\nBrian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film 3/4 stars, noting its similarities to The Babadook and Under the Skin. He wrote, \"it all works primarily because of Barfoot's oversight of the film's sharp technical elements, including fantastic production design, cinematography, and editing.\" The Guardian's Phil Hoad gave it 3/5 stars, writing, \"A monster, or the supernatural, as a manifestation of uncontainable emotions is hardly a new idea, especially as so-called elevated horror has leaned into the concept... Daddy's Head adopts this increasingly familiar tactic, and just about succeeds in freshening it up with a superlative creature and great production design.\" Alison Foreman of IndieWire gave it a B grade, saying it \"isn\u2019t likely to stick around as a film that genre fans will revisit often, but as far as haunting and half-baked ghost stories, Shudder subscribers could do worse than this sort-of-good-sort-of-bad pain in the neck.\"\nSpencer Perry of ComicBook.com gave the film 2.5/5 stars.

    "\n2024 studio album by Christopher Owens\nI Wanna Run Barefoot Through Your Hair is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Christopher Owens. It was released on October 18, 2024, through True Panther Records. It is his first album in nearly a decade, following the release of Chrissybaby Forever in 2015. Owens co-produced the album mainly in San Francisco with Doug Boehm. It was supported by three singles: \"I Think About Heaven\", \"No Good\" and \"This Is My Guitar\".\nBackground and recording\nI Wanna Run Barefoot Through Your Hair is Christopher Owens' first solo album in over nine years. It was conceived following a long period in which Owens suffered a motorbike crash, separated from his fianc\u00e9e, and experienced homelessness and the death of his Girls bandmate Chet \"JR\" White. His last studio album was Chrissybaby Forever, which was released in May 2015 and was the final entry in a three-album contract with his record label, after which they dropped him. Owens called around and received no responses, realizing he was \"no longer a hot buzz artist\". He describes the time as one of panic over the prospect that \"nobody was ever going to make another record with me\". When he was seriously injured riding on his 1982 Honda MB5, his partner of seven years broke up with him and he was fired from the coffee shop job he took to pay his bills. He had refused to go to the hospital over fears of medical debt, leaving him unable to walk for a month. He was unable to afford rent in San Francisco and began living in his car. A first breakthrough came in 2017 when he performed a gig that he organized in Hong Kong, during which time he wrote the album's first track \"No Good\".\nOwens and White remained in contact following the breakup of Girls. They had planned to reform Girls and make a new album. However, when they eventually convened and began recording demos together, Owens noticed that White struggled to do so: \"It was the first time I\u2019d seen him not be able to stay awake for a session. Not even to be able to hit record.\" Whereas Owens became sober in 2014, White's drug addiction persisted. Owens was reassured when White returned to his family home in Santa Cruz to improve his health. He figured he had just gotten to White at the wrong time and was confident that they would reconvene some months later. However, White died there in October 2020, aged 40, after his heart stopped. Several of the songs intended for that Girls album ended up on I Wanna Run Barefoot Through Your Hair. Owens co-produced the album in San Francisco with Doug Boehm. He also worked with producers Ariel Rechtshaid and Jacob Portrait in New York City on the track \"This Is My Guitar\". In a statement, Owens referred to the album as being about \"a journey back to the center of myself.\"\nThe album's title refers to a quote that Owens misremembered James Stewart saying in the film It's a Wonderful Life (1946).\nRelease\nOn July 30, 2024, Owens released the single \"I Think About Heaven\", his first new music in seven years following the 2017 EP Vante with his band Curls. I Wanna Run Barefoot Through Your Hair was officially announced on August 12, 2024. The single \"No Good\" was released the same day alongside an acoustic performance video. A third single, \"This Is My Guitar\", was released on September 9, 2024, also accompanied by an acoustic performance video. The album was released on October 18, 2024, by True Panther Records, the same label that released all of Girls' music.\nCritical reception\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, I Wanna Run Barefoot Through Your Hair received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 86 out of 100 from 6 critic scores.\nReviewing the album for AllMusic, Fred Thomas awarded it a four and a half out of five star rating and wrote that, \"I Wanna Run Barefoot Through Your Hair highlights how Owens can write songs detailing life's harshest miseries and somehow twist them until the main takeaways are hope and gratitude. It's a rare feat, and Owens accomplishes it on many of these songs, making the album not just a collection of some of his strongest work but a humbling reminder to remember to be thankful for what we have while we have it.\" Joe Goggins of DIY gave the album 5 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Christopher Owens has emerged from it with potentially one of the year's best records.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Christopher Owens\nPersonnel\nChristopher Owens \u2013 performance, production\nDoug Boehm \u2013 production (tracks 1\u20136, 8\u201310), mixing\nAriel Rechtshaid \u2013 production (track 7)\nJacob Portrait \u2013 production (track 7)\nDave Cooley \u2013 mixing",

    "\nChandler Halderson (born March 15, 1998) is an American criminal who murdered and dismembered his parents, Bart and Krista Halderson, in Dane County, Wisconsin, in July 2021. He reported both of his parents missing on July 7, and while being questioned on July 8, authorities found a mutilated torso with several bullet wounds in the woods near a home Chandler was reported to have visited. The remains were determined to be those of Bart Halderson. A week later on July 14, a pair of dismembered legs, identified as Krista Halderson, were found near the Wisconsin River, a spot Chandler often visited. Chandler was arrested initially for lying to detectives but would be subsequently charged with the murders and dismemberments of his parents.\nTrial\nChandler Halderson was charged with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, providing false information on missing persons, mutilating a corpse, and hiding a corpse. Halderson entered a plea of not guilty, and went to trial in January 2022, with opening statements starting on January 4. Prosecutors argued that Chandler murdered his parents after they discovered he was lying about various aspects of his life. Chandler had stated numerous times that he was attending Madison Area Technical College, was an employee with the local branch of American Family Insurance and was planning to move to Titusville, Florida, with his girlfriend Cathryn Mellender, where he would be working at SpaceX.\nThey stated that after being confronted by his father Bart on why he wasn't making any money, Bart called Madison College on behalf of Chandler, where he found out Chandler was not actually enrolled with the school. Prosecutors believe that on a day Bart planned to attend a meeting with Chandler at MATC, Chandler shot him in the back with a high-powered rifle gifted to him by a friend. They believe that shortly after killing his father, he texted his mother Krista, who he also killed when she arrived home. Her specific cause of death couldn't be determined, as the only remains of Krista that would be found were her legs. Halderson was convicted on all charged and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on Thursday, March 17, 2022.\nPortals: Biography Law",
    "\nGuba Fortress refers to the fortress walls that once surrounded the historical center of the city of Quba. It was constructed in 1747 after Huseynali Khan of Quba moved the capital of the Quba Khanate from Khudat to Quba. Following the incorporation of the khanate into the Russian Empire, the fortress lost its strategic importance and was used by the local Russian garrison.\nStarting in 1868, military fortresses in the South Caucasus began to be dismantled. In 1870, a plan was developed to demolish the Quba fortress walls and build additional residential neighborhoods in their place. Shortly thereafter, the demolition of the fortress walls and new construction work began.\nThe fortress city of Quba stretched along the upper terrace of the Qudyal River in a west\u2013east direction and was surrounded by fortress walls constructed from unfired bricks. These walls were approximately 3\u20134 sazhen (6.4\u20138.5 meters) in height, 1 sazhen (2.13 meters) in width, and extended 400 sazhen (852 meters) in length and 130 sazhen (277 meters) in width. The fortress walls featured three gates.\nHistory\nAlthough Quba is an ancient settlement, its strategic significance increased in 1747 when H\u00fcseynali Khan of Quba moved his residence from Khudat to Quba, and it was during this period that the fortress walls were constructed. Starting in 1811, significant reinforcement work was carried out on the Quba fortress. The western and eastern sides of the fortress walls were strengthened with fl\u00e8ches, and a bastion was constructed at the center of the southern wall. Additionally, all the old walls were restored and repaired.\nDuring the Russia-Iranian war, the siege of Quba Fortress by the Iranians, which lasted until 1826, and the 1837 Quba uprising did not contribute to the strengthening or further development of the fortress. However, in 1834, a construction project was approved for the Quba Fortress, aimed at \"ensuring the proper construction of neighborhoods and making the streets more accessible for use by the garrison stationed in Quba.\" By the late 1830s, the fortress had lost its strategic importance. The trenches surrounding the fortress walls were filled in, and fruit orchards were planted around the city. At that time, Count Vasilchikov wrote, \"The city of Quba is almost undefended; the fortress walls that once surrounded the city are now partially collapsed, both due to the passage of time and the city's re-planning efforts.\"\nIn the 1840s, after the stabilization of authority, organized urban planning and construction activities began in Quba. Within a short period, the number of brick and stone buildings in the city reached 780, which was more than double the number of similar buildings in Lankaran at that time (298).\nAfter 1868, the process of dismantling military fortresses in the South Caucasus began. Fortress walls were demolished, trenches were filled in, and this initiative aimed at integrating the fortress and surrounding areas also affected the Quba Fortress. In 1870, a plan was developed to demolish the fortress walls and create additional residential neighborhoods in their place. Shortly after, the demolition of the fortress walls and new construction projects commenced.\nDescription\nReferring to the 1811 military plan of Quba Fortress, Sh. Fatullayev noted that the fortress city stretched along the upper terrace of the Qudyalchay River in a west\u2013east direction. It was surrounded by fortress walls made of unfired bricks, with a height of 3\u20134 sazhen (6.4\u20138.5 meters), a width of 1 sazhen (2.13 meters), a length of 400 sazhen (852 meters), and a width of 130 sazhen (277 meters). The fortress walls had three gates.\nAccording to the main plan of Quba Fortress, three main streets led to the three gates, all originating from the square where the Khan's palace was located. The layout of neighborhoods varied depending on the property owners. Water supply was provided via clay pipes that drew water from the river. On the lower terrace of the Qudyalchay River's left bank, the Jewish quarter was located, featuring buildings and synagogues constructed in a free-form plan. Unlike the fortresses of Ganja and Shaki, Quba Fortress did not have an inner fortress (naringala) or a Khan's palace.\nIn 1842, I. Berezin, who visited Quba, wrote, \"The streets are so astonishingly convoluted that finding your way in Quba is more difficult than in London.\"\nIn the second half of the 19th century, like Baku, the city of Quba was primarily located within its fortress walls, while the suburb was considered the outskirts. However, unlike the Baku fortress, Quba underwent significant changes, with nine well-organized and straight streets laid out inside the fortress. A large Bazaar Square was created in the area of the Quba Khan's palace and the square in front of it, turning the area into the city's commercial hub.\nBy the 1860s, a large caravanserai had been constructed on the northern side of the city's central square. The old Juma Mosque was demolished",
    "Building in Timi\u0219oara, Romania\nDissel House, better known by the local name Turkish House, is a historical building in the Elisabetin district of Timi\u0219oara, Romania. It is considered one of the oldest houses in Timi\u0219oara and the oldest in the non aedificandi area of the fortress.\nHistory\nLegend has it that it was built in the 16th\u201317th centuries, being the only house left from the time of the Teme\u015fvar Eyalet, which is why it is called the Turkish House in the monographies about Timi\u0219oara. The legend also says that here would have been the harem of a pasha, and from the cellar there would be tunnels leading to the fortress and to Belgrade or Petrovaradin.\nThe 1990 expertise of architect Vasile Opri\u0219an found that both the type of bricks used in the construction and the size of the foundations comply with the Austrian norms of the 18th century. In fact, it is the house of engineer captain Kaspar Dissel, one of the first three houses built in the area of the current Elisabetin district after the conquest of the fortress in 1716 by the Habsburgs. On the plans from 1734, no building appears in the Elisabetin area. On the plans from 1746, apart from Dissel's house, there are the Rosalia Chapel, built between 1739\u20131740 and demolished in the 1960s, which was located roughly on the current St. Rosalia Street, and Cambiatura, a post horse exchange point located south of Dissel's house. It is the only one still preserved among the three buildings.\nBetween 1759 and 1763 it belonged to the Misericordian monks.\nArchitecture\nThe house is built in oriental style, having three levels: cellar with cylindrical ceiling, finished with a flat vault, ground floor and first floor. Although legend has it that it was built over the old Turkish vaulted cellar, expertise has shown that both the basement and the rest of the house have a unitary construction and are built of the same materials.\n",

    "Previtamin\nChemical compound\n\u03b1-Zeacarotene (alpha-zeacarotene) is a form of carotene with a \u03b2-ionone ring at one end and a \u03b6-ionone ring at the opposite end. It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of various carotenoids and plays a crucial role in the metabolic pathway leading to the production of lycopene and other important carotenoids.\nChemical structure and properties\nThe molecular formula of \u03b1-zeacarotene is C40H58, with an average molecular weight of 538.89 g/mol. Its IUPAC name is 6--1,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene. The compound is an isomer of \u03b2-zeacarotene and exists in both (6R)-isomer and (trans)-isomer forms.\n\u03b1-Zeacarotene is characterized by a predicted boiling point of 637.98 \u00b0C at 760 mm Hg and an estimated water solubility of 8.7e-14 mg/L at 25\u00b0C, indicating very low solubility in water. Its predicted logP values range from 9.66 to 15.27, highlighting its lipophilic nature.\nBiological role and function\nIn biological systems, \u03b1-zeacarotene functions as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of other carotenoids, including lycopene and \u03b2-carotene. It is primarily located in the cytoplasm and cell membranes. The compound also plays a role in cell signaling and lipid metabolism, particularly within the lipid peroxidation and fatty acid metabolism pathways.\n\u03b1-Zeacarotene has been detected in various plant sources, particularly cereals such as corn and breakfast cereals, and is considered both an endogenous (naturally occurring within organisms) and exogenous (obtained through diet) nutrient.\nAntioxidant activity and health implications\nLike many carotenoids, \u03b1-zeacarotene is recognized for its antioxidant properties, which play a crucial role in neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) within biological systems. ROS are highly reactive molecules that can damage cells, leading to oxidative stress and contributing to the development of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. While \u03b1-zeacarotene's antioxidant activity has not been studied as extensively as other carotenoids like \u03b2-carotene or lycopene, preliminary research suggests it may offer similar protective effects. Diets rich in carotenoids, including \u03b1-zeacarotene, are associated with a reduced risk of these conditions due to their ability to support cellular health and mitigate oxidative damage.\nRole in agriculture and biofortification\n\u03b1-Zeacarotene has also gained interest in agricultural research, particularly in the context of biofortification. Biofortification refers to the process of increasing the nutrient content of crops through conventional breeding or genetic engineering. Because carotenoids are important precursors to vitamin A, biofortifying staple crops like maize, rice, and wheat with \u03b1-zeacarotene and related carotenoids could help combat vitamin A deficiency in regions where access to diverse diets is limited. This deficiency is a significant public health issue, particularly in developing countries, where it can lead to visual impairment and increased susceptibility to infections. The ability to enhance carotenoid content in crops offers a sustainable way to improve nutritional outcomes in vulnerable populations.\nEnvironmental factors and stability in plants\nThe concentration of \u03b1-zeacarotene in plants can be influenced by a variety of environmental factors, including light, temperature, and soil quality. Studies have shown that increased light exposure, particularly in the blue light spectrum, can enhance carotenoid production, including \u03b1-zeacarotene, in plant tissues. However, the compound is also prone to degradation when exposed to excessive sunlight, particularly ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can break down the carotenoid structure and reduce its biological effectiveness. This sensitivity to environmental factors underscores the importance of optimal storage and handling conditions for \u03b1-zeacarotene-rich foods and products, both in agriculture and in post-harvest processes.\nResearch on biosynthetic pathways\nRecent advances in plant molecular biology have allowed researchers to explore the specific enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of \u03b1-zeacarotene. Enzymes such as phytoene synthase and lycopene \u03b2-cyclase play key roles in converting precursor molecules into \u03b1-zeacarotene, which in turn can be further processed into other carotenoids. Genetic manipulation of these enzymes in model plants has demonstrated the potential to alter the levels of \u03b1-zeacarotene and related carotenoids, offering new insights into plant metabolism and the regulation of carotenoid synthesis. Understanding these pathways not only contributes to agricultural innovations but also offers opportunities for improving the nutritional content of foods and developing novel carotenoid-based supplements.\nPotential industrial uses in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals\nBeyond its applications in the food and agricultural industries, \u03b1-zeacarotene holds potential in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical sectors.

    "\nThe church, in 2019\nSt Agatha's Church is an Anglican church in Gilling West, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe church was originally built in the late 11th century, as a small rectangular building with a west tower.  In the 14th century, the nave was altered, and a vestry was added on the north side of the chancel.  Around this time, a new chancel arch and south aisle were added, followed later in the century by a north aisle.  The tower was heightened in the late 15th century, when the windows were also altered.  In 1845, the church was restored by Ignatius Bonomi and John Augustus Cory, who added a second north aisle and a stair turret.  The building was grade I listed in 1969.\nThe church is built of stone and has roofs of Welsh slate, stone slate and lead.  It consists of a nave with a clerestory, a south aisle, a south porch, inner and outer north aisles, a chancel with a north vestry, and a west tower.  The tower has three stages, a five-sided south stair turret with a pyramidal roof, chamfered bands, a three-light west window, a clock face on the east side, straight-headed bell openings, an embattled parapet, and a central weathercock.  In the porch are several pre-Conquest carved stones and some later Mediaeval stones, including a grave cover.  The nave roof is 15th century, while most of the fittings are 19th century.  There is a black marble monument to Henry and Isabelle Boynton, dating from about 1531, and assorted 18th- and 19th-century wall monuments.\nSee also\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\nListed buildings in Gilling with Hartforth and Sedbury",
    "\nThe Rising: Murder, Heartbreak, and the Power of Human Resilience in an American Town is a 2015 non-fiction book by Ryan D'Agostino, published by Crown Publishers, about the Cheshire murders.\nThe book describes how William Petit, who survived the incident, took steps to overcome it. Publishers Weekly stated that the book does not have a lot of content about the murders nor about the perpetrators.\nBackground\nThe author originated from West Hartford, Connecticut. In 2011 he wrote an article in Esquire about the incident, and as a journalist he attended the relevant criminal trials. He later became the editor of Popular Mechanics. He had been able to discuss matters with members of the Petit family and their friends.\nReception\nPublishers Weekly praised how the book described William Petit in a \"three-dimensional\" way.\nHelen Ubinas of the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that the book and the story of William Petit overcoming the incident were both \"resonate\".\nA reviewer of the Associated Press stated that overall the book is \"thought-provoking, insightful and highly compelling\". The reviewer noted that the portrayals of the non-perpetrators were \"perfect \u2014 kind, good, unfailingly generous.\"\n",
    "Species of lichen\nHypogymnia canadensis is a species of corticolous (bark-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. Found in western North America, it was formally described as a new species in 2007. Although Hypogymnia canadensi shares its habitat with several related species, it can be reliably identified through a combination of its morphological traits\u2014such as narrower lobe width and smoother upper surface\u2014and its unique chemical composition.\nTaxonomy\nHypogymnia canadensis was formally described as a new species in 2007 by the lichenologists Trevor Goward and Bruce McCune. The type specimen was collected 36\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Kispiox, British Columbia, at an elevation of 750\u00a0m (2,460\u00a0ft). The habitat is characterised as an interior cedar-hemlock zone or lower oroboreal subzone, situated at the lower end of a slope in a wet and open area of a swamp that had been disturbed or damaged. The area is an old-growth forest with Abies amabilis and Tsuga heterophylla as the predominant trees. The lichen, collected by Goward, was found growing on a Tsuga branch on 23 June 1996.\nDescription\nHypogymnia canadensis is a corticolous lichen, meaning it predominantly grows on tree bark. The thallus is appressed and can reach over 6\u00a0cm (2.4\u00a0in) in diameter, with a cartilaginous texture. The branching pattern ranges from isotomic (equal branching) to irregularly dichotomous, with occasional short, bud-like lobes. The upper surface is whitish to pale greenish-grey or brownish, smooth to weakly rugose (wrinkled), with minimal or sparse dark mottling. A black border (a prothallus) may sometimes be visible.\nThe lobes that make up the thallus of Hypogymnia canadensis are contiguous to separate, soon becoming imbricate (overlapping like shingles). They have an even profile, are not intestiniform (not resembling intestines), and are 0.4 to 2.0\u00a0mm broad, with a width-to-height ratio of 1\u20132:1. The lobe tips are imperforate (solid). The lower surface of the lichen is also imperforate and black, with a heavily rugose texture. The inner layer, or medulla, is hollow, with the cavity ceiling ranging from pale brown to dark brown and the cavity floor from brown to dark brown, noticeable at least 5\u00a0mm back from the lobe tip. This lichen lacks asexual propagules.\nApothecia (fruiting bodies) are fairly common in Hypogymnia canadensis. They are somewhat stipitate (having a short stalk) and can reach up to 6\u00a0mm in diameter. The receptacle is mainly funnel-shaped, with the stipe (stalk) being hollow or filled with white cottony hyphae. The disc of the apothecia ranges from tan to dark brown. The exterior of the thalline exciple (the outer layer of the apothecium) is pruinose, covered with a loose mass of hyphae heavily encrusted with crystals. The spores are nearly spherical to broadly ellipsoid, measuring 4.5\u20137.5 by 4.7\u20135.5\u00a0\u03bcm.\nPycnidia, which are structures that produce conidia (asexual spores), are common and form black spots on the upper cortex. The conidia are rod-shaped to weakly bifusiform (spindle-shaped), measuring 3\u20135 by 0.4\u20130.6\u00a0\u03bcm.\nChemistry\nIn Hypogymnia canadensis, various spot tests reveal distinct chemical reactions. The cortex shows a P+ (pale yellow) and K+ (yellow) reaction, while showing no reaction to C and KC\u2212. The medulla, on the other hand, reacts with K+ (slowly turning reddish brown), KC+ (orange-red), but does not react to P or C.\nThin-layer chromatography has identified the presence of several lichen substances in Hypogymnia canadensis. These include atranorin, physodic acid, and 3-hydroxyphysodic acid. The K+ (reddish-brown) reaction specifically associated with 3-hydroxyphysodic acid is noteworthy. As described by McCune and colleagues (2006), this colour change first appears through cracks in the cortex, followed by a gradual reddening of the medulla, visible through the translucent upper cortex.\nSimilar species\nHypogymnia canadensis can be distinguished from other species within the genus Hypogymnia by its distinct morphological and chemical characteristics. One similar species is Hypogymnia wilfiana, which shares some overlapping habitat preferences. However, H.\u00a0wilfiana is characterised by a broader lobe width of 1.0\u20133.0\u00a0mm, compared to the narrower 0.4\u20132.0\u00a0mm lobes of H.\u00a0canadensis. Furthermore, H.\u00a0wilfiana has a more consistently blackened lower surface with a broader and more conspicuous black border on the upper surface, whereas the black border in H.\u00a0canadensis is either absent or less pronounced.\nAnother species, Hypogymnia recurva, also exhibits differences that help in distinguishing it from H.\u00a0canadensis. H.\u00a0recurva features recurved lobe tips, a trait not observed in H.\u00a0canadensis. Additionally, H.\u00a0recurva has a thicker thallus and the upper surface tends to be more rugose compared to the relatively smoother surface of H.\u00a0canadensis.\nBoth H.\u00a0wilfiana and H.\u00a0recurva have distinct chemical compositions that further differentiate them from H.\u00a0canadensis. H.\u00a0canadensis contains atra",

It is an Ortsteil of the municipality of Dornum, in the Aurich district.\nGeography\nDornumergrode is located about one kilometer south of the Wadden Sea coast. The main town of the municipality, Dornum, is about three kilometers away to the south. The village was founded on a long mound surrounded by limestone marsh. Dornumergrode is located on the St\u00f6rtebekerstra\u00dfe.

    "1958 United States Supreme Court case\nAshdown v. Utah, 357 U.S. 426 (1958), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the officers involved in the case did not take advantage of petitioner or overtake her will when eliciting the confession. This case was one of the last decisions by the Court about confession evidence that preceded important new rules in Escobedo v. Illinois.\nBackground\nThe husband of the petitioner in this case died suddenly of strychnine poisoning. After the husband's funeral, the police brought the petitioner in for four-and-a-half hours of questioning by deputies and the prosecutor under the pretense that it was an investigation into whether the poisoning was an accident. The prosecutor advised the petitioner that she did not need to talk to them and that she could get a lawyer. Towards the end of the interview, the petitioner confessed to putting strychnine in a drink intended for herself before giving it to her husband instead.\nDuring the interview, the petitioner's uncle and father arrived at the sheriff's office and asked to see the petitioner because they did not believe it was fair for her to be summoned without a lawyer. They were denied admission. Moreover, the police lied to them and said the petitioner was being questioned with a lawyer present. Justices Douglas and Black ultimately dissented in this case because they believed a request from a next-of-kin should have been sufficient to trigger the petitioner's request for a lawyer and the evidentiary privileges attendant to that request.\n",

In that election, the Labour Party had won less seats than the Conservative Party in the region of England despite winning a greater share of the vote.\nThe election produced an interesting anomaly in England as well as the nation at large - despite the Labour Party winning a greater share of the vote, the Conservative Party won an overall majority, both in the Commons and in England. This occurrence would next take place only in 2005 when the Labour Party would a win a majority of seats in England while the Conservative Party would accumulate a grater share of the vote (however, the Labour Party won a greater share of the vote than the Conservatives in the nation as a whole). This election also noted the highest ever voteshare as well as the total number of votes the Labour Party has ever recorded in any election in England as well as the nation at whole.\nThe narrow victory of the Conservative Party led to the return of Winston Churchill as prime minister and the start of 13 years of Conservative rule (the second longest period of one-party rule in the 20th century).\nResult Table\n",

Incumbent champion Robert Fahey defended his title against Wayne Davies six sets to two. Davies retired his challenge on the third day due to injury.\nQualification\nAs the defending champion, Robert Fahey automatically qualified to the World Championship Challenge. Fahey had won the previous challenge against Wayne Davies in a multi-stage match across Hobart and New York. It would be his first title defence.\nFour players qualified to challenge Fahey through their performances in the 1993\u20131994 season:\n Wayne Davies, World Champion 1987\u20131994, 1994 US Open winner\n Lachlan Deuchar, World Championship Challenger 1988\u20131993\n Julian Snow, 1994 British Open winner\n Chris Bray, 1994 French Open winner\nDavies was the immediate prior World Champion, having lost the 1994 Challenge in Hobart and New York. He had held the title four times, defeating Chris Ronaldson in 1987 and Lachlan Deuchar in 1988, 1991, and 1993. He also lost two challenges to Chris Ronaldson in 1983 and 1985. At the time of the challenge, Davies held 3 Australian Open titles, 4 US Open titles and 3 French Open titles. Davies had never won the British Open.\nDeuchar had challenged for the title on three occasions, each time against Davies and each time in New York. He held 2 Australian Open titles, 2 US Open titles, 3 French Open titles and 6 British Open titles, though the last Open he was at the 1992 Open.\nSnow was an amateur player who had held the British Amateur title continuously since 1987. He was the incumbent British Open champion, having won three times since 1992. He also won the Australian Open in 1992. Snow previously participated in the Eliminators for the 1993 Real Tennis World Championship but lost to Deuchar.\nBray was the least experienced of the four challengers, his only Open title to date coming in the 1994 French Open.\nVenue\nHaving defeated Wayne Davies in the 1994 Real Tennis World Championship, Robert Fahey as the incumbent was permitted to chose the time and place of the Challenge. Fahey accepted a challenge only one year after his first World Championship victory. He nominated his home club of the Hobart Real Tennis Club as the venue. Hobart had previously jointly hosted the 1994 Challenge with the Racquet and Tennis Club in New York City, making 1995 the first challenge to be held exclusively in Australia.\nEliminators\nThe four qualified players played a series of Eliminator matches for the right to challenge Fahey in Hobart. The two British players, Snow and Bray, agreed to play their eliminator in England before travelling to Hobart. Davies and Deuchar would play their Eliminators at the challenge venue in the month prior to the challenge. All three eliminators were held as a best of 13 set format over three days.\nThe first Eliminator was held at the Royal Tennis Court at Hampton Court Palace in London between Julian Snow and Chris Bray at the end of February 1995. The match was notable for having six of the nine sets played end in a scoreline of 6/5, all six sets going to Bray. Despite the set scoreline of 7\u20132, Bray only won two more games than Snow. Bray played a powerful forcing game through much of the match, while Snow retrieved well, especially off the tambour. Bray only needed one set on the final day, and won it in over an hour.\nBray travelled to meet Lachlan Deuchar in the second round in Hobart in late March. Both players started nervously, but errors from Bray cost him the first set 6/4. Deuchar had game points for a 5/2 lead in the second set, but Bray played his way back into the match, winning the 5-all game and the following two sets comfortably. On the night before the second day, Deuchar requested a postponement due to an ankle injury. The postponement was denied, and Bray comfortably won through the first three sets of the second day before Deuchar retired from the match.\nBray met former World Champion Wayne Davies in the Final Eliminator, still in Hobart in early April.

    "Former heliport in Manhattan, New York\nEast 60th Street Heliport (IATA: JRE, ICAO: KJRE, FAA LID: 6N4) was a public heliport on the Upper East Side of Manhattan located between the East River and the FDR Drive. Also known as the Pan Am Metroport, the city-owned facility was originally operated by Pan American World Airways. The heliport opened in 1968 and closed in 1998.\nHistory\nPlanning and development\nOn January 2, 1968, New York City Mayor John Lindsay announced plans to open a new heliport serving Midtown Manhattan located on the East River between East 61st and 63rd streets. The proposed landing pad was to be built and operated by Pan American World Airways on a city-owned pier used by the New York City Department of Sanitation as a snow dump and for equipment storage. The site was accessible by vehicles from a ramp over the FDR Drive that began at the intersection of York Avenue and East 60th Street.\nThe main purpose of the new heliport was to encourage general aviation aircraft to utilize reliever airports in the suburbs\u2014including Republic Airport on Long Island, Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and Westchester County Airport, allowing passengers travel quickly between those airports and Midtown Manhattan via helicopter, thus reducing air traffic congestion at the three major airports serving the city (Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark). To address anticipated concerns that residents would have about noise, operations of the new facility would be limited to use by single-engine helicopters with all takeoffs and landings restricted to occur between the hours of 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and all flight paths occurring over the East River.\nThe New York City Planning Commission held a public hearing on the proposed heliport on January 17, 1968. Opponents of project included Rockefeller University, New York Hospital and residents of Sutton Place. The heliport was approved by the City Planning Commission on March 13, 1968, with operation limited to occur between 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays and between 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Sundays. Pan Am initially spent $50,000 to develop the 58,000-square-foot (5,400\u00a0m2) site, which included three landing pads for helicopters, an operations building and a parking area for autos. The heliport opened on November 4, 1968, for use by privately operated copters.\nOperation\nIn February 1969, Flight Shuttle, Inc. began operation of a weekday on-demand taxi service to Kennedy and Newark airports using four-passenger Bell Jet Ranger helicopters. The one-way fare for the eight-minute flight was $15 plus tax, and passengers were guaranteed to board a helicopter within 15 minutes of their arrival to the heliport or one of the airports. The service was discontinued in June 1970.\nPan Am began providing shuttle service between the heliport and Kennedy Airport in June 1982, after which local residents began complaining about the additional noise generated by shuttle fights and that the city was allowing the heliport to operate without a land-use permit. Previously the facility had been accommodating about 20,000 flights per year from privately operated helicopters. Another shuttle service to Newark Airport was added in May 1983. Both services were provided complimentarily to passengers booked in first class or Clipper Class on Pan Am flights. By 1983, the East 60th Street Heliport was accommodating an annual total of 36,500 takeoffs and landings, making it the third busiest heliport in Manhattan (behind Downtown Manhattan Heliport and East 34th Street Heliport) and was operating close to its capacity without room for a further expansion of flight operations.\nThe site of the proposed hotel in 2015, now a public pavilion\nEast 60th Street Heliport, also called the Pan Am Metroport, was the only heliport in the city that offered hangar service, which was accommodated in the lower floor of the former waste transfer station on the south side of the helicopter landing pads. In 1984, a joint venue of Embassy Suites, developer Julien J. Studley and Pan American World Airways proposed the construction of a $40 million hotel for business travelers adjacent to the heliport (on the site of the former waste transfer station). The hotel was to be an 18-story structure containing 350 guest suites, a waterfront restaurant and a waiting room for the heliport. The proposed hotel was never constructed; the site of the former waste transfer station was turned over to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in 1985, which later refurbished the structure, using funding from Rockefeller University and the Hospital for Special Surgery, into a public pavilion that opened in 1994.\nIn 1989, Johnson Controls purchased Pan Am World Services, Inc., a subsidiary of the Pan Am Corporation that operated the airport. Before the formation of Pan Am World Services, Inc. in 1979, the airport had been operated by Pan American World Airways, specifically by the company's Aviation Division that was created in 196",

    "Far-right organization\nThe Human Diversity Foundation (HDF) is a far-right organization founded in 2022 to promote \"race science\", remigration and white nationalism. HDF publishes the Aporia Magazine and Mankind Quarterly.\nHistory\nThe Human Diversity Foundation was founded by Emil Kirkegaard, a Danish far-right activist under his legal name William Engman in 2022. It was registered as a limited liability company in Wyoming. The other HDF leaders are Matthew Frost, a British former teacher and founder of the Aporia Magazine, and Erik Ahrens, a German white nationalist and social media advisor for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD). The Human Diversity Foundation is a rebrand of the Pioneer Fund. According to Matthew Frost, assets from the Pioneer Fund were given to Emil Kirkegaard which were used for the HDF.\nEmil Kirkegaard leads an \"underground research wing\" of the HDF consisting of about 10 researchers. Members of the HDF research team include Bryan Pesta, Bo Winegard and Davide Piffer. Pesta who had received money from the Pioneer Fund was dismissed from his position at Cleveland State University in 2022 for misusing genetic data in his research. Piffer's race and intelligence research was cited by Payton Gendron, perpetrator of the 2022 Buffalo shooting. Another employee of HDF is Edward Dutton, a former editor-in-chief of Mankind Quarterly and racist YouTuber who promotes eugenics. Dutton has suggested that Black people \"don\u2019t do very well academically and don\u2019t behave very well either\". Dutton was fired from his position at the University of Oulu for plagiarising a student's dissertation. HDF has funded a research paper authored by Russell T. Warne.\nIn October 2024, the Guardian revealed that Andrew Conru, an American businessman, had donated more than $1 million to HDF.\nAs of October 2024, their website consists solely of \"We are a non-profit organization which specializes in researching human diversity. We are not looking for more funding at this time.\"\nNeo Byzantium\nNot to be confused with Byzantium.\nHDF plans to create a private far-right club called Neo Byzantium to obtain income. Membership starts at \u00a3650 and rises to \u00a35,000. It was to be led by Erik Ahrens and Matthew Frost who were apparently influenced by the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate.\nUK Biobank controversy\nIn October 2024, journalists from The Guardian reported that Emil Kirkegaard and HDF had accessed UK Biobank data. Hidden camera footage revealed Matthew Frost in 2023 claiming that \"they\u2019ve managed to get access to the UK Biobank,\u201d and to know more \"talk to Emil\". In response, a UK Biobank representative commented that they have \"continued to monitor and prevent attempts to access the resource by Kirkegaard and other researchers believed to be connected with him\". The representative also commented that HDF are \"not bona fide researchers\".\nBeliefs\nRemigration\nHDF plans to create a white-only ethnostate by forcibly expelling non-ethnically European minorities, a tactic they describe as \"remigration\". This term has become a popular euphemism in recent years among far-right political groups in Germany and Austria to refer to the mass deportation of minorities. Frost has stated that Alternative for Germany's key policy should be remigration if the party were to take power. Kirkegaard has suggested that families that have settled for two or three generations should be paid to leave.\nWhite nationalism\nErik Ahrens, an HDF leader, has defended the Waffen-SS and has stated that he wants to create a home for \"white, Christian people\", as he believes they are under threat from immigration. Ahrens, a fan of Donald Trump, has commented that \"my vision is to one day run in Germany, in a Trump-like fashion\". He went on to say, \"It hasn\u2019t been done for 100 years, to run a populist movement centred around a person. I was looking for who can be this, and I probably have to go into that role.\"\nPublications\nAporia Magazine\nHDF operates the online magazine Aporia as a scientific racism outlet. Matthew Frost founded Aporia in 2021 and sold it to Emil Kirkegaard. Frost has stated that the magazine should be read \"by the elite, people aspiring to the elite\".\nDiana Fleischman is its podcast host. She attended the 2023 Natal Conference with members of the New Right. Bo Winegard, Aporia\u2019s executive editor has stated that he believes racial stereotypes are \"reasonably accurate\" and has requested that his readers embrace \"white identity politics\". Winegard was dismissed from his position at Marietta College. In 2020, Winegard published a retracted paper which drew on Richard Lynn\u2019s flawed IQ data. Winegard's race and intelligence research was criticized for resembling pseudoscience.\nNoah Carl, editor of Aporia, was sacked from the University of Cambridge over allegations that he had collaborated with far-right extremists.\nWhite nationalist Jared Taylor, appeared on the Aporia podcast in 2024 to complain about multiracial societies.

    "American veterans fraternity and secret society\nMilitary Order of the Serpent (acronym MOS; nickname, Snaix; established 1904) was an American secret society and veterans' fraternity organized in 1904, and incorporated on August 6, 1907. The MOS received official recognition by the United Spanish War Veterans (USWV) at the Los Angeles encampment. It became the humorous branch of the USWV, as devotion to the principles and objectives of USWV did not prevent a belief in humor.\nThe MOS was the outgrowth of ideas by Walter Scott MacAaron (1877\u20131941), Col. Fred S. Fanning (1863\u20131940), Col. John Parker, and others. It took its basis from the ancient rites observed by the several Filipino tribes and the ordeals passed thru by the Gilmore Party when captured by the native Filipinos. The MOS was said to be adopted from a clandestine Masonry formed by Filipinos in 1871, at Cavite. Known as the Katipunan Society, this was a  revolutionary organization with headquarters in the Biak-na-Bato Cave, where Emilio Aguinaldo and his headsmen signed the Spanish treaty.\nPreceding events\nThe Order of the Serpent was originally formed in the Philippine Islands. It was built upon the history and traditions of a Filippino revolutionary organization known as the \"Katipunan\", who worshiped the snake as their Deity and lived by levying tribute much in the same manner as the Black Hand. The members of the tribe had a triangle branded on their left breast with a \"K.\" in each corner, and a sunburst in the center. To become a member, the native had, in addition to his oath of allegiance, submit to an odd ceremony, concluded by signing his name with the blood from three cuts in the shape of a triangle onto his left arm. This becoming known, the troops, in 1899, examined every native captured to determine if he had the scar and so secured the secrets of the society.\nDuring the Philippine insurrection, Walter McAron, who became Grand Gu Gu Grandississimo (GGG) of the Military Order of the Serpent (MOS), together with 15 other American soldiers, were captured by the Katipunan, so that they are well acquainted with the customs and manners and traditions of the Katipunan organization. This Order was introduced into the United States and subordinate bodies were organized in many of the States. One of the spectacular features was the parade of members as Snakes in costumes, representing every tribe in islands of the Philippines, from the Tagalog to the Iggorotto. The Katipunan, the Great Snake, headed the smaller ones, and he inserted the royal sting of the jungle for those wishing to learn the mysteries of the Order when the initiates were instructed.\nHistory\nThe Military Order of the Serpent aimed to present in its work one of the Filipino societies, Order of the Serpent, which has sworn undying hatred of the Americans and had devoted its members to the service of Katipunan.\nLt. Gilmore Rescue Party historical marker\nAs was generally known, the ritual of the Spanish War Veterans (SWV), like that of its successor, the USWV, did not contain much levity. In the autumn of 1903, Capt. Frederick Mason Fanning was elected Department Commander of Ohio SWV and chose Sydney Aaron Phillips (1860\u20131937) as his Adjutant General. At the time, he promised Ohio a clean side degree to stimulate interest in the depleting SWV. The Gilmore Party had just been rescued from the Philippines to the joy of the U.S., and public prints were filled with the strange adventures of that party among the indigenous peoples of the Philippines.\nThe Filipinos Society of Katipunan came prominently to the SWV's attention and after experimenting with various side degrees offered by costume houses, which proved to be either trifling, dull, or immoral, the SWV determined to establish the MOS as a side degree of the SWV, which later consolidated into the USWV. The extensive knowledge of native customs obtained from those who served, principally of the 22nd Infantry, U. S. A., together with some of the organizers' own knowledge, helped in writing up a ritual. The degree was formally introduced to the members of the SWV of Cleveland on January 1, 1904. About 52 delegates attended the meeting from various camps all over the state. From that time on, the Snake became a feature of USWV camps in Ohio and was always worked at Department Encampment.\nWhen the organizers learned that a civilian reporter was claiming some credit for the organization of the Order, Capt. Fanning and a chosen group of faithful Snakes incorporated it in 1907, the Captain retiring from his position at the head of it and giving place to Captain Charles E. Stroud, of Sandusky, Ohio, who served until the last Supreme Convention at Boston, when Phillips was elected Supreme Gu Gu Grandississimo.\nMOS degree team (Buffalo, New York, 1913)\nMOS officers, S.

    "\nOregon Ballot Measure 115, the Impeachment of Elected State Executives Amendment, is a proposed amendment to the Constitution of Oregon that will be decided by voters as part of the 2024 Oregon elections on November 5, 2024. If approved by voters, it will amend the state Constitution to grant the Oregon State Legislature the power to impeach and remove statewide elected officials in the Executive branch of the Oregon state government: the Oregon Governor, Oregon Secretary of State, Oregon Attorney General, Oregon State Treasurer, and Oregon Commissioner of Labor and Industries.\nBackground\nOn May 1, 2023, then Oregon secretary of state Shemia Fagan announced that she would resign following reporting from Willamette Week that she had been working as a private consultant for the owners of La Mota, a cannabis dispensary chain operating in Oregon, while the Audits Division, which reported to Fagan, worked on an audit of the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission. Fagan's resignation followed calls from Republican leaders in both chambers of the Oregon State Legislature for her to resign and occurred after Governor Tina Kotek launched an ethics investigation into Fagan's actions. Over a month after Fagan's resignation, each house of the Oregon Legislature voted unanimously to send the proposed impeachment referral to voters for the 2024 general election.\nCurrently, Oregon is the only state without an impeachment doctrine enshrined in its state Constitution. The only mechanism Oregon has for removing elected officials from office is recall, a process that has never in Oregon's history been successful at removing a governor or other statewide elected official.\nProponents of the measure argue that it is needed to expedite the removal of a statewide official for malfeasance and to give state legislators a mechanism for doing so that can be utilized by legislators in all other states. Oregon Rep. Jami Cate, a Lebanon Republican, cited the past ethics violations of previous elected officials, including Fagan, as evidence that this is a tool needed by the state legislature. Opponents argue that the current recall system is preferable and that voters should retain the right to remove officials that they themselves elected.\nProvisions\nUnder the amendment, grounds for impeachment would be \"malfeasance or corrupt conduct in office, willful neglect of statutory or constitutional duty or other felony or high crime.\" The measure would require a two-thirds supermajority vote of the Oregon House of Representatives to impeach a statewide elected official. If successfully impeached, the chief justice of the Oregon Supreme Court would preside over a trial in the Oregon State Senate. After the conclusion of the trial, a vote of the state senators would be held on conviction of the official and would require another two-thirds supermajority vote to convict.\nPolling\n",

Later, he received the bishopric of his native Bznuni region from the Persian king with the right of inheritance. The nobles began to ask Bahram again to appoint someone to the throne, and he gave them a certain Syrian Brkisho. The latter appeared with bad companions, bringing with him female housekeepers, and for three years led an intemperate life full of exeesses, plundering the lots of dying bishops.

    "10th-century Magyar chieftain and military leader\nK\u00e1l or  K\u00e1li (Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u1fc6; \"Kalis\") was a Hungarian chieftain at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries. He held the title of harka (Greek: karchas). His son was the influential military leader Bulcs\u00fa.\nName and title\nTebelis is dead, and it is his son Termatzous who came here recently as \"friend\" with Boultzous, third prince and karchas of Tourkia. The karchas Boultzous is the son of the karchas Kalis, and Kalis is a proper name, but karchas is a dignity, like gylas, which is superior to karchas.\u2014\u200aConstantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio\nThe contemporary mid-10th-century De Administrando Imperio is the only source which mentions K\u00e1l as the father of Bulcs\u00fa, who visited Constantinople in 948 as a member of a Hungarian embassy and was a key informant of the emperor regarding the family relations of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty. Nor K\u00e1l neither Bulcs\u00fa were members of the ruling house. However, the early 13th-century chronicler Anonymus' in his Gesta Hungarorum refers to Bulcs\u00fa as the son of Bog\u00e1t. The majority of historians accepted K\u00e1l's fatherhood as authentic. K\u00e1l had at least another child, because Bulcs\u00fa's nephew is mentioned in 954. Because of his frequent appearance with the \u00c1rp\u00e1ds, some historians attempted to connect Bulcs\u00fa's person to the ruling dynasty. For instance, B\u00e1lint H\u00f3man claimed that K\u00e1l was the son of Li\u00fcntika, while Istv\u00e1n Her\u00e9nyi considered that Bulcs\u00fa was a descendant of chieftain T\u00e9t\u00e9ny through his grandfather Bog\u00e1t and father K\u00e1l.\nArchaeologist G\u00e9za Nagy derived K\u00e1l's name from the Turkic verb kal (\"stay\"), accepted this theory by linguist Dezs\u0151 Pais. Its derivative kalu or kalyu is the immediate antecedent of the chieftain's name. Byzantinist M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Gy\u00f3ni claimed that the name K\u00e1l means Khalyzian, thus Constantine's work misunderstood Bulcs\u00fa's narration and reflected to his ethnicity. Gy\u00f3ni assumed that both K\u00e1l and Bulcs\u00fa were of Khalyzian or Khavar ethnicity. Based on this, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szegf\u0171 considered that K\u00e1l and Bog\u00e1t were identical.\nThe title harka(or karchas) was the third most prestigious position in the Principality of Hungary, after the (grand) prince and \"gylas\" (gyula). Both gylas and karchas \"have the rank of judge\", according to the De Administrando Imperio. S\u00e1ndor L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th considered that the dignity of harka, a relatively short-lived title, was established sometime between 900 and 920 and K\u00e1l was the first office-holder, while Andr\u00e1s R\u00f3na-Tas claimed that the title was originally held by Kursz\u00e1n until his murder in 904 and he was succeeded by K\u00e1l thereafter. According to R\u00f3na-Tas, K\u00e1l then Bulcs\u00fa ruled over the joined and/or subjugated peoples, holding the title of harka. As a combination of the narrations of Constantine and Anonymus, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Makkai claimed that initially Bog\u00e1t, himself possibly a son of T\u00e9t\u00e9ny, served as harka until he was elevated to the dignity of gyula which resulted his settlement from the western part of the Carpathian Basin to Transylvania in the early 920s. K\u00e1l succeeded him as harka. According to Gyula Krist\u00f3, Bulcs\u00fa held the title at least from 942, when he was mentioned among the Hungarian chieftains by Muslim author Ibn \u1e24ayy\u0101n. According to Gy\u00f6rgy Szabados, this information reflects the statehood-nature of the Principality of Hungary and the title of harka was a hereditary position (at least in the relation of K\u00e1l and Bulcs\u00fa).\nTribal territory\nThe tribal territory of K\u00e1l then Bulcs\u00fa, according to Gy\u00f6rgy Gy\u00f6rffy\nAccording to the chronicle tradition, Bulcs\u00fa \"have settled at Zala around Lake Balaton\". The chieftain's descendants, the L\u00e1d kindred indeed possessed lands in the region in the mid-13th century, for instance, Badacsonyl\u00e1bdihegy (present-day a borough of Badacsonyt\u00f6rdemic). Although there are arguments that later chroniclers referred the L\u00e1ds' possession area back to the 9\u201310th centuries, a block in the region that bears the name of Bulcs\u00fa's father can be identified from the place names; Instead Bulcs\u00fa, K\u00e1l (or his father) was that chieftain, who conquered the aforementioned region in the late 9th century or early 10th century. According to Gy\u00f6rgy Gy\u00f6rffy, his summer residence was the K\u00e1l Basin (also named after the chieftain), where present-day K\u00f6vesk\u00e1l and Mindszentk\u00e1lla in Veszpr\u00e9m County preserved his name. A vineyard called Harka is also known in Balatonhenye, also located in the K\u00e1l Basin. Continuing west, K\u00e1l established his winter residence in present-day Di\u00f3sk\u00e1l (at Little Balaton), which laid near the Carolingian fort Mosaburg (Zalav\u00e1r). Thereafter, Mosaburg became the seat of K\u00e1l then Bulcs\u00fa's territory. K\u00e1l's tribe advanced north along the river Zala, reaching the R\u00e1ba valley along Lake Neusiedl (Fert\u0151) and the area of Szombathely. There the village Bucsu in Vas County preserved Bulcs\u00fa's name, as Gy\u00f6rffy considered.\nThere are several villages in Transylvania and Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal \u2013 for instance, K\u00e1l in Heves County \u2013 which plausibly bear the name K\u00e1l or Bulcs\u00fa (and also Bog\u00e1t).

    "Theatre in North Carolina\nThe Peacock Performing Arts Center, also known as the Peacock Playhouse, is a four-story, 250-seat theatre in Hayesville, North Carolina. When it was built in the 1980s, it was the only community theatre in far-west North Carolina and was unique as a professional-style theatre in the rural Blue Ridge Mountains and one of the poorest counties in the state.\nHistory\nThe theatre was built by Lillith Lidseen, who moved to Clay County after her brother Edwin established a pipe manufacturing business in Warne. Lidseen was born in Sweden in 1904, moved with her parents to Chicago, studied fine arts at Wellesley College, acted on stage in Chicago, and taught drama at Hollins College. She moved to Tusquittee, North Carolina, in the 1950s. Lidseen was then asked to direct Brigadoon and Annie Get Your Gun by nonprofit volunteer theatre troupe the Licklog Players (named after the local Licklog Creek). The troupe had performed shows on the cramped stage of Hayesville High School's auditorium since 1978. Seeing the community's love of theatre, in 1979 Lidseen vowed to construct a professional venue in the town of about 400 people.\nBlueprints for the playhouse were drafted in March 1981 and construction on the $750,000 project began on Church Street in downtown Hayesville. However, construction was halted in 1982 after the IRS audited the Lidseen Foundation. The nearly-complete building sat idle for years, attracting vandals. By the time auditors gave a green light, Lidseen's health had declined. In spring 1986, the community pitched in with financial support and labor to see the playhouse open and the Licklog Players brought the building up to code.\nThe theatre's first show was The Curious Savage by the Licklog Players on June 6, 1986. The play, about an old wealthy woman who gave away money to folks with crazy dreams, was dedicated to Lidseen. Lidseen was seriously ill at the time of the theatre's opening and died in January 1987 before she was able to see a production there. Her ghost is said to haunt the theatre. At its opening the theatre was described by the Asheville Citizen-Times as the \"fanciest community theater west of Asheville\" with a \"21st century design\" and a \"first-rate stage.\" Lidseen raised peafowl on her property and the building was named after her favorite animal. The seats were upholstered in peacock blue and feathers adorn the interior.\nThe Licklog Players staged around eight plays each season at the theatre. A dance studio and costume shop occupied the top floor. A weeklong summer youth theatre camp, Peacock Pride, operated by the 1990s. By 2007, the building was threatened by debt and deterioration. The Lilith Lidseen Performing Arts Association was founded in 2007 and raised $800,000 to buy the building in 2009 and renovate it. After performing more than 100 plays at the venue, the Licklog Players moved to a strip mall and closed down following their 2014 season. The LLPAA diversified the range of content staged at the venue, adding concerts, dance classes, and writer events year-round in addition to staging three plays, a musical, and kids camps each season. The LLPAA began selling concessions and alcohol at the theatre for the first time. The venue remains the only purpose-built community theatre in the region west of Franklin, North Carolina.\n",
    "RNLI Lifeboat station in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland\nStranraer Lifeboat Station is located at Foreland Place, Stranraer, a port town which sits at the bottom end of Loch Ryan, on the north side of the isthmus joining the Rhins of Galloway double-headed peninsula to the mainland, formerly in Wigtownshire, now in the administrative region of Dumfries and Galloway.\nA D-class (RFD PB16) Inshore lifeboat was first stationed at Stranraer by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) on 4 June 1974.\nThe station currently operates a D-class (IB1) Inshore lifeboat, Sheila MacDonald (D-833), on station since 2018.\nHistory\nIn 1964, in response to an increasing amount of water-based leisure activity, the RNLI placed 25  small fast Inshore lifeboats around the country. These were easily launched with just a few people, ideal to respond quickly to local emergencies.\nMore stations were opened, but it wasn't until June 1974, that a lifeboat station was established at Stranraer, with the arrival of a D-class (RFD PB16) Inshore lifeboat, the unnamed (D-132). The station was operational only during the summer months. The lifeboat was housed in a Marley 'M-Plan' boathouse.\nOne of the more unusual calls came on 9 September 1984, whilst the lifeboat was on Sunday exercise. The Stranraer D-class (Zodiac III) lifeboat (D-287) was called to the aid of a Volkswagen Beetle. This particular vehicle had been heavily modified, and its occupants, Steve Good and Peter Duncan were attempting to cross the Irish Sea, from Stranraer to Larne, for episode 5 'Water Beetle', of the BBC Television programme Duncan Dares. The engine failed when the vehicle had first entered the water, which had to be towed ashore by the lifeboat. Despite the (good) weather forecast, a later attempt encountered particularly rough conditions, but the car still managed to get 18 miles, before the engine failed again, and the car was towed ashore once again. Duncan reported that the crossing attempt was spotted by a submarine, which surfaced to check on what it had seen.\nBy 1993, the basic boathouse provided in 1974 was nearing the end of its operational life. A new boathouse was proposed and agreed, with works starting in November 1993. Construction was completed in June 1994, the building not only housing the D-class class lifeboat and launch vehicle, but also providing a workshop and crew facilities.\nStranraer lifeboat station was made operational all-year-round in 1996.\nIn 2008, Stranraer would receive the new D-class (IB1) Inshore lifeboat, funded by the Communications and Public Service Lifeboat Fund, more commonly known as The Lifeboat Fund, a fundraising charity supported by members of the Civil Service, Royal Mail, Post Office and British Telecommunications workers (CISPOTEL), through 'payroll and pension payroll giving'. The Fund was founded in 1866. At a ceremony on Saturday 15 November 2008, the fund's 49th lifeboat, Stranraer Saviour (Civil Service No.49) (D-697) was formally named and handed over to the RNLI.\nA new lifeboat arrived at Stranraer in 2018. Sheila MacDonald (D-833), was provided by the RS Macdonald Charitable Trust. The trust was set up by Roderick Stewart Macdonald in November 1978, with funds inherited from his family. His grandfather, R. J. Macdonald, had been one of the founders of the distillery company Macdonald & Muir Ltd, which eventually became Glenmorangie plc.\nIn the 200th year of the RNLI, Stranraer Lifeboat Station would also celebrated their 50th anniversary.\nStranraer lifeboats\n",

In the 1890s and 1900s he went abroad, from France to Italy, then returning to Sweden and becoming fascinated by the Gotland island, but one of his favorite location was Bruges, in Belgium. He reached a great success already before the start of the 20th century, at a level that on a 1905 newspaper's article one could read that he was moving the painting art forward and making it cosmopolitan with his images of the cityscapes of Bruges, of evening scenes of Italian places.\nSwedlund's style was characterized by immense sunsets full of vibrant warm colors, together with more symbolistic and synthetic paintings that were inspired by some other artists like Gustave Moreau and Olof Sager-Nelson (who also painted various scenes from Bruges).\nIn the later part of his life, from 1932 to 1946 he was the curator of the Thiel Gallery.\nPrivate life and family\nHer sister Tekla (1871 - 1948), a physical therapist and a school sport coach, introduced basketball in Sweden in 1896.\nGallery\nDen ensamme mannen p\u00e5 klippan (\"The lonely man on the cliff\"), 1928.

    "\nDad Mohammad was an Afghan father-of-two who was shot and killed by Australian soldiers during the war in Afghanistan. Mohammad, who was unarmed, was accosted by a patrol looking for an insurgent bombmaker and mauled by the patrol's dog. The soldiers then forced Mohammad to lie flat on the ground, at which point one of the soldiers, identified as \"Soldier C\", shot him three times in the head. \nThe incident was investigated by the Australian Defence Force, who concluded that Mohammad had been killed in self-defence based on false testimony from the soldiers involved. Video footage of the shooting acquired by ABC TV was later broadcast as part of the documentary \"Killing Field\", leading to a renewed investigation. In March 2023, Australian SAS veteran Oliver Schulz was arrested and charged with murder for his alleged role in the shooting. The case is believed to be the first time an Australian soldier has faced charges for war crimes.\nVictim\nDad Mohammad was 25 or 26 years old at the time of his death. He was married with two daughters, and suffered from a medical condition that stunted growth in one leg.\nIncident\nIn May 2012, soldiers from 3-Squadron Special Air Service Regiment were dispatched to the Afghan village of Deh Jawz-e Hasanzai in search of a suspected insurgent. Two Black Hawk helicopters that were guiding the ground patrol spotted a suspicious figure in a wheat field ahead of the patrol's position. The patrol scout (referred to in the media as \"Soldier C\") headed into the field with a dog handler, whose helmet camera recorded the entire incident. The dog handler released a patrol dog named Quake from its leash, and Quake immediately ran into the field.\nThe soldiers arrived in the field to discover Mohammad lying on the ground. Mohammad, holding what ABC reported were prayer beads, was being mauled by Quake. Quake released Mohammad when called off by the handler. Soldier C then trained his gun on Mohammad, who did not move, and asked the handler if he should \"drop this cunt\". The handler told Soldier C to ask the patrol commander, who was nearby. Soldier C repeatedly asked the commander the same question; the commander's response is not audible in the recording. Soldier C then shot Mohammad three times from a range of two metres. In total, less than three minutes passed between the soldiers arriving and Mohammad's death.\nThe shooting was witnessed by an Afghan farmer named Abdul Khaliq. Several months after the incident, local authorities lodged a complaint with the ADF and demanded an investigation. The investigators were told by Soldier C that he had fired from 15 metres away, and that Mohammad had been holding a radio. It was also claimed that Mohammad was \"tactically manoeuvring\" and had been shot in self-defence. The ADF ultimately concluded that the shooting was lawful, and that Mohammad had posed a direct threat to the soldiers.\nFour Corners documentary\nOn 16 March 2020, the investigative TV program Four Corners released an episode entitled \"Killing Field\" which focussed on unlawful killings by Australian forces in Afghanistan. The episode included the helmet cam footage of Mohammad's shooting, which narrator Mark Willacy described as a war crime. Former ADF chief Chris Barrie condemned the shooting as \"a simple case of murder\".\nThe release of the footage prompted an investigation by the Australian Federal Police into Mohammad's death, which was later transferred to the Office of the Special Investigator after the release of the Brereton Report.\nCriminal charges\nOn 20 March 2023, former Australian soldier Oliver Schulz was arrested for war crimes. He was remanded in custody and charged with one count of murder as a war crime relating to the killing of Dad Mohammad. It was alleged that Schulz was Soldier C, the man depicted in the video who killed Mohammad. Schulz's arrest marked the first time an Australian soldier had been charged with a war crime.\nAfter his arrest, Schulz requested that he be released pending trial due to the possibility that Muslim extremists could harm him while in prison.

    "Indian cricket data analyst, cricket performance analyst, video analyst, statistician\nPrasanna Agoram is an Indian cricket data analyst, cricket performance analyst, video analyst, statistician, YouTuber and commentator. He served as the Technical Strategy Analyst of South Africa national cricket team for over a decade.\nCareer\nHe obtained an engineering degree with a gold medal in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from Adhiyamaan College of Engineering, Hosur. He also played under-19 cricket for Tamil Nadu at state level for a short tenure.\nAfter a brief stint in umpiring, he plied his trade in pursuing a career on data analytics. He began his analytics career focusing on the statistical analysis of cricket in 2001, at a time when there were only a handful of cricket analysts available as the data analytics, data statistics in cricket had been at its infancy stage. Cricket data analytics were not taken seriously into consideration by players and commentators, (owing to slow technological adaptation by the sport itself) during the time when Agoram entered into the cricketing fraternity as a data analyst. He began building his own cricket data driven software database to research on the matchups and head-to-head record between a selected list of batters against a selected list of bowlers. As a statistical analyst, he also began compiling video footage of cricketers featured at several international matches to analyse the shortcomings of players and to analyse the strengths of players in order to pitch suggestions to such crop of players as key areas for improvements.\nAgoram made trials to incorporate his thought process of pitching performance analysis using his own software database system with the corporate teams which played mercantile cricket tournaments during the weekends in his locality where he resides. He even insisted about putting up video cameras close to the sight screen in order to disseminate reports to the corporate teams about the progress of players and how the players made technical adjustments during the course of the matches. He illustrated his software analysis at the National Cricket Academy which was established in Bangalore, where he exclusively began working on a part time basis for a stint of two years from 2002 to 2004. He was later elevated to the position of Technical Head at the National Cricket Academy in 2004 as a full-time job role. He also collaborated with former Indian cricketer Venkatesh Prasad to guide the Indian under-19 national cricket team in 2005 and he worked as the performance video analyst with the side until the end of the 2006 ICC U19 Cricket World Cup.\nAgoram was appointed as the performance analyst of the Royal Challengers Banglore outfit for the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League in 2008. He began implementing strategies using SWOT analysis for the players during his stint with the Royal Challengers Bangalore side, at a time when T20 was a relatively new format and IPL was introduced as a franchise tournament with the advent of a different model system being brought into the sport which was previously non-existent. South African players Dale Steyn, Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher who were also part of the Royal Challengers Bangalore side during the 2008 IPL season, recommended Cricket South Africa to consider Agoram as the viable candidate for the job role of performance analyst of the South African men's national cricket team after being impressed with his work. Cricket South Africa accepted the recommendation and appointed Agoram as the performance analyst of the national cricket team in 2010 and he worked closely with the South African cricket players until 2021.\nHis first major assignment with South African cricket after taking up the job of performance analyst was the 2011 Cricket World Cup where South Africa faced an heartbreak in the quarter-final defeat to New Zealand. During his stint, South Africa test cricket team rose to the top of the ICC Men's Test Team Rankings and South Africa remained on top of the test team rankings for a longer duration by also winning the ICC Test Championship Maces on consecutive calendar years to stamp their authority as the best test playing nation as well as the best travelling nation in test cricket for many years. Agoram recalled memories of having worked with prominent South African cricketers including Hashim Amla and Dale Steyn whom he mentioned as the few players who cautiously approached the game with data analytics in mind coupled with the performance oriented thought process which both Amla and Steyn formulated and applied during their playing careers until their retirements. He gained popularity in the South African cricket fraternity for his technical guidance he displayed and was fondly nicknamed in South African dressing room as P-dogg. Amla, Kallis and AB de Villiers all acknowledged that Agoram played a crucial role in elevating the standards of South African cricket through his int",
    "Ottoman-Armenian writer (1637\u20131695)\nEremia Chelebi K\u00f6m\u00fcrjian (12\u201313 May 1637 \u2013 15 July 1695) was an Ottoman-Armenian writer and intellectual from Constantinople.\nEremia Chelebi's map of the Armenian churches, completed in 1691.\nBackground\nEremia's recent ancestors came from the district around Kemah in the Armenian highlands. Eremia's great grandfather Sarkis K\u00f6m\u00fcrjian, who was a coal dealer (Turkish: k\u00f6m\u00fcrc\u00fc), abandoned his properties in 1590s during the upheaval caused by the Celali rebellions like most local Armenians and migrated to western Anatolia and Thrace. Sarkis died in the town of Gallipoli in southern Thrace. Nahabed, the son of Sarkis, and his only son Mardiros moved to Constantinople.\nEarly life\nEremia was born on 12 or 13 May 1637 in the Langa neighborhood of Constantinople to Papas (bishop) Mardiros. Eremia belonged to the K\u00f6m\u00fcrjian family, which was distinguished in intellectual and ecclesiastical circles. Like most Ottoman-Armenians, Eremia was a member of the Armenian Apostolic Church. He had a younger brother Komitas, who would become a priest and \"an officially beatified martyr\" of the Roman Catholic Church and was venerated by Armenian Catholics, but also Armenian Apostolics, Armenian Protestants, Greeks, and Muslims.\nAt an early age, Eremia worked alongside Hajji Ampagoum, a wheat contractor who was Eremia's maternal uncle and guardian for some time. Eremia started school and was taught by Der Hovannes, the bishop of the Surp Sarkis Church in the Hisardibi neighborhood. Eremia picked up Turkish in 1656 and later learned Greek, Persian, Arabic, and Hebrew. Although he grew up among clergy, Eremia steered away from that profession as he likely did not want to limit his studies.\nCareer\nFollowing Hajji Ampagoum's death in 1658, Eremia Chelebi started tutoring the children of Abro Chelebi, a famous Armenian merchant. Eremia Chelebi was able to meet many important Turkish and European figures of the era who often gathered in Abro Chelebi's residence. Eremia Chelebi became the chief clerk and advisor of the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople during the term of Mardiros II (1659\u201360) and mediated difficult disputes between members and dignitaries of the Church. In 1664, the Patriarchate sent Eremia to Aleppo to dissuade arch-patriarch Yeghiazar from creating a new arch-patriarchate based in the city. Eremia established a press in Constantinople under Abro Chelebi in 1677, where he was able to print two risales (brief books).\nTravels and death\nBetween 2 June and 3 October 1685, Eremia Chelebi traveled to Echmiadzin as part of a diplomatic mission of the Armenian Church and also to see his son Kirkoris, who was a priest. En route to the town, Eremia Chelebi visited the cities of Ani, Kars, and Erzurum. When Eremia Chelebi returned to Constantinople the next year, he only worked on his books until his death. Eremia Chelebi died on 15 July 1695. He was buried in the Bal\u0131kl\u0131 Armenian Cemetery.\n",
    "Hotel in George Town, Penang, Malaysia\nMerchant Hotel is a hotel within George Town in the Malaysian state of Penang. Located at Penang Road within the city's Central Business District (CBD), the 12-storey building was originally opened as Hotel Ambassador in 1966. It was once the tallest building in the city, but in 1991 the hotel saw a change in ownership as a result of legal action taken against its original owner.\nHistory\nAs early as 1962, The Straits Times reported on the construction of a new 11-storey building at the junction of Penang Road and Muntri Street. This building was intended to house Hotel Ambassador and ultimately contained 80 rooms spread across 12 floors. In 1966, the then federal Minister of Commerce and Industry Lim Swee Aun officiated the hotel's launch. Upon completion, Hotel Ambassador surpassed the Tuanku Syed Putra Building as the tallest in George Town, a status it held until the completion of the Rifle Range Flats in 1969.\nIn 1989, Hotel Ambassador was auctioned to Seapower, a Singapore-based private firm, for M$6 million (ringgit). However, the hotel management had incurred M$756,000 in rental arrears, leading to legal action by the hotel's original owners, Saw Consolidated Securities, to recover its moveable assets. This resulted in a court order to seal the hotel in 1990.\nDespite an initial application by Seapower to regain possession of the building being rejected by the Penang High Court, a subsequent appeal led to the Supreme Court ruling in favour of handing over the hotel to Seapower in 1991. The hotel was subsequently rebranded as Merchant Hotel. Prior to renovations in 2015, the Lonely Planet described the hotel as having a \"rather dark, spooky\" interior.\n",

During the era of the People's Republic of Poland, it held a monopoly on the production of passenger and freight elevators and was part of the ZREMB industrial union from 1972 to 1991. In 1965, it acquired a license for passenger elevators featuring a collective control system from the Swedish company Asea-Graham\u00a0, which became widely installed in Polish large-panel buildings.\nBetween 1989 and 1990, the Kombinat D\u017awig\u00f3w Osobowych ZREMB was dissolved due to the political transformation in Poland.

    "11th-century lord from Normandy\nSee also: Moulins\nGuimond de Moulins (in Italian: Guidomondo De Molisio, Guidmondo De Molisio, or Guimondo De Molisio) was a lord from Normandy in the 11th century, and the progenitor of the great Italo-Norman nobility family De Molisio, which is said to have given its name to the region of Molise in Southern Italy.\nBiography\nIn the 1040s and 1050s, during the reign of William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy, Guimond, described as a \"marquis\" (in Low Latin marchio, lord of a march), was the lord of Castrum Molinis, located in the western part of the Duchy of Normandy (region of Mortagne-au-Perche). This is present-day Moulins-la-Marche, located in the department of Orne.\nWriters of the time describe Guimond as one of the bravest captains of his day, though with a turbulent and violent nature.\nShortly after 1050, he supported the revolt of the Richardide William of Arques against Duke William of Normandy and handed over his fortress to King Henry I of France, an ally of William of Arques, who stationed a French garrison there. After the surrender of William of Arques in 1054, Guimond was likely pardoned by the Duke. According to William of Poitiers, the conspirators were granted ducal pardon, \"with a mild or even no punishment\".\nHowever, his sons were excluded from their paternal inheritance, and Duke William granted the castle of Moulins to William, son of Walter of Falaise, to whom he also gave the hand of Aubr\u00e9e, daughter of Guimond.\nFamily and descendants\nFrom his wife Emma, Guimond de Moulins had at least 9 children: , and one daughter who married a powerful Norman lord, Raoul Taisson:\nRodulfus (Rudolf, Rodolphe, Raoul), who is said to have accompanied Robert Guiscard to Italy around 1047. Count of Bojano around 1053;\nRodbertus (Robert);\nAntonius (Antoine);\nGuimundus (Guimond), who was excommunicated in 1067 by Pope Alexander II along with two other Norman adventurers, Turgis of Rota and William of Hauteville, after seizing property belonging to the Roman Catholic Church in the region of Salerno;\nHugo (Hugo, Hugues);\nAlannus (Alan, Alain);\nGuillelmus (William);\nToresgaudus (Thorgot, Torgot, Turgot);\nAlberada (Aubr\u00e9e): married Raoul Taisson, one of the leaders of the baronial revolt before the Battle of Val-\u00e8s-Dunes in 1047 (though he rallied in extremis to the young Duke William of Normandy); then, according to Orderic Vitalis, after being widowed and with a minor son, she was married by the Duke to a certain William, son of Walter of Falaise, maternal uncle of the Duke of Normandy.\nNotes and references\n",
    "Godzilla characterFictional character\nGodzilla (Japanese: \u30b4\u30b8\u30e9, Hepburn: Gojira), or sometimes known as Heisei Godzilla (Japanese: \u5e73\u6210\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9, Hepburn: Heisei Gojira) is the main protagonist of Heisei era of the Godzilla franchise.\nOne of the last living members of prehistoric species of dinosaurs called Godzillasaurus that used to inhabit Lagos Island, Godzilla was exposed to a massive dose of radiation through being teleported to Bering Sea by humans from year 2204 and subsequent crash of Soviet nuclear submarine in 1970s, mutating him into a ginormous atomic beast single-mindedly set on completely destroying Japan and locating other living members of his kind.\nOver the course of his series, Godzilla evolved from being purely the main antagonistic force to being anti-hero merely happening to save humanity by defeating other monsters. He ultimately met his end after absorbing the uranium deposits from Baas Island, dying over the course of days as his body began melting down, being succeeded by Godzilla Junior.\nOverview\nGodzillasaurus\nThe name \"Godzillasaurus\" is a combination of \"Godzilla\" and the suffix -saurus, derived from the Greek term \"sa\u00fbros\", meaning \"lizard\" in English.\nThe main difference on this Godzilla's origin to other Godzilla incarnations was that this Godzillasaurus originated at Lagos Island instead of Odo Island.\nName\nWhen Godzilla vs. Biollante had been released, Godzilla at the time was commonly called the New Godzilla (Japanese: \u65b0\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9, Hepburn: Shin Gojira). This name would be used to dub Godzilla Junior's adult form in Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995).\nIn Godzilla vs. Destoroyah, after absorbing massive amounts of radiation, Godzilla reaches a burning state causing his body to slowly melt down. Although its mostly known as Burning Godzilla (Japanese: \u30d0\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9, Hepburn: B\u0101ningu Gojira), some concept art, refers to this form of Godzilla is referred to as Red Godzilla (Japanese: \u8d64\u304d\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9, Hepburn: Akaki Gojira).\nDesign\nIn his original form, Godzillasaurus resembled early 20th Century reconstructions of carnivore dinosaurs, having upright posture, proportionally small head with double set of sharp teeth, grey eyes, long neck, greyish-beige scaly skin texture, small arms with three clawed digits per hand, three toes with characteristic ankle claw on each foot, as well as long tail that drags behind the dinosaur. He stood at 12 metres (1,200 centimetres; 470 inches; 12,000 millimetres; 39 feet) and weighted 60 tonnes (60,000 kilograms; 60,000,000 grams).\nGodzilla's first stage of mutation possessed rather massive head with small pointy ears and large eyes with brown iris, thick lips with sharp needle-like teeth underneath, massive frame with dark-grey scaly skin, proportionally larger bent arms with three clawed fingers and thumb, four clawed toes without ankle claw, and much longer tail. In addition to that, Godzilla has developed bone-white, leaf-shaped dorsal plates on his back. He stands at 80 metres (8,000 centimetres; 3,100 inches; 80,000 millimetres; 260 feet) tall, 180 metres (18,000 centimetres; 7,100 inches; 180,000 millimetres; 590 feet) long, and has mass of 50,000 tonnes (50,000,000 kilograms; 5.0\u00d71010 grams). Strangely, he lacks double set of teeth.\nAfter spending five years in a volcano, Godzilla's head became smaller and more feline-like in appearance, having nostrils close to each other and irises taking almost entirety of eye sockets. He has double set of teeth instead of fangs, his neck is longer and body more muscular, especially around the chest and thigh area. The size of his dorsal plates was also increased, making lateral row almost the size of center row. In an aftermath of absorbing Soviet nuclear submarine, Godzilla stood at full 100 metres (10,000 centimetres; 3,900 inches; 100,000 millimetres; 330 feet) in height, 200 metres (20,000 centimetres; 7,900 inches; 200,000 millimetres; 660 feet) in length, and weighted 60,000 tonnes (60,000,000 kilograms; 6.0\u00d71010 grams), gaining even more muscular appearance and vicious face.\nWhen entering critical mass state, Godzilla became more massive in build and developed radiating orange-yellow spots all over his body, particularly on his torso, belly, thighs and shoulders, which have vein-like patterns coming off of them. His eyeballs are red and pulsating, with golden irises, whereas dorsal plates change color from white to reddish-orange. His size remains unchanged.\nAppearances\nFilms\nThe Return of Godzilla (1984)\nGodzilla 1985 (1985)\nGodzilla vs. Biollante (1989)\nGodzilla vs. King Ghidorah (1991)\nGodzilla vs. Mothra (1992)\nGodzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II (1993)\nGodzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla (1994)\nGodzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995)\nLegacy\nA statue of the Heisei Godzilla was built and displayed at the Hibiya Godzilla Square, but was replaced by a 3-metre (9.8-foot; 300-centimetre; 120-inch) tall statue of Shin Godzilla. and the Heisei Godzilla statue was moved inside the Toho Cinemas Hibiya building.\nThe Godzilla head\nOn December 8, 2014, an an",

In its current form, it was established in 1991 and headquartered at Slavutych.\nHistory\nThe battalion provided protection to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, chipboard and special cargos. It's roots go back to 1980, with the creation of the first specialized commandant's office for the protection of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant of the Internal Troops of Ukraine, put into service in 1981. On 19 January 1982, it became a separate unit and on 22 September 1982, its headquarters was relocated to Pripyat. On 26 April 1986, on the day of the Chernobyl Disaster, the 1st Special Commandant's office was the first military unit to respond. After the incident, it was deployed in 1987 to ensure the protection of Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and performed their tasks until April 1990.

    "Painting by Jean Dubuffet\nJazz Band (Dirty Style Blues) is an oil on canvas painting by French artist Jean Dubuffet, from 1944. It depicts the six members of a Jazz orchestra. It is held at the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, in Paris.\nHistory and description\nDubuffett was at the time a great admirer of American Jazz, in particular of Louis Armstrong. He created three Jazz inspired paintings in December 1944. He felt particularly inspired by their improvisational style of music to create works that could be seen as their equivalent in painting, like he stated in a 1963 letter. The six musicians shown in this painting are all African-American and play several different instruments. They are deliberately depicted in a very primitive and childlike style, that also seems influenced by African art. A large piano stands behind four of the musicians and is being played by the musician at the left. At the right, another one plays the cello.\nSophie Duplaix states that in this painting \"the superposition of layers of color and their unexpected mixture, the furious incision of the material that brings out the underlying hues, the warm dominants that unfold in subtle combinations, are all transpositions of a sound universe that breaks with the conventions of classical music, familiar to Dubuffet, who had assiduously practiced the piano since childhood.\"\nDubuffet took an interest to all forms of non-Western music as an inspiration for his artwork, but only in 1960-1961 he would claim to have achieved an equivalence between both forms of art, when he created his own Musical Experiences (1961), largely experimental musical compositions.\n",
    "1949 United States Supreme Court case\nAFL v. American Sash & Door Co., 335 U.S. 538 (1949), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a state may create an employment right for its citizens that prevents them from being denied employment because they are not members of a union.\nSignificance\nThe AFL case was one of the cases that repudiated the Lochner era, a time when the Court vigorously defended corporations under the theory that everyone, including people who faced disadvantages, was merely exercising their economic freedom of contract. In his concurrence, Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote of this period that \"Adam Smith was treated as though his generalizations had been imparted to him on Sinai, and not as a thinker who addressed himself to the elimination of restrictions which had become fetters upon initiative and enterprise in his day. Basic human rights expressed by the constitutional conception of 'liberty' were equated with theories of laissez faire. The result was that economic views of confined validity were treated by lawyers and judges as though the Framers had enshrined them in the Constitution.\"\n",

Because the OUAA possessed more teams than the other two conferences combined, and was the only one that possessed teams from Quebec, the OUAA champion and runner-up would split the Ontario and Quebec bids. Part of this arrangement was the elimination of the automatic bid for the host team.

    "2018 video game\n2022 video game\nHe Fucked the Girl Out of Me is a 2022 video game by independent developer Taylor McCue. The game is an interactive fiction title that explores the creator's personal experiences with transgender identity, sex work, and trauma through Ann, the player character, who is convinced to enter sex work by her partner, Sally. McCue stated that the game was semi-autobiographical and dealt with a mixture of personal experiences that were confronting to translate into a game. Upon release, He Fucked the Girl out of Me received praise and discussion from reviewers, who resonated with the game's personal themes and the mature handling of its subject matter. Following release, the game received the Award for Digital Storytelling at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in 2022, and was nominated for a Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival in 2023.\nGameplay\nGB Studio software was used to create a game similar to visuals on the Game Boy.\nHe Fucked the Girl Out of Me is an interactive fiction game that narrates a linear set of scenes depicting the memories of the player character. In some stages, the player can use the keyboard and directional keys to move the character around and progress dialogue. The choice to display trigger warnings are discussed at the start of the game to identify sensitive themes.\nPlot\nThe game is narrated by Ann, who recounts her traumatic experiences with sex work, although cautions the player that they only wish to share their own experience and not comment on others. Ann is a transgender woman who is struggling financially as a college student as they attempt to fund a prescription of estradiol that isn't subsidized under the Affordable Care Act. Ann's friend Sally introduces her to sex work as a means to make money. Ann's first client invites her back to his house, and disassociates when the man reveals they are a cross-dresser and have sex, navigating feelings of emptiness afterwards.\nRe-reading her diary entries from that time, Ann encounters the line He fucked the girl out of me, reflecting that the experience degraded her, made her hate herself and her feminine identity, and led her to see self-worth and value only in terms of sex. Ann discusses that the experience affected their trust in relationships with others and fear of damaging their relationship with their mother and Sally. Ann confronts Sally's suggestion to lead her into sex work, stating it \"felt like rape\", and decides to leave Sally after she downplays its effects on Ann. In an epilogue set years after the events of the incident, Ann examines objects in a box, including clothes from their time doing sex work, and throws them away. She confronts her past self and challenges her thoughts that hiding and failing to accept herself are the ways to process what happened.\nDevelopment and release\nHe Fucked the Girl Out of Me was created by Taylor McCue, a transgender independent developer based in the Southern United States. McCue provided most of the game's art and code, with supporting art by Kimberly Karlsson and programming by Sopheria Rose. McCue developed the game to depict their own experiences  to be \"understood and accepted as a person\", exploring themes involving mental health, transgender identity and sex work, although found the experience of creating the game personally difficult and confronting. The game was made as an vignette of \"tiny details\" important to McCue, who aimed to introduce interactive elements to make players more able to identify with the player character rather than read the text as detached or passive observers. McCue originally created the game using Twine, then moved to GB Studio, an engine that emulates software for the Game Boy.\nHe Fucked The Girl Out of Me was released by McCue on itch.io in May 2022. As a GB Studio title capable of being ported to the Game Boy, the game received a limited release of physical cartridges made from repurposed bootleg Game Boy games sold by the developer at the Toronto Comic Arts Festival in April 2023. In June 2023, McCue included the game in a Queer Games Bundle co-ordinated by McCue and Nilson Carroll on the itch.io platform, packaged with other games intended to support independent queer developers. A digital re-release on Steam followed in July 2023.\nReception\nSisi Jiang of Kotaku discussed the game's as about \"all the ways in which American society fails its most vulnerable\", finding it to be \"terrifying because of its mundanity\". Smangaliso Simelane of Destructoid considered the game's narrative was \"profoundly personal\" and \"uncomfortably invasive\", finding its \"freedom to breach topics and express viewpoints seldom interrogated by the mainstream\", including sex work, shame and trauma. Also writing for Destructoid, Zoey Handley felt the game was both \"important and difficult to talk about\", noting that whilst it was confronting to the author, it could help the player understand trauma, praising the game's ",

    "Swedish diplomat (1918\u20131989)\nBengt Gustaf Jean-Jacques von Dardel (13 October 1918 \u2013 23 March 1989) was a Swedish diplomat. von Dardel began his diplomatic career as an attach\u00e9 at the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1944, with postings in Brussels, London, and The Hague, among others. He served as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Budapest (1958\u20131962) and as counselor in Washington, D.C. (1962\u20131967), becoming a minister in 1965. His later assignments included ambassador roles in Algiers and Beirut, where he stayed during the early stages of the Lebanese Civil War, despite the dangerous conditions. In 1979, he became the ambassador to Brussels and Luxembourg, serving until his retirement in 1984. He then served as Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps (1985\u20131988) and chaired the Petra and Karl Erik Hedborg Foundation until his death in 1989.\nEarly life\nvon Dardel was born on 13 October 1918 in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of ambassador Gustaf von Dardel\u00a0 and Eva (n\u00e9e Lindman). His paternal grandfather was Chamberlain Georges Albert von Dardel\u00a0, and his paternal great-grandfather was the chamberlain, diarist, and illustrator Fritz von Dardel. His maternal grandfather was Prime Minister Arvid Lindman, and his maternal great-grandfather was the business leader Achates Lindman\u00a0.\nHe passed studentexamen at Sigtunaskolan\u00a0 in Sigtuna on 18 May 1937 and he received a Candidate of Law degree from Stockholm University College in 1944.\nCareer\nvon Dardel was appointed as an attach\u00e9 at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1944. He served in Brussels in 1944, at the Foreign Ministry in Stockholm in 1946, in London in 1948, in The Hague in 1949, at the Foreign Ministry again in 1951, and in Cairo in 1955. He was charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Budapest from 1958 to 1962, counselor at the embassy in Washington, D.C. from 1962 to 1967, attained the rank of minister in 1965, and was deputy head of the administrative department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs from 1967 to 1972. He served as ambassador to Algiers from 1972 to 1974, with dual accreditation in Bamako. In 1974, he was transferred to what was, at the time, the most complicated and dangerous post a Swedish ambassador could hold: Beirut, with dual accreditations in Damascus and Amman. The Lebanese Civil War began in April the following year.\nIn late October 1975, during the Battle of the Hotels in Beirut, foreign embassies urged evacuation due to escalating violence. Swedish ambassador von Dardel, along with two other Swedish officials, stayed in the city despite the dangerous situation. For over a week, von Dardel couldn't access the Swedish embassy, which was located near the conflict zone, so he tried to manage operations from his residence outside the combat area, even as shellfire hit his garden. While two of his colleagues were evacuated, von Dardel and his wife stayed in Beirut. In December 1975, the Swedish embassy was closed indefinitely due to increased violence. von Dardel's colleagues left for Damascus, where he was already stationed, and on 14 December, von Dardel left Beirut on the last available flight. By January 1976, he was in Damascus, waiting for a chance to return to Beirut. In August 1976, just over a week after the Tel al-Zaatar massacre, von Dardel, accompanied by embassy secretary Per Falkenstr\u00f6m, traveled to Lebanon to retrieve two Swedish doctors who had managed to escape the refugee camp and return to Syria. von Dardel also brought back three Swedish journalists.\nIn 1979, he was appointed ambassador to Brussels and Luxembourg, a position his father held between 1921 and 1941. von Dardel retired in 1984. He concluded his career as Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps (Introdukt\u00f6r av fr\u00e4mmande s\u00e4ndebud) from 1985 to 1988.

It is the sequel to 2004's Phantom Brave and is scheduled for release on January 30, 2025 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, and in Spring 2025 for Windows.\nSynopsis\nYears after the events of Phantom Brave, Marona and Ash set sail across the seas, only to be attacked by ghost ships known as the Shipwreck Fleet. When they're attacked by a mysterious figure, Ash manages to get Marona out of there but is forced to stay behind.\nAfter Marona washes ashore, she meets a ghost girl named Apricot who wishes to find her missing father and reunite their pirate crew who were broken up by the Shipwreck Fleet. The two agree to work together, sailing off to reform Apricot's father's pirate crew in order to find Ash and Apricot's father.\nDevelopment and release\nPhantom Brave: The Lost Hero was announced at Nintendo's Direct presentation on June 16th, 2024 and confirmed for a simultaneous worldwide release date on January 30th, 2025 except for the Steam version which is planned to release in Spring 2025.\nAccording to Yuya Hosono, the primary reason for creating a sequel to the original game was due to an American poll of the most popular Nippon Ichi Software characters; at the time the company had released several games in America but they thought the top spots would probably be held by the characters from the Disgaea series. However, the results showed the Phantom Brave characters ranked higher than the Disgaea characters. This made the development team realize that \"even after twenty years, there is still a desire for Marona and her team\". Nippon Ichi Software's American subsidiary, NIS America, also supported the decision to make a sequel.\nNotes\n",

The Society published his book La Philosophie de I' alimentation in 1901.\nGrand made anatomical, physiological and ethical arguments for vegetarianism. In 1900, he was chairman and a speaker at the Vegetarian Federal Union organized in Paris. In his speech he commented \"that vegetarianism contributes powerfully to making the better man; that it ensures his intellectual capacity; softens his relations with his fellow men and makes them more fraternal\". He argued in his essays that meat is responsible for the degeneration of the French nation. He stated that a vegetarian diet could prevent the misuse of alcohol.   A paper he wrote on vegetarianism was read at the International Vegetarian Union's 1926 congress. He was an opponent of vivisection.\nTheosophy\nHe combined theosophy and vegetarianism in his book Hygiene rationnelle vegetarisme, published in 1912. Grand stated that humans have a responsibility to protect animals. His vegetarianism incorporated theosophical ideas of an astral body and reincarnation.

    "Hypothetical predictive algorithm\nThe death clock calculator is a conceptual idea of a predictive algorithm that uses personal socioeconomic, demographic, or health data (such as gender, age, or BMI) to estimate a person's lifespan and provide an estimated time of death.\nRecent research\nIn December 2023, Nature Computational Science published a paper introducing the life2vec algorithm, developed as part of a scientific research project. Life2vec is a transformer-based model, similar to those used in natural language processing (e.g., ChatGPT or Llama), trained to analyze life trajectories. The project leverages rich registry data from Denmark, covering six million individuals, with event data related to health, demographics, and labor, recorded at a day-to-day resolution. While life2vec aims to provide insights into early mortality risks and life trends, it does not predict specific death dates, and it is not publicly available at the moment.\nSome media outlets and websites misrepresented the intent of life2vec by calling it a death clock calculator, leading to confusion and speculation about the capabilities of the algorithm.

Both countries deployed naval vessels but the Indian authorities were able to reach first annexing the islands.\nBackground\nThe Aminidivi islands under the rule of Tipu Sultan of Mysore Kingdom in 1787 were annexed to the British Raj in 1799 after the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. The rest of the islands remained under the suzerainty of the Arakkal family in return for a payment of annual tribute. The British took over the administration of those islands in 1908 for nonpayment of arrears and attached it to the Madras Presidency. As Lacccadives were not a separate entity so they weren't considered during the Partition of India and thus their status was unclear so Pakistan attempted to take hold of these islands.\nRace for Lacccadives\nAt the end of August, 1947, Liaquat Ali Khan, came to realisation that Lacccadives, a region with Muslim majority didn't become a part of Pakistan and could be taken control of with ease. The deputy prime minister of India, Vallabhbhai Patel, also started to think about Lacccadives.\nSo, the Royal Pakistan Navy sent a naval vessel towards Lacccadives from Karachi. In India Vallabhbhai Patel was informed about the plannings in Karachi. He immediately sent collector of Travancore to Lacccadives. He also sent a message to Mudaliar brothers to convey the collector of Travancore to order the police officials to go to Lacccadives with available weaponry. Vallabhbhai Patel stated \"If the police forces no firearms with them, they can take lathis with them but somehow take possession of the area.\" and the Flag of India was raised.\nA few hours later, Pakistani warship reached and had to return on seeing the Indian flag flying.\nAftermath\nThe islands were annexed into the Dominion of India and became part of the Madras State under the Constitution of India in 1950. In 1956, the islands which were had been divided between the South Canara and Malabar districts of Madras state, was organized into a separate union territory administered by the Government of India, following the States Reorganisation Act. The territory which was known as Laccadive, Minicoy, and Amindivi Islands became Lakshadweep islands on 1 November 1973.\n",

It is part of Vicariate IX: The Vicariate of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa. The church is located at J Belen Street corner Gualberto Avenue in Poblacion B. It is the second church of Rosario after the Most Holy Rosary Parish located in Lumang Bayan (lit.\u2009'Old Town'), the present-day Padre Garcia, Batangas.\nHistory\nIn 1687, the first mission pueblo was established by the Order of Saint Augustine, leading to the construction of a church two years later. The Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario was founded in 1698, attaining parish status in 1776. However, the parish faced challenges due to the destruction of the church and the departure of priests during the revolution, resulting in a lack of pastoral care until 1910. After the Philippine\u2013American War, Captain Ed Boughton transferred the town's location from Lumang Bayan to the foot of Tombol Hill, departing the first stone church of Rosario in now the town of Padre Garcia. In 1915, the parish was entrusted to Fr. Eugenio Gherlone, OSJ, with the arrival of the first Oblates of Saint Joseph missionaries. Under Fr. Edoardo Meda, OSJ, a new church was initiated in 1948. OSJ continues to serve the parish to this day.\nGallery\nChurch interior\nImage of Our Lady of the Rosary by the altar\n",

    "1840 military raid and mass-arrest of Indigenous Australians near Melbourne\nThe Lettsom raid was the mass-arrest and imprisonment of approximately 400 Wurundjeri, Woiworrung, Boonwurrung and Taungurung people (collectively known as the Kulin nation of Indigenous Australians) occurring in October 1840 near the British settlement of Melbourne. It was conducted by soldiers and troopers led by Major Samuel Lettsom of the New South Wales Mounted Police, under the authority of both the Superintendent of the Port Phillip District, Charles La Trobe, and the Governor of New South Wales, George Gipps.\nThe raid was conducted as part of a larger operation aiming to remove Aboriginal people from the town of Melbourne, and also to capture or eradicate the Indigenous leaders of a resistance movement against British colonisation.\nAs a result of the raid, a leading Indigenous insurgent named Winberri was shot dead and nine others sentenced to transportation. It also led to the local Indigenous clans being forced to reside away from Melbourne to designated reserves at Nerre Nerre Warren, and later at the Merri Creek reserve.\nBackground\nBritish colonists began their occupation of Kulin country in 1835 with the arrival of John Batman and the establishment of the town of Melbourne; within several years almost 12,000 Europeans had appropriated most of the Kulin land and dispossessed the owners.\nMelbourne was not only a traditional place of meeting but also became a place where food, water and stimulants could be obtained from the Europeans, their usual sources being increasingly denied to them as the colonists usurped their land elsewhere. They were often found walking around Melbourne and set up a community at the Yarra camp on the south bank opposite the settlement.\nCharles La Trobe\nBy late 1839, as the European population increased, the Superintendent of the Port Phillip District, Charles La Trobe, directed that Aboriginal people were to be moved from Melbourne signalling their presence would no longer be tolerated.\nLa Trobe summoned the Aboriginal Protectors, George Augustus Robinson and William Thomas, and told them that if they could not succeed in\nbreaking up the Yarra camp, he would send Captain Frederick Russell of the NSW Mounted Police to do the job. In May 1840, Thomas managed to move around 122 people from the camp to Western Port. However, around 200 either remained or returned to the Yarra camp, calling Thomas a spy and blaming him for the authorities wanting them removed from Melbourne. La Trobe tried to entice their expulsion from the town by offering rations and a reserve of land at Nerre Nerre Warren.\nHowever, by the middle of 1840, La Trobe was increasingly willing to use force to remove the Aboriginal people from Melbourne. In September, he issued orders to expel them directing that \"no Aboriginal blacks...are to visit the township of Melbourne under any pretext whatever\".\nAdditionally during the same period, armed groups of Taungurung men were conducting a campaign of resistance to the north-east of Melbourne. Led by warriors such as Winberri, these gangs raided cattle and sheep stations around the Yea River, Broken River and the Ovens River, killing shepherds, taking sheep and acquiring guns and ammunition. La Trobe was alarmed at this insurgency and ordered the confiscation of guns from Aborigines and directed the Mounted Police to patrol the outskirts of Melbourne to prevent any \"blacks\" from entering the town.\nIn Sydney, the Governor of New South Wales, George Gipps despatched Major Samuel Lettsom of the 80th Regiment to Melbourne with a contingent of Mounted Police troopers to enforce order.\nMajor Lettsom had a list of Aborigines wanted by the authorities as \"objectionable characters\" which included Winberri. Lettsom said that if he could not get those on the list he would take others as hostages.\nIn a preliminary action on 1 October 1840, Lettsom and his Mounted Police made a raid on the Kulin Yarra camp, charging their horses and driving men, women and children into the river and up into the trees to avoid injury.\nThe Lettsom raid and the killing of Winberri\nThe resistance leader Winberri who was killed during the Lettsom raid\nNot long after dispersing the Yarra camp, Lettsom received news that a large group of Taungurung people were coming down from the Goulburn River region to conduct a corroborree with the Wurundjeri people of the Melbourne region. Together, they were to organise a ritual battle against the Wathaurong as well as to discuss La Trobe's ordered expulsion of Aboriginal people from Melbourne. Lettsom was presented with an opportunity to \"instil a little salutary dread\" into \"the blacks\", as Winberri was said to be amongst the travellers.\nOn Friday 9 October 1840, the large meeting of around 400 Kulin men, women and children began at what is now Yarra Bend Park.

    "Eugeen Yoors (formerly Joors, 1879\u20131975) was a Flemish painter, draughtsman, engraver, and stained-glass artist.\nLife\nBorn as Eug\u00e8ne Joors on 7 November 1879 in Antwerp, Yoors spent his formative years in Seville, Spain, where his father held the position of liquor factory manager. He was educated in Spanish and French and undertook studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Seville. He subsequently returned to Antwerp in 1899 to pursue his studies at the National Higher Institute for Fine Arts Antwerp (Nationaal Hoger Instituut voor Schone Kunsten).\nFrom 1905, he pursued further studies at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des beaux-arts in Paris for a number of years. During his time in Paris, he became acquainted with the novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans, Jacques Brasilier, Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan, the founder of a Catholic Rosicrucian movement and L\u00e9on Bloy, also follower P\u00e9ladan teachings. Additionally, he undertook further travel to England, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. In 1907, he established his permanent residence in Boechout, Antwerp.\nIn 1905, he encountered the emerging architect and artist Flor Van Reeth. Both subsequently became founding members of the Boechout art circle, Streven. At one of the aforementioned exhibitions, Huysmans and Van Reeth encountered the author Felix Timmermans. They held similar perspectives on art, religion, and mysticism and established a lifelong friendship. In 1908, Yoors and Van Reeth co-founded the Belgian branch of the spiritual society of the Rosicrucians, the Rosicrucian brotherhood La Rosace and joined the Antwerp art circle De Scalden. He designed his first stained-glass window for the Jozef Muls' villa in Kapellen in 1911. In 1913, Yoors and Van Reeth established the art school Le Scarab\u00e9e d'Or, which focused on the production of objects related to the building and decorative arts.\nFollowing the German invasion of Belgium in 1914, Yoors was forced to remain in the Netherlands as a military refugee. During this period, he created over 500 drawings of soldiers, which he produced in the internment camp of Amersfoort and was later transferred to the internment camp of Zeist. EIn 1918, he married the artist Magda Peeters (1892\u20131989). In order to provide for his young family, he subsequently focused his efforts on the production of stained glass windows. In 1924, he altered his original surname, Joors, to Yoors, in order to avoid confusion with an older fellow artist Eug\u00e8ne Joors.\nIn 1925, Yoors joined with Flor Van Reeth, Felix Timmermans, Ernest Van der Hallen, Anton Van de Velde, and Gerard Walschap, among others, to establish the core group of the progressive Catholic artists' association De Pelgrim. This society of artists professed the Christian faith in works of art, literature, and music that were artistically responsible and in accordance with their religious beliefs took a stand for the renewal of Christian art. The manifesto of this movement attracted international attention.\nWorks\nYoor's reputation was primarily based on his pioneering approach to stained-glazing, which he developed in Belgium. His contributions to stained glass windows are recognized in Belgium, England, Mexico, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Notable examples include the stained glass windows in the chapel of St. Laurentius Church in Antwerp. In collaboration with architect Flor Van Reeth, he designed the stained glass windows for the chapel of the Sacred Heart Institute of the Sisters of the Annunciation in Heverlee (450\u00a0m2 of stained glass windows), the chapel of St. Aloysius College in Ninove, St. Walburgis Church, St. Lievens College, Christus-Koning Church, the St. Ludgardis School in Antwerp, several churches in Weelde and the Cistercian abbey of Notre-Dame of Clairfontaine in Bouillon and the Mater Dei church in Lubumbashi.\nIn the period between 1959 and 1965, he produced ten stained glass windows for the Yser Towers, which was undergoing reconstruction, based on Joe English drawings.\nSint-Walburgiskerk in Antwerp\nOnze-Lieve-Vrouw Boodschap, Heverlee\nOnze-Lieve-Vrouw Boodschap, Heverlee\nChristus Koningkerk in Antwerp\nStations of the Cross mosaic, Sint-Laurentiuskerk, Antwerp\nIn England, Yoors was awarded in 1946 the title of Fellow of the Royal Society on the occasion of the unveiling of the large stained glass window in Kingsley Hall, London, in memory of George Lansbury. In 1947 he created the 'Memorial Window' in memory of Lieutenant de Mey in the Jesuit Priory at Windsor. On 4 March 1967 he was made a Knight of the Order of St Sylvester.\nIn his final years, Yoors created a multitude of designs in gouache on cardboard for the Cathedral of World Peace, a project initiated by Flor Van Reeth that was ultimately unfinished.\nEugeen Yoors died on 1 April 1975 In Berchem and was buried in Schoonselhof cemetery. He was the father of New York-based sculptor, painter, and tapestry maker Jan Yoors.\n",

This work is set in a post-COVID-19 pandemic world. The sequel to this work is the film La Grande Maison Paris.\nThe catchphrase for this film is \"Bring back the stars with our comrades.\"\nIn the promotional poster, a leading actor Takuya Kimura and guest starring actor Masataka Kubota are wearing samue, the formal attire of Mayur Kyoto.\nPremise\nShortly after Rinko Hayami won three Michelin stars for La Grande Maison Tokyo, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the restaurant industry worldwide. Her restaurant also suffered a financial setback, and in order for the restaurant to survive, she formed a business alliance with a food service consulting firm NEX Management, Inc. to conduct online sales of frozen dinners and website management for recipes. Rinko began to think only about running the restaurant and forgot her passion for cooking, and La Grande Maison Tokyo finally lost all of its Michelin stars. Also, Natsuki Obana, who was supposed to have left for Paris, had lost contact with him. One day, Rinko and Kanna Kusumi hear a rumor that  Meilleur Kyoto, newly opened restaurant in Kyoto, is a strong contender for the world best French restaurant. After tasting their dishes, Rinko is convinced that Obana is there. Why is Obana in Japan, whom they have lost touch with, and will La Grande Maison Tokyo be able to revive itself?\nDevelopment\nKimura, the lead actor, said, \"It was very exciting news for me to be able to build the world view of La Grande Maison Tokyo once again. I am very proud, happy, and grateful that all the cast members from those days are still present without changing a single one of them. I am participating as Obana, a member of that cast, so I feel that I have no choice but to do my part to the best of my ability,\" he said, expressing his joy at the sequel. Masataka Kubota plays Yuasa, the chef at Mayur Kyoto, the restaurant in Kyoto where Obana and Rinko are reunited. Yuasa had worked with Obana at Escoffille in Paris. There is a scene in the play where Yuasa presses Hirako, his junior from his Escoffille days, into a cooking duel. Kubota said, \"The character I play, Yuasa, loves French cuisine and takes cooking very seriously. This time, Yuasa plays the role of Obana's trusted partner, and Kimura taught me the manners, gestures, and hand movements of a chef, which also gave me a hint for playing Yuasa. I hope you will look forward to this film, as it contains many important elements that serve as a bridge between La Grande Maison Tokyo and its sequel, La Grande Maison Paris.\" Sosuke Akashi, played by Kitamura, is the president of NEX Management, a company affiliated with a major corporation that has a capital alliance with La Grande Maison Tokyo. He sees a business opportunity in Rinko Hayami, the first Asian female chef of a three-star restaurant. Akashi is an efficiencyist and considers cooking only as a business. As a result, the members of La Grande Maison Tokyo are contractually unable to freely confront the cuisine. Kitamura commented on this role, \"Akashi has Akashi's idea of justice and his work is reasonable, which is why he has employees and a contract with La Grande Maison Tokyo. Some young people may think that Akashi's efficiency-oriented way of thinking is the right way of thinking, so I thought about the justice of each of them when I was shooting the film. I have devised a play with a few quirks in playing Akashi, but I think it adds a nice spice to the film, so I hope you enjoy it.\" The culinary supervisor for this work is a Chef Shuzo Kishida of the French restaurant Quintessence in Tokyo, continuing from the previous work. the chef Shuzo Kishida said, \"I received a great response to my previous culinary supervision, and I hope that this television special drama will bring vitality to the restaurant industry, including French cuisine.\" On October 4, 2024, Yukio Hattori of Hattori Nutrition College, who supervised the cooking for this series passed away.  All casts and staffs expressed their sincere condolences for Hattori on the program's official Twitter.\nPromotion\nMichelin Guide Ceremony Tokyo 2025\nTakuya Kimura and Yuta Tamamori from this film took the stage as unexpected guests at the Michelin Guide Ceremony Tokyo 2025 on October 17, 2024, in Tokyo, Japan.

    "For other ships with the same name, see SMS Hy\u00e4ne.\nSMS Hy\u00e4ne was the second member of the Wolf class of steam gunboats built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s.\nDesign\nMain article: Wolf-class gunboat\nGerman economic activity in Qing China in the 1870s faced significant threats from piracy and resistance from local officials, so the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) stationed warships in East Asia to protect its trade interests. At the same time, the old J\u00e4ger-class gunboats that had been ordered in 1859 needed to be replaced. The two Albatross-class gunboats and the rebuilt Cyclop were too few for the task of patrolling the Far East, so another three vessels were ordered according to the fleet plan that had been approved in 1872. The design for the new ships was completed in 1876, and it called for reusing the engines from three of the Cam\u00e4leon-class gunboats that had also been ordered in the 1859 plan. These three ships became the Wolf-class gunboats. They were to be used extensively abroad to support the fleet's larger cruising screw corvettes and screw frigates.\nHy\u00e4ne was 47.2 meters (154\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 7.66\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.1\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in). She displaced 490 metric tons (480 long tons) as designed and 570\u00a0t (560 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 5\u00a0officers and 101\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a marine steam engine that drove a 2-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by two coal-fired trunk fire-tube boilers. Her propulsion system was rated to produce a top speed of 8.5 knots (15.7\u00a0km/h; 9.8\u00a0mph) at 340 metric horsepower (340\u00a0ihp), but she reached 9.9 knots (18.3\u00a0km/h; 11.4\u00a0mph) in service. At a cruising speed of 9 knots (17\u00a0km/h; 10\u00a0mph), she could steam for 1,640 nautical miles (3,040\u00a0km; 1,890\u00a0mi). To supplement the steam engine on long voyages, the ships were fitted with a barque sailing rig.\nThe ship was armed with a pair of 12.5\u00a0cm (4.9\u00a0in) K L/23 built-up guns, which were supplied with a total of 270\u00a0rounds of ammunition. She carried an additional pair of 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) K L/24 built up guns and three 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon.\nService history\nConstruction and first overseas deployment, 1879\u20131881\nHy\u00e4ne was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven in November 1876, under the contract name Ersatz (Replacement) Scorpion. She was launched on 27 June 1878 without ceremony, owing to the accidental sinking of the ironclad Grosser Kurf\u00fcrst. Hy\u00e4ne was commissioned 7 September 1879 to begin sea trials. These initial tests revealed problems with her sailing rig that required correction before the ship could be sent abroad. The alterations were completed by 1 October, when Hy\u00e4ne was pronounced ready for active service. Her crew immediately began making preparations for an extended voyage overseas.\nOn 8 October, Hy\u00e4ne sailed to join the ironclad corvette Hansa in South America, which was stationed on the continent's west coast to protect German interests during the War of the Pacific between Chile and an alliance between Peru and Bolivia. Hy\u00e4ne passed through numerous ports along the way, before arriving in Callao, Peru, on 15 February 1880. There, she met Hansa, which was commanded by Kommodore Karl Eduard Heusner. By that time, the situation had calmed sufficiently that Hy\u00e4ne was no longer needed in the area, and Heusner detached the ship to cross the Pacific to Samoa. She stopped in Papeete, French Polynesia, on the way, before anchoring in Apia, Samoa, on 30 May. She joined the gunboat Nautilus as the station ships in the area. The German consul to the islands, Kapit\u00e4n zur See (Captain at Sea) Otto Zembsch, embarked aboard Hy\u00e4ne for a tour of the Samoan island chain that began on 4 June; she anchored back in Apia on 4 August.\nHy\u00e4ne next departed on 1 October, bound for Auckland, New Zealand, as that was the closest point that was in telegraph contact with Germany. By 5 December, she had returned to Apia. The two gunboats cruised off Upolu through the end of March 1881. At that time, Nautilus was recalled to Germany. Not long thereafter, the screw frigate Hertha and the gunboats Habicht and M\u00f6we had arrived in Samoa, allowing Hy\u00e4ne to return home as well. She arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 22 September, where she was decommissioned for the winter months on 7 October.\nSecond overseas deployment, 1882\u20131887\nAlready on 1 April 1882, Hy\u00e4ne was recommissioned for another tour abroad, again to the south Pacific. After her crew finished readying the ship for the deployment, she sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 16 April. She sailed around South America, stopping in Montevideo, Uruguay, and Valparaiso, Chile, on the way. From there, she sailed to Easter Island, which was not well-known in Europe at the time; this was at the suggestion of Dr. Adolf Bastian, and ethnographer and head of the Altes Museum in Berlin. She anchored off the southern tip of the island on 19 Septembe",

According to Snob magazine, which refers to Avvakumov as \"one of the most renowned contemporary Russian architects,\" paper architecture is defined as \"avant-garde creative projects not intended for realization.\" The magazine notes that during Soviet times, Avvakumov succeeded in elevating this form of architecture, which began as a student rebellion against the architectural stagnation of the 1980s, to the status of a classic. Today, projects from that era are housed in the world's leading museums.\nSince 1984, Avvakumov has organized exhibitions of Paper Architecture, which have taken place in cities such as Moscow, Ljubljana, Paris, Milan, Frankfurt, Antwerp, Cologne, Brussels, Zurich, Cambridge, Austin, New Orleans, Amherst, Volgograd, Venice, and Berlin. Collections of Paper Architecture are held in institutions including the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow (30 works), the State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg (100 works), the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow (50 works), the Centre Pompidou in Paris (50 works), and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York (50 works).\nIn 2019, Avvakumov published the book Paper Architecture. An Anthology through the Garage Museum Publishing House. The book presents an archive of selected works by Avvakumov in this genre, which he has been collecting since 1984. It features works by more than 100 authors, referred to as \"paper artists,\" with 250 projects and 570 illustrations. In 2020, Avvakumov received The Art Newspaper Russia award for \"Book of the Year\" for this publication. The book was reissued in English in 2021, and in 2023, the second edition was published in Russian.\nExamples of works and projects\nSince the early 1980s, Avvakumov has been engaging with the legacy of the Russian avant-garde. He has designed exhibitions for Lyubov Popova (1989), Konstantin Melnikov (1990), Olga Rozanova (1991), and Vladimir Tatlin (1993/1994). He also worked on the website of Ivan Leonidov and, in 2002, reconstructed Kazimir Malevich's architecton.\nIn 1986, Avvakumov began a series of works titled Temporary Monuments, dedicated to the constructivism of the 1920s and its heroes. Exhibitions of the entire series were held at the Linsen Gallery in Cologne (1990), the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg, and the Museum of Architecture in Moscow (1992\u201393). The main work from this series, Worker and Kolkhoz Woman International (1991), was also shown at the 6th International Architecture Exhibition in Venice (1996), the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow (2000), the Berlin-Moscow exhibition in Berlin, and the Work and Live. Constructivist Architecture. 1917\u20131937 exhibition at the Zotov Center in 2023. Other works from this series were exhibited in various cities around the world throughout the 1990s and 2000s.\nFrom 2000 to 2003, Avvakumov curated 36 exhibitions of architectural photography for the Photoprogram 24 at the State Museum of Architecture in Moscow and the Moscow House of Photography.\nIn 2007, Avvakumov organized the exhibition BornHouse at the VKHUTEMAS Gallery in Moscow as part of the Second Biennale of Contemporary Art. In 2008, he held the exhibition at the Church of San Stae in Venice as part of the 11th Biennale of Architecture. In 2009, the exhibition was showcased at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Lille during the Europe XXL festival.\nIn June 2008, Avvakumov served as the c",

    "Minimum age of consent in Mexico by state.  \u00a0\u00a0Puberty \u00a0\u00a012 \u00a0\u00a013 \u00a0\u00a014 \u00a0\u00a015 \u00a0\u00a016 \u00a0\u00a018 Stripes: Jalisco allows 15 if seduction refuted. Mexico allows 13 if the difference in age is less than 5 years\nEach Mexican state sets the minimum age of consent for sex outside marriage by statute. These vary between 12 and 15. The federal government sets an age of 18, and there are statutory rape (estupro) laws that prohibit deception and often seduction in order to have sex with a minor over the minimum age of consent. For example, Sinaloa sets the minimum age at 12, but presumes that any sex between an adult and a minor under 16 is statutory rape; sex with a minor over 16 is also prosecutable, though usually only at the request of the minor or their legal guardians.\nLegislative framework\nIn Mexico, criminal legislation is shared between the federal and state governments. The federal law establishes the age of 15 as the minimum age of consent, while the age at which there are no restrictions for consensual sexual activities is 18 (sex with someone 15\u201318 is not illegal per se, but can still be open to prosecution under certain circumstances). Local state laws may override the federal law. In practice, the decision as to whether or not to prosecute is left to state authorities regardless of the younger person's age.\nAt state level, the minimum ages of consent vary between 12 and 15, while the age at which there are no restrictions for consensual sexual activities is 18.\nEstupro laws\nEstupro, or statutory rape, is a crime in all states. Although the definitions vary by state, it is usually defined as sexual conduct with a child who has reached the minimum age of consent but is under 18 when the consent of the child is obtained by deceit or seduction. For instance the law of Aguascalientes formerly read: \"El estupro consiste en realizar c\u00f3pula con persona mayor de doce y menor de diecis\u00e9is a\u00f1os de edad, obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de seducci\u00f3n o enga\u00f1o.\" (translation: Statutory rape consists in copulating with a person over twelve and under sixteen years old, obtaining his/her consent through seduction or deceit). Traditionally, estupro applied only to acts committed with a girl, and required \"chastity\" or \"honesty\" of the girl. The vast majority of Mexican states have modernized their laws by removing the requirement of \"chastity\" or \"honesty\" and by making the laws gender-neutral. However, traditional laws still exist in some states: for instance, the law of Baja California reads: Al que realice c\u00f3pula con mujer de catorce a\u00f1os de edad y menor de dieciocho, casta y honesta, obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de la seducci\u00f3n o el enga\u00f1o (translation: \"Whoever copulates with a chaste and honest female over fourteen and under eighteen years old, obtaining her consent through seduction or deceit\"). All states but Baja California have removed the requirement of \"chastity\" or \"honesty\" and the definition of estupro as applicable only to girls. The exact type of coercion that must be used varies by state, for example the Federal Law only makes reference to \"deceit\", omitting \"seduction\" (it reads: Al que tenga c\u00f3pula con persona mayor de quince a\u00f1os y menor de dieciocho, obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de enga\u00f1o, translation: \"Whoever copulates with a person over fifteen and under eighteen years old, obtaining his/her consent through deceit\").\nFederal Law\nArticle 261 of the Federal Criminal Code (PDF) states that: Whoever, without the purpose of reaching copulation, performs a sexual act in a person under 15 or in a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the act or that for any reason cannot resist, or demands that the act is performed, will be punished with a term of 2 to 5 years in prison. If the offender uses moral or physical violence, an extra half term is added to the initial time. Article 262 reads, Whoever has intercourse with a person over twelve years of age and under eighteen, obtaining their consent by means of deception, will be sentenced to three months to four years in prison. This crime of estupro, however, is prosecuted only through a complaint of the minor or his/her parents or legal guardians, as determined in Article 263.\nArticle 266 refers to the previous article 265, which covers the rape of adults in general and establishes a term of 8 to 14 years in prison for sex obtained through physical or moral violence. Article 266 then states that: \"It is equivalent to rape and will be punished with the same penalty: (1st Clause) \u2013 who without violence performs a copulation with a person under 15\". The 3rd Clause of this article punishes with the same penalties also \"the vaginal or anal introduction of objects, without violence and with lascivious goals\", in a person under 15 or in a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the fact, or for any reason cannot resist. If any of the aforementioned acts is performed with physical or moral violence, the sentenc",

    "ICON EVOLUTION EXPO on December 19, 2023\nThe iCon Group case involves allegations against The iCon Group Company Limited of defrauding the public by enticing them to invest, but ultimately failing to fulfill their promises.  This issue was first brought to public attention by Kanchai Kamnerdploy\u00a0, a news anchor for Channel 3 HD, in early October 2024. As of October 18, 2024, more than 2,170 victims have filed complaints, with total damages exceeding 841 million baht.\nThe case is linked to several top Thai actors and celebrities. On October 16, 2024, a court issued arrest warrants for 18 suspects involved in this case, and all of them were apprehended on the same day. Among the arrested individuals were Yuranunt Pamornmontri, Pechaya Wattanamontree, and Kan Kantathavorn. All three had their lawyers file for temporary release on bail, but the criminal court denied the requests. Furthermore, the court also refused to grant bail to the remaining defendants in this case. Following the incident, several businesses have issued statements clarifying that they are not affiliated with the iCON Group. Additionally, the Consumer Protection Board\u00a0 is considering revoking the awards previously given to the company. However, television dramas featuring the defendants in this case will continue to air as scheduled. The Anti-Money Laundering Office (Amlo) has seized assets valued at approximately 125 million baht from the iCon Group.\nBackground\nThe iCON Group Co., Ltd., founded by Waratphol Waratvorakul, was incorporated on June 1, 2018, with a registered capital of 1 million baht. Headquartered in Ram Inthra, the company specializes in the distribution of health and beauty products. Within its first five years of operation, iCON Group achieved a remarkable turnover of over 10 billion baht, with an astonishing 50% of this revenue generated in 2021 alone.\nTo achieve such rapid growth, iCON Group employed a multi-faceted sales strategy. This included a direct selling model, where products were distributed through a network of independent distributors who did not need to hold inventory. The company also provided comprehensive online sales training for distributors and interested individuals. Moreover, iCON Group strategically leveraged celebrities and influencers to endorse its products and enhance brand recognition.\nIncident\nOn October 7, 2024, Kanchai Kamnerdploy reported on a news program about a well-known multi-level marketing company that had enlisted prominent Thai celebrities to promote investment opportunities. The company allegedly lured people into investing but failed to deliver on their promises. According to Kanchai, this scheme has been ongoing since October 5.\nKanchai had spoken with victims of the scam and gathered information about the company's practices. On October 8, he posted a message on social media stating that the company had begun threatening individuals and was prioritizing the protection of its celebrity endorsers over the victims. Following Kanchai's reports, more victims came forward to share their experiences with the fraudulent scheme. One notable victim was Christopher Benjakul, a former actor who had been involved in the accident.\nThe iCon Group founder initially denied these claims, stating that the company had always operated ethically. However, under public pressure, he later admitted to wrongdoing, apologized to the victims, and pledged to take full responsibility. He also announced that The iCon Group would no longer recruit new distributors.\nAftermath\nOn October 9, Sam Yuranant, the research director, denied any involvement in the company's operations, stating that Voratpol was the sole director. However, he expressed willingness to cooperate with law enforcement.\nWhile the Consumer Protection Board planned to summon the celebrities involved for questioning, The iCon Group issued a statement on October 10, claiming that the three were not authorized signatories or shareholders.\nOn October 11, Pakorn Chatborirak, a presenter for The iCon Group, clarified his role, stating that he was merely a spokesperson and not involved in the company's management.\nOn the same day, Pechaya Wattanamontree announced the termination of all her contracts with The iCon Group, stating that she \"chose to stand with the people\".\nOn October 12, Kan Kantathavorn, a marketing director and TV host, announced a temporary suspension of his hosting duties on October 10 in light of the allegations.\nInvestigation and arrest\nFollowing the expos\u00e9 of The iCon Group's fraudulent investment scheme, Thai authorities launched a comprehensive investigation. On October 9, the Royal Thai Police Commissioner Kittirat Panpetch\u00a0 assigned Police Lieutenant General Akkaradech Pimolsri to oversee the case and ordered the Consumer Protection Division to establish a complaint center for victims. Within days, the police announced their intention to seek arrest warrants for key figures involved in the scam, citing violations of the Emerge",
    "2002 kidnapping and murder of a six-year-old girl in Missouri, U.S.\nOn July 26, 2002, 6-year-old Cassandra \"Casey\" Lynn Williamson (born November 23, 1995), disappeared from her hometown of Valley Park, Missouri. After an extensive search, her body was found at an abandoned glass factory. Subsequently, investigations led to the arrest of Johnny Allen Johnson (born March 16, 1978), who was a family acquaintance. Johnson, who confessed to murdering the girl while he attempted to rape her, was convicted and sentenced to death in 2005. Despite his claims of mental illness, which were all rejected by the courts, Johnson was eventually executed on August 1, 2023.\nDisappearance and murder\nOn July 26, 2002, at Valley Park in St. Louis County, Missouri, a six-year-old girl was abducted from her home by a family acquaintance.\nCassandra Williamson, affectionately known as \"Casey\", was last seen before 7am at the kitchen by her father Ernie Williamson, who noticed her missing after he came back from the bathroom. At the time of Williamson's disappearance, Ernie was separated from his wife Angie and lived across the street just to remain close with his children, and he happened to be staying over when he found out his daughter went missing. After about 30 minutes since Williamson's disappearance, Williamson's parents reported her missing. The authorities, including local police, St. Louis County deputy sheriffs and FBI agents, conducted the search for the missing girl, and many members of the community volunteered to look for Williamson.\nSubsequently, the police received information from witnesses that they saw the girl being carried away by a man, who was identified as 24-year-old Johnny Allen Johnson (alias Movant), who was a friend of the Williamson family. Williamson's mother was a childhood best friend of Johnson's older sister and even helped babysit Johnson during his childhood years. In fact, the night before the girl went missing, Johnson attended a barbecue at Williamson's house and the family allowed him to spend the night, and he slept on the couch; Johnson himself was found to be absent at the time when Williamson gone missing. Evidence showed that just six months ago, Johnson was released from a state psychiatric facility, where he was confined due to schizophrenia.\nJohnson was therefore brought in for police questioning and he denied being involved in the disappearance of Williamson. Subsequently, Johnson admitted that he was responsible for murdering Williamson and admitted that he took the girl out to an abandoned glass factory near the girl's home, where he killed her. Williamson's corpse was eventually found in a pit less than a mile from her home by one of the volunteers that joined the search for the girl. An autopsy revealed that Williamson died from blunt force injuries to her head, which caused skull fractures and bruising of her scalp and brain. Furthermore, there were other injuries to the arms, shoulders, legs, and back, and signs of semen were found on the shorts of Johnson, which indicated that he had likely sexually assaulted the girl.\nUpon the discovery of the girl's body, Johnson was arrested and detained for investigations into the murder of Casey Williamson. Based on further investigations, Johnson, who was previously convicted of burglary before the murder, was found to have abducted the girl and took her to an abandoned glass factory, where he attempted to rape Williamson. However, as Williamson resisted his advances, Johnson used a brick and large rock to hit Williamson on the head more than once and consequently battered six-year-old Casey Williamson to death. After the killing, Johnson abandoned the body of the girl at the pit, and even washed himself at the nearby Meramec River.\nA memorial was held for the girl on July 30, 2002. Mourners, including Williamson's friends and members of the public, gathered at Twin Oaks Presbyterian Church to pay respects, and the memorial was broadcast live on television.\nTrial of Johnny Johnson\nAfter his arrest, Johnny Johnson was charged with the kidnapping, attempted rape and murder of Casey Williamson. Under Missouri state law, Johnson faced the death penalty or life imprisonment should he be found guilty of the most serious charge of first-degree murder in the case of Williamson's death.\nJohnson's trial took place about two years after his arrest. Standing trial before a St. Louis County jury, Johnson never denied that he murdered Williamson, but his main defence was diminished responsibility. Johnson's lawyers sought to argue that as a result of his psychiatric disorders, including schizoaffective disorder, Johnson's state of mind at the time of the murders was severely impaired and he killed Williamson after experiencing hallucinations, and he was not capable of planning the murder. A psychiatrist diagnosed Johnson with schizoaffective disorder and testified on his behalf, and Johnson's girlfriend testified that Johnson stopped taking his med",
    "Rugby player\nRobert Summers Stronach (19 May 1882 \u2014 28 August 1966) was a Scottish sportsperson who competed as a hurdler in athletics, rugby union player and Canadian football player.\nBorn in Partick, Glasgow, Stronach was a Scottish record holder in 120 yard hurdles, setting the new mark at an even 16 seconds when he claimed the first of his three successive British national titles at the AAA Championships from 1904 to 1906. He combined his athletics with rugby union, a sport he played as a forward with Glasgow Academicals RFC. His five Scotland caps included their 1905 Calcutta Cup victory against England.\nStronach took up Canadian football after emigrating to Ontario and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders as an outside wing, helping them win the 1909 Interprovincial Championship. He served with the 38th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force in World War I, during which he was gassed and took part in the Battle of Vimy Ridge.\nAfter the war, Stronach was Superintendent of Banff National Park, until the injuries he had sustained on the Western Front forced him to retire in 1929. He lived his later years in Oakville, Ontario.\nSee also\nList of Scotland national rugby union players",
    "Road junction\nThe Mount Edgecombe Interchange, is a major freeway interchange located between Mount Edgecombe and uMhlanga in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It is the junction between the N2 and M41 freeways and underwent a major upgrade to relieve the increasing traffic congestion in the area.\nRoads\nThe N2 is a national route running north\u2013south from the King Shaka International Airport and KwaDukuza towards Durban and Port Shepstone. The M41 is a metropolitan route running east\u2013west from the M4 in uMhlanga towards the R102 between Mount Edgecombe and Phoenix.\nDesign\nA key feature of the project is its two incrementally launched bridges: one, spanning 948 meters, connects the Mount Edgecombe side of the M41 to the N2 South and stands as the longest incrementally launched bridge in South Africa; the second, 440 meters long, links the uMhlanga side of the M41 to the N2 North.\nUpgrade\nAerial view of the old diamond interchange of the Mount Edgecombe Interchange\nPrior to the upgrade of the Mount Edgecombe Interchange, the interchange was a diamond interchange with traffic lights, and included a loop ramp connecting the M41 eastbound carriageway with the N2 South. The growth of the uMhlanga Ridge and La Lucia Ridge areas had pushed the existing diamond interchange to its capacity, resulting in traffic backing up on the M41 and spilling onto the N2 during peak hours. With around 40,000 additional vehicles joining or exiting the N2 from the M41 each day, significant queuing occurred throughout the day. Anticipated future development in Cornubia (north of Mount Edgecombe and west of uMhlanga) further emphasised the need to upgrade the interchange to enhance traffic flow between the N2, M41, and surrounding roads.\nTo address the congestion issue at the interchange, the upgrade of the Mount Edgecombe Interchange began in April 2013 and involved converting the existing diamond interchange into a free-flow, four-level interchange.\nThe project was funded through a collaboration between SANRAL and the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport, with construction carried out by the South African branch of the Italian company CMC di Ravenna. On 30 October 2018, the upgraded interchange was officially opened by then Minister of Transport, Blade Nzimande.\nWith the conversion of the interchange to a completely free-flowing system with limited stops, it is expected that travel time between the areas the interchange connects will now be significantly reduced from 25 minutes to one minute on average.\n",

    "English conductor, organist and composer (1906\u20131996)\nFor the American skier, see Charles Proctor.\nCharles Proctor (5 April 1906 \u2013 26 November 1996) was an English pianist, choral conductor, composer, adjudicator and author on musical subjects. He was the founder of the Alexandra Choir in 1940.\nCareer\nProctor was born in East Finchley, London and educated at Highgate School. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Julius Harrison and later with Emil Sauer in Dresden and Vienna. His early career was as an organist and concert pianist. From 1930-36 he directed the North London Orchestral Society. During the war he served in the War Department Constabulary.\nIn 1940 he founded the Alexandra Choir (based at Alexandra Palace) at the request of Sir Henry Wood, who needed a choir for his Promenade Concert series: the choir made its Proms debut with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on 19 August 1941. It also sang in the Victory Concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 31 May 1945, culminating in a post-war tour of Holland the following year. The Alexandra Choir also participated in the 12 seasons in which Josef Krips conducted Beethoven's Ninth at the Royal Festival Hall during the 1950s and 1960s. The choir remained a central part of London choral music for 38 years. Proctor was its conductor until 1978.\nAs a conductor he performed widely at venues including the Royal Albert Hall, Covent Garden, where he was chorus master to Albert Coates, and for other large scale spectacular pageants produced there by T. C. Fairbairn - including 14 performances of Gounod's Faust in February 1938 with a cast of over 1,000. As chorus master for the Royal Choral Society, Proctor often deputised for Malcolm Sargent as Sargent became increasingly ill towards the end of his life in the 1960s.\nProctor was the composer of a Choral Symphony, first performed in 1937 at the Northern Polytechnic Theatre, a Piano Concerto (1947), and various sonatas as well as songs and part songs. Later in his career he focused more on teaching, adjudicating and examining, particularly at Trinity College of Music and at the annual North London Musical Festival.\nPersonal life\nFor 30 years (1943\u20131973) Charles Proctor was organist at St Jude-on-the-Hill Church in Hampstead Garden Suburb. In 1945 he married the painter and sculptor Rosemary Rennie (daughter of Father Maxwell Rennie of St Jude's, 1936-1954). Some of her work can be seen in the church, and she also produced a bronzed effect cast plaster bust of her husband. Their London address in the 1950s and 1960s was 13 Eastholm, Barnet. In the late 1970s they moved to Hiham Green, Winchelsea in Rye, East Sussex where Proctor acted as organist and choirmaster at Rye Parish Church. He was appointed OBE in 1980. Rosemary died in 1995.

    "Bruneian businessperson (1882\u20131940)\nNot to be confused with Ong Pang Boon.\nIn this Chinese name, the family name is  Wang (\u738b).\nOng Boon Pang (Chinese: \u738b\u6587\u90a6; pinyin: W\u00e1ng W\u00e9nb\u0101ng; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: \u00d4ng B\u00fbn-pang; 1882 \u2013 14 January 1940) was a Bruneian aristocrat, businessman, and Kapitan Cina who made important contributions to the Chinese community, especially in the areas of education and urban planning. He was dedicated to education, as evidenced by his efforts in establishing Chung Hwa Middle School, Bandar Seri Begawan, the country's first Chinese school. He organised the Overseas Chinese Mutual Help Association, serving as its president and providing support to local Chinese residents in their daily lives.\nEarly life and education\nOng Boon Pang was born in 1882 in Lieyu village, Kinmen County, Taiwan. At the age of eighteen, he left his hometown to seek a livelihood, first sailing to Singapore and then to Brunei the following year. At that time, Brunei was still undeveloped and sparsely populated, with a national population of fewer than 20,000, including only a few hundred Chinese residents. The capital city, Brunei Town, had just one street lined with scarce thatch-roofed shops, and the majority ethnic group, the Malays, lived in Kampong Ayer made up of wooden houses on stilts along the rivers. He started his small business from scratch, operating a wooden boat along the river to sell various goods. Over the years, he became a familiar face in the community, recognized as a Chinese merchant who provided essential groceries to local households.\nBusiness career\nOng founded Chop Teck Guan, a company that specialised in regional goods, after years of perseverance and hard labour. Later, he ventured into retail and wholesale, selling gasoline and distributing foreign cigarettes, among other things. Because of being closeness to the Brunei River, the capital's sole street regularly flooded in the 1930s. Ong was one of the contractors participating in the land reclamation project that the Bruneian government started, which gave him the opportunity to amass a sizeable fortune. He opened five stores as his enterprises prospered, including the still-open Teck Leong Pawnshop. After establishing his funds, he opened Boon Pang Cinema in 1939 to offer the locals amusement. The movie theatre was reconstructed in 1953 after being destroyed during the Japanese occupation, but it was damaged once more in 1960.\nThere was no Chinese school in Brunei at the beginning of the 20th century, so Ong organised more than thirty of his friends to start York Choi School, which subsequently changed its name to Chung Hwa School in 1922. At first, the group of around twenty pupils attended courses in temporary classrooms within a rented shophouse since there was no official school facility. In 1937, Ong led a fundraising campaign to build a new school as enrollment increased. Donations poured in after he promised to match every dollar given by nearby companies. As a result, the school was given permanent space on Jalan Bendahara when a two-story building was finished a year later. Having worked at the school for twenty-two years, he served as chairman or chief management from 1918 until his death in 1940.\nPersonal life\nOng passed away from kidney illness as a result of his lifestyle and an extended period of overexertion. He drafted a will on his deathbed, leaving four close family members to handle his assets until his sons were old enough to take over, while his children were still small. His first son-in-law, Lim Cheng Choo; his second son-in-law, Yap Chong Teck; his brother-in-law, Lim Soo Jin; and his second wife, Tay Giok Lian, were among these relations. On 14 January 1940, Pehin Kapitan Ong died at the age of fifty-eight. After taking over his father's companies, his second son, Ong Kim Kee, became a prosperous businessman himself after being influenced by his father's principles. He is the grandfather of Timothy Ong, who currently serves as the acting chairman of the Brunei Economic Development Board.\nTitles\nOng's substantial contributions to the city's growth, his kind support of education, and his aid to the poor were recognised by the Bruneian government. On 18 March 1936, Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin recognised his achievements by appointing him to the State Council of Brunei and granting him the Manteri title of Pehin Kapitan China in 1932, which designates him as a Kapitan Cina. He was the first Chinese person in Brunei to be recognised with this title.\n",

After 1930, the consortium asked the architects L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sz\u00e9kely\u00a0 and Mathias Hubert\u00a0 to design an imposing six-story building for their headquarters. The building permit was obtained on 27 May 1931. It was built within two years in a manner specific to the interwar period, without many decorations, in contrast to the rest of the palaces in the square.\nSince 1931, Pension Central was already operating in the palace, one of the most modern hotels in the city, taken over in 1937 by Martin Eichart. On the ground floor of the building, the Jachan bookstore operated during the interwar period, and the well-known Mercur store during the communist period.\nBetween 1975 and 1978 it was expanded on the site of the former police station, which was demolished; in front of it, in the free space, an outdoor parking lot was laid out. The designer of the new body was Gheorghe G\u00eerleanu\u00a0.\nToday, the palace hosts Hotel Timi\u0219oara, a 191-room hotel owned by Bega Turism, the largest hotel operator in Timi\u0219 County.\nExternal links\nHotel Timi\u0219oara as a 3D model in the 3D Warehouse of SketchUp\nOfficial website of Hotel Timi\u0219oara",

The album exists in two versions: the 1975 version, which is available only on vinyl and includes 15 tracks, and the expanded 1991 release, which added nine bonus tracks.\nCritical reception\nNathan Southern of AllMusic attributed the delayed release to the lack of stylistic cohesion present to Seth MacRae; over the course of one evening, first backed by a swinging jazz trio and then on solo piano, she moves nonstop from blues standards to bossa nova, upbeat tempo pop, late '60s melodies and more. In his opinion, the stylistic diversity seems harsh at first, but those who are ready to adapt to MacRae's interest in combining several genres will feel great satisfaction from the material presented here. He also recommended listening to the extended version of the album, because it not only includes wonderful melodies, but also leaves a recitative of MacRae, which demonstrates her unique personality and delightful sense of humor, as well as her ability to instantly win over the audience.\nTrack listing\n\"Elusive Butterfly\"\n\"Midnight Sun\"\n\"For Once in My Life\"\n\"Yesterday\"\n\"Spread to All\"\n\"The Right to Love\"\n\"If You Never Fall in Love with Me\"\n\"I'm Always Drunk in San Francisco\"\n\"Why Shouldn't I\"\n\"I Thought About You\"\n\"The Sound of Silence\"\n\"Away, Away, Away\"\n\"Did I Ever Love\"\n\"On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)\"\n1991\u00a0reissue bonus tracks\n \"Introduction\"\n \"Sweet Pumpkin\"\n\"Introduction\"\n\"No More Blues\"\n\"Miss Otis Regrets\"\n\"Satin Doll\"\n\"Never Let Me Go\"\n\"My Ship\"\n\"Never Will I Marry\"\n\"September in the Rain\"\nNote: The track \"Introduction\" does not appear in the original version, however, in the 1991 reissue it comes separately immediately after \"I'm Always Drunk in San Francisco\" and is not listed as a bonus track.\nPersonnel\nCarmen McRae \u2013 vocals\nChuck Domanico \u2013 bass\nFrank Severino \u2013 drums\nNorman Simmons \u2013 piano",

    "Book about the Roman conquest of Britain by Richard Hingley\nConquering the Ocean: The Roman Invasion of Britain is a 2022 non-fiction book by British archaeologist Richard Hingley. Part of the Ancient Warfare and Civilization series by Oxford University Press, the book narrates in details the Roman conquest of Britain, spanning from Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BCE to the construction of Hadrian's Wall in the early 2nd century CE. Drawing on new archaeological findings and classical sources, Hingley challenges traditional depictions of inevitable Roman domination, emphasizing the resistance from the native Britons, including the famous revolt led by Boudica. The book has been well-received and was a finalist for the 2023 PROSE Awards.\nBackground\nIn a 2022 interview with the World History Encyclopedia, Hingley explained that while the southeastern part of Britain fell to the Romans relatively quickly, the conquest of the rest of the island, particularly in Wales and northern Britain, was significantly more challenging and protracted. The Romans faced strong resistance from local populations, and their campaigns stretched over several decades, ultimately culminating with the construction of Hadrian's Wall in the 120s CE. Hingley highlighted how imperial hubris contributed to the Roman miscalculation of how long the conquest would take, noting that Roman commanders often overestimated their ability to quickly subjugate Britain, which was seen as a \"distant, fabulous place\" in Roman thought. To provide a narrative for this tale, Hingley argues that victories in Britain were seen by a sequence of military leaders and emperors as enabling the incorporation of an island set within the divine waters of Oceanus (the Latin term for Ocean).\nOverview\nHingley examines the Roman conquest of Britain, spanning from Julius Caesar's initial expeditions in 55 and 54\u00a0BCE to the construction of Hadrian's Wall in the early 2nd century CE. In this work, Hingley challenges traditional narratives of inevitable Roman dominance, highlighting the long and often difficult process of subjugating the British Isles. Drawing upon both classical sources and recent archaeological discoveries, the book provides new insights into Roman military strategies, local resistance, and the cultural interactions between the Romans and native Britons.\nThe book emphasizes that the Roman conquest was not a short-term event, but a protracted process that stretched over a century. Julius Caesar's initial ventures into Britain were exploratory rather than conclusive, with Rome not establishing permanent control until Emperor Claudius's invasion in 43\u00a0CE. Even after Claudius's success in southeastern Britain, Roman expansion into Wales, the peoples of central Britain, and northern Britain mounted significant resistance, with native revolts like Boudica's rebellion in 60\u00a0CE temporarily pushing back the invaders.\nHingley integrates archaeological evidence to reveal a fuller picture of both Roman military activities and the everyday lives of the British population under occupation. He explores how some British tribes formed alliances with the Romans, while others fiercely resisted. The book also provides fresh insights into the Roman military infrastructure in Britain, such as the presence of women and children in military forts, indicating these sites were not purely martial but also served as bases for settlement.\nThe culmination of the Roman conquest, as discussed in the book, was the construction of Hadrian's Wall around 122\u00a0CE, marking the northern boundary of Roman power. Hingley reinterprets the significance of the Wall, suggesting that Roman propaganda framed the conquest of Britain as a triumph over Oceanus, the ancient sea god, and the \"barbaric\" lands beyond.\nThroughout the book, Hingley also addresses modern interpretations of the Roman conquest of Britain, particularly the evolving legacy of figures like Boudica, who has become a symbol of resistance and female empowerment.\nCritical reception\nMatthew Symonds, editor of Current World Archaeology, praised the book for its incisive commentary on Roman military campaigns and its skillful integration of archaeological and literary evidence. He highlighted Hingley's focus on both Roman and British perspectives, as well as his innovative exploration of the symbolic role of the ocean in Rome's conquest of Britain. Symonds noted that \"teasing out this dimension adds real freshness to the subject,\" and commended the book as an essential read for those interested in Roman Britain.\nJerry D. Lenaburg judged the work as \"a fascinating and well-illustrated look at this neglected aspect of Roman and ancient war history.\" Lenaburg stressed Hingley's use of historical and archeological sources to offer fresh insights into the Roman conquest of Britain, the varied responses of native tribes, and the evolving interpretation of figures like Boudica. He also commended the detailed analysis of Roman military s",

    "Sri Lankan writer, content creator, author, motivational speaker\nFor politician hailing from Jammu and Kashmir, see Irfan Hafiz Lone.\nIrfan Hafiz (1981 \u2013 25 July 2018) was a Sri Lankan writer, author, content creator, motivational speaker, social media influencer and internet personality. He was famously dubbed and nicknamed as a differently abled keyboard warrior in the social circles.\nBiography\nIrfan was born in 1981 in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka, in Matara. He was born as the third child in his family of eight children. His father Hafiz Issadeen served as a principal at a school and his father also served as an editor of Arumbu educational magazine.\nHe was detected to have been diagnosed with a rare disorder called Duchenne muscular dystrophy at the age of four. It significantly impacted his childhood and he was also confined to a wheelchair at the age of twelve. His parents faced tough challenge on how to help him out by forming a recovery process and their situation was further aggravated when neighbours and relatives frequently paid visit to check upon him ever since he was diagnosed with the Duchenne muscular dystrophy. His parents were literally worried about his deteriorating physical health conditions which worsened as the days progressed and as a result, he dropped out of schooling at a young age, as he could not properly focus and concentrate on his studies. He attended the Zahira College, Colombo after his family moved to Beruwala. He studied until the 5th grade without advancing further, thereby abandoning the studies due to the precarious health conditions derailing his academic participation. His father Hafiz Issadeen took a firm bold decision to prematurely retire from the service in order to take care of his son's health. His father researched specifically about the cause of disease and he concluded that the disease was incurable, but took necessary remedies to confront the challenges pertaining to the disease conditions.\nHe spent the majority of his life under bed rest in a life support ventilator, as his entire body lost mobility and he battled his way out due to breathing related suffocation issues which he went through after the age of eighteen. It was only after turning eighteen, he endured further life threatening tragical circumstances when his entire muscular system was collapsed unexpectedly, forcing him to live the remaining lifetime lying in bed, as he was unable to move due to the deteriorating physical conditions. He only had some sort of strength as a glimmer of hope, when he only had one finger to move and utilise while the other organs in his body had been paralyzed, largely restraining himself from engaging in productive activities on a day to day basis. He used the sole index finger as an inevitable option for the latter part of his life, as his life trajectory was restricted and confined to just four corners of the wall in a bedroom.\nCareer\nHe had taught himself to learn, read, write, type and understand the global lingua franca language of English despite confronting with difficult physical conditions. He eventually used his only active finger to type and publish three books through his Apple iPhone. He published three books titled Silent Struggle, Moments of Merriment and Silent Thoughts while lying in bed. His books became renowned for their uniqueness for being typically written through an iPhone and his books became bestsellers, garnering him critical acclaim, fame and recognition. His book Moments of Merriment which was a massive compilation of his short story collection with an estimated word count tally of over 40,000 had nearly taken him a year to successfully complete. He was supposed to publish his fourth book, but the plan was shelved due to his untimely death.\nThrough online platforms such as Facebook, he advocated for people suffering from life tragedies to push themselves going forward overcoming roadblocks and obstacles, by taking cue out of his personal life through delivering motivational content about indicating the sequence of life changing events which took place during his lifetime ever since he was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He shared his personal tragedies incorporating with the motivational stories in an insightful manner to the viewers in his official Facebook page under the name Silent Fighter in an attempt to revive the subject of mental health awareness. He eventually received the nickname \"keyboard warrior\" for his thought provoking ideas he shared on a daily basis while lying in bed, to uplift the spirits of people suffering from various ailments through online platforms.\nPopular Israeli-Arab blogger Nas Daily covered a special segment depicting the life trajectory and legacy of Irfan in his official Facebook page and Nas also heaped praise on him by indicating that he had never seen an inspiring person of Irfan\u2019s calibre in his lifetime.\nDeath\nHe died on 25 July 2018 at the age of 37, after being bedridden predomin",
    "Former restaurant in Vancouver, Canada\nLiliget Feast House and Catering was a former restaurant in the West End neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia that specialized in Pacific Northwest Indigenous cuisine. Owned and operated by Dolly Watts beginning in 1995, Liliget Feast House closed down in 2007, after 12 years of operation. \nLiliget succeeded Muckamuck Restaurant and Quilicum, Indigenous restaurants which both occupied the 1724 Davie Street location that Liliget was in. Identified as among the first restaurants that featured the cuisine of the Indigenous communities of the Pacific Northwest, historians Tabitha Robin, Mary Kate Dennis, and Michael Anthony Hart listed Liliget Feast House, among others, as part of the legacy of restaurants within the Canadian Indigenous culinary experience.\nDescription\nLiliget Feast House's name is derived from the Gitxsan language term \"liliget\" meaning \"where people feast\", or \"the place the people come to feast.\"\nThe interior of the restaurant was inspired by that of a traditional Northwest Coast longhouse, the longhouse space was designed by architect Arthur Erickson. The restaurant space was formerly occupied by the Muckamuck Restaurant situated on 1724 Davie Street, which closed in 1981 due to a labour dispute between the non-Indigenous owners and the Indigenous staff. The Muckamuck Restaurant was succeeded by Quilicum in 1986, which was ran by the former Muckamuck staff, but would close down in 1995 before being taken up by Liliget Feast House.\nThe awning of the restaurant featured Watts' family crest featuring a white owl. The restaurant offered seating for 52 individuals, with seating arranged on raised gravel beds. The restaurant's interior contained wooden walkways, beach pebble floors, a system of staircases, cedar-plank tables with sunken legroom, tatami-style benches, and mat seating. Buffed wooden pillars 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) thick separated the restaurant into separate sections. The tables were made so that the wooden slabs would be lifted in order for patrons to climb into the seats. Within the restaurant, the lighting is low due to the lack of windows. The interior featured contemporary First Nations art and Haida prints on the walls, for ambience, the restaurant plays \"laughing water\", pan flute music, and chants. Per Schellhaas, due to occupying the same space as the preceding restaurants, Liliget only differed by the artworks featured in its interior design.\nFood served at Liliget Feast House is typically wild game and seafood prepared in a style by Watts' design. The most popular dishes the restaurant was known for was the salmon and seafood platters, samplings inspired by food served during the potlatch, with Watts expressing her pride in the wild arctic caribou. A 1996 feature by the The New York Times highlighted the \"unusual choices\" including wind dried salmon and pan-fried oolichan. Food is grilled over fire with alder wood as fuel, akin to the food prepared in a traditional manner in the Gitxsan villages Watts grew up in. During the summer, the restaurant served the \"traditional favourites\" lunch hour with a buffalo burger. Dessert served at the restaurant featured few Indigenous options, with the exception of Yel'iss, a mousse made from soopalalie. According to Andrew George Jr., there was significant continuity between the menu between Liliget, Muckamuck, and Quilicum. Despite this, there were unique offerings such as cheddar cheese perogies, crab cakes, clam fritters, stuffed jalapenos with cream cheese, and sweet potato tarts. Food is served on long wooden bowls made from carved cedar and alder, some dishes were served on decorative \"canoes.\"\nHistory\nLiliget Feast House was owned by Dolly Watts, a member of the Gitxsan people who was born 1935 in Kitwanga, British Columbia. Liliget Feast House was preceded by Grandma's Bannock, a small stand outside of the Museum of Anthropology at UBC which was ran by Watts while she attended the University of British Columbia. She recalled that students wanted to raise funds for a trip, Watts offered to make bannock which she would sell for a dollar each. After five days, she sold 1,500 individual bannock. Watts' bannock business would eventually become Just Like Grandma's Bannock Catering in 1992. The bannock business initially ran from rented kitchens, such as the ones in Granville Island Public Market. As demand began to rise, Watts was made aware of the Davie Street location.\nLiliget Feast House was formally founded in 1995. A restaurant space opened up between Deman and Davie streets which was previously owned by a friend of Watts'. Watts was initially hesitant about opening a restaurant in the space, but eventually decided to do so after six months, opening Liliget Feast House late August that year. The restaurant was an initial success, with a peak in business in 1997.\nThe restaurant faced financial difficulties in the years following 1997 due to economic difficulties. Watts speaking to Windspea",
    "\nManeuvers made to maintain a particular location in relation to the earth\nIn aeronautics, atmospheric station-keeping is keeping an aircraft in a specified region in relation to the earth. For an aerostat such as a balloon this could be achieved either by propelling the craft laterally against the wind or by utilizing altitude control mechanisms causing the balloon to go up and down in the sky where it can access different wind layers where the wind is blowing in different directions allowing the system to continually turn into or return to the region of interest allowing it to functionally stay still. \nIn some cases, such as the flight of Loon LLC balloons, machine learning models were employed alongside altitude control systems with superpressure balloon technology to keep balloons floating in specified regions for as long as 39 days.\nBecause high-altitude balloon systems float in sky without consuming any energy, and can employ solar power for any auxiliary power needs, there is no fundamental reason they cannot persist indefinitely at float in the sky. Combining the long duration capability of high altitude flight vehicles with an ability to use altitude control for atmospheric station-keeping allows some high altitude vehicles including high-altitude balloon systems and high-altitude platform station systems to function like satellite systems in geostationary orbit while being much closer to the earth.\nHistory",

    "Town hall in Montpellier, France\nThe H\u00f4tel de Ville (French pronunciation: , City Hall) is a historic building in Montpellier, H\u00e9rault, southern France, standing on Place Georges Fr\u00eache.\nHistory\nH\u00f4tel de Belleval\nThe former H\u00f4tel de Ville on Place Francis-Ponge\nThe city council held its meetings in a building on Place de la Canourgue from 1205, and then in a building on Place Jean Jaur\u00e8s from 1252. After the French Revolution, the council secured a lease on the H\u00f4tel de Belleval on Place de la Canourgue, which had been designed in the neoclassical style and dated back to the second half of the 17th century. The council acquired the building in 1816, and instigated structural improvements, which involved the installation of 12 internal columns, in 1827. The building was designated a monument historique by the French government in 1950.\nIn the early 1970s, the city council led by the mayor, Fran\u00e7ois Delmas, decided to commission a modern building. The site they selected was on Place Francis-Ponge. The new building was designed by Jean-Claude Deshons and Philippe Jaulmes in the modern style, clad in glass and was officially opened by the deputy secretary of the Union of Democrats for the Republic, Albin Chalandon, in 1975.\nAs the responsibilities of the council increased the council took more space in various buildings around the city. In due course, this arrangement was deemed unsatisfactory, and in the early 21st century, the city council, led by the mayor, Georges Fr\u00eache, decided to commission a more sustainable building, where all staff could be collocated. The site they selected was in the Port Marianne district. Construction started in October 2007. The new building was designed by Jean Nouvel and Fran\u00e7ois Font\u00e8s in the modern style, and built by Fayat Group, Bec Construction and Castel & Fromaget, with a steel frame and blue-tinged glass cladding at a cost of \u20ac130 million. It was officially opened by the mayor, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mandroux, on 12 November 2011.\nThe design involved an asymmetrical main frontage, which was 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) wide and 41 meters (135\u00a0ft) high, facing onto a new public space named Place Georges Fr\u00eache, in honour of the mayor who initiated the project. The 12-storey building took the form of a hollow cube, perched across a small lake. It featured a large photovoltaic power station on the roof, to provide heat and light throughout the building. Internally, it provided a new council chamber, as well as offices for 4,000 council staff.\nA statue by the sculptor, Jean-Loup Bouvier, depicting the flamenco guitarist, Manitas de Plata, playing his guitar, was erected in front of the building in June 2017, and a plaque, intended to commemorate the lives of the 41 mayors, who had served the city since 1790, was unveiled by the mayor, Micha\u00ebl Delafosse, on 24 November 2021.\n",
    "The 1950 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 23 February 1950. It was the first election to be held after the abolition of plural voting and university constituencies in addition to a reorganization of constituencies by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949. It was also the first election to be held after a full 5-year term of a Labour government in office.\nWhile the Labour Party registered a narrow majority of 5 seats in the House of Commons, the Conservative Party won 2 seats more than Labour in England (a phenomenon which has since occurred only in 1964). However, in terms of the voteshare, Labour led by nearly 2.5% in England. The wafer-thin majority of the Labour government meant that another election had to be called in October 1951 in which the Conservatives won a narrow majority in the Commons as well as in England, despite Labour winning its highest ever share of the vote (and total raw votes).\nThe turnout registered in this election remains the highest for any election in the post-war era.\nResult Table\n",

    "Albanian noblewoman\nMaria Balsha (Italian: Maria Balsa; Maria del Balzo; Albanian: Maria Balsha; Serbian: \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0448\u0438\u045b), (c.\u20091461\u2013after 22 March 1514), was an Albanian noblewoman from the houses of Balsha and Arianiti. She was Countess of Acerenza and Muro from her marriage to Giacomo Alfonso Ferrillo\u00a0.\nEarly life\nMaria Balsha was the daughter of Goiko Balsha, Lord of Misia and Princess Komita Arianiti. Her father was a nephew of the Lord of Albania, George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, youngest son of his sister Vlaika Kastrioti. Maria's mother, on the other hand, was the daughter of military leader and ruler of the Principality of Arianiti, George Arianiti and his first wife Maria Muzaka, whose family ruled the Principality of Muzaka. Moreover, Komita's older sister and Maria's aunt, Andronika Arianiti was Skanderbeg's wife, further tying their connection to the Lord of Albania. Maria had two brothers who, according to their cousin John Muzaka, died in Hungary.\nDuring the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, Maria's father became a key figure of the Albanian resistance. Goiko was one of the founders of the League of Lezh\u00eb, a military and diplomatic alliance of the Albanian aristocracy, created on 2 March 1444. He continued to fight against Ottoman invasion even after his uncle's death in 1468. Together with his sons, Goiko  joined forces with the Venetians to prevent the Ottomas from further advance. Meanwhile, the seven year old Maria and her mother Komita, fled together with Andronika and other family members to the Kingdom of Naples.   \nThey were welcomed into the court of Queen Joanna of Aragon and in 1483, when she was 22 years old, Maria was married to Giacomo Alfonso Ferrillo, Count of Muro.The couple had two daughters, Beatrice and Isabella. \nDaughter of Vlad the Impaler theory\nIn 2012, Italian historian Raffaele Glinni published two articles in which he claims Maria as the illegitimate daughter of Vlad III of Walachia.  According to the historian, Vlad could be buried in the tomb of Maria's father-in-law, Matteo Ferrillo. The primary reason for this theory, comes from the symbol of a dragon found in the connected blazon of the Ferrillo and the Balsha. Moreover, he identified Misia with a region in Minor Asia, in modern Turkey. In 2014, the same author re-identifies it with the historical region of Dobruja, today shared by Romania and Bulgaria. In reality, the Misia ruled by Goiko Balsha was a coastal region between the cities of Kruja and Lezha in modern Albania. Furthermore, the historian does not take into account how the symbol of the dragon is linked to Maria's maternal grandfather George Arianiti and uncle Skanderbeg, both members of the Order of the Dragon. No historical source ever mentions any meeting having taken place between Komita Arianiti and Vlad the Impaler, nor any illegitimacy rumors concerning Maria Balsha's paternity, prior to Glinni's publication.\nAncestry\nSee also\nArianiti family\nBalsha family",

    "Political corruption in Jammu and Kashmir, India, involving land dealings under Roshni Act\nRoshni Act controversy, also referred to as Roshni Act scam or Roshni land scam, is an alleged scam in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, involving the illegal transfer of 20,46,436 kanals (approx. 1,03,520 hectares) of state land, valued at approximately \u20b925,000 crore (approx. 3 billion USD) to 400 beneficiaries, whose legal status or claims remain contested, under the now-repealed Roshni Act. The scam includes allegations of political corruption, favoritism, and illegal land transfers made under the Act.\nEnacted by the government of Jammu and Kashmir under the chief ministership of Farooq Abdullah in 2001, it was aimed at raising funds for public welfare projects, explicitly for hydroelectric power projects, by transferring ownership of state land to its occupants in exchange for a fee. The Act became the subject of widespread controversy, following the allegations against Kashmiri politicians, businessmen, and bureaucrats. Over time, the scheme was reportedly marred by alleged corruption, manipulation of revenue records, and illegal transfers of land, leading to significant public losses and political controversy. It is considered one of the biggest land scams in the history of Jammu and Kashmir.\nIn 2011, a controversy emerged over allegations of land grabbing in Jammu, initiated by a writ petition filed by professor S.K. Bhalla, then principal of Government Degree College, Mendhar. Bhalla accused several influential individuals, including politicians, bureaucrats, and police officers, of unlawfully occupying land in Jammu. His petition sought the establishment of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to hold those responsible accountable. In 2014, three years after Bhalla's petition, Ankur Sharma, a law student from Kathua, filed a public interest litigation (PIL) before the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, challenging the legality of the Act.\nSharma's PIL sought the disclosure of the beneficiaries of the Act and the retrieval of over 2 million kanals of land, which he alleged had been unlawfully occupied by land mafias. The High Court probed alleged occupying land including cases involving 784 kanals of land in Gole village, 154 kanals owned by the Jammu Development Authority (JDA), and 66,436 kanals transferred to the government by the JDA. The court criticized local investigating authorities for their inaction and alleged collusion with those involved.\nBackground\nThe Roshni Act sought to 'illuminate' the state's finances\u2014derived from the term 'roshni,' meaning 'light' in Hindi and Urdu\u2014by channeling the proceeds from land sales into public welfare projects. This objective is reflected in its name, the 'Roshni Act.\nThe Act was introduced in 2001 by the government of Farooq Abdullah, the then chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, with the stated goal of raising funds for power projects by selling state land to illegal occupants at market rates. The target was to raise an estimated \u20b925,000 crore by regularizing unauthorized occupation of approximately 20.46 lakh kanals (over 1 million acres) of state land. During the period when the Act was introduced, Farooq Abdullah's National Conference was a constituent of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). His son, Omar Abdullah, served as a minister in the government of the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\nIt allowed landholders, especially those occupying large tracts of government land illegally, to gain ownership by paying a fee determined by the government. Over time, amendments were made to the Act, particularly in 2005 by the government led by Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, which significantly reduced the fee that illegal occupants had to pay.\nBy 2007, the administration changed the scope of the Act to benefit a wider section of society, extending ownership rights even to commercial and agricultural landholders, as well as reducing the prices further.\nAllegations\nThe Roshni Act became a subject of scrutiny due to widespread allegations of corruption, fraud, and mismanagement. Political leaders, government officials, and other high-profile individuals were accused of illegally acquiring prime government land in Jammu and Kashmir at significantly undervalued prices.\nThe land records were deliberately manipulated or destroyed to facilitate illegal transfers of land. This led to questions about the authenticity of ownership claims by many beneficiaries. The land under the scheme was reportedly undervalued, with beneficiaries acquiring land at prices far below the market rate. This resulted in huge losses to the state exchequer.\nIt was alleged that several prominent political figures, including leaders of mainstream political parties, including the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC), the Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party (JKPDP), the Indian National Congress, and the leaders of People's Alliance for Gupkar De",

    "RNLI Lifeboat station in Highland, Scotland\nLochinver Lifeboat Station is located at Harbour Road in Lochinver, a harbour town at the head of Loch Inver, on the north-west coast of Scotland, formerly in Sutherland, now in the administrative region of Highland.\nA lifeboat was first placed at Lochinver by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) on 18 August 1967.\nLochinver Severn-class lifeboat 17-40 Julian and Margaret Leonard (ON 1271)\nThe station currently operates a Severn-class All-weather lifeboat, 17-40 Julian and Margaret Leonard (ON 1271), on station since 2003.\nHistory\nDuring the winter of 1966\u20131967, lifeboat trials were carried out at Lochinver. Following a review of both trials and future requirements by the RNLI, it was decided to place an All-weather lifeboat at Lochinver.\nOn 18 August 1967, the 46ft Watson-class lifeboat Dunleary II (ON 814) was initially placed on service at Lochinver. Built in 1938, she had already served 29 years at D\u00fan Laoghaire, and was in her last few years of service.\nLochinver's permanent lifeboat, a 48-foot 6in Oakley MkIII, more commonly known as a Solent-class lifeboat, arrived on 25 July 1969. Built by Groves and Guttridge of Cowes, 48-004 George Urie Scott (ON 1007) was funded by Mrs George Urie Scott, and cost approximately \u00a370,000. Unlike the earlier Oakley lifeboats, the Solent had a steel hull, sub-divided by watertight bulk-heads. It was powered by twin Gardner 6LX engines. This class of life-boat required a crew of seven, and could carry a maximum of about 100 survivors.\nBetween 1978 and 1985, the Solent-class lifeboat was replaced with a MkII 52-foot Barnett-class, the Ramsay Dyce (ON 944). Built by Groves and Guttridge in 1958, she too was another boat at the end of her service life. When she was retired in 1985, in what is probably a unique circumstance for a lifeboat station, the previous lifeboat, 48-004 George Urie Scott (ON 1007), was brought back to the station, and served for another four years. In 1989, the station would receive the 52-foot Arun-class lifeboat 52-42 Murray Lornie (ON 1144).\nRetired lifeboat Ramsay Dyce (ON 944) would perform one more service on 3 May 1992. Sold from service, and used as a dive boat, she responded to a coastguard alert, to any vessels in the Ardmucknish Bay area, for a small inflatable boat with 5 divers, having suffered engine failure. The former lifeboat was soon with the boat, and all were returned to Dunstaffnage Bay.\nIn 1992, the RNLI would receive an extraordinary bequest, a sum of \u00a34 million from the estate of Mrs Eugenie Boucher, specifically to be used for the construction of new boathouses. A native of Penza in Russia, eight so named 'Penza' boathouses would be constructed, including the one at Lochinver.\nA new Severn-class lifeboat was placed at Lochinver on 25 November 2003, and in 2004, a new pontoon berth was constructed, at a cost of \u00a3291,798. At a ceremony on 17 April 2004, the Severn-class lifeboat was named 17-40 Julian and Margaret Leonard (ON 1271).\nAt 19:59 on Sunday 7 December 2014, Stornoway Coastguard received a distress call from the fish carrier Norholm,  drifting towards Cape Wrath in gale-force winds, with no power, and 4 people aboard. Julian and Margaret Leonard was launched at 20:39, arriving with the vessel nearly two hours later at 22:24. In worsening weather, hail stones, with thunder and lightning, getting a line thrown across to the vessel proved impossible, so with skilful seamanship in difficult conditions, a line was floated over to the Norholm, and a tow commenced. Eventually, the vessel was brought 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) off-shore, and at midnight, the rescue helicopter was stood down. The Thurso lifeboat was called to take over at 01:45, with the Lochinver lifeboat returning to base at 07:45. For this service, Coxswain David MacAskill was awarded the RNLI Bronze Medal.\nOn 10 January 2024, Coxswain David MacAskill was formally appointed as a deputy lieutenant for Sutherland.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Lochinver.\nRNLI Bronze Medal\nDavid MacAskill, Coxswain - 2016\nA Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman of the Institution\nStuart Gudgeon, Mechanic - 2016\nRobert Kinnaird, Navigator - 2016\nJames MacAskill, crew member - 2016\nJohn K.

    "Lebanese drug trafficker with ties to Hezbollah and the Medellin Cartel\nChekri Mahmoud Harb (Arabic: \u0634\u0643\u0631\u064a \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f \u062d\u0631\u0628, Spanish: Chekri Mahmud Harb), also known as \"Taliban,\" is a Lebanese national with ties to Hezbollah and the Medellin Cartel. He is known for his involvement in international drug trafficking and money laundering operations, which have helped fund Hezbollah's activities. He is a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker by the U.S. Treasury Department under the Kingpin Act.\nHarb was a central figure in a vast network that funneled proceeds from narcotics sales into the legitimate financial system, circumventing international sanctions and enabling Hezbollah.\nBiography\nInvolvement in drug trafficking and money laundering\nChekri Harb first emerged on the radar of law enforcement through wiretaps in 2007, when he was overheard coordinating drug shipments on behalf of the Medellin Cartel. Harb outlined his smuggling route to an undercover DEA agent, explaining how he transported cocaine by sea to Port Aqaba, Jordan, and then into Syria. His ties to Hezbollah were confirmed when he nodded in response to the agent's mention of the group. He bragged to the\nundercover agent that he could get 950 kilos of drugs into Lebanon within hours. Reportedly, his network paid Hezbollah 12% of its narco-income. During the DEA's \"Operation Titan,\" Harb was revealed to be a significant player in Hezbollah's global drug trafficking and money laundering network. The U.S. Treasury Department designated him as a major narcotics trafficker under the Kingpin Act, linking him to the flow of millions of dollars in drug proceeds from Colombia to Lebanon.\nHezbollah connections\nIntelligence reports indicated that Harb's operations allowed Hezbollah to launder hundreds of millions of dollars, mixing drug money with the proceeds of legitimate businesses. These funds helped the organization finance its operations despite international sanctions targeting the group. U.S. officials believe Hezbollah began turning to global criminal enterprises such as drug trafficking to offset declining financial support from Iran, which had been impacted by economic sanctions. \"The ability of terror groups like Hezbollah to tap into worldwide criminal funding streams is the new post-9/11 challenge,\" said Derek Maltz, the DEA official who oversaw the agency's investigation into the Lebanese Canadian Bank.\nHarb's network utilized the Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) as a hub for its money laundering operations. The U.S. Treasury investigation revealed that Hezbollah-affiliated businessmen, including Harb, were using LCB to move drug money into the legitimate financial system. Accounts linked to the network were used to channel drug proceeds from South America and Africa through Lebanon and into Europe. The investigation into LCB provided a glimpse into Hezbollah's broader financing apparatus, which involved everything from rough-cut diamonds to frozen chicken.\nHezbollah relies on its global financial network to support its terrorist activities. We will continue to take actions to expose and disrupt these illicit networks.\u2014\u200aU.S. Department of the Treasury press release, 2016\nOperation Titan and international investigations\nIn 2008, the DEA's Operation Titan uncovered the full scale of Harb's involvement in drug trafficking, revealing his connections to Hezbollah and the Medellin Cartel. The operation resulted in the arrests of over 130 individuals, including Harb, and the seizure of 23 million dollars in drug money. Colombian authorities described Harb as a key intermediary in moving cocaine from Colombia to the Middle East.\nHarb's criminal activities led to his designation as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker by the U.S. Treasury Department under the Kingpin Act. His assets were frozen, and he was barred from conducting financial transactions with U.S. individuals or entities. Despite these measures, Harb's network continued to operate globally, with ties extending into Europe, Africa, and Latin America.\n",

    "Skyscraper in Mexico City, Mexico\nTorre Punta Reforma also known as Reforma 180 is an office skyscraper in the Cuauht\u00e9moc district of Mexico City, Mexico. Built between 2010 and 2015, the tower stands at 163.7\u00a0m (537\u00a0ft) tall with 37 floors and is the current 24th tallest building in Mexico City and the 33th tallest in Mexico.\nHistory\nArchitecture\nThe tower is located at the intersection of the Avenida de los Insurgentes and Paseo de la Reforma boulevard of Colonia Ju\u00e1rez, in the Cuauht\u00e9moc municipality. The building is one of the most modern skyscrapers in Latin America, not only for the futuristic shape of the building, but also for being the first building in Mexico to receive, since its conception, the Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum NC certification awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), which defines it as a high-performance green building in June 2017.\nThe building houses corporate offices, shops and a fully automated parking lot. The coordinators of the project were Mexican architects Sergio Zepeda and Monique Veraart of the ZVA Group Architects studio.\nFor the 36th floor, a business center and office suites suite were commissioned in the resulting space between the helipad and the roof. Coss & Bodin Architects in collaboration with Colors NY proposed to Colinas de Buen Engineers a six-meter cantilevered volume (glass box) that replaces the weight (Vierendeel Beam) of the equipment that was originally scheduled in this space. A second \"glass box\" is superimposed on this body in the opposite direction to stabilize it, which houses the suite.\nThe building's construction company responsible with the evolution of the site is Cimesa. The developers of the skyscraper are Reforma Bicentenario, who took over the project in November 2010 after the developer Almena, SA de CV allegedly confronted difficulties due to the 2008 Mexican peso crisis.\nThe construction of the tower began in April 2010 and was officially completed in 2014, but the inauguration only took place in early 2015. The complex includes a restaurant, a shopping center and entertainment areas.\nConstruction\nThe official roof height of the construction is of 163.7\u00a0m (537\u00a0ft) to the highest point, and the antenna rises to 168 meters, without counting to the noted height. 37 floors are above ground, while 9 floors serve as underground basements. The total usable gross area of the tower is of 87,000\u00a0m2 (936,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) and the height from floor to ceiling is of 4 meters. The tower disposes of a dynamic, dimensional and thin shape to provide greater stability, due to the seismic zone in which isl be located. It neighbors the high-rise Reforma 222 complex. According to main contractor INPROS, the building is able to withstand an earthquake of 8.5 on the Richter scale.\nSee also\nList of tallest buildings in Mexico\nList of tallest buildings in Mexico City",

He is currently serving his third term as mayor of Vrbas and was a member of the Serbian national assembly from 2022 to 2024. Glu\u0161ac is a member of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).\nEarly life and career\nGlu\u0161ac was born in Vrbas, in what was then the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in the Socialist Republic of Serbia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He was raised in the community, attended the Faculty of Economics at the University of Novi Sad, and has the title of master of engineering in management.\nHe began working as spokesperson and chief-of-staff for the mayor of Vrbas in 2003. He later chaired the board of directors for the public company Vrbas from 2004 to 2008, was deputy head of the municipality's economy department from 2008 to 2009, and was appointed to oversee the office of the control inspector in the department of local public revenues in 2009.\nPolitician\nEarly candidacies\nGlu\u0161ac appeared in the fourteenth position on the Progressive Party's electoral list for Vrbas in a special off-year municipal election in 2009. The list won six seats, finishing third, and he did not receive an assembly mandate.\nHe appeared in the twenty-third position on the Progressive Party's list in the 2012 Vojvodina provincial election, which was held under a system of mixed proportional representation. The Progressives won fourteen proportional seats, and he was not elected.\nFirst terms as mayor\nGlu\u0161ac was given the second position on the Progressive Party's list for Vrbas in the 2013 local elections and was elected when the list won eighteen out of thirty-six seats. The Progressives formed a local coalition government with the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) after the election. Bratislav Ka\u017ei\u0107 of the Progressives was chosen as the municipality's mayor, and Glu\u0161ac became deputy mayor.\nKa\u017ei\u0107 resigned as mayor on 14 July 2016, and Glu\u0161ac was chosen by the municipal assembly as his replacement. Shortly thereafter, he was profiled by the journal Vreme for supporting a comprehensive program of energy efficiency in the community.\nGlu\u0161ac's first mayoral term was relatively brief. He announced his resignation in January 2017 in order to harmonize the municipal's upcoming municipal election with the 2017 Serbian presidential election. His resignation became official on 21 February 2017, and he was appointed to lead a provisional administration on the same day.\nGlu\u0161ac led the SNS's list for Vrbas in the 2017 local elections and was re-elected when the list won seventeen seats. The Progressives and Socialists continued their alliance after the election, and he was chosen for a second term as mayor on 11 May 2017.\nHe resigned as mayor again in late 2019, and his resignation became official on 24 February 2020. It was understood that this was done to ensure Vrbas's next municipal election would be harmonized with Serbia's main local election cycle. He was once again appointed as the leader of a provisional government.\nGlu\u0161ac again led the Progressive Party's list for Vrbas in the 2020 local elections (which were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and was re-elected when the list won a majority victory with twenty-two seats. He did not return to the mayor's office afterward; Predrag Rojevi\u0107 was chosen as the municipality's new mayor on 21 August 2020, and Glu\u0161ac, after a gap of four years, was chosen for his second term as deputy mayor. He resigned from this role on 18 May 2021 and returned as a member of the municipal assembly on 30 June.\nParliamentarian\nGlu\u0161ac appeared in the 130th position on the Progressive Party's list in the 2022 Serbian parliamentary election.

    "1861 battle of the American Civil War\nThe Skirmish at Smith's Farm was a Civil War skirmish fought near Newport News, Virginia on July 5, 1861, as part of the operations on the Virginia Peninsula. Confederate commander Col. Charles Didier Dreux was killed in the skirmish, becoming the first Confederate field officer killed in the Civil War.\nBackground\nFollowing the Confederate victory at the Battle of Big Bethel, the war on the Virginia Peninsula settled into a stalemate, with both sides building fortifications and preparing for the next campaign. Occasional patrols were sent between the lines to forage for supplies or scout for enemy activity, but neither force was strong enough, or confident enough, to bring on an engagement.\nConfederate Brigadier General John B. Magruder, commanding the Hampton Division, assigned the 1st Louisiana Infantry Battalion to guard Young's Mill, supported by a section of artillery from the 3rd Company of the Richmond Howitzers, and cavalry from the Catawba Troop of Halifax Cavalry. Lt. Col. Charles D. Dreux of the 1st Louisiana took command and established the camp at Young's Mill.\nOn July 4, Col. Dreux hosted a barbecue in camp to celebrate Independence Day. Attending the gathering was Colonel Lafayette McLaws, commander of the Confederate forces at Yorktown. Dreux gave a rousing speech, making it clear he did not intend to wait passively at Young's Mill for the Union army to advance. He stated: \n\u201cThis is our day, and we will have it\u201d.\nThat evening, during a council with his officers, Capt. William Collins of the Catawba Troop of Cavalry informed Dreux that Union troops were frequently seen at the home of Nelson Smith, located along the James River, four miles to the south of the Confederate camp. Capt. Robert Stanard of the Richmond Howitzers suggested they take a detachment and ambush the Federals, a plan Dreux wholeheartedly endorsed.\nThe same day, Capt. William W. Hammell, with 25 men of Company F, 9th New York Infantry, had bivouacked a few miles outside the Union camp at Newport News Point.\nShortly after midnight on July 5, Dreux departed Young's Mill with 100 infantry, 20 cavalry, and one howitzer. At dawn on July 5, Capt. Hammell and his men left their bivouac on a patrol northwards to scout the Confederate positions, both forces converging around the farm of Nelson Smith.\nOrder of battle\nUnion\nCompany F, 9th New York Infantry Regiment - Capt. William Hammell (25+ men)\nConfederate\n1st Louisiana Infantry Battalion - Col. Charles Didier Dreux (100+ men)\nCatawba Troop of Cavalry - Capt. William Collins (20+ men)\n3rd Company, Richmond Howitzers - Capt. Robert C. Stanard (1 gun, 10 men)\nSkirmish\nAs the Confederates neared a wooded lane running perpendicular to the main Warwick Road, near Smith's Farm, Dreux positioned his artillery facing down the lane, with the cavalry behind it and the Louisiana infantry deployed on either side. Dreux ordered his men not to open fire until the Union troops had passed. However, as sunrise approached with no sign of the enemy, Dreux grew impatient and sent scouts down the Warwick Road to determine their location.\nAs Hammell and the 9th New York advanced northwards, they were alerted to the Confederate presence when a Louisianan fired prematurely, prompting the Federals to disperse in the woods and return fire from cover.\nCapt. Collins reported:\n\u201cThe first information I received of the approach of the enemy, a gun was fired to our left, on the main road, and was immediately followed by another, and, with a short pause, the firing was again commenced about the same point, which was kept up regularly, the balls cutting around very near myself and men.\u201d\nAccording to Union accounts, as the fire fight began, Col. Dreux stepped into the road and shouted towards his men: \n\u201cStop, stop for God\u2019s sake stop\u2014you\u2019re shooting your own men!\u201d\nDreux mistook Hammell's men for his own scouts, as they were far fewer in number than the large Union force he had expected.\nHammell hesitated briefly, as the Louisianan's grey uniforms resembled those of the 1st Vermont Infantry Regiment, but he then ordered his men to resume firing. During the skirmish, Sgt. Peter Martin of the 9th New York fatally shot Col. Dreux in the side as he attempted to rally his men. Dreux's last words were reportedly: \n\u201cSteady, boys, steady!\u201d\nConfederates rushed forward and dragged the body of their colonel, as well as that of another confederate officer who was killed, back to their lines in the woods.\nThe dense woods made visibility poor, and it seemed to the Confederates that Union fire was coming from all directions. In the ensuing chaos after the death of Dreux, Capt. Stanard ordered the howitzer to be limbered up and moved to cover the main road. The Catawba Troop of Cavalry, misinterpreting this as a signal to retreat, surged forward, surprising the horses pulling the gun. The driver lost control of the team, and the artillery retreated to Young's Mill in disorder. The Catawba Troop ",

    "Presiding officer of the Bruneian legislative council\nThe Speaker of the Legislative Council of Brunei (Malay: Yang Di-Pertua Majlis Mesyuarat Negara) is a pivotal figure in the governance process, responsible for managing the proceedings and voting within the council, ensuring transparency in legislative decisions. Appointed by the Head of State, the Speaker ranks fourth in the state hierarchy and does not assume the role of interim head of state during transitions. This position is vital for maintaining democratic principles and accountability within Brunei's legislative framework.\nFunctions\nThe Speaker of the Legislative Council in Brunei plays a crucial role in managing the council's proceedings and voting process. When a question is posed to the council, the Speaker collects the votes by calling for \"Ayes\" and \"Noes.\" If no member requests a division, the Speaker declares the result based on the voices heard. However, if a division is called, each member must verbally cast their vote, and the Speaker or chairman announces the results. In the event of a tie, the Speaker has the authority to cast the deciding vote. The Speaker also oversees the maintenance of the council's minutes, which are recorded by the Clerk. These minutes detail all decisions and significant matters, and they are signed by the Speaker. If a member identifies inaccuracies in the minutes, they must raise these through a personal explanation, submitting the issue to the Speaker for resolution. Additionally, any member wishing to ask a question must submit it in writing to the Clerk at least seven days in advance unless special approval is granted by the Speaker for shorter notice.\nAppointments\nThe speaker of the Legislative Council is appointed by the head of state, who has the authority to designate the speaker, even when selected from outside the parliament. In the state hierarchy, the Speaker ranks fourth, following the Sultan, the crown prince (who is the Senior Minister at the Prime Minister's Office), and the special advisor to His Majesty the Sultan. Unlike in other countries, the Speaker does not serve as the interim head of state in the event of the Sultan's death or incapacity. The Speaker's mandate continues between legislative terms, and while the term of the Speaker differs from that of the house, there is no fixed election date or term length established. The Sultan appoints the Speaker through an official Instrument under the Seal of Brunei Darussalam, and while the Speaker may be chosen from among the council members, if no Speaker is appointed or the position is vacant, references to the Speaker in the Constitution are interpreted as references to the prime minister. The Speaker serves at His Majesty's pleasure for a period specified in the appointment and can resign by addressing a letter to the Sultan. If the Speaker is appointed from among the council members, they must vacate the office if they cease to be a member. The Speaker is required to attend and preside over all Legislative Council meetings, and in their absence, another member, either appointed by the Speaker or, if none is appointed, the highest-ranking member present, will preside.\nList of speakers\nNotes\n",

Detailing and furniture by Haefeli (1939).\nMax Ernst Haefeli (25 January 1901 \u2013  17 June 1976) was a Swiss architect, furniture designer, and co-founder of the Haefeli Moser Steiger (HMS) architectural firm. He subscribed to the New Building architectural school of thought in Switzerland.\nEducation and training\nHaefeli studied architecture at ETH Zurich from 1919 to 1923, under Karl Moser. His graduation project was a design for the Enge station in Zurich, developed along with fellow students Flora Crawford and Rudolf Steiger.\nAfter completing his training, Haefeli moved to Berlin for a year at the office of Otto Bartning. He returned to Switzerland and worked with his father at the firm of Pfleghard & Haefeli from 1924 - 1925.\nCareer and notable works\nHaefeli opened his own office in 1925, with his first commission being the design of a lakeside house for his aunt Maria Ritter in Erlenbach. In the late 1920s, he collaborated with Ernst Kadler-V\u00f6geli and Swiss manufacturer M\u00f6belfabrik Horgen-Glarus AG on furniture design. He outfitted part of publisher Hans Girsberger's bookshop in 1926. Haefeli set up six model apartments in the Weissenhof estate for Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's apartment building in 1927.\nIn 1928, Haefeli and 28 prominent European architects of the time formed the Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) in La Sarraz, Switzerland. The co-founders included Le Corbusier, Sigfried Giedion, Hendrik Berlage, Karl Moser, and his future business partner Werner M. Moser.\nFrom 1938 - 1939, Haefeli, Werner Moser, and garden architect Gustav Ammann designed the Allenmoos open-air swimming pool in Zurich (dubbed Parkbad). With other CIAM members, Haefeli designed the Neub\u00fchl housing estate in Wollishofen. He contributed numerous furniture pieces to Wohnbedarf AG, a showroom run by Werner Moser, Rudolf Graber, and Sigfried Giedion from 1931 onwards.\nIn 1933, the Erweiterungsplan der Stadt Bern und ihrer Vororte (translated to Expansion Plan of the City of Bern and its Suburbs) competition was conducted in Bern, Switzerland. Haefeli, Rudolf Steiger, and Werner M. Moser won the competition and were awarded a contract for the design of the Kongresshaus Zurich in 1936. This led to the formation of the office community - Haefeli Moser Steiger (HMS), on 1 April 1937. The community existed until 1970 when Moser passed away. Thereafter, it was renamed Haefeli und Steiger and continued until 1975.\nHaefeli was responsible for the construction and detailing works undertaken by HMS. This is evidenced by the exterior design and interiors of the Kongresshaus, Cantonal Hospital (today University Hospital), and administration building of Eternit AG in Niederurnen.\nDuring his time with HMS, Haefeli built numerous houses, including a Shingle-style house in Wattwil for Toggenburg-based industrialist Rudolf Beherlein (1940 - 1941) and his own home in Herrliberg (1947 - 1948).\n",

    "Park in County Cork, Ireland\nBallincollig Regional Park is a park in Ballincollig, County Cork, Ireland, created on the grounds of the former Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills.\nThe park is approximately 135 acres (55 hectares) in area, with 52 structures in varying stages of decay surviving from the gunpowder manufacturing process. Most of the former gunpowder manufacturing was localized in the eastern part of the park, where ruins of the charcoal mill, saltpeter, and sulphur refineries can be seen. The western part is larger and the buildings are sparser, with press house, granulating mill, and dusting house remaining.\nThe site is approximately 2.4 kilometres in length and the River Lee runs the northern length of the site, creating a natural boundary of the park. The site contains a system of canals used during the manufacturing process connecting all the process areas in a single flat system without locks. The canals are fed from the River Lee at the western end of the site, and they were regraded and reformed in the late 1980 by the Cork City Council.\nDevelopment\nIn 1974, the derelict Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills site was purchased by Cork City Council, largely thanks to the efforts of historian George D. Kelleher to whom a plaque was dedicated in the park in 2008. Most of the tenders for the development of car parks, footbridges, footpaths, etc., and the job advertisement for park caretaker, were posted between 1987 and 1988.\nThe park contains soccer pitches, a rugby pitch, walkways, a skateboard facility built at the cost of 170,000 euro, and free-to-use outdoor fitness equipment - the latter installed on the park's western end in November 2011. As a result of a 2012 development plan, which outlined the future of the Regional Park by the Recreation & Amenity section of the local authority, planning was approved for multi-use games areas and a children's playground. By 2019, the total of 1.4 million euro was spent on facilities. An 80-plot allotment scheme was also identified within the development plan, and was opened in November 2013 at the Innishmore entrance to the Regional Park.\nA series of marked trails were laid-out in 2014, and consist of four looped walks, colour-coded according to length. The Military Trail begins at the Shopping Centre Square and continues to the Regional Park by a westerly route. Three other trails of varying lengths begin and end at the western end of the park at Inniscarra Bridge. The establishment of the trails included installing new signage and information maps.\nIn 2019, the park was extended to Fionn Laoi, an east Ballincollig area adjacent to the river. The development including installing a riverside walk and cycleway.\nIn 2021, many additional trees were planted throughout the park.\nIn 2024, a Little Free Library was installed close to the western entrance to the park.\nUse\nIn the 1990s, horse and pony races were organised on the park's grounds. Surveys as early as in 1992 documented high levels of satisfaction of the visitors. In 2018, estimated 660,000 visited the park. The location is used as a venue for social and sporting events, such as Parkrun and Heritage Week.\nAccess\nThe park has four main entrances, with two at its western and eastern extremities, and two from the southern side. There are car parks near each entrance, with the largest ones by the two westernmost ones. In the late 2010s, public toilets and wheelchair-friendly parking spaces were added in these two car parks.\n",

    "Ready to Learn expections on a classroom poster and printed in a student planner at West Exe School, Exeter in 2018.\nFor the American funding scheme for educational television programmes, see Ready-to-Learn.\nReady to Learn (RTL) is a controversial zero-tolerance behaviour policy template used in some British secondary schools.    Under RTL, students receive a warning for any minor infraction; on committing a second minor infraction, they are sent to an \"isolation\" room for five lessons (looping around to the next day if necessary) and a one-hour detention after school.  This is described as an \"extremely simple, binary system\".\nReady to Learn was developed by Henbury School in Bristol in 2016.  It has since been adopted by many other academies nationally.  Some schools have implemented RTL under alternative names, making it challenging to estimate the extent of its usage.\nHistory\nReady to Learn was created at Henbury School, Bristol in January 2016.  Headteacher Clare Bradford and assistant headteacher Matthew Stevenson have both claimed sole responsibility. Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie praised the system, and invited former Labour schools minister Jim Knight to tour the school, resulting in Knight also evaluating the system favourably. Ofsted subsequently assessed in November 2018 that school leaders' \"attention to the implementation of the school's behaviour strategy, 'ready to learn', has diverted their attention from tackling the school's sharp and severe decline in pupils' academic performance\", and rated the school Inadequate.:\u200a4\u200a\nIt has been argued that Ready to Learn emerged as the result of an interaction between, on the one hand, socially conservative rhetoric from the Department for Education under Michael Gove's tenure as Education Secretary, and central pressure to adopt whole-school policies on \"low-level disruption\", and on the other hand, an existing Blairite synthesis of a progressive and behaviourist approach to behaviour management with a neoliberal \"language of management\" and willingness to exclude pupils to improve a school's average results (with this aspect emerging out of the Baker reforms of the 1980s).:\u200a16\u201322\u200a  Journalist Michal Grant has called RTL a \"symptom of school leaders not seeing children as complex young people\", a view similar to that espoused by some pupils subject to the system.:\u200a45\u20136\u200a  Stevenson himself cited a training course at the Ambition Institute and a fact-finding mission to other schools as the inspirations for the policy.\nLocal press cited the introduction of Ready to Learn to West Exe School, Exeter in 2017 as the reason for the school's improvement in results.  The Ted Wragg Multi-Academy Trust had also introduced RTL to other schools in Exeter, including Isca Academy.  The Ted Wragg Trust renamed RTL to \"Reset\" at their schools in 2020.:\u200a10\u200a  In April 2023, a parents' campaign group, Reset Ted Wragg, was established to oppose the policy, stating \"Reset / RTL are finished ... We do not consent to these archaic punishments\".  The Trust initially agreed to review its policies, but the group dismissed the proposed amendments to the RTL system as inadequate.  As of September 2024, the group remains active, accusing the Trust of \"doubling-down on outdated and unpleasant\" policies.\nBristol City Council's independent review into alternative learning provision in 2020 found that most Bristol secondary schools were using Ready to Learn or a similar policy.:\u200a22\u200a  The report states that there \"appears to be an evidence base that says 'Ready to Learn' is an effective whole school behaviour approach and some schools have described it in positive terms as 'transformational'\", but also that RTL results in disproportionate numbers of pupils with additional needs being excluded and put into alternative provision.:\u200a22\u200a\nIn popular culture\nThe fifth episode of School (2018), a BBC Two documentary, focuses on the introduction of Ready to Learn to the Castle School Education Trust in South Gloucestershire.  The programme describes RTL as \"strict\" and frames it as a cost-saving substitute for more expensive bespoke measures for children with complex needs.:\u200a11:04\u200a  A senior leader at Marlwood School concedes that RTL is unfair on students with complex needs.:\u200a25:06\u200a  When headteachers raise concerns about RTL's fairness, the trust's CEO encourages them to \"hold our nerve\" in enforcing it, saying that he would \"rather have the problem\" of a minority of students missing lessons than see lessons be disrupted.:\u200a30:48\u200a\n",

    "For the European postsecondary system, see degree apprenticeship.\nAn apprenticeship degree is a U.S. postsecondary system that integrates on-the-job training with an accredited academic degree. In an apprenticeship degree, practical work experience is emphasized, with academic coursework structured around the job training. A degree seeker works full-time for an employer, receives college credit for the work they do on-the-job, and earns an associate degree, bachelor's degree, master's degree, or doctoral degree from an accredited college or university at the end of the program.\nUnlike a traditional apprenticeship, an apprenticeship degree operates within credit-bearing higher education. In partnership with an accredited college or university, an apprenticeship degree is most common in industries facing acute labor shortages and in professions that require a degree, such as K-12 education, health care, technology, and business. In some cases, the apprenticeship degree includes a licensure component, such as obtaining a teaching credential.\nApprenticeship degrees can take two to six years to complete, depending on the institution, academic discipline, and previously awarded postsecondary credits. Apprentices are paid from day one through graduation and the degree program is offered with little to no student loan debt. Apprenticeship degrees can be funded by federal, state, or philanthropic sources, depending on the apprenticeship type. Upon completion, apprenticeship degrees typically lead to career advancement at the apprentice's existing employer.\nConcept\nIn building upon work-based learning, competency-based degrees, and college-connected apprenticeships, apprenticeship degrees combine on-the-job training with accredited degree programs.\nApprenticeship degrees enable employers to train employees without a degree to fill professional vacancies, while providing employees a paid, low-to-no cost way to earning a degree and advancing their career. The workplace becomes the degree seeker's primary place of learning, removing the common dilemma of choosing between pursuing a degree full-time or earning a paycheck. The training is directly aligned with the learner's field of study and future profession. On-the-job learning is supported by academic seminars, typically held online outside of work hours.\nWhile similar degree-conferring apprenticeships have long been common in the U.K., Germany, France, and other countries, the integration of an apprenticeship with a traditional degree was first utilized in the U.S. in 2010. Unlike its European counterparts, this apprenticeship-based degree model is referred to as an \"apprenticeship degree,\" rather than a \"degree apprenticeship,\" emphasizing the modification of the traditional U.S. degree experience.\nExpansion\nBeginning in 2022, in response to continued qualified teacher shortages, the Biden Administration accelerated the expansion of degree-conferring apprenticeships in K-12 education through teacher registered apprenticeships and its investment in quality teacher preparation programs.\nThese federally-funded programs, commonly referred to as \"grow your own\" initiatives, aim to train entry-level talent to become licensed teachers. They have garnered bipartisan state support and continue to expand through significant federal and state investments.\nIn 2022, two states offered registered teacher apprenticeships. By May 2024, teacher apprenticeship degree programs had expanded to 37 states and territories, with growing interest from peer industries facing acute labor shortages.\nWhile apprenticeship degrees offer significant benefits, they can be more time-consuming and costly to develop compared to other apprenticeship models, as the degree is specific to the apprenticeship career pathway, integrates apprenticeship classroom training, and recognizes on-the-job learning credit. Creating a new degree program around an apprenticeship, such as designing new courses or converting non-credit courses into credit-bearing ones, requires faculty and departmental approvals, accreditation reviews, authorization from state higher education offices, and in some cases, approval from the U.S. Department of Education (ED) or U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for access to federal funding.\nIn February 2024, the nonprofit National Center for the Apprenticeship Degree (NCAD) was established to assist states, institutions of higher education, employers, and funders in developing apprenticeship degree programs in high-need sectors. NCAD, an initiative of Reach University, serves as an apprenticeship degree intermediary, collaborating with universities, industry partners, and state and local systems to increasing offerings of apprenticeship degrees.\nUsage\nCommunity colleges, which are typically more focused on vocational training, to usually more able to adopt and expand apprenticeship degrees in industries such as health care, information technology, business, and advanced manufacturing, where de",
    "Town hall in Nice, France\nThe H\u00f4tel de Ville (French pronunciation: , City Hall) is a historic building in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, southern France, standing on Rue Saint-Fran\u00e7ois de Paule.\nHistory\nThe building was commissioned as part of a masterplan instigated by Louis XIV, in 1706, to reclaim the Pr\u00e9-aux-Oies area of Nice which had previously been marshland. After sanitation had been installed, Rue Saint-Fran\u00e7ois de Paule was the first street to be laid out. Located on the north side of the street, the building was originally conceived as a seminary. It was designed in the neoclassical style, built in ashlar stone and the first phase was completed in 1722. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of seven bays facing onto Rue Saint-Fran\u00e7ois de Paule. The original design of the five-storey building was austere: it was fenestrated with tall casement windows with shutters on all floors. There were iron grills on the windows on the ground floor, and segmental pediments above the windows on the second floor.\nIn 1792, Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia declared war of Revolutionary France, and his officers requisitioned the building for use as military barracks. After the city was conquered by troops of the French First Republic later that year, the barracks were occupied by French republican troops. The building remained in military use until 1804, when it became a gendarmerie. Following the fall of Napoleon in 1815, it was acquired by Saint-Roch Hospital for medical use. The new Saint-Roch Hospital on Rue Pierre D\u00e9voluy was completed in 1858, and the building on Rue Saint-Fran\u00e7ois de Paule then reverted to being a gendarmerie.\nThe building was acquired by Nice City Council in 1866, and was converted for municipal use to a design by the city architect, Fran\u00e7ois Aune. Council officers relocated from their old accommodation at the Palais communal de Nice in Place Saint-Fran\u00e7ois into their new home on Rue Saint-Fran\u00e7ois de Paule in 1868.\nFollowing the election of Jean M\u00e9decin as mayor of Nice in 1928, the council decided to remodel the building in the Art Deco style. A major programme of external works was carried out to a design by Nicolas Anselmi, and the interior was redecorated to a design by Cl\u00e9ment Goyen\u00e8che. The external works included the installation of a two-storey portico, formed by six two storey Doric order columns supporting a balcony, on the Rue Saint-Fran\u00e7ois de Paule, as well as the creation of a new courtyard entrance on Rue de H\u00f4tel de Ville i.e. the east side of the building. A sculpture depicting a 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) high thumb, designed by C\u00e9sar Baldaccini, was installed in the new courtyard in 1965.\nFurther internal modifications were made in 1967 to a design by \u00c9mile Rous. A plaque, intended to commemorate the lives of 17 resistance fighters from the 1st Canton who died in the Second World War was installed in the courtyard and restored in the early 21st century. Individual plaques commemorating the lives of the resistance fighters, Jean Marius-Gordolon and Joseph Giuge, both of whom died close to the building, were fixed to the main fa\u00e7ade of the building.\n",

He wrote Gaelic-language poems on Jacobite themes.\nBiography\nBorn to Scottish parents in Ockham, Surrey, Moffat-Pender grew up in Scotland and was a rugby union forward during his youth, culminating in him being capped for the national team against England in a 1914 Calcutta Cup match at Inverleith.\nMoffat-Pender served in France as a Captain with the Seaforth Highlanders in World War I, over the course of which he was wounded three times. It was during this time that he developed his interest in the Gaelic language. He learned Gaelic through interacting with soldiers from the Isle of Lewis, where he moved after being decommissioned to immerse himself in the language, while also studying at the University of Edinburgh under the tutelage of William J. Watson.\nAs a Unionist Party candidate, Moffat-Pender attempted to enter British parliament on three occasions. He contested the 1929 and 1931 general elections for the Western Isles constituency, as well as the 1929 Wansbeck by-election. The closest he came to being elected was in 1931 when he fell 1,000 votes short of incumbent MP Thomas Ramsay of the National Liberal Party.\nMoffat-Pender lived in Australia from 1931 until World War II and was a successful sheep farmer.\nIn 1956, Moffat-Pender won the Bardic Crown at the Largs M\u00f2d for his epic poem \"The Eve of the Battle of Largs\".\nSee also\nList of Scotland national rugby union players",
    "Italian sweet\nThe cassatella di Agira T(communal designation) are traditional sweets from the Enna gastronomy, originating in the town of Agira and widely found not only in the province of Enna but throughout much of eastern Sicily. As a typical Sicilian product, they have been officially recognized and included in the list of traditional Italian agri-food products (P.A.T) by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (Mipaaf).\nThese pastries, characteristic of the Enna pastry tradition, are crescent-shaped and made from a tender shortcrust pastry that is golden yellow and dusted with powdered sugar. The filling consists of a mixture of cocoa, ground almonds, chickpea flour, sugar, and dried lemon zest, with optional cinnamon added.\nA festival dedicated to the Cassatelle di Agira takes place in the hometown of Diodorus Siculus, Agira. These sweets are available year-round in restaurants, bars, and pastry shops throughout the Enna province and in numerous restaurants in Catania. Some renowned pastry chefs have reinterpreted the traditional recipe, creating an excellent pistachio variant.\nGiven that the production process is labor-intensive and involves several carefully guarded steps passed down through generations, variations in the manufacturing of this sweet can be significant. Recently, there has been a notable increase in imitations that bear little resemblance to the original product. \nThe authenticity and typicality of Cassatelle di Agira can be verified by their dimensions, which are typically 10 \u00d7 6 cm. Additionally, the dough should be soft and not dry or crumbly; neither chocolate nor cocoa should dominate the flavor\u2014both almond taste should also be perceptible. Finally, the shortcrust pastry should not be overcooked or soggy.\nSee also\nItaly portalFood portal\nList of Italian desserts and pastries",

    "\nFictional character\nAnxiety is a fictional character from the 2024 film Inside Out 2. She is the personification of the emotion of the same name. Anxiety serves as an antagonist in the film.\nDevelopment\nIn early drafts of Inside Out 2, Anxiety was intended to be an antagonistic force.  Kelsey Mann, the director of the film, said that she felt like a \"Cardboard Villain\", and was unsatisfied with the writing. He hired two psychologists as advisers. Lisa Damour and Dacher Keltner, and they decided to rewrite it so that  Anxiety would be motivated by the love of Riley.  Lisa Damour  stated that one of the ways to solve anxiety, grounding, or touching a physical object, inspired a scene where Riley overcomes a panic attack by touching a  Hockey Stick.\nAppearances\nAnxiety is first shown to appear in the film Inside Out 2.  She is one of the four new emotions in the film. After Riley Andersen goes to an ice hockey summer camp, she decides to take over Riley's brain entirely. Joy and the other main emotions are stranded, and are forced to come back. Anxiety tries to mold Riley in her own image, causing Riley to be obsessed with succeeding in hockey. At one point, Riley has a panic attack. However, by the end of the film, the other emotions come back.\nReception\nAnxiety has received praise.  Meg Walter of Deseret said that the film helped her understand her own anxiety. Noah Berlatsky, in a CNN article,  said that \" I appreciate the way that \u201cInside Out 2\u201d gives its anxious antagonist a heart and some positive characteristics amidst its frantic quivering\"\n",

    "French Ambassadors to China\nThe list of ambassadors of France to China began after diplomatic relations were established in 1847. The official title of this French diplomat is \"Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the French Republic to the People's Republic of China\".\nHistory\nPalace of the French Legation in Beijing in 1860.\nThe first contacts between China and the West were established by Marco Polo in the 13th century. During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, missionaries continued the French settlement on Chinese soil. However, due to the remoteness of China, France, like most European countries, did not feel the need to establish diplomatic relations with the Chinese Empire for several centuries.\nList of heads of mission\nThe updated list is available on the website of the French Embassy in Beijing.\nTaiwan\nThe current regime ruling Taiwan comes from the exile on the island of Taiwan of the Chinese leaders after the communist revolution of 1949 and the end of the nationalist republican regime. The two governments have since then disputed the sovereignty of the entire Chinese territory. Although tending towards democracy according to the criteria of the European Union, the sovereignty of the country is not officially recognized. The seat occupied by the Republic of China at the United Nations was also lost in 1971 to the benefit of the People's Republic of China, which became the sole representative of China. Only 23 countries (but none in Asia, Europe or North America) out of the 192 that make up the UN recognize the Republic of China and maintain official diplomatic relations with it.

    "Apartment building in Manhattan, New York\n27 West 67th Street is a cooperative apartment building located near Lincoln Square in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Completed late in 1902 and opened early the next year, it was designed by an artist named Henry Ward Ranger and financed by an association of his fellow artists. Ranger's innovative design provided for compact duplex apartments conjoined with large north-facing studios. The association was organized as a corporation whose financial structure followed a cooperative model. The corporation built and managed the co-op while its artist-investors held leases for the studio apartments they occupied. The project was an immediate success, leading other artist-investors to finance and build similar studio co-ops nearby. In 1995, following a thorough restoration, the architectural historian Christopher Gray wrote that the building was \"one of the most important apartment houses in the history of New York City\". As evidenced by the cost of ownership and demand for its studio apartments, the co-op has continued to thrive in the early years of the 21st century.\nSite history\nImage No. 1, detail from The City of New York as laid out by the Commissioners with the surrounding country by John Randel (1821, colored map, 19 x 33 cm.)\nImage No. 2, Map bounded by West 72nd Street, Eighth Avenue, West 67th Street, Tenth Avenue, Plate 117, 1857\nImage No. 3, Central Park West and 72nd Street, looking south from the Dakota, ca. 1890\nImage No. 4, Manhattan, V. 6, Double Page Plate No. 117 , 1892 \nImage No. 5, Detail from Bird's-eye-view of Manhattan and adjacent districts, New York City, 1900\nImage No. 6, Detail from Manhattan, V. 6, Plate No. 26   \nImage No. 7, Entrance to 27 West 67th Street, from The Architectural Record  (October 1903, Vol 14, Iss 4, p. 237)\nImage No. 8, Entrance to 27 West 67th Street in 2022\nImage No. 9, 27 West 67th Street Studio building in 1903\nImage No. 10, Facade of 27 West 67th Street in 2022\nImage No. 11, Studio of Louis Paul Dessar in 1903\nImage No. 12, Dining Room of Louis Paul Dessar in 1903\nImage No. 13, Dining Room in the Apartment of Frank DuMond in 1903\nImage No. 14, Apartment of B.

In 1708 the city began to make the Upper West Side accessible to residents by building an extension of Broadway called Bloomingdale Road. At that time the area was rural, and it remained sparsely settled through the 18th and much of the 19th century. A detail from a map prepared in 1821 shows its dispersed farmhouses. See Image No. 1. A sheet from a fire insurance atlas made about forty years later shows a few substantial brick buildings close to Bloomingdale Road but only a smattering of small wooden structures in and near the block where the studio building would later be constructed. See Image No. 2. Following the creation of Central Park in the 1860s, speculators began to place large apartments like the elegant Dakota on the blocks between the park's western boundary and Columbus Avenue, but most of the area still remained home to squatters' shanties, stables, lumber yards, and disreputable saloons, and many of its streets remained unpaved. A photo taken from the roof of the Dakota about 1890 shows Central Park West at left and the area to its west from 72nd Street south to 59th or 60th. See Image No. 3.\nEconomic prosperity, the attractions of Central Park, expansion of the rapid transit system, and improvements in elevator technology, together with the relatively low cost of land, caused real estate speculators to put up large apartment houses, mostly, like the Dakota, on the avenues and broad crosstown streets in the neighborhood.:\u200a290\u200a:\u200a223\u200a:\u200a234\u200a\nDemand for artists' studios\nOften called the city's Gilded Age, the period between 1870 and 1900 was remarkable for its economic growth, for the displays of wealth by its opulent citizens, and for the dramatic expansion of its cultural activity. Newly prosperous New Yorkers began to assemble art collections, first concentrating on highly regarded European artists and then, increasingly, on paintings and sculptures by Americans. By 1912, as one artist put it, \"the American artist's work is  as good an investment artistically and financially as his fellow artists abroad.\" This artist concluded by writing, bluntly, that investment in the work of American artists \"will pay better than so many stocks and bonds\". At the turn of the century the city's newly prosperous artists found themselves with more money to spend on studios and apartments but also, as prosperity induced a general quest for improved living standards, with more competition with each other for a limited number of places in which t",
    "River in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Czech Republic\nThe B\u011bl\u00e1 is a river in the Czech Republic, a right tributary of the Divok\u00e1 Orlice River. It flows through the Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Region. It is 40.6\u00a0km (25.2\u00a0mi) long.\nEtymology\nB\u011bl\u00e1 is a common Czech name of watercourses, derived from the Czech word b\u00edl\u00e1 (i.e. 'white'). Names of rivers with this colour in the name often referred to the stony or pebbly nature of the river bed.\nCharacteristic\nThe B\u011bl\u00e1 in Kvasiny\nThe B\u011bl\u00e1 originates in the territory of Sedlo\u0148ov in the Orlick\u00e9 Mountains below the mountain Velk\u00e1 De\u0161tn\u00e1 at an elevation of 1,048\u00a0m (3,438\u00a0ft) and flows to \u010castolovice, where it enters the Divok\u00e1 Orlice River at an elevation of 260\u00a0m (850\u00a0ft). It is 40.6\u00a0km (25.2\u00a0mi) long. Its drainage basin has an area of 215.0\u00a0km2 (83.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The average discharge at its mouth is 2.39 m3/s.\nThe longest tributaries of the B\u011bl\u00e1 are:\nCourse\nThe river flows through the municipal territories of Sedlo\u0148ov, De\u0161tn\u00e9 v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch, Liberk, Ose\u010dnice, Skuhrov nad B\u011blou, Kvasiny, Solnice, \u010cern\u00edkovice, T\u0159ebe\u0161ov, Li\u010dno, H\u0159ibiny-Ledsk\u00e1, Libel, Synkov-Slemeno and \u010castolovice.\nBodies of water\nThere are 122 bodies of water in the basin area. The largest of them is the fishpond \u010cern\u00edkovick\u00fd rybn\u00edk with an area of 43\u00a0ha (110 acres), built on the Chobot Brook.\nCanals\nAbout 1 km before the mouth, the river divides and part of the water continues through the Alba Canal. It is a 17.4\u00a0km (10.8\u00a0mi) long canal, connecting the B\u011bl\u00e1 with the D\u011bdina River. The canal was gradually built from the end of the 14th century until 1550. It used to feed a system of fishponds, which no longer exist today. It is a historically important example of landscape modifications in the Middle Ages, which is protected as a cultural monument.\nA cultural and technical monument is also the canal Dlouh\u00e1 strouha, located in Kvasiny. It was built at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries to power the large \u010cern\u00edkovice mill. The upper part of the canal was also used to supply several factories with water.\n",

    "Chinese diplomat\nTang Chunfeng (Simplified Chinese: \u5510\u6df3\u98ce, English: T\u00e1ng Ch\u00fanf\u0113ng, Japanese: \u5510\u6df3\u98a8) is a diplomat of the People's Republic of China and a researcher at the Ministry of Commerce.\nHe worked at the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Japan from 1999 to 2002. Tang is known for being an active supporter of the Ryukyu independence movement in the People's Republic of China.\nOverview\nTang has appeared in videos on the \"Ryukyu Network,\" a website promoting the Ryukyu independence movement in China. He has made claims such as, \"The Ryukyus are part of the big family of the Chinese nation,\" \"90% of Ryukyuans are descendants of the 36 families from Kume who migrated from Fujian, Zhejiang, and Taiwan,\" \"The language during the Ryukyu Kingdom era was entirely Chinese,\" \"Ryukyuan culture was identical to that of the mainland (China) until Japanese aggression,\" and \"75% of Ryukyuan residents support Ryukyu independence\".\nStatements\nTang Chunfeng published a book titled Grieving Ryukyu through the Chinese publishing house Dongfang Press. In the book, he claimed that in 2006, a referendum was held among the Ryukyu ethnic population on the issue of supporting Ryukyu independence, and 75% of residents supported it. According to him, the Ryukyu Independence Commission demanded the removal of all military bases, the establishment of a provisional government, welcomed annexation by China, and advocated for expelling Japan. Additionally, Tang systematically researched historical records of Ryukyu and mainland China exchanges, tracing their origins back to the Qin and Han dynasties. He argued that during the Ming and Qing dynasties, Ryukyu had developed a strong suzerain relationship with the Chinese court, becoming a crucial hub for maritime trade. As a result of long-standing ethnic interactions, Tang claims that Ryukyu's language, script, customs, and institutions all align with those of mainland China. He further stated that the indigenous Ryukyuans originated from the coastal regions of Taiwan, Fujian, and Zhejiang, and that Ryukyuans were linked by blood to all Chinese ethnicities.\nIn the book, Tang repeatedly asserts that Ryukyuans, though \"wearing foreign clothes,\" have been forcibly Westernized in all aspects of life\u2014clothing, food, housing, and transportation\u2014yet have maintained the belief that \"we are not Japanese, but Chinese\".\nIn an article for Ai Thought, he noted the establishment of ACSILs\u00a0 and praised it as a reminder that \"the people of Ryukyu will never cease their pursuit of recovering independence\". He also stated that, based on the Cairo Declaration and Potsdam Declaration after World War II, not only should Taiwan and its associated islands (including the Senkaku Islands) and the Penghu Islands be returned to China, but the unresolved issue of the Ryukyu Islands should also be revisited.\nReferring to his pre-research knowledge about Ryukyu, Tang stated, \"I knew almost nothing about Ryukyu, and there were no historical materials around me. I didn't really understand why Ryukyuans were considered Chinese or why they would want to belong to China.\" He claimed, however, that Ryukyuans wish to belong to China.\nTang also shared an experience where, while staying in Ikebukuro, Japan, a man in his 40s from Okinawa approached him and offered directions, saying, \"Since Ryukyuans are also Chinese, I really wanted to help guide you\".\nRyukyuan Massacre\nAccording to Satoru Nakamura, in the Global Times on November 8, 2010, Tang Chunfeng was spreading the following propaganda in China regarding the so-called \"Ryukyuan Massacre\":\nIn April 1945, due to the Potsdam Declaration and the Cairo Declaration, the Japanese government knew it had no choice but to abandon the territories it had occupied. They issued a \u201cno surrender\u201d order to the local garrison, leading to the mass slaughter of Ryukyuans. According to incomplete statistics, before the U.S. military occupied the Ryukyus, the Japanese army had massacred more than 260,000 Ryukyuans, an atrocity on the same scale as the Nanjing Massacre. \nIn Grieving Ryukyu, Tang also described the Ryukyuan Massacre as follows:\nIf the U.S. liberation of the Ryukyus had been delayed by just a few more months, all Ryukyuans might have been killed by the Japanese military. It wasn\u2019t an act of \"no surrender\"; it was a massacre, just like the Nanjing Massacre. Originally, the 32nd Army Division, which had brutally killed people in China, moved to Okinawa, calling the Ryukyuans \u2018Ryukyu slaves\u2019 and killing them without mercy. \nSee also\nToday Hong Kong, Tomorrow Taiwan, Day After Tomorrow Okinawa\nMap of National Shame\nRyukyu independence movement",
    "\nAstrid Schramm (born 3 May 1956) is a German politician. Since 2024 she has been the state chairwoman of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance in Saarland. From 2009 to 2022 she was a member of the Landtag of Saarland for the party Die Linke.\nLife\nAstrid Schramm is a trained industrial clerk. She worked as a government employee and was a member of the staff council of the Saarland Ministry of Culture.\nState politics\nSchramm was chairwoman of the Die Linke Saarland\u00a0 from 2013 to 2017. Before being involved in The Left, she was already a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD).\nAfter the 2009 Saarland state election, she became a member of the Landtag of Saarland, where she remained until March 2022. She was deputy chairwoman and health policy spokeswoman for her parliamentary group. She was a member of the Committees for Education, Culture and Media (BKM), for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (DI), for Economic Affairs, Labour, Transport, Energy and Mine Safety (WAVEG) and for Social Affairs, Health, Women and Families (SGFF).\nSchramm was involved in a long-standing rift within the Left Party in Saarland and was considered a confidante of the long-standing parliamentary group leader Oskar Lafontaine. The latter accused the regional chairman and Member of the German Bundestag Thomas Lutze of only having been elected to these positions through manipulation and money payments to party members. In this context, Schramm reported Lutze and made this public in several interviews. Lutze's immunity was then lifted. In the subsequent investigation, however, no criminal offenses could be proven against him. Lutze then applied for Schramm to be expelled from the party.\nIn June 2021, the Saarland state arbitration commission of the Left Party expelled Schramm from the party. She had made internal party conflicts public and thus damaged the party. In January 2022, the Federal Arbitration Court of the Left Party confirmed the party expulsion. Schramm announced that she would not take any further steps against it. She retained her functions in the state parliamentary group until the end of the legislative period. She did not run again in the 2022 Saarland state election.\nSchramm joined the newly founded Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance in 2024.\nOn 22 March 2024, she was elected state chairwoman of the Saarland regional association of the BSW in Merzig, together with Randolf Jobstt, who resigned on 14 June 2024 after Schramm's statement on a \"conceivable\" local political cooperation with the Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nLocal politics\nSchramm was chairwoman of the Saarbr\u00fccken district association and the K\u00f6llerbach - P\u00fcttlingen local association within the Left Party. The local association dissolved in early February 2022, as a large proportion of its members left the party after Schramm was expelled from the party.\nFrom the 2019 local elections, she was a member of the P\u00fcttlingen city council as chairwoman of the two-member Left Party faction. She retained this position even after her expulsion from the party.\nExternal links\nBiography at the Landtag of Saarland\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Astrid Schramm.\n",

The coup was orchestrated by opposition leader Sadiq al-Mahdi and aimed to overthrow the Nimeiri regime, which had ruled Sudan since a 1969 coup.\nBiography\nSaad graduated from the Sudanese Military Academy in 1955, then he studied mechanical engineering in Germany. He was fired from the Sudanese Armed Forces in 1974 after being accused of plotting a coup. After that he left to Germany.\n1976 coup attempt\nSaad led the armed forces during the coup attempt, which took place on 2 July 1976. The coup was a well-coordinated effort involving rebel forces, including dissident soldiers and civilians, many of whom were trained and armed by Libya under the direction of Muammar Gaddafi. The dissident forces stormed Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, in a bid to seize control of key government installations, including the Presidential Palace, radio stations, and military barracks.\nLoyalist forces supporting President Nimeiri fought back, leading to several days of intense fighting in Khartoum. The battle caused significant civilian casualties and damage to the capital. The government forces, backed by tanks, managed to regain control of the city, and the coup was suppressed within a week.\nFollowing the failure of the coup, Saad and other key figures, including 98 soldiers and civilians, were arrested, tried, and executed. The regime also used the failed coup as an opportunity to consolidate power and crack down on opposition forces. Nimeiri's government blamed the coup on foreign interference, particularly Libya, and heightened security measures in the aftermath to prevent future attempts.\nIn 1977, a national reconciliation took place between Sadiq al Mahdi, the leader of the opposition who was based abroad, and Nimeiry.\n",

    "American basketball player (1933\u20131987)\nFor the 1980s NBA player, see Johnny Moore (basketball). For the player, coach and executive, see John Doxie Moore.\nJohn William Moore (1933 \u2013 February 11, 1987) was an American college basketball player for the UCLA Bruins. Twice he earned honorable mention as an All-American. He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame.\nPlaying with UCLA in the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), Moore was voted All-Southern Division three times, including a first-team selection. After being drafted and serving in the Army, he tried out for the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Boston Celtics, who had selected him two years earlier in the 1955 NBA draft. Moore was also a player and coach in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). He became an executive in the financial industry.\nEarly life\nMoore was born in Gary, Indiana, where he attended Froebel High School.  Standing at 6\u00a0feet 5\u00a0inches (1.96\u00a0m), he played basketball as a center and was team captain as a senior in 1951.  He averaged 19.1 points per game that year, earning All-State honors and a second straight All-Northern Indiana team selection. His coach called him better than Dave Minor, a Froebel alumnus who became an All-Southern Division basketball player at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1948. Moore also lettered for four years on Froebel's track and cross country teams, and served as student body president. The Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame named him to their 1976 Silver Anniversary All Star basketball team.\nIn spring of 1951, Bruins assistant coach Ed Powell visited Moore at his home. Upon learning that UCLA's student body president was Black, Moore's mother said \"this is where he's going to school\".\nBasketball career\nCollege career\nMoore was the second Black recruited to UCLA by their head coach, John Wooden. Senior forward Bobby Pounds, who joined the Bruins from junior college in 1950, was the first. In his first year in 1951\u201352, Moore played on the varsity team with fellow freshmen Ron Bane, Don Bragg, and Mark Costello. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) had temporarily permitted freshmen to play because many students were leaving college to serve in the Korean War. After Christmas, UCLA had a three-game road trip in the Midwest. For the first game against Kentucky, the Bruins stayed in a hotel in Cincinnati, 90 miles (140\u00a0km) away from Lexington, Kentucky.  They chose to bus into and out of Lexington because the city's hotels were segregated, and Moore and Pounds would have had to be separated from the team. UCLA won their fourth consecutive Southern Division title that season, and they defeated Washington for their second straight PCC championship.\nMoore finished his UCLA career as the school's all-time leading scorer.\nThe following season in 1952\u201353, UCLA finished in third place with a 6\u20136 conference record after four seasons of finishing at least tied for first in the Southern Division. Moore led the team in scoring with 315 points, averaging 12.6 per game, and was voted second-team All-Southern Division. The United Press (UP) named him an honorable mention All-American in 1953\u201354, when he was again a second-team All-Southern Division selection.\nAs a senior in 1954\u201355, Moore was co-captain of the team with Bragg. He was one of three Black starters for UCLA who were averaging double figures in scoring, including Willie Naulls and Morris Taft. In January 1955, Moore scored 45 points in a two-game series against USC to become the first Bruin to score 1,000 points in their career. In February, he was dropped from the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps because his 20/30 vision was too poor for him to qualify for pilot training. UCLA won the Southern Division before losing the PCC championship 2\u20130 to Oregon State. Moore ended his career as the school's all-time scoring leader with 1,202 points. Bragg also finished with over a thousand at 1,023.  Moore was voted an honorable mention All-American by UP and the Associated Press, and the Helms Athletic Foundation named him a second-team All-American. He joined Bragg and Naulls as first-team All-Southern Division selections. Moore became the first player to win the Caddy Works award twice, which honors a Bruin \"selected for his competitive spirit, inspiration and unselfish contribution to the team\". In 2007, he was posthumously inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame.\nAAU and Army career\nIn March 1955, Moore played for Los Angeles Kirby's Shoes at the AAU national tournament, advancing to the quarterfinals. In April, he was selected by the Boston Celtics in the seventh round of the 1955 NBA draft with the 52nd overall pick. He had already been drafted into the Army, but The Boston Daily Globe wrote that he was still \"highly regarded for the future\".\nMoore received basic training at Fort Ord in Monterey, California. He was stationed in Virginia at Fort Lee, where he played for their Travellers basketball team. In",
    "Genre of fiction\nIllustration by \u00c9douard-Henri Avril from the erotic novel Fanny Hill (1748)\nErotic fiction is a part of erotic literature and a genre of fiction that portrays sex or sexual themes, generally in a more literary or serious way than the fiction seen in pornographic magazines. It sometimes includes elements of satire or social criticism. Such works have frequently been banned by the government or religious authorities. Non-fictional works that portray sex or sexual themes may contain fictional elements. Calling an erotic book 'a memoir' is a literary device that is common in this genre. For reasons similar to those that make pseudonyms both commonplace and often deviously set up, the boundary between fiction and non-fiction is broad. \nErotic fiction has been credited in large part for the sexual awakening and liberation of women in the 20th and 21st centuries.\nHistory of erotic fiction\nAncient, medieval, and early modern periods\nThe Satyricon of Petronius Arbiter (later made into a film by Fellini) is an ancient Roman novel, which has partially survived, narrating the misadventures of an impotent man named Encolpius, who has been cursed by the god Priapus. The novel is filled with bawdy and obscene episodes, including orgies, ritual sex, and other erotic incidents. The discovery of several fragments of Lollianos's Phoenician Tale reveal that a genre of picaresque erotic novel also existed in ancient Greece. Some of the ancient Greek romance novels, such as Daphnis and Chloe, also contain elements of sexual fantasy.\nFrom the medieval period, there is the Decameron (1353) by the Italian Giovanni Boccaccio (made into a film by Pasolini) which features tales of lechery by monks and the seduction of nuns from convents. This book was banned in many countries. Even five centuries after publication, copies were seized and destroyed by the authorities in the US and the UK. For instance, between 1954 and 1958 eight orders for destruction of the book were made by English magistrates.\nFrom the 15th century, another classic of Italian erotica is a series of bawdy folk tales called the Facetiae by Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini. The Tale of Two Lovers (Latin: Historia de duobus amantibus) written in 1444 was one of the bestselling books of the 15th century, even before its author, Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, became Pope Pius II. It is one of the earliest examples of an epistolary novel, full of erotic imagery. The first printed edition was published by Ulrich Zel in Cologne between 1467 and 1470.\nIllustration from I Modi, circa 1530\nThe 16th century was notable for the Heptameron of Marguerite de Navarre (1558), inspired by Boccaccio's Decameron and the notorious I Modi which married erotic drawings, depicting postures assumed in sexual intercourse, by Giulio Romano, with obscene sonnets by Pietro Aretino.\nFrontispiece and title page of the 1757 Latin edition of the Dialogues of Luisa Sigea (first published c.\u20091660) by Nicholas Chorier\nAretino also wrote the celebrated whore dialogue Ragionamenti, in which the sex lives of wives, whores and nuns are compared and contrasted.  Later works in the same genre include La Retorica delle Puttane (The Whore's Rhetoric) (1642) by Ferrante Pallavicino; L'\u00e9cole des filles (The school for girls) (1655), attributed to Michel Millot and Jean L'Ange. and The Dialogues of Luisa Sigea (c.\u20091660) by Nicolas Chorier.  Such works typically concerned the sexual education of a naive younger woman by an experienced older woman and often included elements of philosophising, satire and anti-clericalism. Donald Thomas has translated L'\u00c9cole des filles, as The School of Venus, (1972), described on its back cover as \"both an uninhibited manual of sexual technique and an erotic masterpiece of the first order\". In his diary Samuel Pepys records reading and (in an often censored passage) masturbating over this work. Chorier's Dialogues of Luisa Sigea goes a bit further than its predecessors in this genre and has the older female giving practical instruction of a lesbian nature to the younger woman plus recommending the spiritual and erotic benefits of a flogging from willing members of the holy orders. This work was translated into many languages under various different titles, appearing in English as A Dialogue between a Married Woman and a Maid in various editions. The School of Women first appeared as a work in Latin entitled Aloisiae Sigaeae, Toletanae, Satyra sotadica de arcanis Amoris et Veneris. This manuscript claimed that it was originally written in Spanish by Luisa Sigea de Velasco, an erudite poet and maid of honor at the court of Lisbon and was then translated into Latin by Jean or Johannes Meursius. The attribution to Sigea and Meursius was a lie; the true author was Nicolas Chorier.\nA unique work of this time is Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery (1684), a closet play by the notorious Restoration rake, John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester in which Bolloxinion, King of ",

    "Conservative advocacy group in the Weimar Republic\nThe Reich Citizens\u2018 Council (German: Reichsb\u00fcrgerrat) was the umbrella organisation for the citizens\u2019 councils that were set up across Germany to oppose the workers\u2018 and soldiers\u2019 councils that had taken over many local governments in the early weeks of the German revolution of 1918\u20131919.\nAfter the parliamentary Weimar Republic was established and the workers' and soldiers' councils disbanded, the Reich Citizens' Council adopted a programme to fight Marxism, alter the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and end the \"command economy\". It worked with or supported other conservative and far-right groups such as the Anti-Bolshevist League and the German Agrarian League. The Kapp Putsch of March 1920 split and seriously weakened the council, but it was still able to use its influence to help elect Paul von Hindenburg president of Germany in 1925 and block a referendum to expropriate the properties of the former German princes in 1926. By the time the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, the Reich Citizens' Council was no longer playing a significant political role.\nFoundation\nAt the beginning of November 1918, workers' and soldiers' councils spread the German revolution to cities across the German Empire. Meeting with little to no resistance, they formed quickly, took over city governments and key buildings, caused most of the locally stationed military to flee and brought about the abdications of all of Germany's ruling monarchs, including Emperor Wilhelm II when they reached Berlin on 9 November 1918.\nThe citizens' councils that emerged in November and December 1918 in many German cities were committees and commissions whose purpose was initially to gather together the middle-class politicians and other municipal officials who had been pushed to the sidelines by the workers' and soldiers' councils. The citizens' councils were dedicated primarily to promoting the rapid convening of a national assembly, which they hoped would delegitimize and disempower the workers' and soldiers' councils. Many citizens' councils emphasised influencing front-line soldiers who were returning from the war. In December, some citizens' councils began to initiate or finance the formation of Freikorps units, including the Berlin Citizens' Council under the leadership of Salomon Marx\u00a0. The Leipzig Citizens' Council cooperated with a group of former and active officers who called themselves the \u201cWhite Guard\u201d. The Munich Citizens' Council participated with officers and right-wing extremist circles in the preparation of a failed coup attempt, while the Bremen Citizens' Council intended to stage a coup against the workers' and soldiers' council there. In the spring of 1919, the citizens' councils in many cities and towns played a role in ending the workers' councils, sending out \u201ccries for help\u201d, drawing up lists of arrests and, in some cases, taking independent armed action.\nOrganisation and aims\nOn 5 January 1919, representatives of about 300 citizens' councils gathered at the invitation of the Berlin Citizens' Council in the auditorium of the University of Berlin to found a Reich Citizens' Council (Reichsb\u00fcrgerrat). The theologian and German Democratic Party (DDP) member of the Weimar National Assembly, Friedrich Naumann, gave the welcoming address. The Reich Citizens' Council initially based its advocacy on the slogan of \u201cequal rights for the middle class\u201d, rhetorically depicting and opposing the \u201clawless class rule\u201d of the workers. The council's president spoke of a \u201clunatic ideology, un-German, Russian, alien to our nature\u201d.\nAccording to its initial statement, the Reich Citizens' Council was a \"non-partisan collective movement\" in which politicians from the centrist DDP to the national-conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) worked together. From the outset, however, differences were unmistakable, especially regarding the question of whether to fight the Social Democratic Party (SPD) or work with it. A few left-liberals did not reject the German revolution outright and recognised that it was \"deeply embedded in our own circumstances\", but the majority saw it as \"a senseless copy of the Russian events\".\nThe rapid reorganisation of Germany's pre-war middle-class parties soon after the Reich Citizens' Council was formed deprived it of some of its significance. With the largely completed disempowerment and eventual disappearance of the workers\u2018 and soldiers\u2019 councils in the spring of 1919, interest in a unified political \"bourgeois bloc\" also waned, at least at the level of national politics. The Reich Citizens' Council was nevertheless able to stabilise as an organisation after a second Reich Conference on 30 March 1919. It initiated the founding of regional citizens\u2018 councils, of which there were 13 in the spring of 1920, with some 330 local citizens\u2019 councils. The Bavarian Citizens\u2018 Council, which operated as the Bavarian Citizens\u2019 Bloc, played a particularly important role, pro",
    "Temple in Goa, India\nBrahma Temple, Bramha Karmali, Goa (also known as Shri Brahmadav ji Temple) is located in the village of Nagargao, Valpoi, Goa, India. It is one of the few dedicated to Lord Brahma in India. The temple houses a 12th-century black stone idol, carved during the Kadamba period. This sculpture depicts Brahma in his Trimurti form, symbolizing the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, with Brahma portrayed with a distinctive beard. The idol's craftsmanship and historical significance make it an important yet often overlooked aspect of Goa's cultural and religious landscape.\nHistory\nThe history of the Brahma Temple in Nagargao, Valpoi, dates back to the Kadamba period, around the 12th century. During this time, the Kadamba dynasty, which ruled parts of Goa and Karnataka, contributed significantly to the region's cultural and religious landscape, constructing temples and supporting the arts. The temple, dedicated to Lord Brahma, is a rare example of Brahma worship, as very few temples in India honor him. Despite Brahma's role in the Hindu trinity, with Vishnu and Shiva, temples dedicated to him are scarce due to various legends, including one that Brahma was only meant to have one temple in Pushkar, Rajasthan. The black stone idol at Nagargao, carved in this era, reflects the artistic expertise of the period and stands as a testament to the religious diversity of Goa during the Kadamba rule. Over time, the temple has maintained its historical significance, though it remains lesser-known compared to other Goan temples.\n",
    "Left-wing political party in Malaya\nThe Malayan Democratic Union was a left-wing socialist political party active in British Malaya from 1945 to 1948. It was founded by English-educated intellectuals and advocated for the independence of British Malaya as a single entity inclusive of Singapore.\nHistory\nThere exists differing accounts of the party's origins, although it is generally accepted that it was first conceived by its leaders while under Japanese internment in occupied Malaya. Two contradictory accounts have been provided by Gerald de Cruz, who claimed that he had been approached by Wu Tian Wang, a member of the Malayan Communist Party, to initiate the party's founding, and later that the party had been conceived by Lim Hong Bee and the Malayan Communist Party during Lim's involvement with the Communist-led Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army in Endau, Johor. Other accounts, including those of party chairman Philip Hoalim Sr., repudiated any claims of Communist influence in the party's founding.\nThe party adopted a moderate and liberal attitude at its inception and called for, among other things, a self-governing democratic Malaya within the British Commonwealth. It was broadly in support of the Malayan Union, which united the federated and unfederated Malay States, and the Straits Settlements of Malacca and Penang into a single entity, and of the union's accompanying liberal citizenship scheme on the condition that Singapore be included in any such union.\nHowever, the Malayan Union faced significant opposition from Malay nationalists who engaged in clandestine negotiations with British administrators to produce new constitutional proposals that would restore the sovereignty of Malay rulers and introduce a more restrictive citizenship scheme. In opposition to the Anglo-Malay constitution, the Malayan Democratic Union alongside other parties and organisations formed the All-Malaya Council of Joint Action (AMCJA), which styled itself the sole representative body of \"domiciled Malays and non-Malays\", and sought to engage in direct negotiations with the British government for a more democratic constitution.\nThe efforts of the party through the AMCJA to push through a more equitable constitution, including through a hartal in October 1947, were unsuccessful. The party was voluntarily dissolved in June 1948 at the beginning of the Malayan Emergency, when its leaders heard rumours that the colonial government was considering taking action against it. The party was generally considered to have been strongly influenced by and acted as a communist front owing to the presence of Malayan Communist Party members in its central committee from May 1948 onwards, as well as the two parties' close cooperation as part of the AMCJA.\n",

    "Q1 Corporation was an American computer company founded in 1969 by Daniel Alroy. Its main focus was the manufacturing and sale of early microcomputers.\nProducts\nQ1 and Q1/c (First generation)\nThe first generation Q1 computer was first available in 1972. It was based on the Intel 8008 microprocessor and had a memory of 16 kilobytes, user-expandable up to 64K. The Q1 also had an IBM 3740-compatible floppy disk drive. The CPU, memory, and floppy drives fit into a desk unit, while a one-line 80-character display, printer, and alphanumeric keyboard were integrated into a separate desktop console. The desk unit could support up to 6 desktop consoles.\nThe first Q1 microcomputer was delivered on December 11th, 1972, to the Litcom Division of Litton Industries.\nThe Q1 was also sold as the Q1/c in Asian markets, including Taiwan and Hong Kong.\nQ1/Lite (Second generation)\nThe second generation Q1/Lite was based on the Intel 8080 processor and was available starting in 1974. The Q1/Lite combined the separate desk computer unit and tabletop console of the first generation Q1 into a single desktop unit, which included a printer, two floppy drives, an alphanumeric keyboard, and a multi-line flat-panel plasma display.\nThe first pre-production Q1/Lite was delivered to the Israeli Air Force in April 1974, the same month that the Intel 8080 was introduced. In June 1974, several more Q1/Lite systems were ordered; the original pre-production Q1/Lite was returned to Q1, and the first production units were shipped in August 1974.\nSecond generation Q1/Lites were also installed at all eleven NASA bases between 1977 and 1979.\nQ1/Lite (Third generation)\nThe third generation Q1/Lite was available by 1977. It was based on the then-unreleased Intel 8800 processor, which would go on to become Intel's iAPX 432. Like the second generation Q1/Lite, it combined memory, a CPU, printer, keyboard, and plasma display into a desktop console, but like the first generation Q1, also included a separate desk unit, with its own CPU, memory, and floppy drives, which could drive several workstations. \"Independent\" workstations were also available, which would only contain the keyboard and display and act as dumb terminals.\nQ1 and Q1/Lite (Fourth generation)\nThe fourth generation Q1/Lite was available sometime after 1976. It was based on the Zilog Z80 processor. Much like the previous generation, the main computer and floppy drives were contained in a desk unit, but each \"independent\" workstation now had its own CPU as well, therefore being able to be used entirely independently of the main computer. The printer was separated into an external enclosure, not part of either the desk unit nor the workstation.\nAt one point, a different design for the fourth generation Q1/Lite workstation was introduced, being very similar to the design of the second generation Q1/Lite. This design had two variants, one with a printer (marketed as the Q1) and one without (marketed as the Q1/Lite). The printer variant of this later design was also marketed as the Q1 MicroLite.\nOther products\nQ1 offered several peripherals for their computers, including external hard drives, tape drives, and printers.\nA Q1 \"Basic Office Machine\" was also designed and prototyped, although it never reached commercial production.\n",
    "Species of tree\nCupaniopsis tomentella,  commonly known as Boonah tuckeroo, is a species of flowering plant in the soapberry family and is endemic to south-eastern Queensland. It is a tree with paripinnate leaves with usually 6 to 8 elliptic or oblong leaflets, and separate male and female flowers arranged in a panicle, the fruit an orange-yellow capsule with a red flush.\nDescription\nCupaniopsis tomentella is a tree that typically grows to a height of up to 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft), its young branchlets with woolly hairs, the branchlets with lenticels. The leaves are paripinnate with usually six to eight elliptic or oblong leaflets 40\u201390\u00a0mm (1.6\u20133.5\u00a0in) long and 20\u201340\u00a0mm (0.79\u20131.57\u00a0in) wide on a petiole 35\u201370\u00a0mm (1.4\u20132.8\u00a0in) long, the leaf rhachis 60\u2013130\u00a0mm (2.4\u20135.1\u00a0in) long. The flowers are arranged in panicles 20\u201390\u00a0mm (0.79\u20133.54\u00a0in) long, each flower on a pedicel 1\u00a0mm (0.039\u00a0in) long. The sepals lobes are hairy, 5\u20136\u00a0mm (0.20\u20130.24\u00a0in) long and the petals are white, about 2.5\u00a0mm (0.098\u00a0in) long. The fruit is a hairy, elliptic, orange-yellow sessile capsule, flushed with red, 20\u201325\u00a0mm (0.79\u20130.98\u00a0in) long 30\u201340\u00a0mm (1.2\u20131.6\u00a0in) wide, the seed with a yellow aril. \nTaxonomy\nThis species was first formally described in 1863 by George Bentham from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller. Bentham gave it the name Cupania tomentella from specimens collected by Walter Hill near Moreton Bay.. In 1984, Sally T. Reynolds transferred the species to Cupaniopsis as C. tomentella in the journal Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (tomentella) means 'minutely tomentose'.\nDistribution and habitat\nBoonah tuckeroo occurs between Boonah and Ipswich in south-east Queensland, usually in dry scrubs.\nConservation status\nThis species of Cupaniopsis is listed as \"vulnerable\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. The main threats to the species are its fragmented distribution and smothering exotic vines.\n",
    "Slogan coined by Fidel Castro\nThe slogan \"revolution first, elections later\" was coined by Fidel Castro in a speech given on April 9, 1959. The speech famously announced the postponement of the elections promised by Fidel Castro, which were scheduled to occur after the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista. The announcement was the beginning of an electoral delay that culminated in the solidification of Fidel Castro's rule over Cuba. On May Day, 1960, Fidel Castro would outright condemn elections as corrupt, and cancel all future elections.\nBackground\nMain article: History Will Absolve Me\nFurther information: Cuban Revolution\nOn March 10, 1952, three months before the Cuban elections, presidential candidate Fulgencio Batista, with army backing, staged a coup and seized power. He ousted outgoing President Carlos Pr\u00edo Socarr\u00e1s, canceled the elections and took control of the government as a provisional president.\nOn July 26, 1953, just over a year after Batista's second coup, a small group of revolutionaries attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago. Government forces easily defeated the assault and jailed its leaders, while many others fled the country. The primary leader of the attack, Fidel Castro, was a young attorney who had run for parliament in the canceled 1952 elections. Although Castro was never officially nominated, he felt that Batista's coup had sidetracked what would have been a promising political career for him. In the wake of the Moncada assault, Batista suspended constitutional guarantees and increasingly relied on police tactics in an attempt to \"frighten the population through open displays of brutality.\"\nCastro was imprisoned for his role in the Moncada Barracks attack, and in a famed speech, colloquially titled \"History Will Absolve Me\", which he made during his court trial, Castro gave out a list of demands which included the reinstatement of the 1940 Constitution of Cuba.\nAfter Castro founded the 26th of July Movement, and it began engaging in combat in 1956, the organization issued the Sierra Maestra Manifesto in 1957. The manifesto demanded multi-party elections to be held in Cuba.\nHistory\nFurther information: Consolidation of the Cuban Revolution\nEstablishing provisional government\nSee also: Triumph of the Revolution\nAfter the Triumph of the Revolution, Castro held de facto veto power during the process of establishing a provisional government. This de facto power came from his position as commander-in-chief of the rebel army. Immediately after the rebel army seized power, Castro and other rebels agreed to place Manuel Urrutia Lle\u00f3 as President of Cuba.\nOn January 8, 1959, Fidel Castro announced that elections would occur within 18 months. In a speech a few days later, it was announced elections would take place in 15 months. A month later he said elections would be unfair because he'd win in a landslide. Over the coming months, crowds would boo and hiss when Castro would allude to coming elections.\nIn February 1959, Castro asked President Urrutia to make him prime minister, which Urrutia granted. As prime minister, Castro banned all political parties except the Popular Socialist Party. Castro also had the ability to order retrials of people who juries found not guilty.\nPolitical positions in the first two years after the Cuban Revolution were extremely fluid, and poorly defined in legal terms. It was often loyalty that was the determining factor in being appointed to a government position.\nElectoral delay\nOn April 9, 1959, Fidel Castro announced that elections would be delayed for fifteen months. While traveling to New York, Fidel Castro announced that elections may enable the return of an oligarchy to control Cuba society. Despite his skepticism, he assured that elections would be held within four years.\nIn a television interview on June 10, 1959, Fidel Castro was asked about plans for elections. He responded:\nThe Revolution needs time to accomplish its purpose, and the less it is interrupted, the sooner this will be possible. If one can work without interruptions, the time needed will be considerably less. It seems to me that once the Agrarian Reform is completed, which is\nthe basic point of the Revolution, elections can be held at any time.\nIn July 1959, Castro accused President Urrutia of corruption and resigned. In the aftermath of Castro's resignation, angry mobs surrounded the Presidential Palace, and Urrutia resigned.  Castro was reinstated into his position, and a growing political sentiment in Cuba associated Fidel Castro with the only source of legitimate power Fidel Castro soon replaced Manuel Urrutia with Osvaldo Dortic\u00f3s Torrado as President of Cuba. Dortic\u00f3s was a member of the Popular Socialist Party.\nThe ousting of Urrutia would start a wave of resignations by moderates and anti-communists in the provisional government. In October, military officer Huber Matos resigned from his post, citing fears of a communist takeover. Matos was arrested for his protest.\nElectoral cancel",
    "\nMusical artist\nBorut Kr\u017ei\u0161nik (1961, Zagreb) is a Slovenian composer. \nBiography\nIn his early life, the family lived in Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia (which were part of federal republic of Yugoslavia at the time) and Romania. When he was two years old his father was appointed as the Yugoslavian diplomatic attache in Bucharest When he turned 6, they moved to Belgrade, where he spent his early childhood. They moved to Ljubljana in 1973.\nHe began his musical education with the piano and attended a music school during his stay in Belgrade. After moving to Ljubljana, he quit music school, started playing guitar as a self-taught and building his unique compositional language throughout the 1980s. He received a degree in psychology from the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana in 1987.\nCollaborations\nBorut Krzisnik has composed music for films, dance and theatre performances, and other productions. He worked intensely with British film director Peter Greenaway and wrote the score for films The Moab Story, Vaux to the Sea and A Life in Suitcases. The former two are the first and the second film of the trilogy The Tulse Luper Suitcases and the latter is trilogy's integral version.\nThe films narrate the stories of the life of Tulse Luper, the alter ego of the director himself, which intertwines with the events that marked the turbulent history of the twentieth century. An interesting fact that describes Greenaway's working process and his approach to music is that the composer is asked to compose the music before the start of shooting the film, and not after shooting and editing, as is usually the case. In this manner, Peter Greenaway analyzes the music before the start of the filming, wich enables him to synchronize the whole process of shooting with the drive and development of the music. The films were presented at numerous international film festivals including Cannes, Venice, Berlin, Rotterdam, Tribeca, Toronto, Montreal, Chicago, Philadelphia, Hong Kong, Moscow and Edinburgh.\nKr\u017ei\u0161nik's collaboration with Greenaway also includes the following projects: The Greenaway Alphabet (documentary film, director: Saskia Boddeke, acting: Peter Greenaway), Reitdiep Joureys (documentary film/multimedia), Gold \u2013 92 bars in a broken car (theater performance, director: Saskia Boddeke, libretto: Peter Greenaway), Grand Terp (\u201csite-specific\u201d installation), Sex and the Sea(multimedia installation), Compton Verney (installation) and Map to Paradise (installation).\nIn 2000 he started the collaboration with British-American-Brazilian theater and opera director Gerald Thomas. In the plays Nietzsche Contra Wagner (SESC, S\u00e3o Paulo, 2000) and Anchorpectoris \u2013 United States of the Mind (La MaMa, New York, 2004), music drives both performances, and by fusing different theatrical languages, co-creates Thomas\u2019 outrageous, physical, absolute theater.\nIn 2007 the prolific collaboration with the Romanian born Slovenian choreographer Edward Clug started with the performance Sacre du Temps. It opened in Tilburg and shortly afterwards toured Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany. The collaboration continued with three performances: Skitzen (2010), Divine Comedy (2011) and Songs for the Mating Season \u2013 Homage to Stravinsky (2012).\nIn the 90s he worked closely with theater director Emil Hrvatin (later renamed to Janez Jan\u0161a) and British director Julie Anne Robinson, who were present on European theatre stages in at the Picollo Teatro in Milan, the Bush Theatre and the Royal National Theatre (educational programe) in London.\nHis collaborations also include the following artists: Thomas Noone, Ana Lujan Sanchez, Katarzyna Kozielska, Stefanie Nelson, Natalia Horecna, Isabelle Kralj, Felice Lesser, Josh Beamish, Virpi Pahkinen, Gyula Berger, Vinko M\u00f6derndorfer, Bojan Jablanovec, Borghesia and Laibach.\nAwards\nVesna prize for best film music at Slovenian Film Festival in 2008 (for the film Landscape No2)\n1st prize at the Napoli Danza Festival in 1994 (for the art-video Labyrinth)\nOpus\nAlbums\nUtopia \u2013 Claudio Records, UK, 2024\nDancing Machine \u2013 Claudio Records, UK, 2020\nLightning \u2013 Claudio Records, UK, 2013\nValse Brutal \u2013 Claudio Records, UK, 2014 (KUD France Pre\u0161eren, 2009)\nSacre du Temps \u2013 Claudio Records, 2013, UK (Station Zuid, Tilburg, 2007)\nA Life in Suitcases \u2013 Claudio Records, 2012 UK (First Name Soundtracks, London, 2006; KUD France Pre\u0161eren, 2005)\nStories from Magatrea \u2013 Claudio Records, 2014, UK (Falcata-Galia Recordings, Realto, 1999, for Slovenia: KUD France Pre\u0161eren, Ljubljana, 1997)\nLa Dolce Vita \u2013 Claudio Records, 2015 UK (FV, Ljubljana / Discordia, Willich, 1995)\nCurrents of Time \u2013 Claudio Records, 2014 UK (ReR Megacorp, Point East, London, 1991; re-release: Tone Casualties, Hollywood, 1998)\nMusic for dance\nFill in the Blank \u2013 contemporary dance performance, concept: Stefanie Nelson, choreography: Maya Orchin, Stefanie Nelson Dancegroup, New York, 2023\nTrap Ist \u2013 contemporary dance performance, choreography: Felice Lesser, Felice Lesser Dance Co",
    "\nFelix Post, MRCS FRCP FRCPsych (25 July 1913 \u2013 23 March 2001) was a German-born British doctor, and a leading psychiatrist of the second half of the 20th century. Post was a pioneer of psychogeriatrics and the first chair of the psychogeriatricians in the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\nLife\nFelix Post was born in Berlin on 25 July 1913. His mother was Jewish, and he arrived in England in 1934 as a refugee from Nazi Europe. There, he completed his medical studies at St Bartholomew's Hospital, qualifying as a doctor in 1939.\nPost worked at Hammersmith Hospital (alongside Sir Aubrey Lewis) and at Whipps Cross, taking up psychiatry at the Mill Hill Emergency Hospital (part of Maudsley Hospital during the war). He was interned for a short time as an \"enemy alien\" on the Isle of Man. In 1942, Post took up a psychiatric role in Edinburgh, working under Professor Sir David Henderson. There, he was encouraged to focus on the elderly people on the wards, leading him to a career emphasis on geriatric psychiatry. Following the war, he was called up to the Royal Army Medical Corps, ending up as a major.\nIn 1947, Post joined the staff of the joint Bethlem-Maudsley Hospital, where he established a pioneering psychiatric unit for people over 60. He remained at the Hospital until retirement in 1978. His biography for the Royal College of Physicians describes Post as \"possibly the best teacher among the large and talented staff\" of the Maudsley.\nIn addition to his practical work, Post was a researcher and writer on geriatric psychiatry, publishing a number of papers, chapters, and monographs. The Significance of Affective Symptoms in Old Age, published in 1962, was a follow-up study of 100 patients admitted to Bethlem with a depressive illness. His 1965 textbook The clinical psychiatry of late life became a standard text. In 1972  his article \"The management and nature of depressive illness in late life\" was published in the\ufffdBritish Journal of Psychiatry, this and his 1962 work being \"of cardinal importance for research in old age depression\".\nPost was the first chairman of the psychogeriatricians in the Royal College of Psychiatrists (later the faculty of psychiatry of old age), and a foundation fellow of the College. Between 1969\u20131970, he was president of the psychiatry section at the Royal Society of Medicine. Post was awarded the 50th anniversary medal of the British Geriatrics Society \"in recognition of outstanding services to geriatric medicine\", and was honoured in 1995 by the International Psychogeriatric Association.\nDeath and legacy\nFelix Post died suddenly in March 2001, survived by his second wife, Kathleen, and two children from his first marriage.\nThe Felix Post Unit at Maudsley Hospital commemorates him. He has been described as \"probably the first dedicated old age psychiatrist anywhere in the world\". Tom Arie, for the Royal College of Physicians, wrote:He inspired a generation of pupils in many countries who, stimulated by his clinical teaching and research, built special services for old people.An oral history interview with Felix Post is held by the Imperial War Museum.\nSelected bibliography\nThe significance of affective symptoms in old age (London, Oxford University Press, 1962)\nThe clinical psychiatry of late life (Oxford, Pergamon Press, 1965)\nPersistent persecutory states of the elderly (Oxford/New York, Pergamon Press,1966)",
    "\nClimate finance in Cameroon comprises a mixture of the Forest Investment Program (FIP), and domestic, and internationally sourced funding for climate change sustainability, control, and resilience. As Cameroon is built on the coastal regions with the highest risk of flood mortality, its economic resources of agriculture, on which 60% of its population relies, are shaken. This attracts the question of climate finance to salvage livelihood and security. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), countries need more finance for their climate targets than they can source domestically. It also reported that in 2009, high-income countries with a significant historical contribution to climate change committed to raising US$100 billion annually by 2020 to fund climate action in low-income countries.\nThus, in African countries like Cameroon, climate funds become an important source of finance to manage the climate crisis. The report from UNDP stated that 50 percent of mitigation financing tracked in Africa between 2011- 2021 came from MDBs ($37 billion) and 45 percent from bilateral sources ($33.47 billion). It should be remembered that Cameroon signed the Global Methane Pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.  The World Bank on Climate Change and Development Report (CCDR) in Cameroon estimated the GDP loss to range from 4 to 10 percent in the most pessimistic scenario by 2050 if no action is taken. The indication is that climate change will also increase the balance of payments needs and require fiscal space.\nCameroon faces challenges in its climate finance mitigation. A study carried out by Lueong and Suiven on in-depth understanding and knowledge on the different tools, effectiveness, and challenges affecting climate finance in Cameroon, reported diverse funding sources, international climate funds, bilateral agreements, and national budget allocations. Another research stated that Cameroon's major challenge is inadequate financial resources to mitigate climate change.\nGovernment finance of climate in Cameroon\nInitially, Cameroon did not include funding or fine mechanisms in its budget. The Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) stated that two million people (nine percent of Cameroon's population) live in drought-affected areas, and about eight percent of the country's GDP is vulnerable, thus, making a pathway for more rapid inclusive, sustainable economic growth from stakeholders. The effort is to salvage the poverty rate which is expected to be about 15 percent in 2050. This is also seen as above the global target of three percent.\nCameroon has a CIF's investment through its Forest Investment Program (FIP) which designed its activities to cover the adaptation and mitigation efforts, increasing carbon stocks and restoring degraded landscapes. The government established FEICOM: A Public Economic and Financial Establishment in December 1974. It becomes the administration for the local development of funds for climate. It is allowed to access the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in Cameroon. FEICOM signed a memorandum of understanding with the Covenant of Mayors in Sub-Saharan Africa (CoM SSA) to support Cameroonian municipalities to mitigate climate change and access to funding.\nHowever, a statement by ICLEI Africa in 2024, declared that \"less than 3% of climate finance flows to Africa.\" The report calls for the local administration and city governments to be part of the decision-making on how climate finance is spent, especially, as the impacts are felt in their localities. Hence the BRIDGE project team takes up a learning lab in Yaound\u00e9 (Cameroon) to train researchers, selected municipalities, over 30 knowledge brokers, and representatives from the Special Fund for Intercommunal Equipment and Intervention (FEICOM). The National government with the technical and financial partners were also part of the training. The training included online and physical events.\nInternational financiers\nIn 2024, Cameroon received a Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board. This money amounts to US$183.4 million in the exchange rate. This was meant to give redress to other expensive finances and encourage other stakeholders to support with their funds in saving Cameroon's climate challenges. It should be recalled that in 2021 the IMF extended the Credit Facility and Fund Facility to Cameroon with SDR 483 million an equivalent of US$689.5 to support the country's economic and financial reform program.\nIn 2023 the IMF completed the Fifth Reviews of the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangements to Cameroon with the disbursement of about US$73.8 million. This helped Cameroon's economic reform program foster structural transformation, boost growth and resilience, and integrate climate agenda in institutional and budget frameworks.\nSimilarly in October 2023, the ",

    "Fran\u00e7ois Cantagrel\nF\u00e9lix Fran\u00e7ois Jean Cantagrel was a French politician born June 27, 1810, in Amboise (Indre-et-Loire) and died February 27, 1887, in Paris.\nBiography\nCantagrel was born into a family from Aveyron.\nA student in Paris in 1827, Cantagrel received a degree in Law from the University of Paris. He subsequently graduated from the Corps of Bridges and Roads with a degree in architecture.\nEarly Career\nBetween 1834 and 1838, Cantagrel wrote literary criticism articles for the journal L'Artiste. A disciple of Charles Fourier, he founded the newspaper La Phalange, which later became La D\u00e9mocratie pacifique.\nCantagrel was a member of Parliament for Loir-et-Cher from 1849 to 1850. He was convicted in absentia and stripped of his seat following his participation in the Paris insurrection on June 13, 1849. Prosecuted even before the 1851 coup d'etat of Napoleon III, Cantagrel went into exile in Belgium from 1849 to 1854. \nLa Reunion\nCantagrel was the first Director of the La R\u00e9union colony located in Dallas County, Texas. \nCantagrel departed Belgium for Texas on October 3, 1854 as an advance agent for the European American Colonization Society of Texas, charged with preparing the colony for settlement. Along with a small number of additional colonists, Cantagrel was responsible for purchasing the land for the colony and beginning preparations for the colonists, before their arrival in early 1855.\nCantagrel resigned his position in 1856 and returned to France in 1859, after being granted amnesty for his demonstration against Napoleon III.\nFrance\nCantagrel was the director of the Nantes newspaper L'Union D\u00e9mocratique from 1869 to 1871.  In 1871 and 1872, he contributed to the newspaper Le Radical.\nAn opposition candidate under the Second Empire, he was a municipal councilor of Paris from 1871 to 1876. He was a member of parliament for the Seine from 1876 to 1887, sitting on the far left. He was one of the 363 who refused to vote in favour of the Broglie government on 16 May 1877.\nLegacy\nCantegral Street in Old East Dallas is named (although misspelled) in his honor.\nRue Cantagrel in Paris is named after him as well.\n",
    "Family of computer vision models designed for efficient inference on mobile devices\nMobileNet is a family of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures designed for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks. They are designed for small size, low latency, and low power consumption, making them suitable for on-device inference and edge computing on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones and embedded systems. They were originally designed to be run efficiently on mobile devices with TensorFlow Lite.\nThe need for efficient deep learning models on mobile devices led researchers at Google to develop MobileNet. As of October\u00a02024, the family has four versions, each improving upon the previous one in terms of performance and efficiency.\nFeatures\nV1\nMobileNetV1 was published in April 2017. Its main architectural innovation was incorporation of depthwise separable convolutions. It was first developed by Laurent Sifre during an internship at Google Brain in 2013 as an architectural variation on AlexNet to improve convergence speed and model size.\nThe depthwise separable convolution decomposes a single standard convolution into two convolutions: a depthwise convolution that filters each input channel independently and a pointwise convolution ( convolution) that combines the outputs of the depthwise convolution. This factorization significantly reduces computational cost.\nThe MobileNetV1 has two hyperparameters: a width multiplier  that controls the number of channels in each layer. Smaller values of  lead to smaller and faster models, but at the cost of reduced accuracy, and a resolution multiplier , which controls the input resolution of the images. Lower resolutions result in faster processing but potentially lower accuracy.\nV2\nMobileNetV2 was published in March 2019. It uses inverted residual layers and linear bottlenecks.\nInverted residuals modify the traditional residual block structure.  Instead of compressing the input channels before the depthwise convolution, they expand them. This expansion is followed by a  depthwise convolution and then a  projection layer that reduces the number of channels back down. This inverted structure helps to maintain representational capacity by allowing the depthwise convolution to operate on a higher-dimensional feature space, thus preserving more information flow during the convolutional process.\nLinear bottlenecks removes the typical ReLU activation function in the projection layers. This was rationalized by arguing that that nonlinear activation loses information in lower-dimensional spaces, which is problematic when the number of channels is already small.\nV3\nMobileNetV3 was published in 2019. The publication included MobileNetV3-Small, MobileNetV3-Large, and MobileNetEdgeTPU (optimized for Pixel 4). They were found by a form of neural architecture search (NAS) that takes mobile latency into account, to achieve good trade-off between accuracy and latency. It used piecewise-linear approximations of swish and sigmoid activation functions (which they called \"h-swish\" and \"h-sigmoid\"), squeeze-and-excitation modules, and the inverted bottlenecks of MobileNetV2.\nV4\nMobileNetV4 was published in September 2024. The publication included a large number of architectures found by NAS. Compared to the architectural modules used in V3, the V4 series included the \"universal inverted bottleneck\", which includes both inverted residual and inverted bottleneck as special cases, and attention modules with multi-query attention.\nSee also\nConvolutional neural network\nDeep learning\nTensorFlow Lite\nExternal links\n\"models/research/slim/nets/mobilenet at master \u00b7 tensorflow/models\".

    "South Ossetian politician\nLasko Gussoev is an Ossetian politician from the small partially recognized Republic of South Ossetia that served as a member of the Parliament of South Ossetia.\nCareer\nAt the age of 24 Gussoev was one of the youngest people to ever be elected to the Parliament of South Ossetia.\nGussoev served as the director of the Tsinagari Secondary school where he entered a feud with Anatoly Bibilov's Ministry of Construction over the school's gym. Gussoev reported that the gym was constructed, however, the ministry never installed a transformer, rendering the building inoperable due to the lack of electricity to power lights, fans, and other utilities. Gussoev attempted to lobby the government for the funds so he could purchase and install the transformer himself, however, received no comment from the government on the issue. The former head of the Leningor district Vladimir Guliyev stated that the renovations would likely cost 20 million rubles, and that local government didn't have the required funds.\nIn 2023 Gussoev led a cultural celebration in Tsinagari named Arvyron which included a concert, a moment of silence for the dead of the 2008 Russo Georgian War, and a traditional dance ensemble in costume.\n",
    "Museum in Idlib, Syria\nIdlib Museum (Arabic: \u0645\u062a\u062d\u0641 \u0625\u062f\u0644\u0628) is an archaeological museum located in the city of Idlib in northwestern Syria.\nThe museum was founded in 1989 and holds a significant collection of artifacts, most notably the clay tablets from what the museum calls the Royal Archive of Ebla, carefully preserved for study, and they have reshaped much of what is known about the ancient Near East.\nCollection highlights\nIdlib Museum preserves a collection from the ancient city of Ebla, located near Saraqib, a kingdom that thrived thousands of years ago. Among the artifacts are basalt steles, pottery jars, mosaics, and clay figurines. The museum also holds a collection of Islamic artifacts, in addition to artifacts from the Roman and Byzantine periods.\nThe most notable items in the museum are the cuneiform tablets, often referred to as the Ebla Royal Archives. These tablets, discovered in 1964 by an Italian archaeological mission led by Paolo Matthiae, have revealed significant historical data dating back to 5000 BC. The museum also houses a wide range of items from Syria's ancient history, including 12,000-year-old artifacts.\nWar damage and preservation\nThe museum first closed in 2013 due to the escalation of the Syrian civil war, during which it suffered from looting and bombings. Despite this, opposition groups reopened the museum in 2018, supervised by a local civilian group called the Idlib Antiquities Center, which restored two galleries for visitors.\nIdlib Museum has endured substantial damage during the conflict. It was directly hit by shelling in 2015 and again in 2017, causing significant structural damage. Further harm occurred from the aftermath of the 2023 Turkey\u2013Syria earthquakes, leading to cracks in the museum's walls.\nCurrent challenges\nThe museum remains open but struggles with a lack of support and the absence of tourists due to ongoing instability. Local visitors, including school and university students, are the primary audience. Efforts continue to raise awareness of the museum's importance and advocate for increased protection and restoration of Syria's cultural heritage.\nSell also\nList of museums in Syria",
    "Narrow-line Seyfert galaxy in the constellation Perseus\n1H 0323+342 known as 2MASX J032441.19+341045.9, is a galaxy located in the constellation of Perseus. It is located 831 million light years from Earth. It is classified a gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert galaxy, the nearest known example of this subtype.\nObservational history\n1H 0323+342 was first discovered by Wood as an astrophysical X-ray source during the HEAO-1 X-ray survey in 1984. At the time of the observation the source had an unknown origin. In 1993, the source was confirmed as a Seyfert type 1 galaxy by Remillard and colleagues, who identified several emission-line AGNs from a further HEAO-1 X-ray survey. This galaxy has since been detected by both the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and INTEGRAL.\nCharacteristics\nThe nucleus of 1H 0323+342 is found to be active. The most likely explanation for this energy source in all active galactic nuclei is a presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The mass of the black hole in center of 1H 0323+342 is estimated to be 107 M\u0298 based on the width and luminosity of a H\u03b2 line and empirical scaling relations, or ~ 2 x 107 M\u0298 according to multi-wavelength observations. But later studies shows the mass of the black hole has different estimates. In 2016, a similar mass of (3.4+0.9-0.6) x 107 M\u0298 was found from a reverberation study. However, in 2024, the mass is 107.24\u00b10.01 M\u0298 according to the galaxy's total flux spectrum. Additionally, the nucleus shows a quasi-stationary feature similar to a HST-1 structure inside the jet of Messier 87.\n1H 0323+342 shows some characteristics of blazars, including variable fluxes in optical, radio and X-ray bands as well as a compact bright core. Moreover, the core is revealed to have a two-sided structure measuring ~ 15 kiloparsecs. The galaxy also contains a flat-spectrum radio source with a radio loudness of either R5GHz = 246 or R1.4GHz = 318. A relativistic jet is present in 1H 0323+342 although its jet power of 1.0 x 1045 erg s-1 is half the luminosity of its accretion disk.\nThe host galaxy of 1H 0323+342 is a mystery but it has irregular morphology. There is a peculiar structure in the galaxy. It is either interpreted as a one-armed spiral structure based from an optical image taken by Hubble Space Telescope, or a ring-like structure suggesting a recent galaxy merger.\n",
    "Skyscrapers in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland\nThe Hardau Residential Complex (German: Hardau Hochhaus or Wohnsiedlung Hardau II) is a high-rise residential complex in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. Built between 1976 and 1978, the complex consists of four towers, with the tallest one (Tower 1 or Bullingerstrasse 73) standing at 95.4\u00a0m (313\u00a0ft) tall with 33 floors which is the second tallest building in Z\u00fcrich and the 13th tallest building in Switzerland.\nHistory\nSite\nThe residential development is located next to the smaller Hardau I complex developed in the 1960s. Hardau II consists of a total of four residential high-rises with 21 to 31 habitable floors, two four-story residential blocks with five apartment buildings each, a retirement community of the same height with a staff house and a retirement home. The properties in the development include a total of 573 apartments, a kindergarten, various neighborhood facilities and ground floor commercial spaces.\nThe highest residential tower (Bullingerstrasse 73), stands at an official height of 95.4 metres. It was the tallest building in the city of Z\u00fcrich and subsequently in Switzerland between 1978 and 2011 when the Prime Tower was completed, and still one of the tallest residential buildings in the country. It is located in the Hard quarter on Bullingerstrasse or Norastrasse of District 4, situated in the western part of Z\u00fcrich. The Letzigrund Stadium is located in the immediate vicinity to the west of the development.\nArchitecture\nAll the four towers display a square floor plan were built by the architect Max P. Kollbrunner between 1976 and 1978 as part of the first Swiss high-rise boom. The target group was older couples and individuals. Accordingly, the majority of the apartments were 2\u00bd-room apartments. The settlement was intended to alleviate the housing shortage and to offer a smaller apartment to parents with adult children who wanted to move, as well as older people who wanted to stay in the area.\nThe enthusiasm for high-rise buildings gradually waned in the following years; the development became slums because it was not attractive enough for families with children. In 1984, an initiative adopted by the people put a political end to the construction of high-rise buildings in Zurich's inner city. From 2000 onwards, taller buildings were again built in the area surrounding the Hardau development. The city of Zurich, as the owner of the Hardau buildings, combined a necessary renovation of the building technology with the creation of large apartments by combining smaller units. New kitchens, new paint and other adjustments upgraded the development between 2006 and 2007. Along with the general upgrading of the surrounding area, the reputation of the development also changed.\nBuildings\nSee also\nList of tallest buildings in Switzerland",

    "Former zoo in Broome, Western Australia\nPearl Coast Zoological Gardens, also known as Pearl Coast Zoo, or simply Broome Zoo, was a 64-acre (26\u00a0ha) zoo founded by Lord Alistair McAlpine in the Cable Beach suburb of Broome, Western Australia. First opened in 1984, by 1989 the zoo had more than doubled in size. The zoo was one of a number of developments of McAlpine's in the town credited with transforming Broome from a \"derelict\" place into \"an international tourist destination\". The zoo closed in 1991 due to falling visitor numbers, and the animals were sold.\nThe West Australian described the zoo as \"a lush, tropical oasis ... filled with weird and wonderful exotic animals and a cacophony of bright, colourful birds\".\nHistory\nBackground\nMcAlpine, a \"quixotic\" and \"eccentric\" wealthy English aristocrat, first visited Perth in 1960 on the maiden voyage of the SS Oriana. He visited Broome for the first time in 1979, on the advice of his Perth lawyer, John Adams, who suggested they fly there together in McAlpine's private plane as he was at that point searching for a location to showcase his collection of heritage mining equipment.\nMcAlpine was taken by the town, although he described it as derelict. According to a 2018 interview with Sue Thom (guest relations manager at McAlpine's Cable Beach Club Resort since its opening in 1988), upon arriving in Broome, McAlpine went to look at sea shells and later rendezvoused with the rest of his party at the Roebuck Bay Hotel for lunch. Midway through the meal, he announced that he had already bought his first property in the town, reputedly having signed the deal on a beer coaster at the Roey pub.\nBroome development\nFrom this initial first trip, McAlpine enthusiastically began purchasing large landholdings in the area (at one point owning more than 20 properties), and undertaking several development projects. McAlpine was familiar with property development since his time in Perth in the mid-1960s.\nIn 1982, McAlpine purchased a home for himself in Broome (now known as McAlpine House) from a family named Kennedy. This was to become his residence in Broome for more than a decade, and where he would plant and keep an extensive tropical garden with aviaries housing exotic birds, including his prized Eclectus parrots. It was from this context that McAlpine's idea for a zoological attraction in Broome originated, and resulted in the Pearl Coast Zoological Gardens, opened in 1984.\nA plane descending over Sun Picture Gardens towards Broome International Airport, 2018\nAt the time of the zoos construction, Broome was still a very isolated outpost with \"hardly any shipping, the last piece of road between Halls Creek and Broome was still dirt track, (and) freezer trucks had just started to come through\", according to Thom. In this unlikely location, McAlpine chose to build \"a zoo filled with endangered and exotic animals\", confident that it would attract tourists.\nConscious that potential visitors to Broome would have limited accommodation options, McAlpine also purchased land at Cable Beach where he oversaw the establishment of the town's first luxury accommodation, the 600-bed Cable Beach Club Resort, opened in 1988 to celebrate Australia's bicentennial.\nWhat is now the Cable Beach Club Resort & Spa was at that point \"just a caravan park and paddock\" on the headland, according to Thom. McAlpine spent AUD $55 million (at 1987 prices) developing the resort, hoping to develop Broome as a tourist destination for visitors from Australia as well as overseas. McAlpine's low-rise, largely timber resort was the antithesis to what other developers such as Christopher Skase were building on the east coast in places such as Port Douglas, Cairns and the Gold Coast.\nAccording to the Australian Financial Review, many of Broome's present heritage buildings \"owe their current existence and reinvention (as cafes, restaurants, art galleries) to McAlpine's wallet and passions\" at this time. Some buildings, such as the microbrewery and restaurant Matso's Broome Brewery, \"were physically transported from their original locations when it would have been far cheaper to build replicas\". McAlpine also helped to preserve the Sun Picture Gardens.\nZoological gardens\nMcAlpine's development of the Pearl Coast Zoo reflected his passion for gardens and animals, and in his mind it acted as a sanctuary for the rare species he brought there which would otherwise have been at harm from industrial development, hunting or civil war.\nOne of a pair of cheetahs on display at the zoo in 1989\nOpening in 1984, the zoo initially housed only kangaroos, camels and wallabies and covered a total of 25 acres (10 hectares).  From the late 1980s, \"a steady stream of animals were trucked and flown to Broome\", according to The West Australian, including oryx, addax, sitatunga and zebra. Within five years of opening, the zoo was home to Australia's \"best collection of Australian parrots and African exotics\". In 1989, the zoo's 280 aviari",

Fulgencio Batista and Manuel Benitez Vald\u00e9s were both stationed here, and this was the location of the first events of the Cuban Revolution of 1933.\nOn New Year's Eve of 1958, the highest-ranking officials in the Batista government arranged to exfiltrate the country from Camp Columbia Airfield. At 3am on New Year's Day of 1959, three large aircraft lifted off from this airfield, marking the official end of the Cuban Revolution, and the transition of the country to communism under the Castro regime.\nOn January 8, 1959, Fidel Castro held a rally at Camp Columbia Airfield.\nThe Camp was redesignated \"Camp Freedom\" (Ciudad Libertad) by the communist government, until its closure in 1961. The Camp Columbia Airfield became Ciudad Libertad Airport.\n",

It was established in 1994 and is currently headquartered in Volyn.\nHistory\nOn 3 June 1994, the 16th Separate Battalion was established at Ulyaniki on the basis of the Missile regiment of the 37th Guards Missile Division of the Soviet Armed Forces. On 6 October 1994, it was transferred to Lutsk where on 10 June 1998, all separate battalions it became the 16th Special Purpose Battalion which was transferred to the Internal Troops of Ukraine on 17 December 1999.\nThroughout 90s, the main tasks of the Battalion included thwarting of small scale crimes mostly involving the stealing of copper and protection of borders, thwarting illegal crossing attempts in cooperation with the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine.\nIn 2000s, the battalion saw action mostly in law enforcement and thwarting of robberies including carrying out of operations in civilian clothes in some cases. They also maintained public order in Kyiv and Western Ukraine especially during the visits of the President of Ukraine and President of Poland, the Pope and during census.\nIn 2014 it was transferred to the National Guard of Ukraine as the 32nd Separate Battalion. After the Russian invasion of Crimea and the start of the War in Donbass, the battalion was deployed to the ATO zone to take part in combat in Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast. It took part in the First Battle of Mariupol and on 9 May 2014, the personnel of the Battalion engaged separatists occupying the office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine successfully liberating it, during the battle, the battalion's commander and another serviceman were wounded.\nOn 14 August 2017, a cross was installed at the construction site of the Church of the Battalion whose foundation was laid by Lieutenant Colonel Vasyl Gurtovskyi, commander of the battalion. A Golden Crucifix was also awarded to the battalion.\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the battalion saw action during the Northern Ukraine campaign defending the border with Belarus in addition to maintaining public order and curfew in various cities.

    "Electron Backscatter Diffraction software\nFree and open-source software portal\nMTEX is a open-source MATLAB package specifically designed for the analysis of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) data, which are widely used to analyse the crystallographic orientation of materials at the microscale.\nHistory\nThe development of MTEX began in 2008, spearheaded by Ralf Hielscher, who aimed to create a user-friendly platform that could facilitate the analysis of large datasets generated by EBSD. The toolbox has since evolved, incorporating various features that allow for the manipulation and visualisation of crystallographic data.\nEBSD allows for the mapping of crystallographic orientations in materials, providing insights into their microstructural properties. The integration of EBSD with MATLAB through MTEX has enabled researchers to perform advanced analyses, such as orientation distribution function (ODF) calculations, pole figure plotting, calculation of anisotropic physical properties from texture data, and grain boundary and grain reconstruction, which are crucial for understanding the mechanical properties of materials, as the crystallographic texture can significantly influence their behaviour under stress.\nMoreover, the open-source nature of MTEX has fostered a collaborative environment among researchers, allowing for continuous improvements and updates to the toolbox. This community-driven approach has led to the incorporation of new features and functionalities.\nMTEX's versatility is further demonstrated by its application across various fields, including geology, metallurgy, and materials science. In geological studies, for instance, MTEX has been used to analyse the crystallographic orientation of minerals, providing insights into their formation processes and the conditions under which they evolved. Similarly, in metallurgy, researchers have employed MTEX to investigate the effects of processing methods on the texture and grain boundary characteristics of alloys, which are critical for optimising their mechanical properties.\nThe toolbox has also been instrumental in advancing the understanding of deformation mechanisms in materials. By analysing EBSD data with MTEX, researchers can elucidate the relationship between microstructural features and mechanical behaviour, such as strain localisation and phase transformations during deformation.\n",
    "Australian soldier and polar explorer (1869\u20131910)\nBertram Armytage (29 September 1869\u00a0\u2013 12 March 1910) was an Australian soldier and explorer. He fought in the Second Boer War and participated in the Nimrod Expedition to Antarctica during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, for which he was awarded the Polar Medal.\nEarly life\nArmytage was born in Lara in 1869, the son of pastoralist Frederick William Armytage and Mary Susan Armitage. He grew up at Wooloomanata Station near Lara, before being educated at Geelong Grammar School and Melbourne Church of England Grammar School. A keen sportsman, he paddled a canoe from Melbourne to Geelong, before carrying it to the Barwon River, then rowing along the Barwon to Port Phillip Bay and back to Melbourne. He would later travel to England, where he attended Jesus College, Cambridge. He rowed for the college, earning first place in the Lent Races of 1888. After college he returned to Australia, where he worked on his fathers station, as well as a station in Queensland.\nMilitary career\nWhile in Victoria, he joined the Victorian Militia serving in the artillery, before travelling back to England, where he joined the 6th Dragoon Guards as a second lieutenant. In 1899, his unit was sent to South Africa to fight in the Second Boer War. He earnt the Queen's South Africa Medal for his efforts, before resigning his commission at the end of the war, returning to Australia.\nPost war\nAfter his time in South Africa, he spent his time between Australia and England as well as taking part in sporting pursuits. An excellent shot, he was on a deer hunting trip to New Zealand when he heard about the Nimrod Expedition, cutting the trip short to offer his services.\nAntarctic exploration\nHis physical attributes and hunting skills helped Ernest Shackleton overlook his age, being 38 at the time and one of the older members of the trip, selecting him to look after the ponies on the expedition. While he didn't undertake the more notable sections of the expedition, he contributed heavily through depot stocking trips and as a member of the support party for the South Pole party. On one occasion he managed to escape a Killer Whale attack while mustering the ponies on pack ice.\nDeath\nAfter his return from the expedition, he travelled to England. Hoping to obtain a military position to give himself a permanent occupation. Despite the assistance of Major General Sir Edward Hutton, he was deemed too old. He would return to Australia disappointed at this rejection.\nOn 12 March 1910, he would take his own life in his room at the Melbourne Club. He was found wearing medals presented to him by the Royal Geographical Society for his work in the Antarctic, while his Polar and Boer War Medals were on display on his dresser.\nPersonal life\nArmytage was married and had a four-year-old daughter at the time of his death.\nHonours and Memorials\nHis mother established a scholarship at the University of Melbourne in his honour. Mount Armytage in Antarctica was named for him by members of the Nimrod Expedition. His medals are held by the National Trust of Victoria.\n",

    "Quasar in the constellation Eridanus\nPKS 0405\u2013385 is a blazar in the constellation of Eridanus. This is a compact radio quasar with a redshift (z) of 1.285, an indicator of its significant distance. The radio spectrum of this source appears flat, making it a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ).\nThe visible light spectrum of PKS 0405\u2013385 displays strong, broad emission lines, with an intermediate absorption occurring at a redshift of 0.875. Examination using VLBI shows the radio source spans less than five microarcseconds (\u03bcas) in angle. In 1993, this quasar was found to undergo variation in radio flux density during time spans of less than an hour. This variability is intermittent during episodes lasting for weeks or months. The radio flux was also found to vary on longer timescales for periods of a month or two.\nIf the short-term variation were due to the quasar, it would imply an extreme brightness temperature of about 1021\u00a0K. Instead, it was proposed that the variation was the result of interstellar scintillation due to ionized clouds in the Milky Way. The radio emission from the quasar underwent rotation of linear polarization during these events, lending support to the idea of scintillation. A scattering medium at a distance of 3\u201330\u00a0pc would explain these observations, bringing the modelled peak brightness temperature down to a more plausible 2.0\u00d71013\u00a0K. The episodic nature of the rapid variations may be explained by changes in the quasar or the interstellar medium. PKS 0405\u2013385 is one of only three known extreme scintillators, the others being PKS 1257\u2212326 and J1819+385.\nIn 2022, the gamma ray emission from PKS 0405\u2013385 was found to undergo quasi-periodic oscillation with a period of about 2.8 years. This may be explained by helical motion in a jet originating from the supermassive black hole (SMBH), or the core SMBH is itself a binary system. Enhanced gamma ray activity was observed from this source in 2019 and 2023.\n",

    "Ukrainian institution for conscription and military records\nArm badge of the Kyiv City Territorial Center of Recruitment and Social Support\nThe Territorial Center of Recruitment and Social Support (TCC and SP or TCC) (Ukrainian: \u0422\u0426\u041a \u0442\u0430 \u0421\u041f or \u0422\u0426\u041a) is Ukraine's military administration body that keeps military records and mobilizes the population. Starting from 2022, the TCC and SP have completely replaced Ukraine's former system of military commissariats.\nDescription\nAccording to Ukrainian resolution \"On the approval of the Regulation on territorial centers of recruitment and social support\", local TCCs are formed, liquidated, reorganized by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The direct management of the TCC and control over their activities is carried out by the relevant operational commands, and the general command of the Ukrainian Ground Forces, which coordinates the main issues of the TCC's activities with their relevant structural subdivisions of the General Staff of the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense. Territorial centers of recruitment and social support of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Kyiv, Sevastopol, and Ukrainian oblasts are legal entities under public law, with each having independent balance sheets registration accounts in the Treasury authorities.\nIn order to ensure the fulfillment of the tasks and specified functions of each TCC, structural subdivisions (departments, branches, groups, services) are formed within them. Each TCC conducts activities in accordance to the provisions with each structural division, which is approved the head of the district territorial center of recruitment and social support. Regulations on district territorial centers of staffing and social support are approved by the heads of their respective TCC.\nThe TCC is tasked with managing the conscription and military service of citizens, engaging in mobilization training of employees for mobilization civilians, managing military records of conscripts and reservists on the territory of the relevant administrative-territorial unit, the selection of candidates for contract military service, with participation in the selection of citizens for military reserve service, the preparation and mobilization of human and transport resources, ensuring the organization of social and legal protection of conscripts to the Armed Forces, managing veterans of military service and pensioners from among military personnel and members of their families, and participation in military and patriotic education. The personnel of the TCC, as well as the transport and material and technical means of the said TCC are maintained under the budget of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.\nThe number of TCCs as of 2023 reached over 200, and were distributed among four operational commands: \"North\", \"South\", \"West\", and \"East\". However, some of them have separate territorial subdivisions\u2014 so-called \"departments\"\u2014 together with which the territorial total number of such formations approaches or exceeds 300.\nHistory\nOn July 19, 2017, the Government of Ukraine issued an order to approve a pilot project proposed by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on the formation of the TCC from August 1 to December 31, 2017, on the basis of the Chernihiv Regional Military Commissariat (now the Chernihiv Regional TCC and SP). On August 2, 2017, it was announced that starting from August 1, 2017, this pilot project was implemented not only in Chernihiv, but also in Kozelka of the Chernihiv region. The Kozelka District Military Commissariat (now the Second Branch of the Chernihiv RTCC and SP) also joined. On November 1, 2017, at a briefing attended by experts from the Department of Defense Cooperation of the US Embassy in Ukraine, an Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) representative publicized information about the results of reforming military commissariats in the TCC in these two military commissariats of the Chernihiv region.\nOn January 12, 2018, plans were announced to implement the program in Volyn by March 2018. On March 22, 2018, plans to expand the project to four more regions were announced. On April 25, 2018, information about the minister of defense of Ukraine's approval of a plan to create a TCC on the basis of military commissariats without any territorial restrictions, thus on the entire territory of Ukraine, was\u00a0revealed. As of September 17, 2018, this plan provided for the reform of 111 military commissariats in the TCC in Chernihiv, Rivne, Dnipropetrovsk, and Odesa regions by the end of 2018, after which they would be implemented in all other regions of Ukraine.\nOn May 28, 2020, a draft law was registered in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine regarding, in particular, the renaming of the Military Committees of Ukraine to the TCC, but the process of its consideration was significantly delayed. On November 1, 2020, the Ministry of Defense unilaterally renamed all military commissariats of Ukraine into territorial centers, thus creating a precedent for their fu",

    "Canadian university ice hockey team\nCollege ice hockey team\nThe Lakehead Thunderwolves men's ice hockey team (formerly the Lakehead Nor'Westers) is an active ice hockey program representing the Lakehead Thunderwolves athletic department of Lakehead University. The team has been continually active since returning to action in 2002 and is currently a member of the Ontario University Athletics conference under the authority of U Sports. The Thunderwolves  play at the Fort William Gardens in Thunder Bay, Ontario.\nHistory\nAfter the merger of Lakehead Technical Institute and Lakehead College of Arts, Science, and Technology in 1965, Lakehead University was formed. That first year, the college started its ice hockey team and began play as a founding member of the International Collegiate Hockey Association (ICHA), an NAIA conference comprised mostly of American schools. The Nor'Westers shared a league championship in 1967 but were usually a middling team in the conference for much of their tenure. However, Lakehead did make the NAIA tournament in 1971, 1973 and 1975, finishing as runners-up twice.\nIn 1972, the WCIAA split into two divisions, Canada West and the Great Plains Athletic Association (later renamed Great Plains Athletic Conference). The primary reason that Lakehead had joined an American conference rather than a Canadian one, was the cost of travel. With the formation of the GPAA, the financial burdens were greatly reduced, giving the Nor'Westers the opportunity to play in their first native league. However, this did not prevent the team from continuing on with the ICHA and Lakehead jointly played in both until 1977. During this time the Nor'Westers had the unique distinction of appearing in both an American and Canadian national tournament (in 1973), finishing as runners-up in the NAIA field and fifth in the University Cup. In the early 1980's Lakehead had another flirtation with a second league when they joined the Thunder Bay Hockey League for two seasons. Unfortunately, by then, the rot was beginning to set in for the program.\nAfter the halcyon days of the 70s, Lakehead tumbled to the bottom of the GPAC standings and finished in the bottom two each year after 1978. The conference itself wasn't on sound footing at the time and lost a member in 1984. The next season, Lakehead went winless in 26 games. After the worst season in program history, and with costs mounting, the school suspended the program.\nSixteen years passed before Lakehead returned to the ice. In the interim, the school had joined Ontario University Athletics and changed its moniker to 'Thunderwolves'. The team wasted little time reacclimating itself to college hockey and in just two seasons received a bid to the University Cup. In the succeeding 10 years, Thunderwolves only produced winning seasons and finished as the national runners-up in 2006. However, since 2014, the program has declined and has only one winning record (as of 2024).\nSeason-by-season results\nAmercian Collegiate\nNote: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\nCanadian Collegiate\nNote: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\nNote: Totals include senior collegiate play only.\n",
    "\nSoap opera character\nChristopher \"Kit\" Green is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera Coronation Street, portrayed by actor Jacob Roberts. The character first appeared on screen during the episode airing on 13 May 2024.\nKit is the secret son of Bernie Winter (Jane Hazlegrove), brother of Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell) and Paul Foreman (Peter Ash). Since his debut, Kit has made his self known as a detective and has started to build relationships with his long-lost family. He has developed feuds with Bernie, Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper) and Beth Tinker (Lisa George).\nStorylines\nBackstory\nZodiac (Kit's name at birth) was born on 20th May 1993. He was the result of a one-night stand with a man who a drunk Bernie Winter (Jane Hazlegrove) met in Manchester's Ha\u00e7ienda nightclub where she went after her split from her partner Denny Foreman (Danny Cunningham). Already the mother of two-year old twins Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) and Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell), Bernie found it impossible to cope with the addition of a crying baby who she named Zodiac on her own and the child was taken into care. Along with his usual baby paraphernalia, the baby was taken away with a small green jade elephant, an offshoot of Bernie's esoteric interests in alternative therapies and the like. Two years later, Bernie found out that a couple with the surname Green had adopted him and changed his unusual astrological name to Christopher.\nBernie found the wrench of losing her child traumatic to bear and each year wrote out birthday cards for him which she was unable to pass on. For the best part of three decades, she kept the secret and her own emotional pain to herself, struggling to raise the twins while all the time dancing on the right and wrong side of the law.\nIn the meantime, Kit prospered in the care of his adoptive parents and joined the police force. In 2014, Bernie and Kit made tentative contact and arranged to meet, but Bernie couldn't bring herself to go through with the proposed meeting in a cafe, having got herself drunk to cope with the upcoming encounter, and leading Kit to think of himself as abandoned again. \n2024\u2013present\nRising through the ranks to a detective constable, in 2024 Kit was transferred to Weatherfield police's CID reporting to DS Lisa Swain (Vicky Myers) and working on the case of the missing Lauren Bolton (Cait Fitton).\nThat same year, Denny came back into Bernie's life at a time when she was trying to cope with Paul's deterioration with motor neurone disease and the forthcoming loss of her son. His negative presence reignited her old feelings of loss and she began to search for Christopher, visiting every known address in Manchester where such a man lived. She unwittingly traced him to 36 Lidgate Avenue where she went along with his mistaken assumption that she had come for an advertised cleaning job in order that she could get inside the house. Once there, she was caught by Kit searching round the house and came clean as to why she was there. Kit lied that he was not adopted but once Bernie was gone, he opened a drawer and took out of it a small jade green elephant - the only link to his past life.\nFollowing the encounter, Kit consulted Bernie's long police record and began to harass her, arresting her for being drunk and disorderly and impounding her car for being one day late with its MOT. On this occasion, she went to Weatherfield Police Station to arrange for its return and was present when PC Craig Tinker (Colson Smith) presented him with a small cake and candle to celebrate his 31st birthday, leading her to realise that this man was indeed her natural son. The two spoke at some length where Kit made his anger at her abandonment clear, saying that although they were natural mother and son, he refused to acknowledge her as anything more and wanted to get on with his life without her.\nIn the meantime, Kit had encountered his half-siblings without revealing who he was to them. Aware of Paul's MND, he stepped in to help him when an inconsiderate driver used a disabled space outside Weatherfield General that Paul was waiting to use and sent him on his way with a flash of his police card. He also helped Gemma avoid being charged with shoplifting a pair of shoes for her daughter Carys Winter-Brown (Charlotte Holt) by digging up dirt on the shop manager, Bruce Ruskin, and forcing him to drop the charge. After his adopted mother died, Kit revealed himself to Paul and Gemma as their brother. They were outraged that Bernie gave him away, robbing Paul of the chance to ever really get to know him. As they spurned their mother, Kit gloated to her that he'd given her a taste of her own medicine. Paul brought his warring family together by telling them that his dying wish was that they were reconciled, but Kit only reluctantly accepted Bernie's apoplogy for what she did to him and when they were on their own told her that he would always dislike her.\nWorking on Lauren's case, Kit set u",

It encompasses the neighbourhoods of Lindir and Salir.\nHistory\nThe land is first recorded in a registry of land leases of the Vi\u00f0ey Monastery in 1312 under the name Hvammur. The land would remain in the possession of the monastery until the Protestant Reformation in Iceland in the mid 16th century.\nThe name Hvammkot first appears in an governor's account by Eggerts Hannesson in Bessasta\u00f0ir from June 24, 1552. Formerly, Hvammkot was crown land, its land lease totalling 90 acres. The landbook of \u00c1rni Magn\u00fasson og P\u00e1ll V\u00eddal\u00edn from 23 October 1703, writes as follows about Hvammkot: \"The worth of the land is uncertain. Its owner is the Royal Majesty. Its occupant is Teitur J\u00f3nsson,  lives on one half. Another, Marteinn J\u00f3nsson, lives on the other half.\"\nOn May 17, 1873, the land was sold off from royal possession for 594 rigsdaler. On January 1, 1891, resident \u00deorl\u00e1kur Gu\u00f0mundsson, a parliament representative of \u00c1rness\u00fdsla, renamed the land F\u00edfuhvammur.\nThe last occupants of the land were \u00cdsak Bjarnason and \u00de\u00f3runn Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir, who moved there in 1919, alongside their six children. Their land was eventually bought by the city of K\u00f3pavogur, and having fallen into disrepair, their residence was demolished in 1983.\n",
    "Russian teenagers (died by suicide 2016)\nDenis Muravyov and Ekaterina Vlasova were two 15-year-old teenagers from Pskov, Russia who barricaded themselves in a private house in Strugi Krasnye on the afternoon of November 14, 2016 and opened fire on police officers before committing suicide. They showed the whole event on their social media pages, broadcasting on Periscope and calling themselves the Russian Bonnie and Clyde. The case caused a wide resonance and discussion online.\nBackground\nDenis Muravyev and Katya Vlasova met at school in the spring of 2016. After meeting, Muravyev and Vlasova added each other in VKontakte. The two continued to meet in person and soon began dating.\nCourse of events\nOn the morning of 11 November, Muravyev took his mother's bank card from her bag, which he used to withdraw money  for two tickets for a shuttle bus to Strug Krasnye. Muravyev and Vlasova ran away from home following a quarrel with their parents. The parents started searching for them and called the police. On the afternoon of 14 November, the teenagers were found in a dacha house 80 kilometers from Pskov, belonging to the Vlasova's stepfather. There the schoolchildren had been hiding from their parents for three days and planned to \u201csit out\". The teenagers barricaded themselves in the room, opened the stepfather's safe, which contained weapons. Shortly before that, Denis wounded the girl's mother who had come to the address to look for them. On Monday, a police car pulled up to the house on Kudryavtsev Street. The teenagers opened fire at her from the second floor window, the police tried to negotiate with the teenagers for several hours, eventually deciding to launch an assault.\nBefore the suicide, the teenagers posted identical farewell messages to their relatives on their VKontakte pages, accusing them of \u201cdestroying their psyche and lives\".\nInvestigation\nMuravyev and Vlasova's parents were recognized as victims, and several criminal cases were opened, including negligence, negligent storage of firearms, and abuse of power by law enforcers.\nAccording to a representative of the Department of Internal Affairs in the Pskov region, law enforcers went to the village of Strugi Krasnye to check information about Muravyev, who had been reported missing. When the police officers were fired upon, they blocked the building and entered into negotiations with the teenagers. The teenagers did not make any demands.\nCharging law enforcers with murdering teenagers\nA number of media outlets and online users speculated and accused law enforcers of deliberately killing the teens. Prosecutors claimed that the pair committed suicide before the SWAT team approached their room. On the live feed, the teens discussed that they did not want to commit suicide and that they had no ammunition left to fight a gunfight. The version that Muravyev shot Vlasova and then himself contradicts their words about the lack of ammunition. Social media reacted to this contradiction. Since Rosgvardia, claims that the police special forces did not open fire during the attack, some users speculate that the teens may have lied that they ran out of ammunition\nA police officer who failed to check a report of missing teenagers in the Pskov region was charged with negligence. After receiving a report about the missing minors, the officer failed to organize proper verification of the report, collecting and studying data about the personalities and social circle of the teenagers.\nDenis Muravyev's family stated that they believed the officers who arrived on the scene acted wrongly, leaving the teenagers with no choice other than suicide.\nPopularity and online discussions\nThis tragedy instantly became a topic of discussion among the peers of the deceased teenagers. Groups dedicated to Muravyev and Vlasova began to appear on social networks. Young people quote them in their statuses, write posts calling them \u201cdefenseless and freedom fighters\u201d, and compose fanfics. The total number of subscribers to the groups amounted to almost 25,000. 60% of them are girls. Romantic interpretations of the tragedy appeared online. Teenagers began to be compared to Bonnie and Clyde - famous American robber-lovers.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, several theories emerged to explain what had happened. Speaking on the radio station \u201cGovorit Moskva\u201d, a clinical psychologist suggested that the teenagers could have joined a sect or suffered from mental illness.\nMP Elena Mizulina, on her Twitter page, blamed the tragedy on computer games.\nIn popular culture\nBritish composer Philip Venables adapted the event into an opera called Denis & Katya. It premiered in Philadelphia in 2019 and in the United Kingdom in 2020.\nOn June 23, 2022, the Russian crime drama \"Interseason\" based on the case of Pskov teenagers was released.\nNotes\n",
    "Town hall in Toulon, France\nThe H\u00f4tel de Ville (French pronunciation: , City Hall) is a historic building in Toulon, Var, southern France, standing on Avenue de la R\u00e9publique.\nHistory\nCivic leaders leaving the old H\u00f4tel de Ville\nThe original town hall was an ancient building on the quayside. In September 1653, the city council decided to demolish the old town hall and erect a new building on the same site.\nThe new four-storey building was designed in the neoclassical style, built in ashlar stone and was completed in 1656. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of five bays facing onto the waterfront. The central bay featured an ornate round headed doorway with a keystone, flanked by pilasters, which were adorned by a pair of finely carved figures supporting a balustraded balcony. There was a segmental headed French door, flanked by pilasters supporting a triangular pediment on the first floor. The figures were sculpted by Pierre Puget and, although sometimes referred to as caryatids (female figures), are actually atlanteans (male figures): Puget used two of the porters who unloaded ships along the quay as his models. The doorway was designated a monument historique by the French government in 1914.\nIn 1847, a fine bronze statue designed by the sculptor, Louis-Joseph Daumas, with four bas-reliefs on the base, was unveiled in front of the building. It was officially entitled the Le G\u00e9nie de la navigation (en: Genius of Navigation). However, it became associated with the French Admiral Jules de Cuverville, who commanded the reserve of the French Mediterranean Fleet in the late 19th century, and local people referred to it, somewhat irreverently, as the \"Cul-vers-ville\" (en: backside to the town hall).\nIn the early 1950s, the city council decided to commission a more substantial building. The site they selected was on the Avenue de la R\u00e9publique on the opposite side of the road to the rear of the old building. The original proposal was to erect a 25-storey mixed-use municipal development, which would have been connected to the old building by a footbridge across the road. However, this plan was rejected based on its high cost and it being too avant-garde. The new building was designed Jean de Mailly in the modern style, built with a concrete core and steel frame and was completed in January 1970.\nThe design involved a symmetrical main frontage facing onto Avenue de la R\u00e9publique. The structure consisted of a 15-storey tower sitting on a three-storey podium. The front of the podium featured a large portico extending the full width of the building. The tower was 54 meters (177\u00a0ft) high, or 70 meters (230\u00a0ft) high including the flagpole, and featured alternating columns of windows and blue-tinted cladding. Internally, the podium accommodated the offices of the mayor and deputy mayors as well as the public facing areas, while the tower accommodated the council staff.\nMeanwhile, the site of the 17th century town hall on the quay was redeveloped, and the new building was designated the Mairie d'honneur. The old doorway was retained to provide access to the new building which now serves as a tourist centre.\n",

    "American Muslim-interest college sorority\nMu Delta Alpha (\u039c\u0394\u0391) is an American professional sorority for Muslims. Established in 2014, it has chartered nine chapters in the United States. It was the first professional sorority for women in the United States.\nHistory\nMu Delta Alpha was founded as Muslimahs For Change Sorority on February 17, 2014 at the University of Texas at Dallas. It was founded by Samira Maddox who wanted a welcoming space for Black Muslims. Its other founding members were Fatima Ahmed, Dana Kamal, and Palwasha Rehmani. It is a \"professional sorority that focuses on sisterhood, service, and personal development for young women\". Although Muslim-focused, membership is open to women of all backgrounds. Its founders chose to create a professional sorority rather than a social sorority because there were many of the later and they wanted to a professional sorority to \"give Muslim women the opportunity to show that Muslim women can reach their potential and that they are encouraged to educate themselves through Islam.\" It was the first professional sorority for women in the United States.\nMuslimahs For Change Sorority became Mu Delta Alpha on June 11, 2016. It was incorporated in 2017 in the State of Texas. Initially, the sorority expanded within Texas. In 2017, Beta chapter was established at the University of Texas at Austin, followed by Gamma at the University of North Texas.

Its campus activities include hosting a fast-breaking meal, or iftar, for Ramadan. The Zeta chapter at the University of Colorado, Denver held established a prayer space on campus. Chapter also hosts Muslim speakers and programs related to women's empowerment.

    "Government offices in George Town, Penang, Malaysia\nThe Tuanku Syed Putra Building is an office building in George Town within the Malaysian state of Penang. Completed in 1962, the building, situated at Downing Street within the city's Central Business District (CBD), is owned by the Malaysian federal government and accommodates the Penang General Post Office (GPO). It once served as the seat of the Penang state government and, until 1966, was the tallest building in George Town.\nBackground\nGovernment Offices as seen from the Penang Strait c.\u20091892.\nA section of the Government Offices survived the Allied bombing of Penang in 1944 and is now occupied by the Penang Islamic Department.\nPrior to the Japanese invasion in 1941, the U-shaped Government Offices at the junction of Downing and Beach streets functioned as the administrative seat of Penang, then part of the British crown colony of the Straits Settlements. The complex, built in phases between 1884 and 1909, consisted of three two-storey blocks accommodating the Governor's office and various government departments.\nIn 1944, the Government Offices were largely destroyed by Allied aerial bombardment, with only a section (now occupied by the Penang Islamic Council) remaining. After the British recaptured Penang, administrative agencies had to be temporarily relocated to nearby Japanese-built godowns and commercial structures, resulting in inefficiencies in the post-war administration of the colony due to the dispersed offices. As the prospect of independence for the Malayan federation approached, there were proposals for a centralised office block to accommodate both federal and state departments, but plans were put on hold due to a nationwide communist insurgency.\nHistory\nIn 1957, the Malayan federal government allocated $1.2 million (Malayan dollar) for the construction of a new government office building as part of the First Malayan Five-Year Plan. The new building was planned for a 1-acre (0.40\u00a0ha) site at Downing Street where the destroyed Government Offices had stood. Construction of the new building commenced in 1959 and was expedited to meet a 1961 deadline.\nThe new building, designed in the International style, has a total floor area of 125,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (11,600\u00a0m2), with the Penang General Post Office (GPO) occupying 35,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (3,300\u00a0m2) on the ground floor. Office spaces make up 80,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (7,400\u00a0m2) and the remaining 10,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (930\u00a0m2) is designated for the staff canteen. Named after the then Malayan King Tuanku Syed Putra, the 10-storey building eventually cost $3.2 million.\nUpon its completion in 1962, The Straits Times reported that the building \"contrasts sharply with the pre-war colonial fa\u00e7ades facing the King Edward Place, Weld Quay and Beach Street\". It became the tallest building in George Town, surpassing the adjacent HSBC Building in height, and retained this status until 1966 when it was superseded by Hotel Ambassador. In addition to serving as the seat of government in Penang, the building was where the state's Justices of the Peace first organised into an association. Penang's seat of government relocated to the newly completed Komtar in 1986, while the building remains in use by federal government agencies and the Penang GPO.\n",
    "Not to be confused with Ferrari F8.\nMotor vehicle\nThe Ferrari F80 (Type F250) is an upcoming limited production mid-engine, hybrid sports car built by the Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari. Designed and named to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the company, it serves as a successor to the LaFerrari.\nDesign\nThe design of the F80 was inspired by the F40, which commemorated Ferrari's 40th anniversary, and the Ferrari Daytona SP3. Certain style elements, specifically the black band on the bonnet, were inspired by the Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona, similar to the Ferrari 12Cilindri.\nSpecifications\nEngine and transmission\nThe F80 uses a hybrid powertrain, consisting of a 3.0L twin-turbocharged Tipo F163 CF 120\u00b0 V6 petrol engine derived from the Ferrari 499P, and three electric motors. Separately, the petrol engine produces 900\u00a0PS (662\u00a0kW; 888\u00a0hp) while the three electric motors produce 300\u00a0PS (221\u00a0kW; 296\u00a0hp); combined, they produce 1,200\u00a0PS (883\u00a0kW; 1,184\u00a0hp).\nPerformance\nThe car has a stated top speed of 350 km/h (217 mph). It can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 2.15 seconds and 0-200 km/h (0-124 mph) in 5.75 seconds. Ferrari officials say that this car puts down more than a ton of downforce (1050KG). This is also Ferrari\u2019s most powerful car, making 1200 Horsepower with both electric and gas powered motors.\nProduction\nThe Ferrari F80 was revealed on October 17th, 2024.\nFerrari states that production will start in 2025 and end in 2027.

It claims that the Ryukyu people are one of the ethnic groups of the Chinese nation, supports Ryukyu independence, and asserts that the Okinawa Islands are Chinese territory.\nOverview\nAccording to an interview with Hong Kong's television station Asia Television (ATV), Zhao Dong(political activist)\u00a0, the representative of the Chinese Ryukyu Special Autonomous Region, claimed that \"Ryukyu is the territory of the Chinese nation, and the opinions of the people living there are irrelevant.\" The committee is registered in Hong Kong and has its office in Shenzhen. This is due to the active exchange between \"Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan\". On July 31, 2016, Chinese media outlet Bowen Press reported that the Hong Kong-based civil organization \"Chinese Ryukyu Special Autonomous Region\" announced plans to file a lawsuit at an international court regarding the ownership of Okinawa.\nThe committee pointed out that, according to the Cairo Declaration and Potsdam Declaration after World War II, Japan's territory is limited to Hokkaido, Shikoku, Honshu, and Kyushu, and that the Ryukyu Islands, which should be returned to China, have been occupied for an extended period with the support of the United States. Furthermore, based on the declarations mentioned above, Japan returned territories such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Pescadores Islands to China. In the surrender document, the Japanese government clearly accepted the declarations and pledged to fulfill their terms. However, the Ryukyu Islands, as stated in the proclamation, are not under Japan's sovereignty, and other smaller islands cannot be arbitrarily occupied without the agreement of the three signatory nations: China, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\nZhao Dong, referring to the South China Sea Arbitration, argued that while Japan has called on China to respect the ruling of the arbitration tribunal, Japan itself has violated the Cairo and Potsdam Declaration for years and persistently occupied territory that should be returned to China under U.S. protection. He emphasized the need to take the issue to international courts to restore Chinese territory.\nZhao Dong stated, \"As a member of the Chinese nation, we have the right and duty to protect national sovereignty and are passionate about taking concrete action to reclaim Ryukyu.\" During the height of the Japan-China debate over the Okinawa issue, Zhao Dong, chairman of the Chinese Ryukyu Special Autonomous Region, said in an interview with a Central News Agency reporter, \"The position of the Preparation Committee on the Ryukyu issue is clear. Ryukyu is a part of the Chinese nation\".\nMain Claims\nRyukyu originally belongs to China's sovereignty. In other words, Ryukyu has a subordinate relationship with the Chinese nation. No, Japan itself should realize that it was nothing more than a vassal state far below the Chinese nation. Japan has not reached the moral standards of the Chinese nation, which is why it is in its current state. Therefore, the idea is, 'Once Japan grows, we will recognize it as a directly governed administrative region of ours.' Japan, too, is part of the Chinese nation's territory (domain). Japan's position is exactly that, and Hokkaido and Ryukyu are no different in this regard\".\nWe are too caught up in superficial (international) laws\" (in response to the argument that claiming Ryukyu is Chinese territory has no basis under current international law).\nBusiness Activities\nOn April 18, 2016, Zhao Dong claimed to have stepped in as an investor during the management crisis just before the collapse of Asia Television, stating that he had funding from his electronics business in Japan.\nThe Preparatory Committee for the Special Autonomous Region of Ryukyu under the Chinese Nation has an affiliated corporation called the Ryukyu Group, which includes \"Shenzhen Ryukyu Cultural Communication Co., Ltd.,\" \"Shenzhen Shengsan Technology,\" \"Shenzhen Kenwood Investment Co., Ltd.,\" and \"Shenzhen The Story of Spring Cultural Communication Co., Ltd.\" The Ryukyu Group operates an online shopping site called \"Ryukyu Mall,\" which features mobile phone cases on its homepage and includes a message stating, \"The governments of Japan and the United States must strictly adhere to the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration\".\nConnections with Anti-Social Organizations in Taiwan and Okinawa\nZhao Dong has made contact with the Bamboo Union Taiwanese gang, as well as with Chang An-lo of the Chinese Unification Promotion Party, known for its radical political activities in Taiwan. According to an article in the Ryukyu Shimpo dated October 29, 2015, officials from the Chinese Unification Promotion Party visited Okinawa in mid-October to meet with members of the designated organized crime group, Kyokury\u016b-kai.

    "\nThe Raid on the Baksan hydroelectric power station was a militant attack that took place on July 21, 2010, in Kabardino-Balkaria, a republic in the North Caucasus region of Russia. The attack was carried out by four gunmen affiliated with the Caucasus Emirate, an Islamist militant organization active in the region.\nBackground\nThe raid on the Baksan hydroelectric power station occurred in the context of ongoing insurgency and instability in the North Caucasus region of Russia. Since the early 2000s, militant groups, particularly those aligned with the Caucasus Emirate, have carried out numerous attacks aimed at destabilizing Russian control and establishing an Islamist state in the region. Under the leadership of Asker Dzhappuyev, the Vilayat Kabardino-Balkaria-Karachay (KBK) division of the Caucasus Emirate became increasingly active, targeting key infrastructure to undermine government authority.\nThe Attack\nOn the morning of July 21, 2010, four militants associated with the Caucasus Emirate launched a coordinated assault on the Baksan hydroelectric power station in Kabardino-Balkaria. The attackers infiltrated the facility, killing two security guards and wounding 3 others who were stationed at the site. Once inside, they planted several explosive devices on the power station's machinery.\nThe explosions caused severe damage to two of the power units, leading to a temporary shutdown of the station's operations. The blast did not result in a complete power outage in the region, but it highlighted the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to militant attacks.\nPerpetrators\nThe Caucasus Emirate, a militant Islamist group operating across the North Caucasus, claimed responsibility for the attack. The group, under the leadership of Doku Umarov and his regional commanders like Asker Dzhappuyev, aimed to create an independent Islamic state governed by Sharia law in the region. This incident was part of a broader strategy by the Caucasus Emirate to target infrastructure, including energy facilities, transportation networks, and law enforcement installations.\nAftermath\nThe Russian government responded to the attack with increased security measures at strategic infrastructure sites across the North Caucasus. Authorities initiated a counter-terrorism operation to locate and neutralize those responsible for the attack. The raid on the Baksan hydroelectric power station intensified concerns over the militants\u2019 ability to disrupt critical energy supplies in the region.\nFollowing the incident, Russian officials acknowledged the need to bolster security at key facilities to prevent similar attacks in the future. The event also led to a crackdown on suspected militant sympathizers and increased surveillance in Kabardino-Balkaria and surrounding areas.\nReactions\nThe attack drew condemnation from Russian authorities and was widely reported in both domestic and international media. It was seen as a significant escalation in the tactics of the Caucasus Emirate, emphasizing their intent to target essential infrastructure as part of their insurgency campaign against the Russian state.\nSee also\nInsurgency in the North Caucasus\nCaucasus Emirate\nKabardino-Balkaria",
    "25th season of the Metropolitan Amateur Football Association\nAustralian rules football season\nThe 1920 MAFA season was the 25th season of the Metropolitan Amateur Football Association (MAFA), an Australian rules football competition played in the state of Victoria. The season began on 15 May and concluded sometime in September, comprising a 13-match home-and-away season, followed by a one-week finals series.\nElsternwick won the MAFA premiership for the first time, while Collegians finished as runners-up.\nThis was the first MAFA season to be held following World War I, which had forced the curtailing of the 1915 season and the cancellation of the 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1919 seasons.\nAssociation return\nThe 1915 season was curtailed due to the impacts of World War I, which had seen 164 MJFA players enlisted in the Australian Army by 30 July 1915.\nFollowing the early conclusion of the season, officials from the Victorian Football League (VFL) sought to have the MAFA become a reserves competition to the VFL for the 1916 season. At least two clubs \u2013 Beverley and South Yarra \u2013 reported the MAFA that they had been \"approached\" about becoming reserves teams to Richmond and St Kilda respectively. The MAFA announced in late 1915 that they would not resume competition until the war had ended, while also stating that they were not prepared to be absorbed by the VFL.\nIn 1917, the MAFA stated it had received applications from clubs to enter once the war was over, although the exact clubs that applied are unknown. Clubs already in the MAFA were advised by officials to keep in touch with their members \"so as to be in a position to appoint representatives to deal with important matters immediately the game is resumed\". Although the war ended in November 1918, the 1919 season was also cancelled.\nOn 22 March 1920, the MAFA decided at a meeting to resume competition.\nAssociation membership\nFour clubs that had competed in the 1915 season (Collegians, Elsternwick, South Yarra and University) remained in the MAFA, while another four clubs entered the competition for the first time in 1920. The Beverley Football Club did not return to the MAFA, although it still existed and was likely in recess at the time.\nCarlton District, Caulfield, Collingwood District, Leopold amd University moved to the newly-formed Victorian Junior Football League (VJFL) in 1919, although Caulfield withdrew prior to the start of the season. Caulfield then attempted to rejoin the MAFA, but their application was refused as the club's reputation was seen as \"intolerable\" prior to the war.

The newly-formed Teachers College Football Club, Old Caulfield Grammarians Football Club and Old Melburnians Football Club also entered teams.\nHome-and-away season\nRound 1\nRound 2\nRound 3\nLadder\nSource:  (P) Premiers\nFinals\nIt appears that no finals series was held in 1920, although the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA, formerly MAFA) claims a grand final did take place. When announcing the competition would resume, the MAFA stated that \"there will be no semi-final or final matches\".\nThe 1920 home-and-away season concluded on 23 August, a date on which only saw two games were played. The Herald wrote on 27 August that \"notice of motion has been given that finals be played in this association's competition,\" adding that \"the proposal will be considered at the next meeting of the association\". However, at that meeting (held between 31 August and 3 September), it was reported that the MJFA \"had completed this season's programme\". While no contemporary sources indicate semi-finals or a grand final were held in 1920, the VAFA states that Elsternwick defeated Collegians by 31 points in a grand final, winning 11.1 (67) to 5.6 (36).\nAt the time, the MAFA used the Argus finals system, which gave the club that finished first on the ladder at the end of the home-and-away season (the minor premiers) the right to challenge the winner of the finals series for the premiership. Ordinarily, this would mean that first-placed Elsternwick would play fourth-placed Old Melburnians, and second-placed Collegians would play third-placed Old Caulfield Grammarians, with the winners of the semi-finals playing in a grand final. However, it appears the 1920 season used the pre-1909 method of the premiers being decided based on the best overall record for the season.\nNotable events\nThe MAFA joined the Amateur Sporting Federation, which saw the competition recognised as the \"senior authority in amateur football\".\nJ.V. Deane was unable to continue as the MAFA secretary, and was replaced by S. Hughes.\nA representative match requested by the Melbourne District Football Association (MDFA) was not agreed to by the MAFA, and did not go ahead.",

    "\nHistoric site in Queensland, Australia\nMaryborough Baby Clinic is a heritage-listed former health clinic at 445 Kent Street, Maryborough, Fraser Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Queensland Works Department and built in 1924. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 December 2020.\nHistory\nThe former Maryborough Baby Clinic was built in 1924, and is situated on the prominent corner of Kent and Lennox streets, opposite the Maryborough City Hall. Following the introduction of the Maternity Act 1922, which was part of a movement to improve the health of mothers and babies, the clinic was one of ten regional clinics built by the Queensland Government throughout the state in the early 1920s. Constructed to a standard, high-quality design by the Department of Public Works, the Maryborough Baby Clinic remains highly intact. The clinic served the Maryborough community until its closure in the mid-1990s.\nMaryborough is a regional centre 215 kilometres (134\u00a0mi) north of Brisbane, and forms part of the traditional land of the Butchulla (Badjala) people. The original township of Maryborough was situated further west upstream on the Mary River, after wharves were established there in 1847\u20138, to provide transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1852, the growing town was gradually relocated further downstream where ships were able to better navigate the river. Development followed, and by March 1861 Maryborough was declared a municipality. During the late 1860s and 1870s, Maryborough developed rapidly as the port for the nearby gold rushes in the Gympie area. By the 1920s, Maryborough had a population of more than 10,000 people and was a major regional centre.\nIn the mid-19th century, deaths of children under five comprised 50 percent of all deaths. While this had been reduced to 11 per cent by the turn of the century, this was still too high. Dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera, diphtheria and typhoid were the main causes of death in the late 19th century. Mrs Mary McConnel, formerly of Cressbrook Station in the Brisbane Valley, initiated the establishment of the first children's hospital in 1878 in Brisbane, the second such hospital in Australia. The first resident medical officer for the Brisbane Children's Hospital, Dr Alfred Jefferis Turner, was appointed in 1889. Turner's early work was in the eradication of diphtheria. Through his collaboration with Brisbane doctor LN Ashworth, their use of the antitoxin led to a significant drop in the death rate from diphtheria between January 1895 and November 1896. Other significant medical advances made by Brisbane-based doctors include the identification of hookworm as the cause of filariasis, the introduction of a test to identify typhoid and the identification of lead in paint as a significant factor in lead poisoning of children, an issue which required a long public campaign to reduce the lead content in paint.\nDespite these advances, infant mortality still remained high, being 10.68 per cent of all deaths in 1892 and 10.91 per cent in 1901. Diarrhoeal disease was still a major factor and there was a higher death rate during the summer months, many of which could be attributed to poor infant feeding. Dr Turner embarked on another public health campaign, in educating mothers in the hygienic preparation of food, particularly for those infants not breast fed.\nThe early 1920s heralded a major public health campaign by the Queensland Government following the introduction of the Maternity Act 1922. As part of a national and international movement to improve the health of mothers and babies, baby clinics were established throughout Queensland. Under the stewardship of the Department of Public Works (DPW), a standard design for the Queensland regional baby clinic was produced. Based on this plan, ten regional clinics were built. These included Rockhampton, Townsville (demolished), Ipswich, Toowoomba, Bundaberg, Gympie, Mackay, Charters Towers, Warwick and Maryborough. A baby clinic was established in Cairns at this time, but it was not of the standard design and is no longer extant.The Rockhampton clinic was the first to be opened on Saturday 27 October 1923. It was described in the 1924 DPW Report:\"A compact tile-roofed one-storey reinforced cement plaster building of attractive design, containing waiting hall 16 ft by 16 ft; a doctor's room 12 ft by 11 ft; treatment room 13 ft by 11 ft; retiring and nurse's rooms 11ft by 10 ft with water closet, lavatories, store, press etc. Modern fittings and furnishings have been installed throughout and a septic system provided for conveniences.\"Specifications for the Rockhampton Clinic are indicative of those used for the standardised designed clinics. They were domestic in scale, included Classical architectural treatments to the street-fronting elevations and included interior treatments that were hygienic and easily cleaned. Generally, the foundations were altered to suit individual si",

    "New Zealand industrial designer\nPeter Frank Haythornthwaite ONZM DSc LifeDINZ FIDSA (1944 \u2013 ) is a New Zealand designer whose consultant practice, entrepreneurial initiatives, contributions to design education, and professional leadership has achieved recognition on many levels. One entrepreneurial project became a 1988 best seller at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) shop, and a 2008 design was the first New Zealand product to be selected for the MoMA Permanent Collection.\nEarly life\nPeter Haythornthwaite was born in 1944 to William \"Bill\" Haythornthwaite (1913\u20132009) and Ann Haythornthwaite (n\u00e9e Pilkington) in Auckland, New Zealand. Bill's advertising agency, W. Haythorn-Thwaite Limited (hyphenated to assist pronunciation), established in 1946, was among the first New Zealand design studios to have work included in international journals such as Modern Publicity, Novum Gebrauchsgraphik and Graphis. Along with access to international design magazines, strong influences on Peter included Bill's model of design-led quality, creative tenacity, and his learned-from-experience mantra: \"If there is no way, make a way\".:\u200a16\u201318\u200a\nPeter Haythornthwaite's direct experience of the wider world began in 1953 when the family set off for London so Bill could research the application of the new medium of television to advertising. The return voyage through France, Switzerland and Italy laid the groundwork for the global perspective and international standards that characterised his career.:\u200a19\u201320\u200a\nAround 1958, W. Haythorn-Thwaite Limited's client Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL) placed an order for Lockheed aircraft and sent consultants from the Henry Dreyfuss New York design office to Auckland to discuss the interior fitout. When the Haythornthwaites hosted the visitors to dinner, the shy 14-year-old Peter was persuaded to show the gentlemen his drawings of cars. Receiving a pat on the back and some \"Keep at it, kid!\" encouragement probably initiated the aspiration that surfaced some years later\u2014to one-day work at the Dreyfuss office.:\u200a18\u200a\nEducation\nPeter Haythornthwaite arrived at the University of Auckland's Elam School of Fine Arts in 1962 with an open-minded approach to developing his creativity. Awareness of the state local industrial design output came in 1963 when he assisted in mounting a Design in New Zealand exhibition at the school organised by the New Zealand Society of Industrial Designers (NZSID). But it was a second-year project\u2014to design a \"sound object\"\u2014that drove his future direction. Experienced as a profound \"this is what you were made for\" epiphany, Haythornthwaite discovered that holistically confronting multi-layered functional and aesthetic requirements with complete trust in the design process, could allow his \"intuition\" to deliver a coherent conceptual breakthrough. Immersion in the global history and current practice of design leaders came through regular visits to the Elam library.:\u200a18,\u200a26\u200a\nProfessor Edward J. Zagorski, head of the industrial design program at the University of Illinois, arrived with a growing reputation as inspiring educator when he spent a sabbatical year lecturing at Elam as a 1965 Fulbright Fellow. When Zagorski in retirement visited New Zealand 35 years later, Haythornthwaite recalled his impact:\nWe experienced a whirlwind of energy and enthusiasm. Ed had the rare ability to inspire students with raw talent to take giant leaps\u2014way beyond their original vision. ... He gave me a new sense of what design could be.:\u200a57\u200a\nAfter graduating from the Elam School of Fine Arts with a DipFA Hons (Design), Haythornthwaite took up Zagorski's suggestion and continued his studies at the University of Illinois. He took his qualification to Bachelor level, then spent two years undertaking the Master's program. His thesis project, an under-water propulsion unit, expanded his active interest in scuba diving and led to his first post-graduate job.:\u200a28\u201330\u200a\nWorking life\nJoining the AMF Voit sporting goods division in California from early 1969 aligned with Haythornthwaite's interest in water sports. Although employed as an engineer, Peter set out to demonstrate the industrial designer's approach: \"I wanted to fully investigate the physical and emotional relationship of a product to its user as well as creating elegant form and functionality.\":\u200a34\u200a When financial pressure forced AMF Voit to downsize, Haythornthwaite joined Eldon Industries Inc. His experience designing office stationery products was to become useful over a decade later when he established his entrepreneurial \u00e4r\u2019ti-fakt-s enterprise.:\u200a34\u201335\u200a\nHaythornthwaite's ambition to work with Henry Dreyfuss Associates (HDA) in New York City was realised in 1970. Although Henry Dreyfuss had retired, the commitment to human factors was progressing through the leadership of Niels Diffrient, Haythornthwaite's supervising partner. A Diffrient dictum that made a lasting impression was, \"For heaven\u2019s sake, don't start doing any design work, even s",

The rulers of El Cayo had a hierarchy under the rank of Sajal, a title given to a nobleman subordinated to the ruler of a bigger capital, in this case, El Cayo was a vassal of Piedras Negras.\nEl Cayo Altar 4 has a Mesoamerican long count inscription of 9.11.12.1.3 13 Ak'bal 11 Yax, which is equivalent to September 1, 664 AD and is indicated as the birth date of a sajal from El Cayo named Aj Chak Wayab' K'utim. The Altar illustrates the image of Aj Chak Wayab' K'utim sitting in front of a censer performing an end-of-cycle ceremony on the long count date of 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ajaw 13 Yax, which corresponds to August 18, 731 AD.\nLintel from El Cayo\nEl Cayo lintel 1 records some political topics related to the site, first it records the birth date of a nobleman named Chan Panak\u2019 Wayib\u2019 recorded in the Mesoamerican long count of 9.16.0.2.16 6 Kib\u2019 9 Mol corresponding to June 30, 751 AD. Then it narrates that on April 18, 763, a ruler of Piedras Negras participated in the ceremony of ascension to power of Chan Panak' Wayib\u00a0for his future succession to the tilte of sajal. After this, it is recorded that years later Aj Sak Maax, a ruler of Sak Tz'i, encommended another sajal named Aj Chak Suutz' K'utiim, this would imply that at some point Piedras Negras had lost its power and domain over El Cayo and it was already under the domain of Sak Tz'i.\nThe site was discovered and first documented in 1897 by Teobert Maler during an expedition on the Usumacinta region where he recorded the presence of several monuments and a ruined main palace. In 1997, a group of archaeologists including Peter Mathews, tried to extract Altar 4 to take it to a museum but they were attacked and kidnapped by local indigenous people accusing them of being looters, after some days they were found in the middle of the jungle, this incident ended every archaeological research and cancelled any further investigations in the site until today.\nRulers of El Cayo\nAj Chak Wayab' K'utim\nChan Panak' Wayib\nAj Chak Suutz' K'utiim",
    "\nEleanor D. Brown is a clinical psychologist and an academic. She is a professor of psychology at West Chester University (WCU), where she directs the Early Childhood Cognition and Emotions Lab (ECCEL) and co-directs the Research on Equity via the Arts in Childhood (REACH) Lab.\nBrown is most known for her research on children experiencing stress and trauma related to poverty and racism, as well as on arts-based interventions. Her work has emphasized the diversity among families facing adversity and identified ways to leverage family and community strengths to support children's well-being. She has collaborated with community partners, including Settlement Music School, to explore how music and the arts can promote equity.\nEducation and early career\nBrown received her B.A. in Psychology with a Concentration in Education from Haverford College in May 2000. She completed her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology with a specialization in Child Development and Children Facing Risk at the University of Delaware in August 2005.\nBrown began her career in clinical work as a Child and Family Therapist at the Family Support Network at WCU and later as a Cognitive Therapist at the Center for Cognitive Therapy at UPenn. Since 2006, she has worked as an Early Childhood Consultant and Child and Family Therapist at ECCEL.\nCareer\nBrown became a research fellow and later a consultant for Ronald Seifer's Early Childhood Research Center at Brown University Medical School (2004\u20132010). She has been the director of the ECCEL at WCU since 2005, and the co-director of REACH since 2020.\nBrown joined WCU as an assistant professor in 2005, became an associate professor in 2010, and has been a full professor since 2015. From 2006 to 2012, she was the president of the Faculty Senate. She co-founded and facilitated the WCU CARES (Campus Allies Regarding Emotions of Students) program from 2008 to 2012.\nBrown was co-president of the Philadelphia Chapter of the Association for Psychology of Women from 2011 to 2021, and served on the Arts and Pre-K Advisory Committee for the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance (2016\u20132019).\nResearch\nBrown has studied children's development, poverty, racism, marginalized groups, and models of change, focusing on Head Start, arts, mindfulness, and anti-racism training. She partnered with Settlement Music School's Kaleidoscope Arts Enrichment Preschool, leading a series of studies on the impact of the arts, with her research on arts and cortisol in economically disadvantaged children funded by the NEA Art Works Research grants program. In 2010, her findings showed that children in arts classes achieved significantly higher gains in receptive vocabulary\u2014a key predictor of school success\u2014compared to peers at a nearby preschool. Subsequent research in 2013 revealed that Kaleidoscope students experienced 60% more positive emotions during arts activities than those in traditional classrooms, along with improved emotional regulation. In 2017, participation in arts classes was linked to reduced cortisol levels in economically disadvantaged children, indicating lower stress. Furthermore, in 2018, her work confirmed that Kaleidoscope students demonstrated greater school readiness than those in a non-arts-integrated Head Start program, underscoring the potential of arts integration to enhance educational opportunities for disadvantaged children.\nBrown's investigation found that daily poverty-related stress is associated with negative parent mood, varying with the presence of a stable partner, underscoring the importance of social support in low-income families. Another study linked this stress to parental coping strategies and learned helplessness in young children attending Head Start, highlighting how parental coping can mitigate the negative developmental impacts of poverty. Her research has indicated that elevated cortisol levels during preschool are related to executive functioning difficulties in children facing poverty-related stress, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions. Another study suggested that more playtime and sleep time are linked to lower stress levels for children attending Head Start preschool, suggesting ways parents; may promote their children's well-being.\nHer work on the relationship between emotional intelligence and stress regulation in preschoolers demonstrated that improving emotional knowledge could help lower stress hormone levels. She also examined the role of arts education in fostering emotional growth, reducing stress, and enhancing social skills, particularly for children facing economic hardship.\nBrown's research has been featured in media outlets such as Pacific Standard, ScienceDaily, and PsyPost.\nSelected articles\nBrown, E.

    "\nThe Consensus Development Program is an initiative focused on gathering expert opinions to establish standards and guidelines in various fields, especially in health and medicine. Developed as a collaborative effort by organizations such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the program assembles panels of specialists who assess available evidence on critical topics and form recommendations to guide clinical practice and policy. This method helps ensure that healthcare decisions are informed by the latest scientific research and expert consensus.\nObjectives\nThe primary objective of the Consensus Development Program is to provide authoritative guidance on healthcare practices by evaluating scientific data and expert knowledge. The program covers a broad range of topics, including cancer treatments, diagnostic methods, and preventive strategies. By facilitating a structured discussion among experts, the program aims to bridge gaps in knowledge, encourage research, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.\nProcess\nThe program typically follows a systematic process, beginning with the selection of a topic that requires consensus. This is followed by a thorough review of existing literature and data, with the assistance of resources such as PubMed and the National Library of Medicine (NLM). Expert panels then deliberate in workshops and public sessions, where they discuss findings and draft recommendations. The final step involves disseminating the panel's conclusions to stakeholders, including healthcare providers, policymakers, and the public.\nImpact on Cancer Treatment\nThe Consensus Development Program has had a significant influence on cancer care, offering evidence-based recommendations that shape screening guidelines, treatment protocols, and patient care strategies. The program addresses issues such as the benefits and risks of specific treatments, the development of new diagnostic tools, and the ethical considerations in cancer care. The comprehensive approach ensures that recommendations are based on a balanced view of risks and benefits.\n",

After graduation, he was assigned to an aviation unit. He retired from the military in 1991, worked for several companies, and in 2009, established the private organization \"Okinawa Strategy Headquarters\".\nAs a journalist, Nakamura focuses on topics related to Okinawan politics, international relations, criticism of the Ryukyu independence movement, U.S.-Japan relations, security issues, and China. He has also written and contributed to articles on North Korea's abduction issue.\nHe has delivered lectures at the Seiji Nichi Forum\u00a0 as well.\nViews on the Ryukyu Independence Movement\nNakamura is critical of the Ryukyu independence movement. He also believes that this Ryukyu independence movement is led by Governor Takeshi Onaga, who was supported by the \"All Okinawa\u00a0\" coalition, and the activists promoting it. When Onaga delivered a speech at the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2015, referring to the people of Okinawa based on the \"indigenous peoples\" argument, Nakamura, together with Okinawan Prefectural Assemblyman Moriyuki Teruya\u00a0, criticized him at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, stating, \"The people of Okinawa are Japanese citizens. The governor has damaged their pride\".\nOn New Year's Day 2018, Daisuke Muramoto\u00a0\" (from the comedy duo man Rush Hour\u00a0) appeared on TV Asahi\u2019s program Asa Made Nama TV and made comments like \"Okinawa was originally taken from China, wasn\u2019t it?\" In response, Nakamura said, \"It\u2019s 100 times more admirable to show interest in Okinawa\u2019s issues and history,\" and presented Muramoto with a speech by Ch\u014dby\u014d Yara.\nNakamura pointed out that Chinese support for the Ryukyu independence movement has existed since around 2012, referring to Robert Kajiwara, a fourth-generation Okinawan living in Hawaii, who conducted a petition campaign through \"WE the PEOPLE\" to stop the Henoko construction. Kajiwara stated at the United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2019 that \"Japan used the Battle of Okinawa to cover up a mass slaughter of Ryukyuans,\" which Nakamura attributed to Chinese influence.\nRegarding the relationship between China and the Ryukyu independence movement, Nakamura mentioned Chinese scholar Tang Chunfeng, who supports Ryukyu independence, as well as the Chinese Ryukyu Special Autonomous Region, which claims Okinawa as Chinese territory.\nNakamura also argued that Chinese universities and think tanks engage in academic exchanges with Okinawan independence groups, and Chinese media repeatedly question Japan's sovereignty over Okinawa. He claimed that the Ryukyu independence movement, anti-U.S. base protests, opposition to constitutional revision (Article 9), and left-wing peace activists are united, with support from China.\nSee also\nToday Hong Kong, Tomorrow Taiwan, Day After Tomorrow Okinawa\nMap of National Shame",

Writing for Softpedia, Andrei Dumitrescu praised the \"ambitious\" graphics and the importance of the game's narrative in drawing attenton to Carson's work, but felt it did not \"fully work as a video game\" due to anachronisms in its narrative and platforming elements that did not make sense in the context of the game. Edwin Evans-Thirlwell for The Guardian considered the game to feel \"forced\" in its message and feature \"dissatisfying\" voice acting, although finding the \"shock and dislocation\" of its themes to have merit as a horror game. Describing the game as \"disjointed, unfocused and maddening\", Brandon Chinn of SUPERJUMP considered the game's puzzles to be \"alarmingly frustrating\" and aspects of the narrative to be \"starkly off-putting\" and \"antagonistic to the player.\nAccolades\nThe Forest Cathedral was nominated for a Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival in 2024.\n",

    "1994 studio album by Black 47\nHome of the Brave is an album by the American band Black 47, released in 1994. The band supported the album with a North American tour and an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The first single was \"Losin' It\".\nProduction\nThe album was produced by frontman Larry Kirwan and Jerry Harrison. Harrison was on a list of names provided by Black 47's record label; the band appreciated his relaxed production style. Kirwan wrote 15 of the album's 16 songs, taking the same character-driven approach that he employed in his play writing. He considered many of his songs to be autobiographical or political. \"Who Killed Bobby Fuller?\" concerns a man trying to solve Bobby Fuller's murder, in order to impress a woman. \"The Big Fellah\" is about the Irish revolutionary Michael Collins. \"Oh Maureen\" describes Kirwan's love for a woman who is married. Winds musician Chris Byrne rapped on \"Time to Go\", about political conflict in Ireland, and a response to criticism the band had received from British periodicals. \"Black Rose\" details an infatuation for the companion of a friend who is in prison. \"Danny Boy\" is about a gay Irish immigrant who lands a construction job in Queens. An unlisted 17th track closes the album.\nCritical reception\nThe Boston Globe stated that \"songs spiced with tin whistles and pipes abut cuts with driving drums and raging guitars... It's a sound that ranges from jubilant to mournful\". The Philadelphia Inquirer called the album \"another glorious blast of Celtic-flavored rock and roll, with dollops of rap and reggae.\" The Washington Post opined that \"Black's sound is so gimmicky: Celtic-rock given an arena-metal swagger and embroidered with Latin, reggae and hip-hop elements designed to reflect the group's Lower East Side residence.\" Robert Christgau panned Kirwan's vocals, labeling them \"soul-as-melodrama rockism with a brogue.\"\nTrouser Press dismissed the album as a \"wan imitation of the R&B phase of Dexy's Midnight Runners\". The Chicago Tribune concluded that \"Kirwan's running commentaries on the Irish immigrant's adjustment to American life fare well from his playwright's sense of dialogue.\" The Knoxville News Sentinel said that Home of the Brave \"goes on entirely too long ... retracing its steps and sounding the same notes.\" Buddy Seigal, of the Los Angeles Times, listed Home of the Brave as the second best album of 1994.

    "\nHistoric site in Queensland, Australia\nMackay Memorial Swimming Centre is a heritage-listed war memorial and swimming pool at 2 Milton Street, Mackay, Mackay Region, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Russell Gibbins and built in 1963. It is also known as Mackay War Memorial swimming pool. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 June 2020.\nHistory\nThe Mackay Memorial Swimming Centre opened in December 1963 as a \"living memorial\", a war memorial which combines remembrance with community amenity. It honours all those from the Mackay district who lost their lives fighting in World War I or World War II. This public asset was constructed with an Olympic-sized 50-metre (160\u00a0ft) pool, children's wading pool, an entrance building, and a plant building, set in generous landscaped grounds. A war memorial mural made of Italian glass mosaic tiles is set into the front wall of the entrance building. The place has a strong and ongoing community association, and is important in demonstrating the historic pattern of war memorial swimming pool construction which peaked in Queensland during the 1950s-60s.\nMackay, part of the traditional land of the Yuwibara people, was surveyed in 1863 and developed as the centre of a major sugarcane-growing area. Following the devastating cyclone of January 1918, Mackay enjoyed a period of substantial growth. In 1938, the Forgan Bridge replaced an 1880s bridge across the Pioneer River, and in 1939, the new Port of Mackay was opened. Queensland's first bulk sugar handling terminal opened at this harbour in 1957.\nDespite its growth and prosperity, the citizens of Mackay waited until the 1960s for a public swimming pool. Earlier proposals, either for swimming enclosures in the Pioneer River or baths on land, were made from at least 1879, but none came to fruition. A local boat builder offered to construct public baths upon the river bank. Other proposals included salt water baths at the corner of Victoria and Carlyle streets (c.1909), and a river pool (enclosed with war surplus torpedo netting), just upstream of the north end of the Sydney Street Bridge (1924). The demand for a public swimming facility was driven by a desire to escape the summer heat (while avoiding crocodiles and sharks), safely teach children to swim, and to attract tourists. One option utilised by keen local swimmers was a swimming hole on the north side of the river between the river wall and Cremorne. IT was an old swimming hole, located in the river downstream from the north end of the Forgan Bridge and previously silted up, but had been scoured out again by floods.\nSea bathing was popular in Western culture from the late 18th century, for health and hygiene reasons. Competitive swimming also developed during the 19th century, and increased in popularity in the early 20th century. In 1896 swimming was included in the modern Olympic Games (men only, until 1912), and in 1908 the Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA) was formed to standardise the rules for swimming, diving and water polo and ensure the direction of Olympic Games competitions for those sports. Swimming was given further impetus by the 1924 Olympic Games held in Paris, where  an 8-lane pool measuring 50 metres in length by 20 metres in width was specially constructed at Tourelles for swimming events This set the 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) Olympic standard for pool length.\nIn Queensland, swimming for health, recreation and sport has a long history. In 1849, a bathing house (for private subscribers) was erected in the Brisbane River at \"the Government Garden\" in 1849. In 1857, a floating timber bath was moored to the bank of the Brisbane River at South Brisbane (almost opposite the end of Queen Street); it was 75 by 24 feet (22.9 by 7.3\u00a0m). In 1886, the Spring Hill Municipal Baths opened as the first in-ground public baths in Brisbane. In 1910, the first state school swimming pool in Queensland was opened at Junction Park State School in Brisbane. Brisbane's Fortitude Valley Baths, on the site of the earlier Booroodabin Baths (1901), were rebuilt in 1925\u201326 to the Olympic standard length, and subsequently replaced in 1985. The Dalby Olympic swimming pool opened in Dalby in 1936 and was Queensland's first 50-metre (160\u00a0ft) pool outside Brisbane. Australia's gold medals in swimming at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics increased interest in the sport, and in the construction of 50-metre (160\u00a0ft) swimming pools.\nMackay also sought an Olympic-sized pool. In late 1944, the Mackay City Council (MCC) employed architect Dr Karl Langer to design a town plan, and his May 1945 plan included a swimming pool near the centre of Mackay, as well as swimming pools in several of the six neighbourhoods he envisaged.  The central swimming pool was planned on the block north of Alfred Street, between Gregory and Wood Streets. A neighbourhood planned for west of Milton Street and north of Shakespeare Street was also to include a pool just northeast of the Mackay Gene",
    "Archaeological site in Mainamati, Comilla, Bangladesh\nThe Kutila Mura (Bengali: \u0995\u09c1\u099f\u09bf\u09b2\u09be \u09ae\u09c1\u09a1\u09bc\u09be)  is an archaeological site located in Mainamati, Comilla, Bangladesh. It is one of the most significant Buddhist sites in the region, renowned for its well-preserved stupas and historical importance.\nHistory\nKutila Mura is situated on the highest mound in the northeastern part of the Lalmai ridge, near the ancient site of Ananda Vihara. Excavations at the site suggest that the earliest structures date back to the 7th century, with the most recent constructions possibly dating to the 13th century. This is supported by the discovery of an Abbasid gold coin, found in the upper layers during excavation. Additionally, five ancient inscriptions found in the Mainamati area reference two Ratna-traya shrines in the nearby city of Devaparvata, and it is inferred that Kutila Mura may have been one of these shrines.\nArchitecture\nKutila Mura is known for its unique architectural design, differing significantly from other nearby sites such as Shalvan Vihara. While sites like Shalvan Vihara showcase a more evolved architectural style, Kutila Mura maintains a traditional design.\nThe site features three main stupas, which are aligned in a north\u2013south direction. These stupas are believed to symbolize the 'three jewels' of Buddhism (Tri-ratna): Buddha (knowledge), Dharma (morality), and Sanggha (discipline). The foundation of the central stupa is laid out in the shape of a Dharmachakra, with a deep central shaft surrounded by eight box chambers. These chambers housed numerous votive stupas made of terracotta and clay, as well as sealings and large pieces of fine Buddhist sculptures made from soft grey shale. The foundations of the other two stupas contained similar relics, though without the sculptures.\nCultural Significance\nKutila Mura's alignment with the three jewels of Buddhism and its rich collection of religious relics point to its importance as a Buddhist sacred site. The site's religious symbolism and architectural complexity highlight the depth of Buddhist culture in the region during the period between the 7th and 13th centuries.\nInformation Plaque\nSee also\nSomapura Mahavihara\nBikrampur Vihara\nKantajew Temple\nMainamati\nPandit Vihara\nSixty Dome Mosque\nLalbagh Fort\nList of archaeological sites in Bangladesh",

It is based on the tragedy Romeo and Juliet, written by William Shakespeare.\nPlot\nThe plot takes place in a neighborhood called Castanheiras, where two families with different proposals for the neighborhood live in discord, divided between the Torre (Monteiro) and Vila (Campos) sides. However, Romeu (Miguel \u00c2ngelo) and Julieta (Vitt\u00f3ria Seixas) meet, and from then on, the rival families have a new opportunity to bring peace and unity between them.\nWell known in the neighborhood, Julieta Campos is an adventurous and cool girl who skateboards around the area. She is the granddaughter of the respected H\u00e9lio Campos (Luiz Guilherme), a renowned coach who runs the region's sports center, CEC. She also lives with her grandmother and confidant, Clara Campos (Lu Grimaldi). Meanwhile, Romeu Monteiro has been encouraged by his parents, Vera Monteiro (Bianca Rinaldi) and Bernardo Monteiro (F\u00e1bio Ventura), since he was little to play tennis and has the best teacher to give him lessons in the condominium. But he does not have the same passion for solitary sports and ends up preferring collective ones, where he can play and have fun with friends. Romeu also lives with Gl\u00e1ucia Monteiro (Karin Hils), his aunt and Bernardo's sister, a woman of dubious origin who uses her tricks to achieve some prestige.\nTwelve years ago, due to a mistake, Julieta's mother was unjustly arrested thanks to the Monteiros, who believe that she kidnapped Romeo when he was still a baby, in addition to being accused of stealing a jewel from Vera, who was with Gl\u00e1ucia. When they discover the problem from the past, Romeo and Juliet do not know how they will manage to stay together in the face of the rivalry between the families. News of the romance also reaches the families, who do not like the story at all and try to separate them immediately, causing various situations. Romeu and Julieta want to put an end to this hostility and try to find a solution. However, when they discover more situations involving the rivalry between the families, they realize that this may be a difficult mission, but not impossible.\nAmong the parallel plots, there is a similar little group, which is composed of Ian (Miguel Soares), a boy who usually uses his imagination a lot and lives with Leon (Matheus Ueta), his imaginary best friend who wears a lion costume and is only seen by Ian, who is also considered \"crazy\" by other characters, Nath (Arlyane Carvalho), a nice girl who, together with Ellen (Bella Alelaf), her best friend, try to find a place to play and Dimitri (Samuel Estevam), a boy who is not afraid of anything and likes to help people, facing the Pedalzeiras, a group of cyclists composed of Muke (Gabriel Miller), Trapa\u00e7a (Zaira Harue), F\u00ea Dengosa (Antonella Dez) and Chilique (Miguel Trajano), whose objective is to dominate the park by inserting their stickers on the toys to ride bicycles and threatening anyone who crosses their territory, prohibiting the children of Castanheiras from having fun.  Dimitri was initially a member of the group, leaving it after thinking better about his actions and joining Ian, Nath and Ellen, forming a group called Extraordinaries. The Extraordinaries often enter the World of Imagination, where they complete the Golden Path of the Seven Missions and enter the Great Door, behind this door, there is a bookshelf, where Faustinho must return five books.\nCast\nSpecial appearances\nProduction\nThe plot is an adaptation of the original work by William Shakespeare, but without the main tragedy of the story.

    "Cadastral territory of Brno in South Moravian Region, Czech Republic\nPis\u00e1rky (German: Schreibwald, Hantec: \u0160rajbec) is a cadastral territory in Brno, Czech Republic, west of the historical center. It has an area of 4.67 km\u00b2. The majority of the territory of modern Pis\u00e1rky was annexed to Brno in 1850. Since November 24, 1990, Pis\u00e1rky has been divided between the city districts of Brno-st\u0159ed (most of the area), Brno-Kohoutovice (western part) and Brno-Jundrov (a small part in the northwest) . About 2,600 people live here.\nHistory\nUntil the 18th century, the area of today's Pis\u00e1rky was almost devoid of buildings, which until the construction of houses in Hlinky Street consisted originally only of the defunct Kamenn\u00fd ml\u00fdn, which was first mentioned in 1366.\nBefore 1815, the empire-style Bauer mansion was built in the southwestern part of the area of the later Brno Exhibition Centre. Sugar factory buildings were soon built near it, demolished in 1954. In 1850, the parts of modern Pis\u00e1rky, which then belonged to the cadastral territory of Star\u00e9 Brno, were annexed to Brno. In 1892, a small part of Pis\u00e1rky, including the house at Pis\u00e1reck\u00e1 4 and the vicinity of the adjacent intersection, was added to Brno from Jundrov. In the seventies of the 18th century, the construction of villas began in Vesla\u0159sk\u00e1 street, then belonging to Jundrov, which culminated here in the eighties of the 18th century. Since the eighties of the 19th century, the central and western part of Hlinky Street has also seen the development of residential housing, which has existed in almost its current form since 1909. In those years, the Hecht villa, which today houses the Consulate General of the Russian Federation, was also on display on this street. In 1919, the rest of the Pis\u00e1rky cadastral territory was added to Brno.\nIn the years 1926\u20131928, the world-famous Brno Exhibition Centre was built in the west of the Pisareck\u00e1 floodplain near the Bauer mansion, which was heavily damaged during World War II and restored in 1949\u20131950. In the years 1955\u20131959, the area of the exhibition center was increased from the original 26 hectares to 54 hectares.\nAs an independent cadastral territory, Pis\u00e1rky only emerged during the second cadastral reform of Brno at the end of the sixties of the 20th century. In 1990, their territory was divided between the modern city districts of Brno-Kohoutovice and Brno-st\u0159ed. On September 1, 1995, based on an agreement with the city district of Brno-Kohoutovice signed on August 25, 1995, the city district of Brno-Jundrov acquired a small part of Pis\u00e1rky in exchange for a small part of the cadastral territory of Jundrov. On February 12, 2014, a minor change in the border between Pis\u00e1rky and Bohunice took effect, and at the same time a change in the border of Brno-Bohunice and Brno-st\u0159ed in Vinohrady Street, when they moved from Bohunice to Pis\u00e1rky (and thus to Brno-st\u0159ed) plots with new numbers 2334, 2335, 2336 and 2337, having a total area of 42 m\u00b2. Until the sixties of the 20th century, these plots of land newly attached to Pis\u00e1rky belonged to the Star\u00e9 Brno a V\u00edde\u0148ka cadastral territory. Currently, the implementation of the Pis\u00e1rky sports-recreational area, which should be located behind the Anthropos Pavilion, is being considered. Its authors are architects from the Brno architectural office A PLUS, who, among other things, are behind the design of the Bohunice University Campus.\nDescription\nIn the western part of Pis\u00e1rky, there is a forest, formerly known as \"Pis\u00e1rky\", after which the cadastral territory is named. Since 1928, a significant part of the cadastral territory Pis\u00e1rky has belonged to the area of the international Brno Exhibition Centre. The Svratka river flows through Pis\u00e1rky, on the right bank of which there is a wooded slope with a bicycle path passing by the Anthropos Pavilion. The district is also home to the Riviera recreation area and swimming pool, the Holiday Inn hotel, the Consulate General of the Republic of Lithuania, and there is also one of the two tram depots, the Pis\u00e1rky depot, which also houses the Brno public transport company. There are a number of villas on the north side of Hlinky Street and Vesla\u0159sk\u00e1 Street. There are a number of family houses in Libu\u0161ino \u00fadol\u00ed Street.\nTerritorial divisions\nThe cadastral territory of Pis\u00e1rky is further divided into 10 basic settlement units.\nDemographics\nAs of the 2021 census, the population is 2,606, down 1% from 2,641 in the 2011 census.

    "Yonino Channel is a unit headed by Arashi's Kazunari Ninomiya in the form of a YouTube channel, run together with KAT-TUN's Yuichi Nakamaru, Hey! Say! JUMP's Ryosuke Yamada and Timelesz's Fuma Kikuchi, that started in April 2021.\nOverview\nChannel's (anonymous) start\nOn April 8, 2021, a new channel with no identified owner opened, with a video with the title \" An Important Notice from an Entertainment Agency\", containing images of Earth from a satellite point of view, to images of Tokyo, to a silhouette of who would be later identified as Ninomiya, with a message of the opening of a new official channel and the dropping of the official first video on the 25th. A second video appeared about one week later, revealing a bit more of what was coming, with 3 new silhouettes more this time. Days later, a third video was released, with the logo \"Yuichi's Film\" opening the drone-like fly-by shots that led to a collage of silhouettes of the 4 people who would appear.\nNinomiya's appeal for subscription and the reveal of the first member\nThe day before the official opening, Ninomiya appeared inviting all to follow the new channel. By the 26th, the channel, still unnamed, had reached 2.7 million views and had gathered 1 million subscribers. In this video, Ninomiya hinted at who could be his first companion.\nJyanino's other members and braking records\nDays later, with videos having revealed the identity of the other 3 members (first, Nakamaru, second, Kikuchi, and third, Yamada), the channel reached 2 million followers. The four released a video thanking fans and followers alike for helping the channel reach the number. The now-called Jyanino Channel (\u30b8\u30e3\u306b\u306e\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b) (name suggested by Kikuchi) had surpassed Arashi's channel's record by 4 days, making it the fastest channel to reach 2 million in all Japan.  The channel continued to rise in its number of subscriptions and views,  reaching 2.58 million subscribers by mid-year, and 8.2 million views for the video where Yamada was revealed as the new member. For this, the channel ranked first in BitStar's \"First half of 2021 \"newly opened\" YouTube channel\" ranking. By comparison, King & Prince's channel, centered mostly in music videos, ranked second with 6.2 million views and 670 000 subscribers.\nGetting a place to call their own: Jyanino room\nAfter filming in random places, in May 2021 the group finally got permission from the agency to use an unused space. A new project was born: refurbish the space into a filming room. In October 2021, the completed project was included in one of the channel's videos. Yamada, who secretly planned the room's remodel, led the other 3 into the now-called \"Jyanino Room\", which included items the group had gone searching for and bought. It also included a blank, undecorated wall for which Yamada requested Nakamaru a mural of the 4 members. Nakamaru agreed to draw it.\nReaching 3 million\nOn December 11, 2021, YouTube announced their top 10 ranking lists. Jyanino Channel was ranked fourth for their video in which Yamada was revealed as the last member, and first as \"Top creators with increasing number of subscribers in Japan\".\nOn January 4, 2022, the channel would surpass 3 million followers. The group's achievement would be shared live with around 270 000 fans and followers through a live stream. In the same broadcast, the group announced the sale of commemorative t-shirts.\nOne year of existence and the first TV appearance\nOn April 23, 2022, the group, celebrating the first year of the channel,  appeared for the first time on TV, on NTV's 1 oku 3000 man nin no Show Channel (1\u51043000\u4e07\u4eba\u306eSHOW\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb), hosted by Ninomiya's fellow Arashi member Sho Sakurai. Sakurai noticed the awkwardness of the members and replied \"It's not your first appearance on terrestrial television!\", making them feel a little more relaxed, and the audience laugh at the comment. The program revived the Arashi ni Shiyagare (\u5d50\u306b\u3057\u3084\u304c\u308c) corner \"Death Match\" in a special gyoza version, with Jyanino members competing against Show Channel members. The group announced there that they would be heading the NTV telethon 24 Jikan Terebi (24\u6642\u9593\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3) as its main personality. Jyanino members commented that it still surprised them that such a thing was possible. As part of the telethon, the Jyanino members also participated in the design of the new charity tees, with Ninomiya suggesting the theme for the design, and Kikuchi naming a new color (\"Lavery\" = Lovely berry color).\nThe agency's top channel\nOn May 7, 2022, the channel would hit another marker, becoming Johnny's YouTube top channel, surpassing Arashi's, with 3.26 million subscribers.\nAnan magazine and 24 Jikan TV\nThe group appeared on the cover of the August 2022 issue of Anan Magazine, with a casual pose, wearing the 24 Jikan Terebi t-shirts.

    "2017 single by Dopebwoy\nCartier is a song by Dutch Surinamese rapper Jordan Jacott, better known as Dopebwoy, featuring fellow Dutch rappers Chivv and 3robi. It was released as a single in 2017 and later included as the third track on Dopebwoy's album Andere flex that same year. Upon release, Cartier became the most-streamed Dutch-language song on both Spotify and YouTube. As of 2024, it remains one of the most-streamed Dutch-language songs.\nBackground\nThe song was written by Chyvon Pala, Anass Haouam, and Jordan Jacott, with the latter also serving as the producer. It falls within the Nederhop genre with influences of Afrobeats, and the lyrics focus on wealth and luxurious lifestyles. The title refers to the luxury brand Cartier, specifically referencing \"planga van Cartier,\" which is street slang for Cartier sunglasses. Initially, the beat was created for the group SBMG's song 4x duurder, but Dopebwoy decided to keep it for himself, recognizing its quality, despite being offered money for it. The track became a significant hit, marking Dopebwoy's breakthrough in the music industry. In the Netherlands, the single achieved five-times platinum status. This was the first collaboration between the three artists, both collectively and individually. They have since worked together on several other tracks, including Domme invest, Walou crisis, Champagne papi, and Marbella.\n",
    "1890 short story by Bram Stoker\n\"Gibbet Hill\" is an 1890 short story by Bram Stoker first published in a Christmas supplement of the Daily Express Dublin Edition.\nThe story was unknown to even Stoker biographers and literary scholars until October 2024, when it was uncovered by Brian Cleary, an amateur researcher and Stoker enthusiast at the National Library of Ireland.\nPlot\nThe story revolves around a man who meets three children standing in front of a memorial to a murdered sailor, by Gibbet Hill. One of the children suggests that, if there was a murder today, someone would be stuck up on Gibbet Hill. The man invites them to see where the murderer had been put and, together, they walk to the top of the hill. Distracted by the view, the narrator loses sight of the children. He takes a nap among some trees, and wakes to see the children a short distance away, before a snake passes over his feet towards the children, who appear able to communicate with and control the snake. Later, the children attack the narrator. The story culminates with the snake wriggling out of the narrator\u2019s chest and gliding away down the hillside.\nExternal links\n Works related to Gibbet Hill at Wikisource\n",
    "\nThe Turkoman Rebellion in Eastern Iran was a military uprising by the Iranian Turkmens with support of the rebellious Kurds and the Soviet union against the Sublime State of Persia under Reza Shah Pahlavi.\nBackground\nAt the time, Iran was facing numerous tribal rebellions which aimed at resisting Tehran's authority over their regions, Sheikh Khazal decided to resist the Central government's takeover of Khuzestan. The British relied upon Khazal because of the maintenance of the oilfields. The British had to think whether to continue the approach to khazal or to come to discussions with the central government in order to shape their influence in the region. Inspired from Khazal, Luristan rose under a rebellion by the Bayranvandis, in Fars and Isfahan the Qashqai, Bakhtiyaris remained unclear on their stance on the crisis and the British advised Khazal to accept the terms of the central government and soon the movement collapsed.\nBattle\nDuring the crisis in Khuzestan, the Iranian Turkmens rose in revolt against the central government.The Turkmens who had freed themselves from Russian rule as of 1917 had increased their rebellious activities.They soon began to threaten communications between Tehran and Khorasan. Upon the arrival of Reza Shah Pahlavi from Khuzestan he began large scale military campaigns to suppress the uprising.

    "Mountain in Washington (state), United States\nThor Peak is a 6,804-foot-elevation (2,074-meter) mountain summit in Chelan County, Washington, United States.\nDescription\nThor Peak is part of the Wenatchee Mountains which are a subrange of the Cascade Range. It is situated six miles (9.7\u00a0km) south of Stevens Pass and one mile east of the Cascade crest. Thor Peak is in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness on land managed by the Okanogan\u2013Wenatchee National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Trapper and Prospect creeks which are tributaries of Icicle Creek, which in turn is a tributary of the Wenatchee River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 2,800 feet (853 meters) above Prospect Creek in 0.65 mile (1 km). The nearest higher neighbor is Mac Peak, 1.86\u00a0mi (2.99\u00a0km) to the south-southwest. This mountain's toponym has not been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names, and it will remain unofficial as long as the USGS policy of not adopting new toponyms in designated wilderness areas remains in effect. However, it is labeled as \"6804\" on USGS topographical maps, which corresponds to its elevation. Thor Peak is set immediately east of Thunder Mountain and Thunder Mountain Lakes. Thor is the hammer-wielding god associated with thunder in Norse mythology.\nClimate\nWeather fronts originating in the Pacific Ocean travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.\nGeology\nThe Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is 31\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km) north of Thor Peak, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.\nDuring the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada\u2013US border by 10,000 years ago. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys is a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.\nSee also\nList of peaks of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness\nGeology of the Pacific Northwest",

It was located in Hamme-Mille, a district of the current Belgian municipality Beauvechain. Following the French Revolution it was secularised and in 1800 the buildings were sold off as building material and consequently demolished. In 1867 a brick ch\u00e2teau was erected on the spot of the former monastery.\nHistory\nDepiction of Valduc Abbey in a miniature from an early 15th-century manuscript\nThe abbey was founded as a Cistercian monastery for nuns around 1232 by the Duke of Brabant, Henry II. The abbey underwent several phases of reconstruction, expansion and crisis, but would eventually become quite a big establishment. A time of particular activity was the 15th century. By 1679, the abbey had expanded considerably and the entire village of Hamme-Mille was under its overlordship. During the 18th century, the abbey suffered as a consequence of war and also internal strife. By the later part of the century, it however was substantially rebuilt, probably to designs by Neoclassical architect Laurent-Beno\u00eet Dewez.\nFollowing the French Revolution and the ensuing French occupation of Brabant following the War of the First Coalition, the abbey was secularised in 1797. In 1800, the buildings were sold off as building material and consequently demolished. Some of the subsidiary buildings, notably a farmstead (built in the second half of the 18th century) and a water mill (mentioned already in 1431) however remain. On the grounds of the former monastery, a brick ch\u00e2teau was erected in 1867. It was commissioned by Pierre Craninx\u00a0, Professor at the University of Leuven, and designed by G\u00e9rard Van der Linden\u00a0 in a Neo-Renaissance style.\n",

    "Weather event in the United States\nThe 1967 Coho Salmon Fishing Disaster refers to a squall over Lake Michigan, off the coast of Michigan in the United States, which occurred on September 23, 1967. Hundreds of small fishing boats were on the lake to take advantage of a coho salmon run. More than 150 boats capsized, seven people died, and 46 people were injured.\nBackground\nFreshly caught coho salmon\nIn 1965, the state of Michigan decided to stock rivers that ran into Lake Michigan with coho salmon in an attempt to reduce the population of alewives, then considered a \"trash fish\". About 660,000 coho salmon fingerlings were planted in 1966. The coho salmon fishery was well-established by 1967, with state biologists reporting that survivability of the 1966 plantings had exceeded expectations.\nAlthough the state's first coho salmon fishing season opened April 1, the 1966 coho salmon plantings were not expected to make a big run until the fall of 1967. (At the time, Michigan state law forbade the commercial harvesting of salmon.)\nCoho fever\nSpring fishing success\nThe success of coho salmon fishermen around the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in April and May created much anticipation among fishermen in lower Michigan, where the salmon would move in the fall.\nThe Michigan State Department of Conservation encouraged the excitement by experimenting with catching methods and equipment, and reporting the results to anglers (almost none of whom in Michigan had any experience with fishing for salmon). The department assigned two patrol boats to keep tabs on the coho as they moved south, and reported findings daily to fishermen. Anticipation by fishermen for near-shore coho angling rose all throughout the summer of 1967. Fisherman throughout the Midwest believed the best fishing in the nation would occur in Lake Michigan.\nThe coho were slow to move toward shore; state experts said on August 2 that good near-shore fishing would probably begin in late August. By Labor Day weekend (September 1 to 4), good coho fishing could be had just 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2\u00a0km) offshore, and many schools could be found just 660 to 900 feet (200 to 270\u00a0m) from shore.\nCoho fever begins\nPhotograph of Willard Schaedig with two Coho Salmon he caught, summer 1968 (Presque Isle County Historical Museum)\n\"Coho fever\" struck Michigan. By late August, hundreds of anglers were crowding the lake off the towns of Frankfort, Manistee, and Onekama in northern lower Michigan every weekend. The week of August 28, at least 50 coho fishing boats could be seen on the water each weekday. On Thursday, August 30 (the Thursday before the Labor Day weekend), at least 315 boats were counted offshore.\nThe Detroit Free Press estimated that 19,000 anglers were on the water fishing for coho on Labor Day weekend. Cars with license plates from all over the Midwest were seen in Manistee. There were 600 to 800 small boats on the water off Manistee on Sunday, September 3, and Monday, September 4. Traffic clogged the roads around Frankfort, Manistee, and Onekama. No boats were available for hire for miles along the coast from Sleeping Bear Bay south to Ludington. Fishing guides in the Manistee area had been booked for more than a year, and boat rentals could not be had. Hotel reservations were very difficult to get in Benzie County, where the Platte River emptied into Lake Michigan, and sporting goods stores in Manistee ran out of bait, lures, rods, and tackle. Boat launching sites and marinas at Frankfort, Manistee, and the mouth of the Platte River were overwhelmed.\nThe United States Coast Guard expressed concern that coho anglers were not observing water safety rules. Most fishermen were in poorly-powered watercraft less than 18 feet (5.5\u00a0m) in length. Boats under 18 feet could not handle the large lake swells, and could be easily swamped due to low freeboard. Anglers used airboats, cabin cruisers, canoes, houseboats, prams, sailboats, car-top dinghies, kayaks, and rubber rafts to fish on the lake. One Coast Guard employee saw a man fishing using pontoons lashed together with rope, and a few boards on top for seating. Many boats had motors too under-powered for choppy lake weather.\nThe fishing was heavy Labor Day weekend, but state officials said the coho run would not peak until some time between mid September and the first week of October.\nCoho fever continues in September\nThe second weekend of September (September 8 to 10) proved even more popular for coho anglers. An estimated 38,000 coho salmon anglers were on the water that weekend, trolling between Manistee and the Platte River. From 800 to 1,000 boats jammed the waters the week of September 11 to 14 at Manistee, while 1,500 to 1,700 vessels could be found there the weekend of September 15 to 17. Cars with license plates from all over the nation were seen in Frankfort and Manistee, and more than 450 boats were counted off Manistee on Sunday, September 10.

    "\nFree Grace Alliance (FGA) is a Free Grace advocacy organization formed by former members of the Grace Evangelical Society. It is distinguished from the Grace Evangelical Society over their understanding of the content of saving faith, as the Free Grace Alliance holds that to be saved one must believe in the person, work and promise of Christ. This is in contrast to the Grace Evangelical Society, which holds to the view that one is saved by just believing that Jesus gives eternal life to everyone who believes.\nThe president of the FGA is Jeremy Vance and its executive director is Jeremy Mikkelsen.\nHistory\nThe Free Grace Alliance formed in November 2004 with an emphasis on international missions. Although the Free Grace Alliance was initially planned to be created for other reasons than the dispute over the content of faith,  the Free Grace Alliance split from the Grace Evangelical Society in 2005 when most of the prominent leaders (including the chairman of the board) within the Society rejected the change in the content of saving faith being taught by Zane C. Hodges and the Grace Evangelical Society changed its doctrinal statement regarding the content of saving faith. Later in 2009, the Free Grace Alliance released two public statements distancing themselves from the Grace Evangelical Society due to their understanding of the content of faith.\nSince 2013, some in the Free Grace Alliance have considered changing its name to \"Grace Alliance\" due to concerns of the label \"Free Grace Theology\" having possible negative connotations.\nThe widely influential Dispensational theologian Charles Ryrie (1925 \u2013 2016) attended Free Grace Alliance gatherings.\n",

    "\nTwo human polls make up the 2024\u201325 NCAA Division I women's basketball rankings, the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll, in addition to various publications' preseason polls.\nLegend\nAP Poll\nThe women's basketball poll began during the 1976\u201377 season, and was initially compiled by Mel Greenberg and published by The Philadelphia Inquirer. At first, it was a poll of coaches conducted via telephone, where coaches identified top teams and a list of the Top 20 teams was produced. The contributors continued to be coaches until 1994, when the AP took over administration of the poll from Greenberg, and switched to a panel of writers.\nUSA Today Coaches Poll\nThe Coaches Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked No. 1; second highest is ranked No. 2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775.\nSee also\n2024\u201325 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings\n",

    "Composition by Edgard Var\u00e8se\nOffrandes (in English, Offerings) is a short composition for soprano and chamber orchestra by French composer Edgard Var\u00e8se. It was finished in 1921.\nBackground\nOffrandes, entitled Dedications for the premiere, was written on a commission by the International Composers' Guild, of which Var\u00e8se himself was the director. This was the first commission out of many, one each year, until the guild was dissolved in 1927. The piece, finished in 1921, was completed shortly after Var\u00e8se released a manifesto praising composers and attacking performers. According to Var\u00e8se, \"the composer is the only one of the creators today who is denied direct contact with the public. When his work is done, he is thrust aside and the interpreter enters, not to try to understand the work but impertinently to judge it.\" The first movement was dedicated \"\u00e0 Louise\", Edgard Var\u00e8se's wife, who was also an influential literary figure, and played an essential role in supporting Var\u00e8se's career. The couple married in 1922, the same year Offrandes premiered. The premiere occurred on April 23, 1922, at the Greenwich Village Theatre, in New York City and marked Var\u00e8se's first work to be premiered in the American continent. It was conducted by long-time collaborator and renowned harpist Carlos Salzedo, to whom the second movement was dedicated. Nina Koshetz played the part of the soprano with the New Symphony Orchestra, an orchestra created by Var\u00e8se in 1919 to secure the American premieres of compositions by other contemporary composers, most notably Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire and Stravinsky's Les noces. It was first published in 1927 by C. C. Birchard and republished in 1960 by Franco Colombo and Ricordi.\nStructure\nThis compositions is cast into two movements and has a total duration of just under 7 minutes. Var\u00e8se calls for a soprano and a small orchestra consisting of a piccolo, a flute, an oboe, a clarinet in B-flat, a bassoon, a French horn in F, a trumpet in C, a trombone, a harp, a string quintet consisting of two violins, a viola, a cello, and a double bass, and a relatively complex percussion section (as was customary in Var\u00e8se) consisting of a ratchet, a snare drum, a mammoth bass drum, cymbals, castanets, a tambourine, a triangle, and two differently-pitched gongs. Var\u00e8se specifies that if the string section were to be larger, the total forces would not exceed six first violins, four second violins, four violas, two celli, and two double basses. The piece also has specifications for advanced techniques for the harp.\nThe movement list is as follows:\nChanson de l\u00e0-haut (Song from on high). LentLa croix du sud (The Southern Cross). Lent mod\u00e9r\u00e9, tr\u00e8s lourdThe two movements of the piece are set to an unspecified poem by Vicente Huidobro and Jos\u00e9 Juan Tablada's La cruz del sur, the latter originally written in Spanish but translated into French for the composition. In these two settings, the melody did not prevail over duration and timbre, and there is a shift of orchestral powers: the strings are underpowered whereas the percussion is strongly emphasized, both in presence and in number of musicians. Var\u00e8se was an innovator insofar as he worked with the entire range and held notes in the extremes of the orchestral range for relatively long periods of time. Var\u00e8se aimed to eliminate the performer's lung capacity as a limiting factor, ensuring that long, extreme notes in his compositions could be sustained without interruption.\nRecordings\n",

    "Israeli diplomat\nAlon Liel (born 31 October 1948) is an Israeli international relations scholar and former diplomat.\nHe served as the Director General of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Planning from 1994 to 1996, and as the Director General of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs for about six months, he also served as the Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires at the Israeli Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, and as Ambassador to South Africa.\nPolitical career\nIn 1979, Liel was appointed to his first position outside of Israel, as Deputy Consul in Chicago. He later served as the Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires in Turkey (1981), deputy director of the Middle East Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1984), advisor to the political director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and head of the South Africa desk (1986), spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1988), consul in Atlanta (1990), and Ambassador of Israel to South Africa (1992).\nAfter his tenure in South Africa ended in 1994, Minister of Economy and Planning Shimon Shtrit appointed him as the Director General of his ministry, a position he held until the ministry was dissolved by Yossi Beilin in 1996. In 1997, he founded the company \"Global Code,\" specializing in consulting and research for companies operating in Turkey. Concurrently, he served as an advisor to Ehud Barak on foreign affairs while Barak was serving as Leader of the Opposition, and also lectured in international relations programs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv University, and the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya. His lectures primarily focused on issues related to Turkey and South Africa, as well as the fundamentals of diplomacy.\nDuring the 1999 Knesset elections and Prime Minister elections, he served as an advisor to Ehud Barak In this capacity, he was also linked to the Barak's NGO scandal After David Levy resigned as Foreign Minister in 2000, Prime Minister of Israel Barak appointed him as Director General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The appointment took effect in early November 2000, shortly before Shlomo Ben-Ami was appointed Foreign Minister. Following the establishment of the 29th government, Shimon Peres became Foreign Minister and decided to appoint Avi Gil in Liel's place. The appointment was made in April 2001. Liel then served as a director at the investment and real estate company \"Gazit Inc,\" and as chair of the Israel-Turkey Business Council.\nFrom 2006 to 2008, he privately managed (with the knowledge of the Israeli government) a channel for secret talks with Syrian officials through the Swiss government. In 2009, Liel headed the movement for peace between Israel and Syria.\nIn an article for the South African newspaper \"Business Day\" in 2012, Liel called for a boycott of settlement products. This article sparked significant criticism within the political and public arenas in Israel. Liel also supported author Alice Walker's decision to boycott Israel and not republish her book \"The Color Purple\" in Israel. In 2015, he participated in an appeal to the government of Brazil requesting that it not approve Israel's intention to appoint Danny Danon as Israel's Ambassador to Brazil. In December 2015, he signed a petition for members of the European Parliament calling for them, following the parliament's decision on product labeling from Judea and Samaria and the Golan Heights, to escalate measures distinguishing between Israel within the Green Line and \"the occupied territories\".\nIn January 2016, recordings were published in \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" made by the organization \"Enough - Youth for Israel\" documenting a conversation between Liel and members of the organization Breaking the Silence, where Liel is heard saying to the organization's members that although they have the legitimacy of two percent of the Israeli public, one cannot wait due to the expansion of the settlements and must act outside of Israel. He recommended that activists apply pressure for an international boycott that could only influence Israel, as happened in South Africa: \"You are the tip of the spear that tells the world that the occupation is intolerable for us and intolerable for them. It is intolerable for both peoples, and once there is recognition that it is intolerable, things will start to unfold.\" Liel also recommended pursuing a decision from the United Nations Security Council that Palestine is a member state, which would make Israel an occupier of a UN member state. He also suggested initiating a sporting boycott of Israel. In response to the publications, Liel stated that he opposes a boycott of Israel.\nIn December 2019, Liel began promoting a \"Joint Democratic and Electoral Struggle Front\" of Meretz with the Joint List (Ra'am) for the Knesset.\nFrom 2008 to 2013, he served as a member of the Mevaseret Zion council on behalf of the \"Mevaseret on a Different Level\" party.

    "\nSeason of television series\nThe twenty-fourth and final series of the British medical soap opera Doctors commenced airing on 10 January 2023, and is set to conclude on 14 November 2024. The series is set to comprise 276 episodes. Set in the fictional West Midlands town of Letherbridge, the soap follows the lives of the staff and patients of the Mill Health Centre, a fictional NHS doctor's surgery.\nProduction\nCancellation\n\"We have taken the very difficult decision to bring daytime drama Doctors to an end after 23 years. With super inflation in drama production, the cost of the programme has increased significantly, and further investment is also now required to refurbish the site where the show is made, or to relocate it to another home. We remain fully committed to the West Midlands and all of the funding for Doctors will be reinvested into new programming in the region. We would like to thank all the Doctors cast and crew who have been involved in the show since 2000. We know the crucial role Doctors has played in nurturing talent, and we will work to develop new opportunities to support skills in scripted programming.\"\nBBC's statement after cancelling Doctors.\nOn 18 October 2023, the BBC announced that Doctors had been cancelled. The decision was made due to the financial strain of moving the set from Selly Oak to Digbeth as part of BBC Birmingham's ventures to create a new base for their productions. The BBC confirmed that it would be giving the soap a grand finale and was \"working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves\". Filming was to be wrapped in March 2024, with the final episode scheduled to air in December 2024.\nAmidst false news reports of Doctors being cancelled for low ratings, the production team took to social media to debunk them. At the time of its cancellation, Doctors was receiving an average of 1.6 million live viewers and was consistently the most watched programme in its timeslot. Their social media team posted the statement: \"we would like to clarify that the decision to cancel the show is not based on low figures, as we have consistently enjoyed a strong viewership, and we are deeply grateful for the enduring support of our dedicated audience.\"\nCast member Elisabeth Dermot Walsh appeared on Good Morning Britain to discuss the cancellation, where she said that the whole team were \"reeling\" from the decision, which had come as a shock to them. Co-star Kia Pegg wrote a piece on social media about the \"dystopian\" experience of the team being informed of the cancellation. She revealed that external people knew of the decision prior to them and was angry that they had been informed before them.\nThe BBC's decision to cancel Doctors was met with universal criticism. The Writers' Guild of Great Britain called it \"a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences\". They were also concerned that it had become the second continuing drama to be cancelled by the BBC in the 2020s, after fellow medical drama Holby City had been axed in 2021. Equity commented: \"This is enormously detrimental, not only for those regularly engaged on the show, but also for those who will be deprived of an opportunity of work \u2013 particularly in the Midlands, where there are very few job prospects due to continuing underinvestment in the region. The BBC has to do better to represent and serve the Midlands region and we call on the BBC to enter into talks with the Union to go through exactly how the funding will be reinvested in the region.\" Viewers launched a petition to save the soap, suggesting that another network could buy the rights to the series to continue making it.\nThe show's final episode was filmed in March 2024, and was originally to be screened in December 2024, but this was later revised to November 2024, due to a scheduling break not going ahead as planned.\nCast\nIn November 2022, it was confirmed that former Coronation Street star Wendi Peters had been cast as Nina Bulsara, a new general practitioner at The Mill, who was billed as a 'maddening new character'. Peters' exit from the role was confirmed in September 2023, following her decision to leave the series. The character departed in February 2024. Alongside Peters' casting, Rahul Arya was cast as Suni Bulsara, Nina's son, and a general practitioner.\nIn January 2023, Kiruna Stamell was introduced as Kirsty Millar, her casting had not been confirmed beforehand, and was a replacement for Valerie Pitman, who departed at the conclusion of the previous series. Stamell made a previously unannounced departure from the role in September 2024, which saw Kirsty take a promotion at another medical centre.\nIn March 2023, Jan Pearson made a previously unannounced exit from her role as Karen Hollins, in a storyline which saw the character killed off after suffering from health issues in the previous months. Pearson later said that the storyline was her decision, and she asked to be killed off, stating \"I asked to die and they were very",

The platform was formed in the aftermath of the July Revolution with a view to building consensus on rebuilding Bangladesh as an inclusive democracy following the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5, 2024. On October 22, 2024, the Jatiya Nagorik Committee along with the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement announced a five-point demand, advocating for sweeping political and constitutional changes to dismantle what they describe as a \"fascist political settlement\" and replace it with a democratic one.\nBackground\nStudents in Bangladesh began a quota reform movement in early June 2024 after the Bangladesh Supreme Court invalidated the government's 2018 circular regarding job quotas in the public sector. The movement escalated into a full-fledged mass uprising after the government carried out mass killings of protesters, known as July massacre, by the late of July. By early August, the movement evolved into a non-cooperation movement, ultimately leading to the ouster of the then-Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, on August 5, 2024. Hasina's ouster triggered a constitutional crisis, leading to the formation of a semi-revolutionary government led by the country's only Nobel laureate, Muhammad Yunus, as the chief adviser. Shortly after the formation of the oath-taking of Yunus-led government, the Jatiya Nagorik Committee was formed.\nObjectives\nThe central mission of the Jatiya Nagorik Committee is the reconstruction of Bangladesh as an inclusive democracy. Its members expressed strong opposition to the existing political settlement, describing it as authoritarian and oppressive. Among its founding objectives are building a quity-based new political settlement dismantling the old political settlement, ensuring justice for those involved in the July massacres and pushing for the demand for a constituent assembly election.\nSee also\nStudent-People's uprising",

His great-grandparents were deported from Lithuania to the Samara Governorate for participating in the anti-Russian Uprising of 1863. His great-grandmother Ro\u017e\u0117 Stauskait\u0117 was the love interest of the poet Antanas Viena\u017eindys. In 1922, the family returned to Lithuania and settled in their original village of Jaskoni\u0161k\u0117s\u00a0 near Dusetos where Stauskas attended a primary school. He further studied at the progymnasium in Antaliept\u0117 and gymnasium in Roki\u0161kis.\nHe graduated in 1939 and enrolled at the aspirant courses at the War School of Kaunas. There he was classmate with painter Algirdas Petrulis. At the same time, he enrolled at the Kaunas Art School. After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940, the War School relocated to Vilnius. As a result, Stauskas transferred to the Vilnius Art School (present-day Vilnius Academy of Arts) where his teachers included Viktoras Vizgirda and Jonas \u0160ileika.\nWorld War II\nStauskas was arrested and deported during the June deportation in 1941. He reached Sevurallag\u00a0 in November 1941 where he was forced to work cutting down trees and processing timber. For a time, his bunkmate was painter Adomas Smetona\u00a0 (nephew of President Antanas Smetona). NKVD officials started investigation in 1942 and in March 1943 determined that they had the wrong person \u2013 they were looking for the policeman Povilas Petras Stauskas and not student Petras Stauskas. Student Stauskas was released from the Gulag, while policeman Stauskas was arrested in 1946.\nFor a few months, he worked at a tank factory in Nizhny Tagil before joining the Lithuanian 16th Rifle Division of the Red Army. He fought with the division and helped Soviets retake Lithuania until he was injured near Katy\u010diai. After recuperating, he was deployed to Manchuria where the Soviet Union was preparing to fight against Japan.\nMuseum director\nStauskas was demobilized in 1946. He returned to Vilnius and resumed his education at Vilnius Academy of Arts where his teachers included Justinas Vieno\u017einskis\u00a0, Vladas Dr\u0117ma, Petras Aleksandravi\u010dius\u00a0, Antanas Gudaitis\u00a0. He graduated in 1950 and joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In March 1951, we was appointed as the director of the M. K. \u010ciurlionis National Art Museum. He held this position until he was fired by the Minister of Culture Jonas Bielinis\u00a0 on 15 March 1988. Reportedly, he was dismissed because he protested plans to relocate the museum for its historical premises so that the War Museum could expand.\nAs museum director, Stauskas quietly resisted Sovietization efforts. Using his reputation as a war hero, he employed and protected former political prisoners or deportees who managed to return to Lithuania but struggled finding employment. According to witnesses, he even had a secret hand signal to warn employees if a KGB agent came to visit the museum. Stauskas also hid and protected from destruction various politically unacceptable items from the interwar Lithuania (for example, a set of Lithuanian state orders, property of coin mint, sport awards, memorabilia of various institutions and societies) or religious items (for example, wooden folk sculptures of Jesus or saints). He also acquired new art that did not comply with the official requirements of Soviet ideology. He worked to preserve original interiors of Pa\u017eaislis Monastery and Church of St. Michael the Archangel, Kaunas.\nDuring his tenure, the museum opened subsidiary museums: a branch in Druskininkai (1963), Vincas Grybas museum in Jurbarkas (1960), \u017dmuidzinavi\u010dius Museum (1966) and Ceramics Museum (1978) in Kaunas.\nStauskas died on 28 February 2003 in Kaunas and was buried at the Petra\u0161i\u016bnai Cemetery.\nWorks\nStauskas mainly created watercolors, but also painted in oil. His subjects were mainly landscapes (particularly of Kaunas and his native village) and portraits. His paintings usually feature limited and restrained colors that help convey emotion and person's character.",

    "BL Lac object in the constellation Draco\n1ES 1959+650 is a BL Lacertae object or a BL Lac object located in the eastern constellation of Draco, about 676 million light years from Earth. It was first discovered as an astronomical radio source in 1987 by Green Bank Radio Telescope and further categorized as both a flat-spectrum radio source and an X-ray source during the Einstein IPC Slew Survey conducted in the early 1990s.\nCharacteristics\n1ES 1959+650 has an active galactic nucleus. It is classified as a high energy-peaked BL Lac object or a synchrotron peaked blazar with a synchrotron peak of the spectral energy distribution appearing in ultraviolet and X-ray bands.\nThe host galaxy of 1ES 1959+650 is a gas-rich elliptical galaxy with a dust lane located 0.8\" north of its nucleus. Its structure is complex, indicating a past galaxy merger. The supermassive black hole in the center of 1ES 1959+650 is estimated to be ~ 1.3 x 108 M\u0298.\n1ES 1959+650 is violently variable. It exhibits multiple outburst episodes across its electromagnetic spectrum, In its low flux state between 2000 and 2001, 1ES 1959+650 was observed with HEGRA Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope system, which it showed a Crab flux of 5.3%. During its flaring state in May 2002, the blazar's flux level increased significantly as high as 2.2 Crab. Furthermore, an orphan flare, not accompanied by increasing activity in spectral bands, was also shown. The gamma emission in 1ES 1959+650 displays 'softer-when-brighter' evolution in a 0.1-300 GeV band while the X-ray emission showed 'harder-when-brighter' evolution in a 0.6-10 KeV band.\nIn addition to its variability, 1ES 1959+650 shows gamma ray flares from short to long timescales. X-ray flares were also detected in the blazar, apart from gamma ray flares. Between August 2015 and January 2016, a powerful and prolonged X-ray flare was detected in 1ES 1959+650. That same year, the second strongest X-ray flare occurred with a 5.5 month interval separation after the first flare.\nThe source in 1ES 1959+650 is unresolved on a kiloparsec scale. By looking at a parsec scale, it is found to be dominated by a luminous core. There is also presence of some extended unpolarized emission to the north, which the electric vector position angle is found parallel to it while the core polarization on the other hand, is roughly 1.5 percent. This suggests a component emerging towards north with average polarization of 4 percent.\n",

    "\nHistoric site in Queensland, Australia\nWavell Heights Presbyterian Church is a heritage-listed church at 64 Spence Road, Wavell Heights, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by James William Gibson and built in 1966. It is also known as St Luke's Presbyterian Church. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 September 2022.\nHistory\nWavell Heights Presbyterian Church (1966), in Wavell Heights, Brisbane, is a pentagonal brick church set within a church complex with mature trees. Built in a post-war suburb, the modernist-style church resulted from the Presbyterian Church's post-war building program, and its desire to remain relevant to contemporary society. Its plan, lighting, and furniture arrangement were designed to give the congregation a sense of community and involvement in the service, through gathered worship.\nWavell Heights, part of the traditional land of the Turrbal people, is located west of Sandgate Road, north of Kedron Brook. Prior to the 1940s, most of the area was characterised by dairy farming and pineapple growing, although by 1917 there were some residential subdivisions. The area was known as West Nundah until a public poll in July 1941 selected the name Wavell Heights, after the British General (later Field Marshall) Archibald Percival Wavell. Wavell Heights was formally christened at a concert at the Imperial Theatre in Nundah in October 1941. Other naming options had included \"Beverley Heights\" or 'Inala'. The suburb grew rapidly in the immediate post-World War II (WWII) era. Undeveloped land in Wavell Heights and neighbouring Chermside was acquired by the Queensland Housing Commission, on which by August 1947 it planned to build 450 houses. At the time, it was the commission's largest housing project, and it increased the population of Wavell Heights substantially. The Wavell Heights Neighbourhood Society was formed in 1947, and later established a community centre on Edinburgh Castle Road. A non-official post office opened on 4 December 1950   in the premises of Mr CB Grace at the corner of Rode Road and Pfingst Road. Three schools, including a high school, opened in the late 1940s and 1950s. The suburb possessed several churches established in the 1930s, including the Nundah Presbyterian Church (built 1932, as at 2022, known as the Gateway Presbyterian Church), West Nundah Methodist Church (built 1938, as at 2002 known as Wavell Heights Uniting Church), the Catholic Church of St Pascal Baylon (built 1937), and the Holy Spirit Anglican Church (1904-6 building relocated in 1936). Post-WWII growth resulted in a timber Presbyterian church hall being opened on Spence Road in 1952.\nThe Presbyterian Church and the site at Wavell Heights\nThe first Presbyterian congregation in Queensland had formed in 1849, and the first Presbyterian Church opened on Grey Street, South Brisbane, in 1851. Other Presbyterian churches opened in newly settled areas of Queensland, and in 1863 Queensland's Presbyterian congregations combined into a Synod and the Presbyterian Church of Queensland (PCQ) was formed. In 1865 three Presbyteries (covering multiple congregations) were formed: Brisbane (including Ipswich), Toowoomba (including Warwick), and Rockhampton (including Maryborough). The Presbytery of Maryborough was formed in 1870, Townsville in 1886, and Mackay in 1948. A union of Presbyterian Churches formed the Presbyterian Church of Australia in 1901. By 1954, the top four Christian denominations in the Metropolitan area of Brisbane were: the Church of England (34.33% of the population); followed by Catholic (24.35%); Presbyterian (10.74%); and Methodist (10.57%). Presbyterians also made up 11.7% of Queensland's population at this time.  In 1977, the Uniting Church in Australia was formed from most members of the Presbyterian, Methodist and Congregational denominations, although a third of Presbyterian congregations remained in the Presbyterian Church of Australia.\nPresbyterian congregations in Queensland were formed into charges, under a minister, and a charge could include one or more church congregations. Before a fully sanctioned charge was formed, \"Home Mission\" charges could be established by Home Missionaries. The expansion of Presbyterian charges in Queensland was mainly due to the Home Mission enterprise, which relied on missionaries and money sent from the Home Churches in Scotland and Ireland. The Nundah Charge, which later covered Wavell Heights, held its first service in January 1932, and was a fully sanctioned charge by the end of 1935.\nThe Spence Road site of the 1952 Presbyterian church was part of a 10-acre-3-perch (4.05\u00a0ha) undeveloped block that had been acquired by the PCQ for \u00a34,500 in 1947. The site was originally intended to become an auxiliary hospital, connected to the planned St Andrews War Memorial Hospital in central Brisbane, but despite a cairn of remembrance being dedicated on the Wavell Heights site in September 1949, the auxiliary hospital did",

Since 1997, it has been a member of Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences.\nHistory\nThe Central Research and Design Institute of Urban Development originates from the state trust for the design of workers' towns and settlements for industry \"Standartproekt\", created in 1931, which was part of the All-Union Association \"Soyuzstandartzhilstroy\".\nIn 1933, the trust \"Vuzstroyproekt\" was included in \"Standartproekt\", and the new trust was named \"Gosstroyproekt\". Its branches were also created in Leningrad and Novosibirsk.\nAfter the end of the Great Patriotic War, Gorstroyproekt employees made a significant contribution to the restoration of cities damaged by military action: Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporozhye, Sevastopol, Stalingrad and others. The Kiev branch of Gorstroyproekt and the Kharkov Gorstroyproekt were created on the basis of the institute.\nIn 1964, the State Design Institute \"Gorstroyproekt\" and the Institute of Urban Development and Regional Planning of the USSR Academy of Construction and Architecture were merged and on their basis the Central Research and Design Institute for Urban Development was created, which belonged to the recently created Gosgrazhdanstroy under the Gosstroy of the USSR. The Central Research and Design Institute for Urban Development also created branches (in Yerevan, Minsk, Tbilisi and Frunze (Bishkek)).\nIn 1991-1997 The Central Research Institute of Urban Development was part of the Russian State Construction Committee, and in 1998 it was included in the list of scientific institutions of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences.\nIn 2017, on the basis of the Central Research Institute of Urban Development, by merging with it:\nResearch Institute of Theory and History of Architecture and Urban Development of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences;\nOrder of the Badge of Honor of the Ural Research and Design Institute of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences;\nFar Eastern Research, Design and Technological Institute of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences;\nSeven regional branches of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences (Far Eastern, Southern, Siberian, Ural, Volga, Northwestern and Central),\nFederal State Budgetary Institution \"Central Research and Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction and Housing and Communal Services of the Russian Federation\" (TsNIIP Minstroy of Russia) was created\nIn the 2010s, the Central Research Institute of Urban Development continued to study issues of urban planning ecology. Thus, in 2014, the institute held a Round Table on the topic of \"Problems of Urban Development in the Moscow Agglomeration Zone\".\nSelected projects\nThe institute's staff participated in the design of more than a hundred cities, including the development of master plans for Ashgabat, Yerevan, Novosibirsk, Odessa, Rostov-on-Don, Sverdlovsk, Tashkent, Tbilisi, Kharkov, Chelyabinsk and several others. At the beginning of the 21st century, master plans for the cities of Voronezh, Kazan, Orel, Saratov, Yaroslavl and others were developed, as well as territorial planning schemes for the Altai Territory and the Altai Republic, Belgorod, Novosibirsk and Smolensk regions.\nDesign work was also carried out for cities during the implementation of industrial projects of national importance, including:\nBalakovo (Balakovo NPP);\nNaberezhnye Chelny (Kama Automobile Plant);\nNakhodka (Nakhodka Sea Trade Port);\nTolyatti (Volzhsky Automobile Plant);",

Like many other cities in early Al-Andalus, had a significant Christian population (known as Mozarabs), who were allowed to maintain their faith in exchange for paying the jizya (a tax levied on non-Muslims).\nThe use of \"count\" in his title, a remnant of Visigothic nobility, reflects the continuation of older Roman and Gothic administrative traditions in the city. Besides the title of Count of Coimbra, Fl\u00e1vio Teod\u00f3sio was also Judge of the Christians. The title judge in this context was not merely judicial, but often carried administrative, military, and political responsibilities.\nThese titles are mentioned in a donation that Fl\u00e1vio Teod\u00f3sio himself made to Lorv\u00e3o Abbey. In these documents he signed himself as \"Tiudus Comes Christianorum in Combria et Julliano Judex Christianorum\". The donation to the Abbey consisted of two estates in Almofalla, in the person of Abbess Aydulfa.\nPrimary sources about Fl\u00e1vio Teod\u00f3sio\u2019s life are scarce, with much of the information derived works of medieval chroniclers like Rodrigo Jim\u00e9nez de Rada.\nBiography\nHe was the son of Fl\u00e1vio Alarico Count of Coimbra, and Fl\u00e1via Teodia Atenerico. He married Munia Sueira from whom he had:\nHermenegildo (775 - 841)\nAtaulfo  (769 - 851)\nTeodorico  (770 - 805)\nSancha (775 - )",
    "Panchalingeshwara Temple at Begur. Picture Courtesy: Wikimedia Commons \nBegur is a locality in Bengaluru South which stands as a testament to ancient Bengaluru, with historical evidence dating back to c. 6th century CE. It was formerly known as Bempur, Veppur, and Behur, and served as a significant administrative center, playing a vital role in the evolution of Bengaluru to a modern global metropolis.\nThe most compelling evidence of Begur's historical significance is found in the Panchalingeshwara temple complex, considered to be among Bengaluru's oldest temples. Constructed during the reign of the Western Gangas around 900 CE, this temple houses numerous inscriptions and hero stones, offering valuable insights into the region's history and culture.\nSignificance\nInscriptions and Herostones Housed at Begur Nageshwara Temple Complex. Picture Courtesy: Wikimedia Commons \nThe numerous inscriptions and hero stones found in Begur, particularly within the Panchalingeshwara temple complex, along with the first recorded mention of \"Bengulooru\" in the 900CE inscription, firmly establish Begur's crucial role in understanding Bengaluru's historical and cultural development. These inscriptions provide valuable insights into:\nEarly History of Begur\nThe region is historically referred to as Bempur, Veppur, and Behur. The earliest historical reference to Begur is found in a copper plate inscription from 517 CE. This inscription is documented in Epigraphia Carnatica Vol. 9 as Doddaballapur inscription number 68, marks the first recorded mention of Begur. Over the centuries, Begur served as a vital administrative division, referred to as Bempur/Begur naadu in various inscriptions. The presence of a fort, along with more than 20 inscriptions and hero stones dating from the 10th to 16th centuries, reflects its historical significance in the Bengaluru region.\nReligious and Cultural Practices\nThe inscriptions from Begur reveal a strong presence of both Hinduism and Jainism, highlighting the region's diverse religious practices. The construction of the Somanatha temple, now known as the Nageshwara temple, by the chieftain Nagatara in 900 CE reflects the significance of temple building and religious patronage. This temple became the focal point of the Begur Panchalingeshwara temple complex, which later housed several other temples. An inscription from 900CE details the grant of tax revenues and lands to the Somanatha temple, highlighting the economic support provided to religious institutions. The inscription also mentions the practice of k\u0101la\u1e43ka\u1e3bci (foot-washing ritual), performed by Nagatara as an act of devotion, and records various donations to temples, indicating the community's active involvement in religious life. The prevalence of Jainism is evident from the inscription mentioning Tondabbe as Nagatara's daughter, who chose the Jain ritual of Sanyasam (voluntary death) for her final moments, and another inscription documenting a donation to the Chokkimayya Jinalaya, a Jaina Basadi. Additionally, hero stones commemorating individuals who died in battles reflect the warrior culture and the importance of valor in the society.\nLinguistic Evolution\nThe Begur inscriptions offer a glimpse into the evolution of the Kannada language, showcasing the script and linguistic features prevalent during different periods. While the majority of the inscriptions are in Kannada, some are in Tamil written in Grantha script, reflecting the region's linguistic diversity. Studying these inscriptions provides valuable data for understanding the development of Kannada and its variations over time. \nUrban Development\nBegur Lake. Picture Credits: Wikimedia Commons\nThe 900CE inscription mentioning the \"Benguluru\" battle is the first written record of the city's name, firmly establishing Begur as a crucial location in Bengaluru's early history and pushing back the documented history of the city's name by several centuries. The inscription that mentions twelve villages under the administration of Begur (Bempuru) points to the existence of a network of settlements in the region, indicating an early form of urban organization. These villages, including present-day Begur, Togur, and Hulimangala, offer a glimpse into the spatial extent of Begur's influence in ancient times. Additionally, the mention of specific locations like Tumbepadi (possibly present-day Tumbadi in Tumkur district) and Saraki (still bearing the same name today) provides valuable geographical context and helps in understanding the historical landscape of the region. The reference to \"khandugas\" of land in an inscription offers insights into the land measurement systems used during that period, contributing to our understanding of administrative practices and economic activities related to land ownership. Furthermore, the Begur lake, referred to as \"Veppur Periya \u0112ri\" in a 12th-century Tamil inscription, highlights the importance of water resources in the development of the settlement.\nDisc",

    "2024 video game\n2024 video game\nMouthwashing is a 2024 psychological horror adventure game developed by Wrong Organ and published by Critical Reflex. Played from a first-person perspective, the game follows the five crew members of the freighter spaceship Tulpar after a mysterious crash leaves them stranded in space, trapped within as supplies dwindle. The captain, alive but severely maimed and unable to speak or move, is blamed by the remaining crew for deliberately crashing the ship for reasons unknown. The game uses a split, nonlinear narrative.\nGameplay\nMouthwashing is a single-player narrative-focused adventure game played from a first-person perspective with little in the way of survival or combat mechanics. It can also be described as a walking simulator. Gameplay primarily involves exploring the Tulpar, engaging in dialogue with the crew, and solving puzzles using items.\nPresented as a nonlinear narrative, the game plays out across disjointed scenes taking place in the weeks and months before and following the crash. Jumps in the timeline are sometimes delineated by non-diegetic transitions that mimic glitches or crashes. Players experience captain Curly's perspective in the scenes before the crash, while scenes taking place after the crash are from the perspective of former co-pilot Jimmy, who takes on the role of captain in the aftermath of the disaster.\nPlot\nDuring a routine shipment, the freighter spaceship Tulpar is sabotaged into crashing into an asteroid. The crew \u2013 consisting of captain Curly, co-pilot Jimmy, medic Anya, mechanic Swansea, and last-minute intern Daisuke \u2013 survive. However, most of the ship's resources are blocked off by airbag-like foam, damage to which could potentially breach the ship's hull and trigger lethal decompression. Curly is also mutilated by the crash and cannot speak or move; he is kept alive via a dwindling supply of painkillers. Jimmy declares himself acting captain as a result, claiming that Curly caused the crash after going postal.\nWhen food and medical supplies begin to run low after two months, the crew open their confidential shipment, discovering that it consists solely of mouthwash. The sugar and ethanol content result in them consuming it, and the ensuing drunkenness inflames tensions further. Eventually, Anya locks herself in the medical bay with Curly. After failing to convince Swansea to help him break in, Jimmy knocks him out using a mocktail roofied with the ship's sole bottle of rubbing alcohol and sneaks into the utility bay to find tools. After discovering that Swansea was guarding the ship's only working cryopod, Jimmy coerces Daisuke into crawling through a damaged vent to reach Anya and Curly. However, Daisuke is severely injured in the process, and his wounds become infected when Jimmy uses the mouthwash as an impromptu antiseptic. Swansea, who had been treating Daisuke protectively and hoped to save the cryopod for him, reluctantly and crudely euthanizes him with a fire axe before violently turning on Jimmy.\nFlashbacks to the days leading up to the crash reveal that the Tulpar crew were due to be laid off following their delivery; Curly breaks the news prematurely, distressing his crewmates as he is the only one who can financially support himself afterwards. Later, in a private conversation with Curly, Anya reveals that she is pregnant with Jimmy's child. Other interactions between Curly and Anya imply that Jimmy raped her. Curly attempts to ease tensions with Jimmy, only for Anya to reveal her pregnancy to Jimmy behind Curly's back. The stress of his impending layoff and the possibility of being held accountable for Anya's pregnancy ultimately drive Jimmy to crash the Tulpar in a failed murder-suicide bid.\nBack in the present, Jimmy breaks into the medical bay, where Anya is revealed to have killed herself via an overdose, and uses the ship's emergency revolver to kill Swansea, who condemns Jimmy's cowardice and selfishness in his last moments. With his sanity rapidly declining, Jimmy holds a mock birthday party with the crew's corpses, where he cuts off and consumes part of Curly's leg; he also force-feeds the captain his own flesh in a surreal hallucination. After a series of additional visions where he is accosted for his actions throughout the game and for his inability to take responsibility for them, Jimmy concludes that he can redeem himself if he ensures Curly's survival, placing him in the cryopod. He then apologizes to Curly for hurting him before killing himself with the revolver, believing that he successfully \"fixed\" their situation. The game's credits roll as Curly is placed into a 20-year cryosleep, his fate left uncertain.\nDevelopment and release\nThe team behind Mouthwashing includes producer Kai Moore, audio designer Martin Halldin, art and narrative designer Johanna Kasurinen, designer and programmer Jeffrey Tomec, and technical designer Dave van Egdom. The developers took inspiration from films including Alien, Event H",
    "Norwegian keyboard player and singer (born 1952)\nMusical artist\nStein Groven, born 22 February 1952), better known by his stage name Casino Steel, is a Norwegian-born keyboard player, singer and songwriter.\nHe has played in several different bands and collaborations within rock, punk and country in Norway, United Kingdom and the US, and has released several solo albums. He was inducted into the Norwegian Rockheim Hall of Fame in September 2021.\nBackground\nStein Groven grew up in Trondheim, Norway. From the age of 15 he played in various local bands, including Jane where his friend Geir Waade played drums. A few months before his 18th birthday Stein moved to London where both he and his friend Geir became active in the local music scene.\nLondon Years\nIn London Stein joined the band The Queen, which after an argument with a certain Freddie Mercury was renamed Hollywood Brats. When the band split up he briefly played with his friend Geir Waade in the band London SS before joining The Boys, which are still active. The Boys also released several Christmas themed recordings under the name The Yobs.\nPost punk career\nThe Boys disbanded in 1982 and around this time Stein moved back to Norway where he was later joined by his friend Gary Holton, with whom he released four albums at the start of the 1980s. The collaboration was very successful in Norway but went unnoticed in other countries.\nIn 1983 he started a collaboration with Norwegian artists Claudia Scott and Ottar \"Big Hand\" Johansen in the country trio Claudia / Big Hand / Casino. The trio released three records. They received the Norwegian music award Spellemannprisen in 1985 in the category roots & country for the album Oh Yeah! and was nominated for the Spellemannprisen in 1984 in the category country & western for Fools Never Learn.\nThe collaboration with Claudia Scott continued beyond the 80s, first as a duo and then in the band CCCP where Carlene Carter and John Payne were also members. In 1990, he released his first solo album, which was named Casino Steel. The following year he started the record company Revolution Records. In 2007, he started The Last Rock 'N' Roll Band together with, among others, Honest John Plain from The Boys.\nStein Groven received the veteran award at the Norwegian Gammleng Award in 2019 and was nominated for the Rockheim Hall of Fame in 2018 and 2019 before being inducted in 2021.\nIn 2002, he was sentenced to 120 days in prison for fraud in the Norwegian recording artist organisation GramArt where Stein Groven was the chairman of the board. The case received a lot of attention in the Norwegian media, as a number of well-known Norwegian musicians participated as witnesses.\nIn February 2022 Casino Steel was joined by many of his past bandmates and others he has worked with for a concert held in Olavshallen in his home town of Trondheim to celebrate his 70th birthday.\nThe Boys Reformed\nIn 1999 Stein Groven and most of the original members of The Boys reformed the band and they have remained active since then, mainly playing small shows in various locations in Europe and the Far East. The band released the album Punk Rock Menopause in 2014 where Stein (Casino Steel) co-composed all the songs. And they released the singles I'm A Believer and Organ Grinder in 2021 and 2023 respectively.\nDiscography\nAlbums\nSteelworks (1983)\nScott & Steel (1988), with Claudia Scott\nCasino Steel (1990)\nCasino Steel & The Bandits (1991)\nThe Wonderful World of Mr. Casino Steel (1991)\nOh Boy!

    "In organic chemistry, the Bruylants reaction (sometimes misspelled Bruylant) is a substitution reaction in which a Grignard reagent replaces a nitrile on a carbon that also has an amino group. It is useful for synthesizing phenylcyclidine and related dissociative anesthetics.\nUnlike a traditional Grignard reaction where the nucleophile attacks the nitrile carbon, here the nitrile itself is lost as a leaving group. The reaction is named for Pierre Bruylants (1855\u20131950), who first reported it in 1924.\nThe reaction mechanism appears to involve ejection of the nitrile to form an iminium that is then attacked by the Grignard rather than a direct displacement such as an SN2 reaction. This accounts for the importance of the alpha amino group and the absence of stereoselectivity on chiral reaction sites.\nModifications\n1,2,3-Triazole and related heterocycles have been used as safer alternatives to the nitrile, as they avoid the typical use of cyanide to form the nitrile.\nOrganolithium reagents can be used instead of the magesium-halide Grignard reagents, though they are more prone than Grignards to attack the nitrile itself.\n",
    "Lifestyle and Mental Health is the title of a 2011 review article published in the journal American Psychologist by Roger Walsh (MD, PhD, DHL). The article discusses categories of potential lifestyle changes to improve one's mental health along with supporting research. It is used in patient education. The article has garnered attention from editorials, books, and the medical literature. According to Google Scholar, it has been cited over 1050 times as of October 2024.\nBackground\nOther notable publications by Walsh prior to the article \"Lifestyle and Mental Health\" include the books Paths Beyond Ego: The Transpersonal Vision (1993, with Frances Vaughan), Essential Spirituality: The 7 Central Practices to Awaken Heart and Mind (2000), A Sociable God: Toward a New Understanding of Religion (2005, with Ken Wilber), and The World of Shamanism: New Views of an Ancient Tradition (2007). Additionally, Walsh's 2006 publication with Shapiro in American Psychologist, entitled \"The Meeting of Meditative Disciplines and Western Psychology: A Mutually Enriching Dialogue\" had garnered more than 1400 citations by October 2024 according to Google Scholar.\nThesis\nThe stated thesis of the article is that:\n\"Health professionals have significantly underestimated the importance of lifestyle for mental health. More specifically, mental health professionals have underestimated the importance of unhealthy lifestyle factors in contributing to multiple psychopathologies, as well as the importance of healthy lifestyles for treating multiple psychopathologies, for fostering psychological and social well-being, and for preserving and optimizing cognitive capacities and neural functions.\"\u2014\u200aWalsh, in Lifestyle and Mental Health (2011) p. 579\nTherapeutic lifestyle changes\nWalsh writes that therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLCs) can be effective, affordable, and stigma-free. They can boost self-esteem and also improve physical health. They can be enjoyable and thus potentially self-reinforcing. Walsh notes even clinicians can benefit from meditation given it can help cultivate \"calmness, empathy, and self-actualization.\" Walsh cites evidence suggesting that the positive effects of TLCs might even generate significant multiplier effects in society by positively impacting \"families, friends, and co-workers.\"\nExercise\nExercise is presented as \"a healthful, inexpensive, and insufficiently used treatment for a variety of psychiatric disorders.\" Exercise reduces the risk of depression, age-related cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease according to cross-sectional and prospective studies. \"In terms of therapeutic benefits, responsive disorders include depression, anxiety, eating, addictive, and body dysmorphic disorders. Exercise also reduces chronic pain ... and some symptoms of schizophrenia.\"\nNutrition and diet\nWalsh emphasizes a \"rainbow diet\" mainly consisting of fruits and vegetables (a multicolored plant-based diet) with some salmon-like fish content, for omega-3s. Walsh endorses calorie restriction given obesity may be associated with reduced cognitive function, reduced gray matter, and reduced white matter. Walsh notes that \"fish and fish oil\" are fundamental for mental health given that \"they supply essential omega-3 fatty acids, especially EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)\" for neural functioning.\nNature\nTime in nature has healing and restorative effects, but modern societies tend to isolate us from sunlight, box us away from nature, and have reduced us, through digital immersion, to being people who \"have become the tools of their tools.\" In contrast, time in nature is associated with \"greater cognitive, attentional, emotional, spiritual, and subjective well-being.\"\nRelationships\nOne's social connections are a cornerstone of one's wellness, and \"the health risk of social isolation is comparable to the risks of smoking, high blood pressure, and obesity.\" Benefits of social connections include \"enhanced happiness, quality of life, resilience,  cognitive capacity.\" Walsh states that helping patients improve their interpersonal relationships should be a standard part of mental health care.\nRecreation and enjoyable activities\nWalsh encourages participation in activities that involve play, humor, and the arts, noting that the evidence suggests that \"enjoyable recreational activities, and the positive emotions that ensue, foster multiple psychological and physical benefits.\"\nRelaxation and stress management\nGiven that chronic stress is a health threat, Walsh highlights the importance of stress management. Stress relieving modalities include psychotherapy, aforementioned TLCs, and self-management skills. Potential modalities included under the rubric of self-management skills are somatic therapies, including muscle relaxation techniques, self-hypnosis, guided imagery, tai chi, qigong, and yoga. Meditation is presented as particularly beneficial\u2014more effective than psychotherapy.\nReligious and s",

    "Indian politician (born 1964)\nSajjad Ahmed Kichloo (born 20 June 1964) is an Indian politician and former member of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly who served as a State Home minister in the first Omar Abdullah ministry in 2009. A member of the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, he was elected as a member of legislative assembly during the 2002 and the 2008 legislative assembly elections from Kishtwar constituency. He also served as a member of the Legislative Council in 2015, representing Kishtwar district.\nCareer\nKachloo was born to Bashir Ahmad Kichloo on 20 June 1974 in Kishtwar, India. His father was also a member of the National Conference (NC). Kichloo entered politics following his father's death. He began his career in 1996 as the tehsil president of the NC's youth wing. In 1998, he became the district president of the NC in Kishtwar. He contested the 2002 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election from the Kishtwar constituency. He was re-elected in the 2008 Assembly elections.\nIn 2013, Kichloo was appointed as the minister of State for Home in the government of Jammu and Kashmir.\nControversies\nAllegations of assault\nKichloo's political career was marred by controversy when he was accused of assaulting Riaz Ahmed Choudhary, the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Kishtwar Development Authority, during preparations for an official visit by the then chief minister Omar Abdullah to Kishtwar district in April 2013. Choudhary alleged Kichloo's misconduct and ordered his arrest, a claim that led to media attention and public scrutiny.\nOn 18 April 2022, a Jammu and Kashmir court directed police to register a case against Kichloo.\nRole in 2013 clashes\nKachloo resigned as the State Home minister in August 2013, following allegations of his involvement in the 2013 Kishtwar clashes on 9 August 2013. The violence resulted in the deaths of three people and the destruction of over 150 shops and houses, attributed to the administration's failure, including Kachloo to control the situation. He was later exonerated of any involvement in the clashes that occurred on 9 August 2013. The Justice R.C. Gandhi Commission of Enquiry, a one-man commission led by Justice (retired) R.C. Gandhi, determined that Kichloo was not guilty of any partisan conduct during the incident.\nInvolvement in land scam\nFurther information: Roshni Act controversy\nIn November 2020, Kichloo was implicated in the Roshni Land scam following the Jammu and Kashmir High Court's nullification of the Roshni Act of 2001.\nIn October 2021, the Jammu and Kashmir administration released a list of beneficiaries linked to illegal land allocations made under the Roshni Act. Originally intended to regularize encroachments on state land, the act faced scrutiny for allegedly facilitating the illegal transfer of land to influential individuals, including politicians, bureaucrats, and businessmen.\nKichloo's name surfaced in connection with this scandal alongside other prominent figures, indicating a widespread network of beneficiaries involved in the controversial land deals. The initial disclosures by the Jammu and Kashmir administration included Kichloo's name.\n",

The dam also supports the proposed Ranchi Smart City, aiming to supply an additional 12 million liters of water. However, it faces challenges, particularly during summer when water levels drop significantly.\nManaged by the Jharkhand Urban Infrastructure Development Company (JUIDCO), the Dhurwa Dam has a reservoir capacity of about 1.37\u00a0km3, crucial for domestic use and irrigation. The dam not only plays a vital role in the local economy but also attracts tourists for its scenic beauty and recreational opportunities. It provides a serene environment for visitors to enjoy picnics and nature walks. While ongoing water scarcity raises concerns about meeting the growing urban population's demands, the Jharkhand government has proposed linking additional water sources to ensure a reliable supply for both current residents and future developments.\nSee also\nList of dams and reservoirs in India",
    "\nThe October 2024 Friday Prayer in Tehran took place at the Grand Mosalla mosque, attended by thousands of worshippers. Khamenei delivered two sermons in Persian and Arabic, lasting 40 minutes in 4 October.\nThe Friday prayer took place a few days after Iran's missile attack on Israel. The last time Khamenei delivered the Friday prayer sermon was shortly after the Assassination of Qasem Soleimani in 2020. In his sermon, Khamenei described Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 as a legitimate action and expressed his support for Arab groups engaged in the conflict with Israel.\nSenior Iranian officials at the Friday Prayers\nThe president of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian, the head of Parliament and senior military commanders, were seated in the front row of the ceremony.\nBackground\nFurther information: 2024 Hezbollah headquarters strike\nOn the morning of Friday, October 3, 2024, a ceremony was held at Grand Mosalla mosque in Tehran to commemorate Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon. Following this ceremony, Khamenei led the Friday prayers and delivered two sermons. The prayers took place three days after Iran's missile attack on Israel. This attack was a response to Israel's recent actions in Lebanon and Palestine, as well as the killing of senior commanders from Iran, Hamas (Ismail Haniyeh), and Hezbollah.\nContent\nIn his Friday prayer sermons, Khamenei praised Iran's missile attack in October 2024, describing it as a brilliant action. He referred to Israel as the wild dog of the United States. Khamenei emphasized that the primary issue he wishes to address is the unity of Islamic countries. He stated that all Islamic nations, from Afghanistan to Yemen and from Iran to Gaza and Lebanon, must unite against Israel. According to a state television report, Khamenei announced that if necessary, Iran would repeat the October attack.\nIn a national television report, a woman dressed in white cloth\u2014a symbol of death\u2014held a child in her arms and stated, \"We are not afraid of any threat.\nReaction\nThe number of participants in this Friday prayer is estimated to be around a thousand Iranian individuals.\nAl-Jazeera correspondent Resul Serdar reported that Khamenei conveyed a message to Israel by conducting Friday prayers during this critical period, indicating that the Iranian authorities are not seeking refuge. He believes that Khamenei's emphasis on unity, amidst the heightened possibility of war, serves as a call for a coordinated response against Israel.\nAccording to a BBC report, following the assassination of Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, there were indications that Ayatollah Khamenei had altered his location. However, by attending Friday prayers, Khamenei demonstrated that he has no intention of going into hiding.\nThe Guardian reported that the leader of Iran demonstrated the support of the Iranian people for the airstrike on Israel by gathering a large crowd at the Grand Mosalla mosque in Tehran. This show of solidarity followed the killing of Haniyeh, Hassan Nasrallah, and Abbas Nilforoushan, one of the commanders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nSina Azdi, an adjunct professor at George Washington University and an expert on Iran's national security, stated that Ali Khamenei conveyed messages in his speech emphasizing solidarity with the authorities and Arab groups, as well as the necessity for domestic support in response to Iran's actions against Israel. Azdi noted that Khamenei's remarks suggest that Iran responds in a rational manner and will not act impulsively; however, in the event of an Israeli attack, Iran will certainly retaliate.\n",

After her death, Queen Katranide was buried with great pomp and church rites in the cemetery of the cemetery next to the Catholic Church of Ani. At the beginning of the 20th century, when a group of archaeologists, the orientalist Joseph Orbeli, opened the tomb of Katranides and the skeleton of the queen was revealed, they saw that the queen's legs were crossed exactly as the legs of Christ were crucified. This was his last wish. Katranide decorated the Cathedral of Ani with \"apricot blossom gold\" fabrics, silver and gold vessels. A man-sized silver cross was erected on the dome of the temple, and King Smbat the Cosmonaut brought a giant crystal torch from India.\nExcept Cathedral of Ani, this was not her only endeavor.

    "\nThe National Laboratory of Building and Public Works (Laboratoire Nationale du B\u00e2timent et des Travaux Publics), or LNBTP, is a public company that conducts tests on soils and matierials used in conxtruction projects in Burundi.\nFoundation\nThe National Laboratory of Building and Public Works (LNBTP) was created by Decree No. 100/129 of 14 December 1982 with the status of a technical department.\nBy Decree No. 100/114 of 2 August 1990, it became an administration with legal personality, its own assets and management autonomy.\nIts board of directors has five members including the director, who are appointed by decree on the proposal of the Minister in charge of public works.\nThe original mission of the LNBTP was to undertake all tests, studies and research concerning soils and construction materials for buildings and public works.\nHistory\nMinisterial order No. 720/158 of 18 July 1994 authorized involvement of private laboratories in execution of public works and building contracts awarded by the State. The private laboratories had to provide technical references and have sufficient and experienced staff. The LNBTP was the authority in assessing the quality of the services of private laboratories.\nMinisterial Order No. 720/129 of 9 March 2001, still in force as of 2018, gave the LNBTP a monopoly on studies and geotechnical control of soils and materials  for execution of public works and building contracts awarded in the name of the State, These must include a clause specifying the nature and frequency of the laboratory's interventions. Approved private laboratories could intervene in public contracts as self-control laboratories for companies or private individuals.\nA 2004 World Bank report noted that LNBTP functions included supervising technical and geo-technical studies for roads.\nIt had experienced and well-trained engineers, but did not have the capacity to plan and lead road programs executed by the private sector.\nIn July 2014 Ernest Mberamiheto, Minister of Good Governance and Privatization, answered questions in a National Assembly debate.\nCompanies that had been recommended for privatization over a five-year period included SOSUMO, SIP, SRDI , OTB, ALM, COGERCO\n, LNBTP and ONATOUR.\nIt was recommended that measures be put in place to prevent the assets of these companies being abused in the interim before privatization occurred.\nAs of 2018 the laboratory had 48 permanent employees including 6 engineers, 10 technicians and 19 technical assistants.\nIt was poorly funded, relying on fees and external aid, and faced competition from private laboratories.\nThe LNBTP had a monopoly on tests relating to buildings, but the market was free and subject to competition for other types of works.\nIn 2019 by Decree No.100/079 of 24 May 2019 the LNBTP was merged with other entities into OBUHA, which was in charge of Urban Planning, Housing, and Construction.\nThe other merged entities were SIP, ECOSAT, Municipal Technical Services (SETEMU), General Directorate of the Building (DGB) and General Directorate of Urban Planning and Habitat (DGUH).\nThe new organization was responsible for sanitation, housing, and urban planning and development.\nIn July 2021 over 30 employees of the former LNBTP were dismissed. \nThey were told that their contract had terminated when the decree establishing OBUHA had been signed, although their salaries had continued to be paid.\nThey could take a recruitment test if they wanted to continue with OBUHA, join the civil service as new exmployees with no recognition of their experience, or accept severance pay.\nThe employees were not told how to hand over, or to whom.\nNotes\n",

    "Brace roots (roots developing from aerial stem nodes) are a type of adventitious root that develop from aboveground stem nodes in many monocots. Anchorage, water and nutrient acquisition are the most important functions of roots. Thus, plants develop roots that maximize these functions for productivity and survival. In cereals such as maize, brace roots are one of the roots that contribute to these important functions. Brace roots develop constitutively in whorls from stem nodes, with the lowest whorl being the first to develop, enter the soil, branch out, and contribute the most to anchorage. Subsequent whorls may enter the soil and contribute to anchorage and resource acquisition, but they may also remain aerial. While these aerial roots do not contribute as much to anchorage, they could contribute in other ways such as forming an association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\nBrace roots may remain aerial or penetrate the soil as they perform root functions such as anchorage and resource acquisition. Although brace root development in soil or aerial environments influences function, a lot is still unknown about how their anatomy, architecture and development contributes to their function. The physiology of brace roots is directly linked to their anatomy, architecture, and development. The dynamic interplay of internal regulators such as transcription factors, miRNAs, and phytohormones, lay the foundation for brace root development. Once brace roots emerge from stem nodes, the influence of external factors such as the availability of water, nutrients, light and humidity become prominent. Therefore, a combination of internal and external factors determine the overall organization, shape, and size of individual roots (root system architecture) and, as a result, root function.\nOverview\nTwo types of brace roots as shown in maize.\nRoots may develop from the embryo (contained in a seed) or post-embryonically (after germination). In young plants, root functions such as anchorage and resource acquisition (finding and taking up water and nutrients) are carried out by embryonic roots. Embryonic roots include primary roots and in some plants, seminal roots. In eudicot species (plants that have their embryo enclosed in two seed leaves), older plants continue to rely on a primary tap root for root functions with contribution from post-embryonic lateral roots. In contrast, monocot root functions are mostly carried out by post-embryonic nodal roots. Nodal roots are adventitious roots (roots originating from non-root tissues) that develop from stem nodes below (called crown roots) or above (called brace roots) the soil. Although many adventitious roots develop in response to stress conditions such as flooding or wounding, some adventitious roots develop as a normal (i.e., constitutive) part of the plant life cycle. A specialized type of constitutive adventitious root that originates from aboveground nodes in monocots, such as maize, sorghum, setaria and sugar cane, is called a brace root.\nThe term \"brace root\u201d has been inconsistently used. In some contexts, the term is used for only aboveground nodal roots that remain aerial and could provide support after tipping. This notion dates back to the work of Martin and Hershey in 1935 and was further expounded by Hoppe et al. 1986. However, over time, the term has evolved to encompass all aboveground nodal roots or sometimes only those that enter the soil.\nBrace roots develop starting from the lowest stem node (node closest to the soil), where multiple roots emerge arranged in a whorl around the stem. Depending on the plant and the environment, brace root whorls may develop from two, three, or more nodes up the stem. Due to the subsequent nature of brace root development, the brace root whorls that develop from higher stem nodes may remain aerial throughout the plant lifespan and are referred to as aerial brace roots while the brace root whorls closest to the ground penetrate the soil and are referred to as soil brace roots.\nBrace root anatomy\nIn maize, aerial brace roots, soil brace roots, and crown roots exhibit distinctive phenotypic traits. Anatomical differences start as early as the primordium (immature organ), where the shape of the root cap within primordia differs between belowground crown roots and aboveground brace roots. The crown root primordia has a conical root cap similar to the primary root, whereas the brace root primordia has a flattened root cap that extends further along the primordia length. As brace roots penetrate the soil, the root cap gradually resembles that of crown roots.\nIn general, the aerial portion of brace roots is different from the soil portion of brace roots, with the soil portion more closely resembling the crown roots. For example, the aerial segments of brace roots are green or purple in color and become colorless when the roots penetrate the soil. In addition, the aerial segments of brace roots have epidermis (outermost cell layer) that is ",

    "There are two separately organised and run Australian motor racing series featuring cars designed and built for the TA2 class of the American Trans-Am series.\nWhile independently run, both series feature almost identical technical regulations and cars used for one series can be used for the other.\nTA2 racing cars in Australia\nThe TA2 racing cars used in Australia are manufactured by Howe Racing Enterprises and use a standardised Chevrolet LS3 race engine prepared by McLaren Motor Engineering, a South Australian-based engineering firm (unrelated to the British McLaren Group). Other TA2 chassis and engines used in the US are not permitted in either Australian racing series. The regulations for both series specify that most components of the cars must be unmodified and replacement parts purchased from the distributor of the cars, PBR Distributions.\nThe cars used in both series series are identical spaceframe chassisbuilt by Howe Racing Enterprises and use a modified GM LS3 engine prepared by McLaren Motor Engineering, a South Australian motor reconditioning and preparation firm (unrelated to the British McLaren Group).\nThe engine produces 525 horsepower (390 kW), with a four-speed H-pattern manual transmission, which is unusual in modern racing vehicles that typically use a sequential manual transmission or a semi-automatic transmission. For 2025, teams will have the option of running one of two gearboxes, one made by G-Force and another by Holinger, with the Holinger reported be more expensive but more durable when used aggressively.  The minimum weight of the cars (including driver) is 1250 kilograms, making the cars somewhat large and heavy for dedicated racing vehicles.  The power and weight figures are roughly similar to Group GT3 racing vehicles.\nThe cars feature fibreglass bodies that resemble either the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro or Dodge Challenger; the underlying chassis and engine of the cars is the same regardless of the body. The cars reportedly produce around 100\u00a0kg of aerodynamic downforce at the rear, which aids cornering speeds, but is much lower than many sports car classes (a road-registerable Porsche 911 GT3 RS is capable of producing a total of 860\u00a0kg of downforce at its top speed\nThe cross-ply tyres are supplied by Hoosier Racing Tire.  Only one type of slick, and one rain tire, are permitted for use, and a limited number of tyres are supplied by the category manager for each race meeting.  The use of cross-ply tires is to make the racing more entertaining, as the inferior tyre performance (as compared to more modern radial tyres) makes the cars more difficult to drive and makes managing tire wear important for drivers.\nThe cars have disc brakes with control brake pads and discs supplied by the distributor. Like most racing categories, they do not use any electronic driving aids such as anti-lock brakes or traction control.\nLap records for Australian TA2 cars are generally slightly faster than TCR, but significantly slower than Porsche Carrera Cup or the Supercars Championship\nTA2 muscle car series\nMain article: TA2 Racing Muscle Car Series\nThe TA2 Racing Muscle Car Series has run annually since 2017, and is the featured category in the Hi-Tec Oils Super Series, a series of race meetings sanctioned by the Australian Auto Sport Alliance.\nThe races are televised nationally on the free-to-air network SBS.\nTrans-Am Series\nMain article: Australian National Trans-Am Series\nThe Australian National Trans-Am Series (currently known as the Trico Trans-Am Series after its naming right sponsor) is run by Australian Racing Group (ARG) and is sanctioned by Motorsport Australia. \nARG is the exclusive Australian licensee of Trans-Am trademarks, and hence is able to use the name in the series they run.\nIt has run annually since 2020 as part of the SpeedSeries, a series of circuit racing events run by ARG, also featuring the TCR Australia Touring Car Series and other support categories.

    "Breed of cattle\nBadri is an indigenous breed of cattle found in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, India. It is locally known as Pahadi due to its adaptation to the hilly terrain of the region. It derives its name from Badrinath Temple, a Hindu temple in Uttarakhand. Badri has become the first cattle breed in Uttarakhand to receive certification from the ICAR's National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR). As of 2022, the population of Badri cows in Uttarakhand is estimated to be around 700,000, with approximately 479,000 of them being female.\nThe cattle are primarily used for milk production and agricultural purposes, with the milk being rich in A2 proteins, which is considered healthier than A1 proteins found in some other breeds.\nHistory\nIn 1988, a conservation initiative for Badri cattle began at the Animal Breeding Farm in Nariyalgaon, Champawat, which covers an area of 127 acres.\nIn 2011, Trivendra Singh Rawat, the then Minister of Animal Husbandry of Uttarakhand, renamed the local breed of cows as Badri during a visit to Champawat. In 2012, a cattle breeding center was established in Nariyal village, Champawat, as part of an initiative to conserve and promote this indigenous breed, which has 137 Badri cows as of July 2016. The Badri cow was officially recognized as an indigenous cattle breed by the Department of Agricultural Research in August 2016.\nIn November 2022, officials from Uttarakhand's animal husbandry department proposed using sex-sorted semen technology and embryo transfer methods to improve the genetic quality and production of Badri cattle. These proposals were presented during a session with Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and state officials.\nCharacteristics\nBadri cattle are relatively small in size, with varied coat colors ranging from black, brown, red, and white to gray. The horns of Badri cows are curved upward and inward, which helps them navigate the rough and uneven terrain of the hills.\n",

    "\nThe Panda Project, Inc., was an American computer company active from 1992 to 2000. It was best known for the Archistrat family of high-end workstations and servers, which made use of a custom, 256-bit backplane design accommodating a number of computer architectures. The Archistrat was short-lived and sold in low quantity.\nHistory\nThe Panda Project, Inc., was founded in April 1992 in Boca Raton, Florida, by Stanford W. Crane Jr.:\u200a7E\u200a Crane had previously worked for AMP Incorporated and Molex Corporation, two major companies in the field of electrical connectors, in the 1970s and 1980s. In the mid-1980s, Crane founded his first startup, Crane Electronics, to compete with his former employers; that company declared bankruptcy in 1986. Six years later, Crane founded Panda Project in Boca Raton, occupying the 1,900-square-foot former offices of Don Estridge, one of the major architects of the IBM Personal Computer. In naming his company, Crane chose a non-technical name to evoke an air of secrecy and to ward off competitors of the company's true nature.\nWithin two years of founding Panda Project, Crane had managed to court many former employees of IBM, including Joseph A. Sarubbi, another architect of IBM's PC XT; Bruce Smith, a project manager of the PC division at IBM; and Greg Simco, a technical lead for IBM's OS/2 operating system. By March 1995, Panda Project had managed to accrue over a dozen further IBM alumni, including H.\u00a0L. \"Sparky\" Sparks, a senior manager at IBM who had helped established the first dealer networks for the IBM PC back in 1981.\nBetween March and May 1994, Panda Project began preparing to file its initial public offering, which commenced in the third week of May 1994. The $10\u00a0million raised from its IPO was funneled back into Panda Project to fund the company's research and development for computer hardware products.\nPanda Project's first product was VSPA (Very Small Peripheral Array), a packaging technology for surface-mount integrated circuits. Announced in September 1994, VSPA allowed for a 60-to-70-percent reduction in the size of ICs versus those housed in contemporaneous plastic quad flat packs (PQFPs). The VSPA package was a three-dimensional design making use of overlapping, receding carriers (similar in shape to a step pyramid) in order to pack more leads into the same surface area. Panda Project co-developed VSPA with IBM Microelectronics at their Manufacturing Technology Center facility in Boca Raton. The machinery to build VSPA ICs was delivered to Panda Project from IBM in April 1995, and the first successful prototypes of a VSPA graphics chip were demonstrated to Cirrus Logic, a prospective licensee by the end of May 1995. The technology was first licensed in 1996 to AMP Incorporated, Crane's former employer.\nIn 1995, Panda Project introduced their first computer system, the Archistrat, which was a family of Intel x86-based workstations and servers featuring a custom backplane design whose connectors were 256\u00a0bits wide and made use of Panda Project's patented Compass connector design. The main components of the computer, including the CPU, chipset, and PCI and ISA expansion slots, resided on a single board that connected to the backplane, while the RAM was contained on its own separate board connected to the backplane, as was its I/O connectors. This arrangement was intended to make the computer easier to upgrade and resilient against obsolescence, since it could theoretically accommodate other 32-bit computer architectures such as PowerPC and 64-bit architectures such as DEC Alpha by just replacing the CPU board. The Compass connector was a pin grid array design, in which each pin is split into four and arranged into quadrant occupying the footprint of the average pin on a normal PGA.

    "American environmental activist\nCharles Frederick Wurster Jr. (August 1, 1930 \u2013 July 6, 2023) was an environmental activist, a professor of environmental science, and one of the founders of the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). The EDF founders, non-lawyers except for Victor Yannacone, were scientists, environmentalists, and birders, but they were instrumental in the intiation of environmental law and legal action against the use of DDT.\nEducation and career\nA native Philadelphian, Wurster grew up in Olney, Philadelphia. He began his lifelong involvement in birdwatching when he was a teenager in high school. After high school education at Germantown Friends School, he graduated in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Haverford College. One summer during his youth, he worked in an Alaskan gold mine. After earning a master's degree in organic chemistry from the University of Delaware in 1954, he graduated in 1957 with a Ph.D. in organic chemistry from Stanford University. His thesis advisor was Harry Stone Mosher. For the academic year 1957\u201358, Wurster was a Fulbright Fellow in Innsbruck, Austria. Wurster was employed from 1959 to 1962 as a researcher by Monsanto and from 1962 to 1965 as a postdoctoral research at Dartmouth College. At Stony Brook University (SBU), he became an assistant professor in 1965 and retired in 1994 as professor emeritus in SBU's School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences. In 2009, SBU awarded him an honorary degree. He was a visiting professor in Australia, Norway, and South Korea.\nIn 2015, Oxford University Press published Wurster's book about the DDT struggles during the 1960s and 1970s.\nResearch, environmental activism, and public education\nThe research of Wurster and his collaborators provided scientific evidence for the environmental dangers caused by chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides. He participated in, and reported on, government hearings that resulted in various bans against the use of DDT. After DDT bans prompted by groups such as the EDF, many bird species quickly recovered.\nA 1969 paper on DDT residues in connection with fiddler crabs was coauthored by Wurster, George M. Woodwell, and William E. Odum (who was the first son of Eugene Odum).\nIn 1976 Wurster and Arthur P. Cooley suggested that, in many high school and college courses, students' writing of term papers might be replaced by students' writing of petitions. Such petitions to federal, state, or local governments might request changes in policies with environmentally harmful consequences. Wurster and Cooley argued that motivation of students can be enhanced by real-world projects \u2014 furthermore, writing petitions can teach the students about their rights and responsibilities as citizens and how to participate in government.\nWurster had many collaborators for his numerous scientific articles. R. George Rowland (1941\u20131990) was often one of Wurster's coauthors. In 1984, Wurster, Rowland, and Paul Lundy published a marine algal bioassay for detecting toxic chemical pollutants.\nWurster was a world class birder and leader for ornithology and ecology tours in the Arctic, Antarctic, Africa, and South America. He made an appearance in the NOVA television documentary Return of the Osprey, originally broadcast in the United States on March 18, 1986.\nWurster served on EDF's board of trustees for over 55 years. He also helped to establish the Environmental Defence Society in New Zealand and served on the board of trustees of the Defenders of Wildlife.\nDeath\nA lifelong asthmatic who never smoked, Wurster died at his daughter's home in Arlington, Virginia, from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nFamily\nWurster's first wife was Dorothy Hadley Burster-Hill (1932\u20132007), a cytogeneticist, an authory on the chromosomes of carnivores, and a faculty member in the Darmouth Medical School's department of pathology. Before their divorce, Charles and Doris Wurster had a son Steven, who became a woodworker living in McCall, Idaho. Wurster's second wife was Eva Tank-Nielsen, a Norwegian diplomat. Before their divorce, they had a son Erik and a daughter Nina. Nina Wurster made her career in healthcare, but she and her children participate as volunteers for EcoAction Arlington. Erik Wurster became an expert in promoting sustainable energy projects. When Wurster died at age 92 in 2023, he was survived by his three children, four grandchildren, and his longtime companion Marie Gladwish, an artist and world traveler.\nSelected publications\nDurham, Lois J.; Wurster, Charles F.; Mosher, Harry S.

    "Hermann August Eidmann (21 February 1897 \u2013 4 September 1949) was a German forest zoologist and a professor at the forest institute in Hannoversch M\u00fcnden and also served in the Reich Institut for forest research in Hamburg-Reinbek. He was the author of a textbook of entomology and had a special interest in ants.\nEidmann was born near Alsfeld in Hesse to forester Hermann (1862\u20131932) and Maria Paulina n\u00e9e Rouge (1867\u20131947). He grew up exploring forests as a boy and went to study natural sciences at Giessen and Munich. He received a doctorate from Munich under Richard Hertwig. He then became Hertwig's assistant and later worked under Karl Escherich and habilitated in 1925. In 1924 he studied the ant fauna of Spain and three years later went to Shanghai as a professor of biology at the Tongji University but political turmoil led to his return in a few months. He travelled through Japan and Manchuria on his return. In 1929 he went to the forestry institute (formerly the K\u00f6niglich Preu\u00dfische Forstakademie) at Hannoversch M\u00fcnden to succeed Ludwig Rhumbler as head of zoology. He went on research trips around the world and developed the department of forest zoology. He attended the 4th International Entomological Congress where he spoke on the beneficial impacts of ants like Formica rufa for forestry. In 1933 he was a signatory to the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State. He published a textbook of entomology in 1941. From 1942 he also directed the zoology department of the Reichsinstitut f\u00fcr ausl\u00e4ndische und koloniale Forstwirtschaft in Hamburg-Reinbek.\nEidmann married Hilda Bach in 1922 and they had two daughters.

    "For other uses, see Kitab al-Tawhid.\nKitab at-Tawheed (Arabic: \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f) (Book of Monotheism) is a Sunni book about monotheism in the Athari school of thought. The book is the primary source for Wahhabi beliefs on monotheism. The book was written by the Hanbali scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab.\nHistory\nFollowing early education in Medina, Ibn \u02bfAbd-al-Wahhab traveled outside of the Arabian Peninsula, venturing first to Basra which was still an active center of Islamic culture. During his stay in Basra, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab studied Hadith and Fiqh under the Islamic scholar Muhammad al-Majmu'i. In Basra, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab came into contact with Shi'is and would write a treatise repudiating the theological doctrines of Rafidah, an extreme sect of Shiism. He also became influenced by the writings of Hanbali theologian Ibn Rajab (d. 1393 C.E/ 795 A.H) such as \"Kalimat al-Ikhlas\" which inspired Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's seminal treatise \"Kitab al-Tawhid\".\nThe treatise was banned in Russia on 16 July 2007 due to it being labelled \"extremist\" by the Russian government, alongside several other books of Muslim scholars, such as the Risala-i Nur Collection written by Said Nurs\u00ee. Nafigullah Ashirov, chairman of the 'Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the Asian Part of Russia,' strongly condemned the ban and criticized the Russian government for fostering intolerance against Muslim literature.\nSummary\nOriginal corpus of Kitab al-Tawhid (The Book of Monotheism) written by Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab on display, 2018 in National Museum of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh\nThe book focuses on how God is one and that God should only be worshipped alone without any middleman (called monotheism). It also disapproves of the worship of more than one God (which is called polytheism or shirk) and also refutes innovation within Islam by strictly following the Qur'an and hadith. The book also tries to show the dangers of polytheism to the reader and the punishment for polytheism in Islam. The book also condemns the use of black magic or fortune telling (both called sihr or shirk) in any form such as amulets and astrology.\nMuhammad Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab sought to revive and purify Islam from what he perceived as non-Islamic popular religious beliefs and practices by returning to what, he believed, were the fundamental principles of the Islamic religion. His works were generally short, full of quotations from the Qur'an and Hadith, such as his main and foremost theological treatise, Kit\u0101b at-Taw\u1e25\u012bd (Arabic: \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f; \"The Book of Oneness\"). He taught that the primary doctrine of Islam was the uniqueness and oneness of God (tawhid), and denounced those religious beliefs and practices widespread amongst the people of Najd. Following Ibn Taymiyya's teachings on Tawhid, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab believed that much of Najd had descended into superstitious folk religion akin to the period of Jahiliyya  (pre-Islamic era) and denounced much of their beliefs as polytheism (shirk). He associated such practices with the culture of Taqlid (imitation to established customs) adored by pagan-cults of Jahiliyya era. Based on the doctrine of Tawhid espoused in Kitab al-Tawhid, the followers of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab referred themselves by the designation \"Al-Muwahhidun\" (Unitarians).\nThe \"core\" of Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab's teaching is found in Kit\u0101b at-Taw\u1e25\u012bd, a theological treatise which draws from material in the Qur'an and the recorded doings and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the Hadith literature. It preaches that worship in Islam includes conventional acts of worship such as the five daily prayers (Salat); fasting (Sawm); supplication (Dua); seeking protection or refuge (Istia'dha); seeking help (Ist'ana and Istigatha) of Allah.\nAccording to the political scientist Dore Gold, Muhammad ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab presented a strong anti-Christian and anti-Judaic stance in his main theological treatise Kit\u0101b at-Taw\u1e25\u012bd, describing the followers of both Christian and Jewish faiths as sorcerers who believe in devil-worship, and by citing a hadith attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad he stated that capital punishment for the sorcerer is \"that he be struck with the sword\". Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab asserted that both the Christian and Jewish religions had improperly made the graves of their prophet into places of worship and warned Muslims not to imitate this practice. Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab concluded that \"The ways of the People of the Book are condemned as those of polytheists.\"\nIbn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab had believed that visiting the tomb of Muhammad was a righteous deed, referring to it as \"among the best of deeds\" while condemning its excesses.\n",

    "US scheduled airline (1968\u20131981)\nNot to be confused with the earlier Mackey Airlines of the same founder, that operated similar routes from 1953 to 1967 and merged with Eastern Air Lines\nBeech 99 at Fort Lauderdale 1971. Note the \"Air Commuter\" titles\nCV-440 at Fort Lauderdale 1975\nDC-6B at Miami 1975\nDC-8-51 at Las Vegas 1980\nMackey International (MI) was a US airline, initially flying under commuter regulations until it was certificated in 1978 as an international scheduled airline by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the now-defunct Federal agency that, until 1979, tightly regulated almost all commercial US air transportation. MI's founder was Joseph C. Mackey, who earlier founded Mackey Airlines, which flew similar routes until sold to Eastern Air Lines in 1967. Through 1978, MI flew between Florida, the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos and Haiti under a number of names, including Mackey International Air Taxi, Mackey International Air Commuter and Mackey International Airlines. However, the legal name remained Mackey International. MI grew during the early 1970s but never achieved profitability. In 1977, its offices were destroyed by a terrorist bomb.\nIn December 1978, MI filed for bankruptcy. Control passed to a third party, which substantially mismanaged the carrier. In 1980, MI briefly flew jets from Florida to Las Vegas. The carrier stopped operations in October 1981 and stopped defending a CAB fitness investigation, which resulted in a January 1982 revocation of its certificate.\nHistory\nStartup\nJoseph C. Mackey was the founder of Mackey Airlines, which he sold to Eastern Air Lines in 1967, as a result of which he had a five-year noncompete, so in starting Mackey International he was limited to routes Eastern was not flying. But Eastern flew only to Nassau and Freeport and MI started with 15-seat Beech 99 turboprops and thus focused on smaller routes than Eastern.  MI was incorporated in Florida on 11 July 1968 and first flight was August 16, 1968. The airline was just one division of Mackey International, which at the outset also included a realtor division and a property development division all focused on the Bahamas. Initially the airline styled itself Mackey International Air Taxi, which fit the role. The Civil Aeronautics Board carved out an exception to its otherwise tight control of commercial air transport for airlines that operated only aircraft under a specific weight, an exception described in Part 298 of the CAB's economic regulations. Such airlines were known as air taxis, Part 298 carriers, commuter airlines or similar. \nMain article: Civil Aeronautics Board \u00a7\u00a0Air taxis\nGrowth\nA 1969 timetable shows nonstop service from Miami to nine points in Bahamas, none of them Freeport or Nassau. Fort Lauderdale was served almost exclusively as a connection over Miami, except to Sarasota and Ft Myers. In 1969, MI signed a cooperation agreement to work with Eastern, taking over a few routes that Eastern did not want to serve. Mackey International also executed an initial public offering, raising $1.6 million. In 1970, MI (with the support of Eastern) obtained a CAB exemption to fly 44 seat aircraft (i.e. go above the size limits for aircraft that Part 298 carriers could fly as of right) between Miami, Ft Lauderdale and West Palm Beach and a dozen Bahamas points, none of them Freeport or Nassau. This allowed MI to operate Convair 440s. This exemption was expanded through 1973 until it covered 49 markets. Then, in 1974, the CAB extended the 44 seat exemption to cover the Turks and Caicos, and expanded the exemption to allow MI to fly between Miami, Ft Lauderdale and West Palm Beach and certain points in the Bahamas, none of them Freeport or Nassau, with 90 seat aircraft. The CAB acknowledged that this was a very big aircraft for a Part 298 carrier to fly, and put limits on its use, including prohibiting it from flying charters. The CAB justified it in part by the fuel savings MI would realize (this was in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. This explains why a commuter carrier was flying DC-6s between Florida and the Bahamas.\nA 1970 timetable billed the airline as Mackey International Air Commuter. A 1975 timetable (for Mackey International Airlines) shows service from Miami to seven Bahamas points (other than Freeport or Nassau) and three in Turks and Caicos, many served on a multistop basis. There was substantial nonstop service from Freeport to West Palm Beach and Ft Lauderdale and some nonstops between Nassau and Fort Lauderdale. Only the three south Florida cities were served in the US.\nTerrorist bombing\nSouth Florida was beset by Cuba-related terrorist activities in the mid-1970s, with dozens of bombings, leading The Miami News to call it the explosion capital of the country. Mackey International attracted the attention of the bombers by attempting to start service to Cuba. On 25 May 1977, an early-morning bomb blast destroyed MI's Fort Lauderdale's offices, without injury as the last employees had go",

    "This article is about the real tennis British Open at the Queen's Club. For other uses, see British Open (disambiguation).\nTennis tournament\nThe British Open is a real tennis tournament, with the men's draw held annually at Queen's Club in London, England, and the women's draw held at the Seacourt Tennis Club on Hayling Island. The men's event is a national Open carrying ranking points for the Real Tennis World Championship. The women's event does not carry any ranking points.\nHistory\nChallenge era\nThe men's event was established in 1931 as the Prince's Club shield, and was originally a challenge format with Edgar Baerlein defeating Marylebone Cricket Club professional William Groom in the inaugural edition 3 sets to 2. A second challenge was held later the same year, with E Ratcliff defeating Moreton Morrell professional Ted Johnson in the same year. The event changed to a best of 13 format in 1932 with Groom defeating Ratcliff, but losing to amateur champion Lowther Lees in 1934. Lees would hold the title until 1938 where he was defeated by Queen's Club profesional Jim Dear. No challenges would be held during World War II, with Dear resigning his title in 1952. The title was picked up by rackets professional Ronald Hughes, who held it until 1967, when he retired during the challenge against Frank Willis.\nWillis would battle the title against amateur Howard Angus five times during the 1970s, with Angus becoming champion in 1970. An annual doubles Open championship was first contested in 1971, first won by Ronald Hughes and Norwood Cripps. Cripps would win eleven of the first thirteen doubles championships, partnered with Hughes, Charles Swallow and Alan Lovell. In the singles, Angus won the Real Tennis World Championship in 1976, uniting the British Open and World Championships for the first time. In 1979, he was challenged for both titles by professional Chris Ronaldson, to be held at the Royal Tennis Court, Hampton Court. Ronaldson won both titles, defeating Angus 7\u20130, and thereafter relinquished the British Open title, allowing it to become an annual event at Queen's Club.\nOpen era\nWith the tournament now held annually, the 1980s were dominated by Chris Ronaldson winning six times between 1980 and 1985. In 1984, Ronaldson became the first player to win all four Opens in the same year - a calendar year grand slam. The era saw a rise in the number of Australian professionals travelling to participate, with Graham Hyland, Lauchlan Deuchar and Wayne Davies competiting against Ronaldson in various finals, Davies taking the match to a fifth set on three occasions and Hyland once. Ronaldson's hold on the Championship was broken by Deuchar in 1986, who would go on to win a further five consecutive titles until 1991. Deuchar's dominance prevented Davies from completing a calendar year grand slam in 1988, the latter having held the three other titles that year. Davies and Deuchar won the doubles together on eight occasions, undefeated at the Open between 1984 and 1992.\nA changing of the guard occurred in the early 1990s, with British amateur Julian Snow winning three titles between 1992 and 1994. The tournament saw the early rise of Robert Fahey, retiring from the 1993 final against Snow and thus failing to complete a calendar year grand slam. Fahey won his first title in 1995, but his dominance started in 2000. Fahey won eleven singles titles between 2000 and 2011, losing only the 2002 final to Tim Chisholm in five sets. He also won nine doubles titles between 2001 and 2012, missing out in 2004 and 2009. Fahey's grip on the Open title was broken by Bryn Sayers in 2012, though he would later win the 2018 as well.\nThe 2010s saw the rise of Camden Riviere. Riviere had reached the final in 2008, but it wouldn't be until 2014 that he would win for the first time. Riviere would be undefeated at the British Open from 2014 onwards, though he was absent in 2018 and 2021. Riviere also has been undefeated in doubles since 2013, partnered with Tim Chisholm on four occasions and John Lumley on two occasions.\nPast finals\nMen's singles\nMen's doubles\n",
    "British speedway rider\nJohn Roy Dook (23 August 1907 \u2013 June 1980) was an English motorcycle speedway rider.\nBiography\nDook, born in West Ham, London, began his British leagues career riding for Lea Bridge during the 1929 Speedway Southern League season. He was a pioneer rider appearing during the first season of league racing in Britain.\nThe following season in 1930, he was signed by his home town club West Ham Hammers but struggled to cement a place in the team and returned to ride for Lea Bridge in 1931.\nAfter impressing around the Lythalls Lane Stadium at the end of the 1932 season, he was duly signed by Coventry, where he spent two seasons averaging a solid 6.18 and 6.19 respectively. His career stalled somewhat after joining New Cross Lambs in 1934, although he did win his first team honours when the Lambs won the London Cup.\nIn 1935, his season was interrupted by a dislocated shoulder and a significant muscle injury and while with New Cross in 1936, he doubled up for Bristol Bulldogs to race in the 1936 Provincial Speedway League. It was at Bristol that he gained most of his success, helping the team to become the 1937 Provincial league champions. Dook averaged an impressive 9.01 from 41 matches.\nDook continued to ride for Bristol until the outbreak of World War II and would not return to racing until 1946, riding with the Birmingham Brummies. In his final season with Birmingham in 1948, he contributed towards the Brummies winning both the National Trophy and Anniversary Cup for division 2 teams.\nDook gave up riding and in 1950 took over as manager of Shelbourne Park in Dublin. He had previously performed the same role at Leicester. In 1951, he became manager of the Newcastle Diamonds and made several appearances for the club.\n",

His parents divorced when he was young and his mother remarried John Boe a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman. The family moved frequently and Foerstel grew up in Indianapolis, Detroit, Los Angeles, Chicago and Long Island.\nHe received a Bachelor of Arts from Hamilton College in 1955 and an MLS from Rutgers University in 1959. He served in the U.S. Army from 1955 through 1958 working as a  radar specialist. He later earned a Masters in Science from Johns Hopkins University in 1970.\nCareer\nFoerstel started his career as a fine arts librarian from 1959-66 at Towson State University. He then moved to be a science librarian at the University of Maryland at College Park, becoming head of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Library. He worked at UMD from 1967 through 1996. He was a member of board of directors of the National Security Archive at George Washington University and the and the Freedom to Read Foundation.\nWhile working in libraries, Foerstel wrote a number of books about library censorship and privacy. Surveillance in the Stacks, The FBI's Library Awareness Program was an expos\u00e9 of the history of the FBI's attempts to infiltrate libraries. Foerstel had met with FBI agents who visited UMD libraries looking for book-lending records of patrons with \"Eastern European or Russian-sounding names.\" Foerstel did not feel comfortable complying with these requests. He did some research and took part in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, discovering that the FBI had been visiting science libraries in the United States for 13 years under a project which became known as the Library Awareness Program. He worked with the university to create and implement policies protecting patron records and later worked with Maryland legislators to advocate for legislation guaranteeing the privacy of all Maryland library records. That legislation was passed in 1988. In 1989 Foerstel discovered that as a result of his response to the FBI's inquiries he, himself was investigated by them. Foerstel retired from his university work in 1996 and continued to write about First Amendment issues.\nBanned in the U.S.A.: A Reference Guide to Book Censorship in Schools and Public Libraries looked at book-banning incidents from 1976 to 1992 and was later updated to include information about book bans, including interviews with authors and reviews of court cases, through 2000. The book included a Survey of Banned Books which contained annotated entries on the 50 most frequently challenged books from 1996 through 2000. Foerstel was outspoken against crusades to ban books, calling them strongly irrational.\nPersonal life and death\nFoerstal married Lenora Shargo, an art professor who he met while they were carpooling from their shared apartment building to Towson. The couple had three children. Lenora died in 2018. Herbert Foerstel died on September 20, 2024, at the age of 90.\nHonors and awards\nFoerstal won a Hugh Hefner First Amendment Award in 1988.

    "Root Causes Strategy (RCS) or U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration in Central America is a federal government/private sector approach to address the root causes of illegal immigration into the United States from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras (collectively called the Northern Triangle of Central America).\nThe strategy was initiated when on February 2, 2021, when President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of this plan. The plan, led by Vice President Harris, consists of private sector investment into the Northern Triangle countries in order to develop the region and curb illegal immigration into the U.S..\nFive pillars\nThe strategy consists of five pillars:\nPillar I: Addressing economic insecurity and inequality;\nPillar II: Combating corruption, strengthening democratic governance, and advancing the rule of law;\nPillar III: Promoting respect for human rights, labor rights, and free press;\nPillar IV: Countering and preventing violence, extortion, and other crimes perpetrated by criminal gangs, trafficking networks, and other organized criminal organizations; and\nPillar V: Combating sexual, gender-based, and domestic violence.\nChronology of events\nIn February 2021, President Biden signed the Executive Order Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to Address the Causes of Migration, to Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and to Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border. The order is referred to as the Collaborative Migration Management Strategy (Migration Strategy).\nThe following is the chronology of the events in terms of actions by Vice President Harris:\nIn May 2021, a Call to Action for businesses and social enterprises to make significant commitments to promote economic opportunity for people in the Northern Triangle of Central America was launched.\nIn July 2021, the U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration or Root Causes Strategy (RCS) was launched with the Biden-Harris Administration releasing the strategy and five pillars of the strategy.\nIn December 2021, $1.2 billion in private sector commitments were announced by the vice president.\nIn May 2021, the Partnership for Central America (PCA), a public\u2013private partnership focused on economic development in the Northern Triangle of Central America.\nIn February 2023, the vice president announced the launch of Central America Forward, which is a framework for addressing good governance and labor rights in the goals and objectives of the PCA.\nOn March 25, 2024, the vice president, U.S. Department of State, and the PCA announced private sector commitments totaling more than $3.2 billion.\nCriticism and analysis\nAccording to the Associated Press article Takeaways: Harris\u2019 approach to migration was more nuanced than critics or allies portray it:Migration from those three Central American countries did gradually drop, though experts say it\u2019s unlikely that Harris\u2019 plan was a major factor. Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group stated:It was focused on a long-term scenario and it was focused on countries that are no longer the primary sending countries.\nUSAID 2023 Results\nIn a 2023 report to Congress by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), examples of the success were reported in terms of the pillars of the program:\nNotes:\nVery Robust: Exceeding targets and increasing two results two years in a row.\nRobust: Exceeding targets, but decreasing results compared to previous results.",

When the Roter Frontk\u00e4mpferbund was banned in 1929, he joined the Combat League against Fascism (Kampfbund gegen den Faschismus\u00a0).\nAfter the Nazi Party seized power in 1933, it launched a crackdown on anti-fascist activists. Raab lived underground with a group of comrades, initially in the Beuerberg area, later in Antdorf and Hohenkasten. At the end of 1933, Raab was in Bichl and was recognized by a Penzberg businessman who had been a member of the Nazi Party since January 1933. Raab fled with a comrade on his motorbike to Austria, where he hid for a few weeks in the Karwendel Mountains, and then moved on to Switzerland.\nIn Switzerland he immediately became involved in anti-fascist work. Raab and his comrades smuggled anti-Nazi leaflets and newspapers into Germany. He also illegally crossed into Germany multiple times to help organize resistance. At a meeting in Munich in 1934, he was confronted by the Gestapo. He pretended to accept the Gestapo's offer to supply them with information in the future. This bought him a day's freedom, which he used to flee to Switzerland. Raab remained in Switzerland until the spring of 1936, then went to France and resumed his anti-fascist activities in Paris.\nSpanish Civil War\nIn July 1936, Raab enlisted in the International Brigades, and arrived in Barcelona on August 10, 1936. There he was integrated into the Th\u00e4lmann Battalion. Due to his military experience in the First World War and in the Roter Frontk\u00e4mpferbund, he became an officer. Raab was commander of the Th\u00e4lmann Battalion from February to May 1937 and again from July 1938 to January 1939; holding the rank of major.\nInternment in France\nAfter the defeat of the Spanish Republican Army, Raab crossed the Spanish-French border at the Pyrenees with the XI International Brigade on February 9, 1939. He was taken to an internment camp near St. Cyprien by French authorities. The internment camp was an open area in the sand dunes near the sea, fenced in with barbed wire. To protect themselves from the cold and sandstorms, the prisoners had to dig holes in the sand to find shelter. There was a lack of sanitary facilities, medical care, and food at the camp. Diseases such as dysentery, scurvy, and typhus broke out in the camp; the conditions in the camp contributed significantly to health problems Raab would experience throughout his life.\nConditions improved somewhat when Raab and many of his fellow prisoners were transferred to the Gurs internment camp and later to Camp Vernet.\nEscape from internment and participation in the French Resistance\nAfter the fall of France in 1940, the armistice of 22 June 1940 stipulated that all Germans in French custody were to be handed over to Germany. Many Germans who had fought in the Spanish Civil War for the Spanish Republic were deported to concentration camps. In October 1941, Raab and some of his comrades managed to escape from Camp Vernet. In Toulouse, he was able to make contact with resistance circles and travelled on to Switzerland. In Switzerland, he was arrested and extradited back to France; he was interned again in Camp Vernet.\nIn November 1942, Raab was removed from Camp Vernet and taken to Castres in preparation for extradition to Germany. On the evening of September 16, 1943, he was among 36 prisoners who managed to escape. The majority of those who escaped joined the French Resistance, including Raab. Despite serious health problems, he took part in Resistance actions, particularly in the city of Toulouse. Later, in Marseille, he was a member of the FTP-MOI leadership. After the liberation of Paris in the summer of 1944, he joined the Committee for a Free Germany for the West (Komitee Freies Deutschland f\u00fcr den Westen).\nMayor of Penzberg\nIn June 1945, Raab returned to Penzberg. With the support of local mine workers, he was appointed acting mayor of Penzberg by the American occupation authorities. He held this office from June 21, 1945, to January 29, 1946.\nIn the first post-war municipal elections, the social democrat Anton Prandl\u00a0 succeeded Raab as mayor; while Raab was elected to the town council as a member of ",

    "American politician (born 1981)\nThis article is about the politician. For the snooker player, see Chris Scanlon.\nChristopher P. Scanlon (born August 6, 1981) is an American politician who is the current acting mayor of Buffalo, New York. He is Buffalo's 63rd mayor, having served since October 15, 2024 after succeeding Byron Brown.\nHe was previously a member of the Buffalo Common Council, representing the South District from May 2012 to October 2024.\nEarly life and education\nChristopher Scanlon was born to father John P. \"Scanoots\" Scanlon (1938\u20132022) and mother Paula Scanlon (n\u00e9e Kuntz).\nHis father was vice chairman of the Erie County Democratic Committee and aide to both Mayor James D. Griffin and Mayor Anthony Masiello. John P. Scanlon was never paid for his political work, but collected multiple salaries for no-show jobs from the City of Buffalo.\nHis family is of Irish descent, and he was raised in South Buffalo. Scanlon and his family are Roman Catholic, and he attended grade school at the local St. Thomas Aquinas Church. His six siblings also attended private school.\nHe is a graduate of Bishop Timon \u2013 St. Jude High School, and holds both an associate's degree in business administration from Erie Community College and a bachelor's degree in business administration from Buffalo State University.\nPolitical career\nWhen you grow up in a household involved in all those previous campaigns, if nothing else, you learn by osmosis. \n\u2014Christopher Scanlon\nScanlon was appointed to the Buffalo Common Council in May 2012, filling the South District seat vacated by Michael P. Kearns who had left to join the New York State Assembly. His appointment was criticized as a patronage hire, citing Scanlon's lack of college degree and relevant experience.

    "Garland Greever (1883\u20131967) was an American writer, poet, and academic. His Century Handbook of Writing, written with Easley S. Jones and first published in 1918, was an influential manual for English composition teachers.\nAcademic career\nGreever taught in the English Department at the University of Southern California, along with Frank C. Baxter, and was acquainted with poet Robert Frost, for whom he tried, without success, to get a residency at USC in 1933. He was friends also with novelist and poet Hamlin Garland, whom he invited to attend his classes for guest lectures; Garland, in turn, would mentor Greever's promising students.\nCentury Handbook and other publications\nIn 1918, he and Easley S. Jones published the Century Handbook of Writing; this book, which followed Edwin C. Woolley's Handbook of Composition (the first \"handbook of mechanical correctness\" in the United States), competed with Woolley's for dominance in the market until the 1930s. Woolley's Handbook (or Woolley) had been the first composition book with guidelines on grammar and mechanical correctness, rather than a focus on rhetoric, which had dominated the textbook market since the mid-1800s. Greever and Jones's Century Handbook, which Robert Connors calls \"Woolley's great imitator and competitor\", improved on Woolley in a few ways. First, it was meant for classroom use, whereas Woolley was more intended for the teacher as a guide to correcting \"themes\", as weekly composition essays were called. Second, it featured exercises that accompanied the various rules, where Woolley had only a small, separate section of exercises. In addition, Woolley's 350 rules were compressed; the Century had only 100. The book's \"rules and exercises are arranged on a decimal plan by means of which the student may be easily referred to the portion of the book he needs to study\".\nWith Joseph M. Bachelor, he published two more \"Century\" textbooks for English studies, The Century Vocabulary Builder (1923) and The Century Book of Selections (1924). The latter contained \"short literary excerpts--interesting, well chosen, and skillfully arranged--to serve as models for students (approximately college freshmen) in their writing\", and was recommended for in-class use: \"This class reading is not only of value in itself; it forces the student to cope with new words, gives him examples of good style, and not infrequently introduces new ideas.\"\nIn 1926, Greever published A Wiltshire Parson and His Friends, an edition of the correspondence of William Lisle Bowles. He had discovered a letter Samuel Taylor Coleridge had written to Bowles, and on the basis of that letter and a few other notes, identified four (anonymously published) literary reviews as Coleridge's, a claim accepted by at least one other scholar. These four reviews were printed in Coleridge's Miscellaneous Criticism, published in 1936 by Thomas Middleton Raysor. Charles I. Patterson, however, argued in 1951, in an article published in the Journal of English and Germanic Philology, that only the 1797 review of The Monk was written by Coleridge.\nSelected publications\nThree American Poems: Poe's Raven, Longfellow's Courtship of Miles Standish, and Whittier's Snow-Bound.

    "\nThe Chancellerie des Universit\u00e9s de Paris is the public institution under the French Ministry of Higher Education that inherited the administration of the assets of the University of Paris, which was split into thirteen autonomous universities in 1971. It administers the Sorbonne, the Villa Finaly in Italy, the Ch\u00e2teau de Ferri\u00e8res (until 2012), the Domaine de Richelieu in Indre-et-Loire, the Jacques Doucet Library and other assets bequeathed to the former University of Paris. The chancellery also represents the eleven universities that own the Cit\u00e9 internationale universitaire de Paris. The Sorbonne building and The Sorbonne brand name are owned by the chancellery. It also manages the official store of the Sorbonne and the universities of Paris.\nThe chancellery was created in 1971 after the Faure law of 1968, which dismembered the University of Paris, at the same time as the university chancelleries in the other academies. Since 2021, it has been the only remaining chancellery in France, the others having been dissolved.\nIts headquarters are located at the Sorbonne, which it administers on behalf of the universities Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, Sorbonne University and Sorbonne Nouvelle.\nMission\nIn France, the chancellor (chancelier) is one of the titles of the rector (recteur), a senior civil servant of the Ministry of Education serving as manager of a regional educational district (acad\u00e9mie). In his capacity as chancellor, the rector awards academic degrees to the university's graduates, oversees the legality of the universities' executive acts and channels funding from the ministry. The rector has no executive function in any university but remains a member ex officio of the board of every public university in his district.\nThe chancellery assists the rector-chancellor in managing the various universities in Paris. It is responsible for a posteriori control of the actions of Parisian universities, as well as those of the Paris inter-university libraries, particularly with regard to state investments. Following the transition to autonomy for Parisian universities, which relinquished responsibility for managing university staff, its main day-to-day mission is to manage the property of Parisian universities, in particular their joint and undivided assets.\nBecause of the special situation of the \u00cele-de-France region, the Chancellerie des Universit\u00e9s de Paris has a jurisdiction that can extend beyond the city of Paris alone, to encompass the region's seventeen universities in certain cases. The Minister responsible may also, by decree, entrust the Chancellery with the management of the assets of other Grandes \u00c9coles and universities, which constitutes an exception to the rule. \nThe thirteen universities of Paris, now numbering eleven after mergers:\nParis 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne University, also known as Sorbonne or Paris 1;\nPanth\u00e9on-Assas University Paris, or Assas Universit\u00e9;\nSorbonne Nouvelle University, or Paris 3;\nSorbonne University, also known as Sorbonne or Paris 4, Paris 6 or UPMC;\nParis Cit\u00e9 University, also known as Descartes, or Paris 5 and Paris 7;\nParis 8 University Vincennes-Saint-Denis, or Paris 8;\nParis Dauphine University, also known as Dauphine, and formerly Paris 9;\nParis Nanterre University, also known as Paris West, or Paris 10;\nParis-Saclay University, also known as Saclay, Orsay, or Paris-Sud and Paris 11;\nParis-East Cr\u00e9teil University, or UPEC and Paris 12;\nSorbonne Paris North University, or Paris 13.\nLocation\nThe Palais Acad\u00e9mique in the Sorbonne\nBy royal decree of May 16, 1821, the headquarters of the rectorate of the Acad\u00e9mie de Paris was established in perpetuity on the premises of the Sorbonne. When the Sorbonne was rebuilt at the end of the 19th century, the rector-chancellor was given luxurious premises in the north of the building, known as the Palais Acad\u00e9mique (English: the Academic Palace). Since its creation following the dismemberment of the University of Paris, the chancellery's services have occupied the entire Sorbonne's Palais Acad\u00e9mique, offices in various other parts of the building, and numerous other buildings in the city of Paris. The chancellery regularly uses the Sorbonne Grand Amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre for events, official ceremonies and awards ceremonies.\nList of inter-university centres and campuses shared by Paris universities\non the Latin Quarter campus:\nthe Sorbonne (since 1253): shared by Sorbonne University, Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne University and Sorbonne Nouvelle University;\nthe Panth\u00e9on Centre (since 1771): shared by Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne University and Panth\u00e9on-Assas University Paris;\nthe Cordeliers Convent (since 1217): shared by Sorbonne University and Paris Cit\u00e9 University;\nthe Cit\u00e9 Internationale Universitaire de Paris (since 1925): shared by all of the eleven universities of Paris;\nthe Michelet Centre (since 1928): shared by Sorbonne University and Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne University;\nthe Condorcet Campus (since 2019): shared by Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne U",

It would be the third consecutive, and third total, Challenge held in Australia, and the first in Melbourne. Both eliminators would also be held in Melbourne, the home court of challenger Frank Filippelli.\nEliminators\nThe three qualified players played a series of Eliminators for the right to challenge Fahey across late February and early March 1995. All matches were held at the Royal Melbourne Tennis Club.\nThe first eliminator was held between Filippelli and Gooding in late February. The first day was unseasonably hot, which favoured the Australian Filippelli over the Scotsman Gooding. The first set was close, until Filippelli hit a hot streak, racing from 3-all to win the set 6/3. The second set went the way of Gooding after a long deuce battle in the second game. Filippelli started the third set strongly, holding a lead throughout despite a late Gooding comeback. Filippelli blitzed the final set of the day in the heat 6/1. \nGooding started well on the second day, winning the first two sets as Filippelli looked in disarray. However, he rebuilt his composure over the course of the next two sets to level the day at two sets all. Going into the final day, Filippelli had a 5\u20133 lead. The first two sets of the final day were shared one apiece, with Filippelli needing one more set to win. The first three games of the tenth set were long and gruelling, and afterwards Filippelli began to tire. Gooding went on the attack and won all three remaining sets to qualify for the final eliminator.\nGooding faced Davies in the second eliminator in early March. On the first day, the honours were evenly split, with Davies pushing Gooding to the corners and Gooding responding with attack at any opportunity. The first set of the second day proved crucial. With high temperatures again, neither player took much of an advantage, with Davies finishing with a grille after a 5-all deuce. In the next two sets, Gooding tried to slow down the play but could not find his targets, both comfortably falling to Davies. Gooding suffered a heavy fall from sweat on the floor in the final set of the second day, taking a short timeout. After the break, Gooding returned reinvigorated and retrevied brilliantly to take the set 6/4. Davies had a 5\u20132 lead going into the final day, and found the final two sets comfortably to secure a place in the Challenge against Fahey.\nMatch\nThe format for the Challenge was best of thirteen sets played over three days. Four sets were scheduled for the first two days, and up to five sets on the final day.\nDay 1\nFahey started the match at a very high tempo, serving exclusively |railroads]] and hitting with great power and accuracy at th",

    "Boxing match\nMark Breland vs. Marlon Starling was a professional boxing match contested on August 22, 1987, for the WBA welterweight title.\nBackground\nMark Breland had defeated Harold Volbrecht in February 1987 to claim the vacant WBA welterweight title, which had been vacated by previous champion Lloyd Honeyghan after Honeyghan refused to face the South African Volbrecht due to the country's apartheid policies. After his victory, Breland disclosed that he had broken his left hand in the first round which would require surgery and delay his first title defense for the time being. Breland would return to the ring July winning a non-title tune-up fight before it was announced that he would face the WBA's number-one ranked contender Marlon Starling in August. Breland's original opponent was scheduled to be Tommy Ayers, but Ayers had been upset by journeyman Rollin Williams in June resulting in him losing both his number-one ranking and title shot to Starling.\nThough Starling was a veteran of 45 fights, more than double that of Breland, who sported a 18\u20130 record, Starling entered the fight as an underdog. Starling dismissed Breland's previous opponents feeling that Breland had not fought anyone close to his caliber stating \"I'm going to introduce Mark Breland to the pros. I've got more KOs than Breland has fights.\" Breland, however, sported a sizable height and reach advantage and mentioned as much rebuffing Starling's claims retorting \"My advantage is my height and my reach and my smarts, He's an experienced fighter. But I think he's underestimating me by a lot of things they've been saying.\"\nThe fight took place in Columbia, South Carolina and was the first world title bout to take place in the state. It was a homecoming of sorts for Breland, as though Breland had been born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, his parents were both from South Carolina and lived in nearby Denmark in a house Breland had purchased for them. Starling's manager Donnie Bowers tried to nullify Breland's hometown advantage by attempting to have the fight moved elsewhere, though he was unsuccessful.\nThe Fight\nBreland used his height and reach advantage over built up a commanding lead on all three scorecards as he landed frequent jabs on the smaller Sterling. However, Starling, despite losing rounds, continually frustrated Breland by frequently clinching and pushing Breland, who went down to canvas eight times as a result of Starling's antics for which referee Tony Perez deducted a point from him in the sixth round. However, in the 11th round, Breland, who had never fought past 10 rounds up that point  and was fighting with torn cartilage in his ribs, was stunned after Starling landed a shot to his ribs that sent him into the ropes on the defensive. Starling, realizing Breland was hurt, went on the attack and eventually landed a left hook that sent Breland down. Breland struggled mightily to get back up and Perez, feeling that Breland could not continue, stopped the fight at 1:38 of the round.\nAftermath\nBreland hoped for an immediate rematch with Starling, but WBA rules at the time prevented a rematch from happening for the time being.\nThey would meet again in April 1988.\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For WBA Welterweight title\nBroadcasting\n",
    "Quasar in the constellation Sagittarius\nPKS 1830-211 is a gravitationally-lensed blazar in the southern constellation of Sagittarius, one of the most powerful such objects known. It has a high redshift (z) of 2.507, an indicator of its significant distance. This flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) is one of the brightest extraterrestrial radio sources. In visible light, identification of this object is hampered by the galactic plane and an M-type star that lies near the line of sight.\nThis quasar was first detected in 1969 during a radio survey by the Parkes Observatory in Australia. In 1984, it was found to display interplanetary scintillation, suggesting structure on angular scales of less than an arc second. Radio observations in 1988 found an unusual double structure separated by an angle of ~1 arc second. The flat radio spectrum and double structure of this feature are suggestive of gravitational lensing by a foreground galaxy. Interferometric radio telescope observation was used to detect an unusually bright Einstein ring in 1991, spanning a radius of 1\u2033.\nRadio observations of PKS 1830-211 made over a 13-month period were used to measure changes in flux density. Both components displayed dramatic changes in their flux level, with the fluctuation on one component matched by the other about 44 days later. This lent strong support to the idea this is a gravitationally lensed system. The time delay was refined to 26+4\u22125\u00a0days in 1998. In 1996, absorption of neutral hydrogen was detected at a redshift of 0.19, suggesting a possible second lensing galaxy for a compound gravitational lens. This object was confirmed via infrared imagery in 2005. However, this second galaxy is thought to have a negligible effect on the overall lensing.\nImaging of the quasar with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2002 identified the lens galaxy as a normal spiral galaxy at a redshift of 0.886. It is inclined at an angle of 25\u00b0 to the plane of the sky, appearing nearly face-on. Based on the size of the Einstein ring, this galaxy has a mass of about 1011\u00a0M\u2609, which is comparable to the Milky Way. An independent analysis of the same imaging data suggested the possible presence of a main-sequence star within 0.5\u2033 of the target. A third point-like lensed image of the quasar was detected in 2020, located part way between the other two. PKS 1830-211 is a source for gamma-ray emission that undergoes significant flaring.\nPKS 1830-211 has been used as a radio source for measuring redshifted molecular species, including ArH+, CF+, HCN, HCO+, H2O, NH3, and OH+. As of 2014, it is the \"extragalactic object with the largest number of detected molecular species\". In 2023, Rydberg atoms were detected in the foreground galaxy by the MeerKAT telescope array.\n",

    "This article describes the geology of the ceremonial county of Staffordshire, England which includes the modern administrative county together with the unitary district of Stoke-on-Trent but excludes those areas which were transferred to West Midlands in 1974.\nThe geology of Staffordshire in the West Midlands region of England is largely characterised by sedimentary bedrock of late Palaeozoic to early Mesozoic age overlain by a suite of superficial materials deposited during the Quaternary period. The extraction of coal, limestone and clay have been significant industries within the county.\nCambro-Ordovician\nThe Merevale Shale in the extreme southeastern corner of the county is of Cambrian (Merioneth) to Ordovician (Tremadoc) age. It is predominantly a greyish mudstone but contains some dolomite. It was intruded during the Ashgill epoch of the Ordovician by sills of spessartite, lamprophyre and diorite. They form part of a grouping known as the Midlands Minor Intrusive Suite, other surface occurrences of which are at the Wrekin and near Nuneaton. A tiny outcrop of the underlying Monks Park Shale on the county boundary at Dost Hill is Staffordshire's oldest rock, dating back to the Merioneth (British regional) epoch between 499 and 485 million years ago.\nNo rocks known to be of Silurian or Devonian age are recorded at the surface in Staffordshire.\nCarboniferous\nThe Carboniferous period (359 - 299 million years ago) is represented by limestones, mudstones and sandstones in the northern third of Staffordshire with further outcrops along its margins elsewhere. \nCarboniferous Limestone\nThe southwestern part of the White Peak lies within Staffordshire, its name owing to the presence of grey-white Carboniferous Limestone in the landscape. The limestones are assigned to the Peak Limestone Group:\nEcton Limestone Formation / Hopedale Limestone Formation\nMilldale Limestone Formation (including a reef-knoll facies)\nThe mid to late Dinantian Ecton and Hopedale limestones are widespread in the triangle between Ecton, Tissington and Caldon. Outliers of the Ecton Limestone occur at Butterton and Mixon whilst outliers of the Hopedale Limestone occur in the Kniveden area. The Kevin Limestone is of similar age to the Hopedale Limestone and found in the Weaver Hills area.\nCraven Group\nStrata intermediate between the underlying limestone and the overlying gritstone are assigned to the Craven Group. Three formations are mapped in the area (uppermost/youngest first):\nBowland Shale Formation (including Minn, Hurdlow and Kniveden sandstones)\nWidmerpool Formation (including Onecote Sandstone)\nEcton Limestone Formation\nMillstone Grit\nThe Millstone Grit Group outcrops across Staffordshire Moorlands district in the north of the county. Three formations are recognised in the area, within each of which are various named sandstones set amongst shale strata (uppermost/youngest first):\nMarsden Formation (including Rough Rock, Chatsworth Grit and Roaches Grit)\nFive Clouds and Sheen sandstones (not included within a named formation)\nHebden Formation (including Longnor Sandstones)\nMorridge Formation (including Blackstone Edge and Lum Edge sandstones)\nThe Roaches Grit gives rise to The Roaches, Hen Cloud and Ramshaw Rocks together with outcrops at Flash and along Axe Edge, the southern end of which is just within the county. It forms prominent north to north-easterly dipping scarps at Back Forest and nearby Hangingstone and provides the bedrock in which the chasm of Lud's Church has opened up. It is also found in the vicinity of Rudyard. The overlying Chatsworth Grit gives rise to a number of gritstone edges in the Flash area.\nCoal Measures\nWithin the North Staffordshire Coalfield, the Lower, Middle and Upper Pennine Coal Measures formations are mapped. The South Staffordshire Coalfield is now largely within the county of West Midlands and forms the basis of the Black Country. However Middle Coal Measures rocks do also extend north from it beneath Cannock forming the basis for that coalfield. A small area of Lower Coal Measures rocks extends beneath Goldsitch Moss in the northern angle of the county. It hosts a few coal seams and the Woodhead Hill Rock, a sandstone.\nA small portion of the Warwickshire Coalfield extends across the county boundary under the eastern part of Tamworth.\nWarwickshire Group\nWarwickshire Group strata overlie the Coal Measures in the north and are found again (as the Salop Formation) around Loggerheads and Adbaston. The lowermost unit within the group is the Westphalian age Etruria Formation; it unconformably overlies the Coal Measures. This boundary was once thought to be a fault and references to the 'Symon Fault' are frequent. In the Enville and Baggeridge areas, the Etruria Formation is overlain by the Enville Member and the Clent Formation though the latter is of early Permian age. \nEast of the Coal Measures at Tamworth, the Etruria Formation is overlain by the sandstones and mudstones of the Asturian age Halesowen ",
    "Aboriginal Australian (1915\u20132002)\nDaisy Florence Ruddick n\u00e9e\u00a0Cusack (15 August 1915 \u2013 23 April 2002) was a Gurindji woman and member of the Stolen Generations from the Northern Territory. Her skin name is Kumachi.\nLife in the Northern Territory\nRuddick was born on Limbunya Station and was the daughter of a Demae, a Gurindji woman, and Jack Cusack, an Irishman who was employed at the station. At the age of six she was taken from her mother and taken to the Kahlin Compound, in Darwin, while her mother was away in hospital. In order to travel to Darwin she, alongside two other girls taken at the same time, were taken on horseback to Timber Creek, which took several weeks, and then travelled by boat.\nRuddick later stated that her father tried to have her returned to him but died before he was able to do so. Ruddick's brother Peter Limbunya was allowed to stay at the station because he had an Aboriginal father.\nRuddick remained at the compound until she was thirteen and spoke out about her time there and, like Val McGinness, stated that the education and food she received was minimal. She also recalled frequent beatings saying that:\nFlogging was every day. We'd get flogged by the matron. And we'd get flogged by the girls in charge of the dormitory\u2014\u200aDaisy Ruddick, as quoted in 'I can picture the old home so clearly\u00a0: the Commonwealth and 'half-caste' youth in the Northern Territory 1911-1939' (1993) by Tony Austin\nThis was despite corporal punishment of girls being banned in South Australia but allowed in the Northern Territory. Ruddick also recalled being forced to stand in the hot sun, the shaving of hair, the deprivation of food, the whitewashing of faces and the tying of children to the bed all being used as punishments. She said the older girls often bullied the younger ones.\nAfter she left Ruddick went to work as a nanny for the family of Eric Asche, where she cared for their son Austin Asche, in Darwin. She remember this experience positively and felt as though she was treated as one of their own and Asche, who would later speak at her funeral, considered her to be his big sister.\nAfter Ruddick left the Asche family she began studying as a nurse assistant, through which became the first Aboriginal Health Worker in the Northern Territory and, in 1934 she was sent by Cecil Cook to assist Clyde Fenton in the establishment of Katherine Hospital and she worked with him for a number of years until recalled by Cook. Cook then had her return to the Kahlin Compound and work at the Bagot Hospital and, at 23 years-old, she did not wish to return.\nLater, at the age of 25, when encouraged by Cook, she purchased a home in the area; something that then Aboriginal women could not do easily and this home was one of the first 5 Aboriginal Trust homes. In 1939 she married Joseph Ruddick, despite Cook's disapproval of her choice (although he did ultimately give approval), and went on to have four children with him.\nDuring World War II Ruddick was evacuated and spent time in Mildura and Melbourne where she begun a lasting friendship with Sir Ernest Edward \"Weary\" Dunlop. During this period her husband served with the RAAF.\nRuddick became a qualified nurse and, while working in Darwin, became known as the 'Pied Piper' for the way she gathered people who had fallen on hard times and, as a part of this, her home became a refuge for many.\nShe was an active member of the Australian Half-Castes Progressive Association, alongside Joe McGinness, and worked hard to improve conditions for her people. She was also a founding member of Darwin's Sunshine Club, an all-nationalities social club. In 1952 she separated from her husband.\nWhen Ruddick died in 2002 her funeral was held in the former Vestey's Meatworks as there was not a church large enough to accommodate the at least 2,000 people in attendance.\nOral history\nRuddick recorded numerous oral history interviews including at least two recorded Tony Austin by Library & Archives NT in the 1990s and another, recorded in 2001, which is held by AIATSIS (B H388.63/U1).\nLegacy\nRuddick Circuit in Stuart Park, Darwin is named for her.\n",
    "Thermal springs in Himachal Pradesh, India\nManikaran hot springs is a geothermal spring system located in the Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh, India, on the banks of the Parvati River. The town of Manikaran has been built up around these sacred springs, and an experimental geothermal energy facility is located there.\nDescription\nThe hot spring water emerges from the springs at a high rate of discharge and at high temperatures; the thermal water from deep within the hot springs mixes with cold water at the surface.\nHistory and folklore\nHot springs at Manikaran\nGeological phenomena such as thermal springs are often considered during ancient times in Indian civilization as evidence or manifestations of \"divine power and gifts from the gods\" (Rajendranath Seal, 1958). Chandrasekharam wrote that hot springs factor large in Hindu mythology, for example, hot springs are associated with the Mahabharata and Ramayana, especially in relation to Lord Shiva who is affiliated with sites of geothermal spring activity. A legend asserts that Parvati requested that Shiva assist her in finding a pair of earrings she lost. Using his third eye Shiva was able to see through the bubbling hot water to recover the earrings.\nShiva-Parvati temple at Manikaran hot springs\nThe Manikaram thermal springs are considered to be a pilgrimage destination to Sikhs and Hindus, and a Sikh gurudwara shrine and place of shared worship has been built near the source of the hot springs, as have Hindu temples. Nearby one finds devotees cooking rice wrapped in cloth packets in the hot spring waters.\nThe springs have been used for balneotheraputic purposes.\nWater profile\nThe hot spring water has a pH of 7.3 to 7.6 and is considered slightly alkaline. The spring water is carbonated, and CO2 gas percolates from the springs. The water contains sodium, calcium, chloride with small amounts of magnesium; analysis shows the spring water is of the Na-Ca-HCO3-Cl type. Trace metals have been detected in the water including cobalt, copper, strontium, nickel, silver, and zinc.\nThe water temperature has been measured at four of the non-boiling springs at a range of 186\u00a0\u00b0C (367\u00a0\u00b0F) to 202\u00a0\u00b0C (396\u00a0\u00b0F) degrees; the average temperature is 195\u00a0\u00b0C (383\u00a0\u00b0F) degrees.\nExtremophile species of microorganisms are present in the hot spring water.\n",

Mannucci.\nClub career\nEarly career\nBorn in Lima, Saba played for the youth team of Esther Grande. He played on the right side of midfield or on the wing, scoring 28 times in 2017, and occasionally played in age groups one or two years older than his age. In 2018, he also played for Sport Boys as part of an agreement between the two clubs, and joined Alianza Lima in August.\nIn October 2018, Saba went on trial for two weeks at Werder Bremen of the German Bundesliga. He trained with players including Peruvian veteran Claudio Pizarro.\nMelgar\nWhen Esther Grande manager Marco Valencia moved to Melgar in 2019, he signed Saba, who helped the reserve team to third place that year. When the Torneo de Promoci\u00f3n y Reserva was suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Saba was added to the first team and made his professional debut in the Peruvian Primera Divisi\u00f3n on 27 August in a 2\u20130 home loss to Carlos Stein, playing the last 25 minutes as a substitute for Diego Manicero.\nIn March 2021, Saba was loaned to Deportivo Municipal. For the following two years he also moved temporarily, respectively to UTC Cajamarca and ADT; with the latter, he played 28 games in 2023 as they qualified for the Copa Sudamericana for the first time.\nSaba was linked with a return to Alianza for 2023, but opted to go on loan again, this time to Carlos A. Mannucci.\nInternational career\nSaba was included in the Peru under-20 team, but COVID conditions meant that the team played no official matches during his spell. They did play training matches against other age groups of the Peruvian Football Federation, and these led to him preferring a right-back position.\nSaba was called up to the senior team ahead of 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Bolivia and Venezuela in November 2023. Manager Juan Reynoso excluded players from Alianza or Universitario due to the national finals.\nIn December 2023, Saba was called up for the Peru under-23 team for four friendly matches. He scored a penalty kick in a 4\u20130 win over Bolivia. The following month, he was the captain at the 2024 CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament in Venezuela, from which his team did not qualify for the Olympic event.\n",

    "Species of bird\nThe Cocos booby (Sula brewsteri), formerly known as Brewster's booby is a species of booby in the family Sulidae. It was formerly considered a subspecies of Brown booby, but it was split by the American Ornithological Society in 2024 due to morphological and behavioural differences. It is native to the east and central Pacific Ocean.\nTaxonomy\nThe Cocos booby was first described by Nathaniel Stickney Goss in 1888 based on birds collected on San Pedro M\u00e1rtir Island in the Gulf of California. He gave the birds the Latin name Sula brewsteri after his friend and fellow ornithologist William Brewster. In 1944, ornithologist Alexander Wetmore placed Brewster's booby as a subspecies of Brown booby. In 2024 a proposal to the American Ornithological Society to treat Brewster's booby as a distinct species was passed unanimously. Due to the changes of all North American bird names including the names of people, the name for the species was pre-emptively changed from Brewster's booby to Cocos booby after Cocos Island of Costa Rica, where the species breeds.\nCocos booby currently has either two or three subspecies depending on the taxonomic authority. The subspecies are:\nS. b. brewsteri (Goss, 1888) - Breeds on islands in the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean off the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.\nS. b. etesiaca (Thayer & Bangs, 1905) - Breeds on islands in the Pacific Ocean off of Central America and Colombia.\nS. b. nesiotes (Heller & Snodgrass, 1901) - Breeds on Clipperton Island.\nDescription\nThe most immediately obvious difference from the related Brown booby is the male's white face, varying in size by subspecies. Females of all subspecies of Cocos booby also possess a white forehead. Males of the nesiotes subspecies have the most white, with a fully white head and neck. Males of the nominate subspecies have a white face, and a pale brown neck, while males of the etesiaca subspecies only have white on their foreheads. Males also have a grey bill, rather than the yellow bill of male Brown booby's, and females have a pinker bill than female Brown booby's.\nBehaviour\nS. b. brewsteri with chick\nLike other boobies, the Cocos booby is a colonial breeder, and nests on islands. When the Cocos booby comes in contact with its relative, interbreeding appears to be rare. Observations on Wake Island found that male and female Cocos booby consistently paired with each other in large Brown booby colonies. Other observations found female Cocos booby among only Brown booby's did not pair, while instances of hybridization have only been reported at colonies with male Cocos booby and no female Cocos booby. At least two instances of hybridization between Cocos booby and Brown booby are known, one from Midway Atoll in 2020 and the other from Nakanokamishima Island from 2012 to 2014, where a chick was successfully reared.\nDistribution\nCocos booby are found in the East Pacific Ocean, breeding in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Mexico, French Overseas Territories, Colombia, and the United States. It is also found offshore of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Panama. In recent years, Cocos booby's have dispersed and are now found in the Central and West Pacific in Japan and Hawaii where they have now bred. They are only recent resident breeders in California, first breeding in the Channel Islands in 2017, and now regularly occur as far north on the Pacific coast as Vancouver. Large colonies exist on the islands of Clipperton Island, San Pedro M\u00e1rtir Island, Isla Esp\u00edritu Santo, Isla Isabel, Islas Marietas, Socorro Island, Isla del Ca\u00f1o, Gorgona Island, and Cocos Island. Recently, breeding has occurred on Palmyra Atoll, Wake Island, Midway Atoll, and Moku Manu in the United States Minor Outlying Islands and Hawaii.\nNotes\n",

    "NCAA Division I men's basketball team representing Le Moyne College\nThe history of Le Moyne Dolphins men's basketball from 1973 to 1979 includes the coaching reign of Tom Cooney. Although Le Moyne did not have a losing record in any of the six seasons under Cooney and had an overall record of 82\u201363, the Dolphins failed to reach the postseason. Rick May became the first Le Moyne player to record 1,000 career rebounds as a senior during the 1973\u201374 season. The Middle Eastern College Athletic Association (MECAA), the conference in which Le Moyne had been a member since 1955, dissolved following the 1975\u201376 season. Coach Cooney's first recruiting class turned out to be his best, producing a 15\u20137 record as seniors in the 1976\u201377 season. They were led by John Lauer and Pete Hogan, both of whom ended their careers in the top six among Le Moyne's all-time leading scorers. Although the Dolphins were not selected for the 1977 NCAA tournament, Le Moyne athletic director Tommy Niland believed they deserved a bid, and that the best 32 teams were not chosen. The Dolphins played their first ever game against Division I power Syracuse, located only four miles away, during the 1977\u201378 season. Jene Grey, who was selected in the 1979 NBA draft, finished his Dolphins career as the program's second leading all-time scorer and rebounder.\nTom Cooney takes the reins (1973\u20131974)\nOn November 16, 1972, Le Moyne announced that Tommy Niland would resign as head coach at the end of the 1972\u201373 season after 25 years as the Dolphins head coach. On December 19, Le Moyne announced that assistant coach Tom Cooney would succeed Niland. Cooney played for three seasons on Le Moyne's varsity team and was captain as a senior for the 1963\u201364 season, during which the Dolphins were MECAA champions and reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA College Division tournament. Prior to becoming Niland's assistant, Cooney was the head coach at St. Vincent de Paul High School in Syracuse for three seasons.\nLe Moyne became a Division II institution, when the College Division was split in 1973. Practices for the 1973\u201374 season opened on October 15, 1973. The Dolphins lost captain Phil Harlow, who was their all-time leading scorer, Brian Gaetano and Bob Kawa to graduation for Tom Cooney's inaugural season as head coach. Rick May and Bob Quirk returned for their senior seasons and were named co-captains. Junior Tom Moody and sophomores John Ferraro, Brian O'Connor and Mark Bowka also returned. New to the team were 6'0\" junior transfer Bob Braunitzer from St. Lawrence, sophomores 6'4\" Mark Daly and 5'8\" Gary Jackson and freshmen 6'4\" Bob Burkhard, 6'5\" Pete Hogan and 6'7\" John Lauer. Ted Grace, a key player for the Dolphins as a freshman and sophomore the previous two seasons, gave up basketball to devote more time to his Islamic faith.\nRadio broadcasts of Dolphins games had ceased after the 1971\u201372 season. Le Moyne's own WLMU broadcast live coverage of three home games during the 1973\u201374 season with commentary by Kevin Cooney and Bruce Sedlak. They hoped to expand coverage next season, if the station's budget was adequate.\nDolphins head coach Tom Cooney earned his first victory in his second game at the helm, a 76\u201374 upset at Potsdam State on December 4. Le Moyne used a full-court press to stage a comeback from a seven-point second-half deficit. John Ferraro, who scored 16 points to lead the Dolphins, hit a pair of free throws on a one-and-one opportunity to break a 74\u201374 tie with 29 seconds remaining and provide the winning margin.\nLe Moyne's Christmas invitational tournament returned in 1973, after a one-year hiatus. The Dolphins were 4\u20131 and riding a four-game winning streak entering the event. There was heightened interest in the tournament, since one of the participating teams was Catholic, which was coached by former Dolphins star Dick Myers. Myers and Le Moyne head coach Tom Cooney were teammates for three years, and both were starters on Le Moyne's 1963\u201364 team that went to the NCAA tournament. Both have since been enshrined in the Le Moyne Athletic Hall of Fame. Freshman John Lauer scored 25 points on 9-for-13 shooting to lead the Dolphins to a 95\u201368 victory over Hamilton in the tournament opener on December 28. Fifteen of Lauer's 25 points came during a decisive second-half run during which Le Moyne outscored the Continentals, 36\u201322, stretching their seven-point lead to a 21-point bulge with less than five minutes to play. John Ferraro had a double-double for the Dolphins with 13 points and 11 rebounds.\nThe following evening, Potsdam State closed the game on a 14\u20133 run over the final 6:25 to erase a seven-point Dolphins lead and win the tournament final, 78\u201374. Ted Bence scored 23 points to lead the Bears and was named the tournament's most valuable player. Rick May had a double-double for the Dolphins with 19 points and a game-high 14 rebounds and was named to the all-tournament team. Bob Braunitzer had 13 points to go with the 15 he scored against Hamilton a",
    "RNLI Lifeboat station in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland\nKippford Lifeboat Station is located on Roughfirth Road, Kippford, a small village on the east bank of the River Urr, which sits at the head of Rough Firth, on the Solway Firth, in Dumfries and Galloway.\nAn Inshore lifeboat was first stationed at Kippford by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in May 1966.\nThe station currently operates a D-class (IB1) Inshore lifeboat, Ronnie Sinclair (D-854), on station since 2021.\nHistory\nIn 1964, in response to an increasing amount of water-based leisure activity, the RNLI placed 25  small fast Inshore lifeboats around the country. These were easily launched with just a few people, ideal to respond quickly to local emergencies.\nMore stations were opened, and in May 1966, a lifeboat station was established at Kippford, with the arrival of a D-class (RFD PB16) Inshore lifeboat, the unnamed (D-87). The station was operational only during the summer months.\nOn 24 August 1977, the yacht Albino, on passage from the Isle of Whithorn to Kippford, headed up the west side of Almorness Point, rather than the east side, and into the shallow Orchardton Bay. Realising the mistake, the yacht tried to anchor, but was driven ashore, with the rudder being torn from the boat. The Kippford lifeboat (D-135) was launched at 20:10, and the two crew were rescued, the yacht being recovered the following day.\nIn 1999, Kippford Lifeboat Station became operational all year round.\nEver since the opening in 1966, the lifeboat station had been operated out of a garage, with no crew facilities. In the summer of 2001, work was carried out to convert a house in the main street, to be the lifeboat station. The conversion was the idea of divisional RNLI inspector John Caldwell. A design by Architects Robert Potter & Partners to be in keeping with the surrounding buildings was agreed. Completed in autumn 2001, the station can now provide modern crew facilities, along with a retail outlet.\nA new type D-class (IB1) Inshore lifeboat arrived at Kippford on 12 November 2009. The lifeboat, funded from the bequest of Mrs Catherine Frances Harrison, was duly named Catherine (D-718) at a ceremony on 17 April 2010.\nCatherine was withdrawn from service in 2021. She was replaced on 28 April 2021 by the Ronnie Sinclair (D-854), funded from the bequest of the late Miss Sheila Sinclair of North Berwick, and named after her late brother.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Kippford.\nA Letter of Appreciation, signed by the Chairman of the Institution\nKippford Lifeboat Station - 1977\nKippford lifeboats\nLaunch and recovery tractors\n",

    "Merovingian bishop and Frankish saint\nNot to be confused with Aubert of Avranches.\nAubert of Cambrai (French: Aubert de Cambrai) or Aubertus was a Merovingian Bishop of Cambrai and Arras and a Frankish saint.\nBiography\nAubert of Cambrai was born around c. 600 AD in Austrasia, Francia.\nAubert was consecrated as the bishop of the united sees of Arras and Cambrai on 24 March 633 AD. He succeeded Aldebert, bishop of Cambrai-Arras.\nBishop Aubert promoted religion and the study of holy texts in Hainaut and Flanders. Through his influence, many nobles were Christianized, and King Dagobert became a major supporter of the Christian Church. St. Landelin was entrusted to his care and was educated in learning and piety by St. Aubert. The bishop of Cambrai gave his benediction to St. Ghislain and blessed his hermitage (now Saint-Ghislain) on the Haine in the pagus Hainoensis. St. Aubert bestowed the religious habit upon Count of Hainaut Vincent Madelgarius, his wife Saint Waltrude, and her sister St. Aldegundis. Aldegundis was admitted to the vows of a nun by St. Aubert of Cambrai and St. Amandus of Maestricht before becoming the first abbess of Maubeuge Abbey. Aubert built himself many churches and several abbeys, including in Hautmont, in 652 AD. After Witger, Count of Condat, died as a monk at Lobbes Abbey, Bishop Aubert bestowed the veil of widowhood upon St. Amalberga.\nAubert of Cambrai, alongside St. Eligius of Noyon, arrived 30 days after St. Fursey's death to exhume his body for his canonization around 655-658 AD.

    "2024 Indonesian film\nThe Shadow Strays is a 2024 Indonesian action crime thriller film written and directed by Timo Tjahjanto. It was released by Netflix on 17 October 2024. The film stars Aurora Ribero as Codename 13, a 17-year-old assassin who is suspended after a botched mission in Japan. During this time, she crosses paths with 11-year-old Monji, who has just lost his mother.\nThe film had its world premiere on 10 September 2024 at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival.\nPlot\nCodename 13, a 17-year-old trained assassin known as a Shadow, is part of an international organization of assassins. On a mission in Japan, she assassinates her primary target, the leader of a criminal clan. However, 13 is dazed after accidentally killing a bystander and is incapacitated. Umbra, 13's mentor, eliminates the rest of the clan and rescues her. Umbra reprimands 13 for her lapse in focus and puts 13 under suspension, for a psych retraining, in Jakarta. Umbra herself is tasked to undertake a mission in Cambodia by the Handler.\nDuring suspension, 13 has recurring nightmares of her mother's death and routinely contacts her handler who instructs her to consume her medication and wait. 13 encounters 11-year-old Monji and his mother, Asti, who live next to 13's safehouse. Asti works as an escort for Haga, a human trafficker and owner of the club Moonrose. One night, 13 witnesses Haga and his men assaulting Monji and his mother but does not intervene. The following morning, Monji's mother is found dead due to an overdose and Monji is warned by police detective Prasetyo.\nReceiving no instructions for over two weeks, 13 becomes restless and stops taking the medication prescribed to her. She later befriends Monji who wishes to avenge his mother. 13 takes Monji to Asti's grave to comfort him. The following day, 13 discovers that Monji has gone missing and she forces Jeki, a foot soldier for Haga, to take her to Haga, believing Haga had kidnapped Monji. Jeki begrudgingly takes 13 to the Moonrose. Jeki explains that Haga and his twin sister Soriah is a part of a crime syndicate that involves the corrupt Prasetyo who is also Haga's lover. The syndicate also includes Ariel, a druglord running as vice governor of Jakarta alongside his father, Soemitro, an influential criminal kingpin. At the Moonrose Soriah arranges a drug deal with druglord Abi Kabil. Jeki requests an audience with Haga to Soriah, presenting 13 as a gift for his boss. 13 learns that Monji had come to the Moonrose the previous night and was kidnapped by Prasetyo and Haga.\nIn Cambodia, Umbra eliminates a number of her masked targets and rendeszvouses with a fellow Shadow, Troika, who was also assigned the mission unbeknownst to Umbra.

Umbra bests Volver but hesistates in killing her upon learning that Volver is pregnant, which is thought to be impossible for Shadows. Volver asks Umbra to join her but Umbra just lets her escape. However, Troika finds Volver and kills her.\n13 kills Haga, which enraged Soriah who shoots up the Moonrose and inadvertently draws the police's attention. 13 kills the Moonrose's security team and eventually escapes with Jeki but the two part ways after the latter's refusal to help in 13's mission to recover Monji.\nPrasetyo desperately hunts down 13 after hearing of Haga's death from Ariel and Soriah takes shelter with Ariel. Soemitro berates Ariel for needlessly causing chaos by killing Asti who was pregnant with Ariel's child. In turn, Ariel tortures the captive Monji.\nLater that night, Prasetyo and his corrupt police squad stormed Jeki's grandmother's house but their attack was thwarted by 13.

The Handler replies by informing Umbra of 13's killing spree, tasking Umbra and Troika to neutralize her to prevent further damage.\nBefore the deal, Ariel tasks 13 to kill Kabil once the exchange has taken place. As the deal happens, Monji-who is in the same car as Soemitro and Jeki-succumbs to his injuries and dies. Realising this, Jeki alerts 13, who becomes dazed and does not kill Kabil. Jeki takes control of the car he's in and drives it into Kabil's men.

    "Scotland-born New Zealand botanist, botanical collector, and mountaineer (1920\u20131996)\nMargaret Jane Annand Bulfin (n\u00e9e Simpson) (1920\u20131996) was a Scotland-born New Zealand botanist, botanical collector, and mountaineer. She was an expert on New Zealand seeds and their germination, viability and identification, and as a Scientist at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research she performed extensive field work including vegetation surveys in different areas of New Zealand. She co-authored the book Seeds of New Zealand Gymnosperms and Dicotyledons, and was awarded the Allan Mere Award for her contributions to New Zealand botany.\nEarly life\nMargaret Jane Annand Simpson was born in Scotland on 7 July 1920 and emigrated with her family to New Zealand when she was five years old. She grew up in the Bay of Plenty, and became an avid tramper, mountaineer and botanist.\nEducation and career\nSimpson received a Diploma of Horticulture at Massey Agricultural College (now Massey University) in 1945, and later a BSc at Auckland University. In 1950 she started working as a science technician in the Botany Division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) with botanists Lucy Moore and Ruth Mason, first in Wellington and then in Christchurch and Lincoln.\nOne of the projects Simpson assisted with early in her career was the curation of a fruit and seed collection, which she continued to work on for the next thirty years until she retired. Other projects she worked on included a long-term high-country vegetation field study at Molesworth Station, and a vegetation survey of Nelson Lakes National Park. For over a decade of the latter project, New Zealand horticulturalist Janet Moss was her field assistant and boatman.\nSimpson was appointed as DSIR Scientist in 1974, and her research focused on native New Zealand species' seed germination, viability and identification. She was a keen field botanist, and went on many field trips, often in the company of other women botanists as well as visiting international botanists. Although she retired in July 1985, she continued her research on seeds.\nLegacy\nIn 1991, Simpson received the New Zealand Botanical Society Allan Mere Award, which acknowledged her contribution to research on New Zealand seeds and their germination, including the valuable seed reference collection that she put together.\nAlthough she was not a taxonomist, Simpson named one species together with Lucy Moore: Myosotis brockiei L.B.Moore & M.J.A.Simpson. At least two plants have been named after her, both of which are found in Nelson Lakes National Park:\nEpilobium margaretiae Brockie, a species of willowherb endemic to New Zealand\nPseudocyphellaria margaretiae D.J.Galloway, a New Zealand lichen\nSimpson collected nearly 4,000 herbarium specimens over the course of her career, most of which are housed at the Allan Herbarium at Manaaki Whenua \u2013 Landcare Research in Lincoln. She published a handful of scientific articles over the course of her scientific career, and these were published under her unmarried name, Margaret J.A. Simpson. In 2001 she co-authored a major book, Seeds of New Zealand Gymnosperms and Dicotyledons, with her colleague Colin J. Webb. Through her botanical field work, Simpson became interested in French naturalists who visited New Zealand, and she wrote short biographies of Jules Dumont d'Urville and \u00c9tienne Raoul, among others.\nPersonal life\nSimpson was an experienced mountaineer who summited numerous peaks in New Zealand, and elsewhere. She and her husband Raymond Alexander Bulfin lived near the banks of the Liffey in Lincoln, where she enjoyed gardening and music. Simpson died on 3 May 1996.\nImportant works\nColin J.

    "Strikes in 1988\nIn 1988, a number of labour strikes, labour disputes, and other industrial actions occurred.\nBackground\nA labour strike is a work stoppage caused by the mass refusal of employees to work. This can include wildcat strikes, which are done without union authorisation, and slowdown strikes, where workers reduce their productivity while still carrying out minimal working duties. It is usually a response to employee grievances, such as low pay or poor working conditions. Strikes can also occur to demonstrate solidarity with workers in other workplaces or pressure governments to change policies.\nTimeline\nContinuing strikes from 1987\nFirst Intifada, including strikes, against the Israeli occupation of Palestine.\n1987\u20131988 International Paper strike\n1987\u20131988 Lunafil strike, 410-day strike by Sindicato de Trabajadores de Lunafil members in Guatemala.\nJanuary\n1988 Delhi lawyers' strike, 75-day strike by lawyers in Delhi, India, demanding the resignation of police officer Kiran Bedi.\n1988 Dublin firefighters' strike, strike by Dublin Fire Brigade firefighters, the first in 20 years.\nFebruary\n1988 British nurses' strike\n1988 Ford of Britain strike, 11-day strike by Ford of Britain workers.\nKarabakh movement, including strikes, in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, demanding transfer of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast to Armenia.\n1988\u201389 P&O strike\nMarch\nOne-day general strike\u00a0in Portugal against labour reforms.\n8888 Uprising in Myanmar\n1988 Argentina teachers' strike, 5-week nationwide strike by teachers in Argentina.\nMarch 1988 Panaman strikes, series of strikes against the military dictatorship of Manuel Noriega, culminating in the 1988 Panamanian coup attempt.\n1988 Snecma strikes, by SNECMA workers in France.\n1988 Writers Guild of America strike, 153-strike by television and film writers in the United States, the longest strike in the Writers Guild of America at that point.\nApril\n1988 Nigerian fuel strikes, series of strikes in Nigeria protesting increases in fuel prices.\n1988 Polish strikes\n1988\u201391 United States jai alai strike, 3-year strike by Jai alai players in the United States.\nMay\n1988 Hyundai strike, 24-day strike by Hyundai Group workers in South Korea.\nJune\n1988 Bell Canada strike, 10-week strike by Bell Canada workers, represented by the Communication Workers of Canada.\n1988 New Zealand meatpackers' strike\nJuly\n48-hour general strike in Peru over wages.\n1988 El Salvador electrical strike\n1988 Groton strike, strike by General Dynamics Electric Boat workers in Groton, Connecticut.\n1988 San Francisco nurses' strike\nAugust\n1988 ASUU strike, strike by Academic Staff Union of Universities members in Nigeria against structural adjustment, the first strike in the union's history.\n1988 Falconbridge strike, 10-day strike by Falconbridge Nickel Mines workers in Canada.\n1988 Mecsek strike, strike by coal miners in Mecsek, Hungary, against austerity.\n1988 NYU strike, 3-week strike by clerical workers at New York University seeking wage parity with other workers at the university.\n1988 United Kingdom postal workers strike\nSeptember\nOne-day strike by journalists in India over new regulations on the press.\nOctober\n1988 Aqueduct strike, 13-day strike by jockeys at the Aqueduct Racetrack in the United States.\n1988 Fernald strike, 10-week strike by workers at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center in the United States.\n1988 French embassies' strike, strike by diplomatic workers in French embassies and consulates.\n1988 French nurses' strike, strike by nurses in France.\n1988 New Haven Symphony strike, 2-month strike by New Haven Symphony Orchestra musicians.\nNovember\n1988 CSN strike, strike by Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional workers in Brazil.\n1988 Louvre strike, strike by security guards at the Louvre, in France.\n1988 Peruvian miners' strike, 8-week nationwide strike by miners in Peru.\n1988 Petrobras strike, 10-day strike by Petrobras oil workers in Brazil.\n1988 RATP strike, 6-week strike by RATP Group workers in France.\nDecember\n1988 Spanish general strike",

    "Permission to access restricted information\nThis article is about security clearances in the United States. For security clearances in other countries, see Security clearance.\nA United States security clearance is an official determination that an individual may access information classified by the United States Government. Security clearances are hierarchical; each level grants the holder access to information in that level and the levels below it.\nThe US president can declassify previously classified information, following a detailed process.\nGaining access\nFor people that require a security clearance to get access to classified information, an in-depth background investigation is conducted primarily by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, and the recipient signs a nondisclosure agreement.\nAs of 2017, certain government officials (but not their staff) are granted access to classified information needed to do their jobs without a background check: members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives for committee work, federal judges and state supreme court judges for adjudicating cases, and state governors. Attorneys representing clients in cases with classified materials require a background check, but there is a reduced-scrutiny procedure for time-sensitive access. This ex officio access can be revoked.\nPending a full security clearance an applicant may be granted a temporary security clearance of indefinite duration, which gives the applicant access to classified information while the original application is being vetted.\nAccess to any particular piece of information requires \"need-to-know.\" In some cases, this requirement is only nominal, as some classified information is widely published on secure networks. In other cases, there is a formal need-to-know determination. In addition to such a determination, Special Access Programs and Sensitive Compartmented Information may require additional investigation and adjudication of the prospective clearance holder.\nAs of 2020, the cost of obtaining a Top Secret clearance is $5,596 while a Secret is $433. These costs are paid for by revolving government funds and not by contractor companies.\nAuthority\nThe authority for classifying information and granting security clearances to access that information is found in executive orders (EOs) and US Federal law. The United States' National Security Information (NSI) has been classified under Executive Order 13526, but since 10 January 2017 the rules were modified by James Clapper as Security Executive Agent Directive 4 in the closing days of the Obama administration. Information may be classified under this Order if a classification authority determines its unauthorized release could cause damage to the national defense or foreign relations of the United States. Information concerning nuclear weapons and fissile material may be classified under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA). These clearances are only granted by the US Department of Energy. The clearance process for access to NSI or AEA information is substantially aligned. Under Executive Order 12968, the investigative and adjudicative guidelines for NSI and AEA clearances are identical. This enables reciprocity between NSI and AEA clearances, although some exceptions exist.\nThe United States' Executive Order 12968's standards are binding on all of the United States government agencies that handle classified information, but it allows certain agency heads to establish Special Access Programs (SAPs) with additional, but not duplicative, investigative and adjudicative requirements. The Intelligence Community's Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) control systems are a family of SAPs, and SCI eligibility must be granted prior to accessing any particular control system or compartment (which may require additional investigation or adjudication). SCI eligibility policy is described in Intelligence Community Directive 704  and its implementing policy guidance Within the Intelligence Community, the access to SCI information is far more common than \"Collateral Top Secret information,\" and therefore operatives will routinely include SCI in a TS product, just to ensure they do not have to meet the \"cradle-to-grave\" accountability requirements of Collateral TS information. Any additional clearance measures used by SAPs must be approved by the Office of Management and Budget, which has generally limited such measures to polygraphs, exclusion of persons with non-US immediate family members, requiring more frequent reinvestigations, and requiring annual updates to security questionnaires.\nHierarchy\nA security clearance is granted to an individual and generally recognizes a maximum level of clearance. Exceptions include levels above compartmentalized access or when an individual is cleared for a certain type of data. The President of the United States will be given access to any government or military information that they request, even if they would no",
    "\n2024 single by Lady Gaga\n\"Disease\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Lady Gaga. It was released on October 25, 2024, through Interscope Records, as the lead single from Gaga's upcoming eighth studio album. She wrote and produced the song with Andrew Watt and Cirkut, while Michael Polansky provided additional songwriting. Musically, \"Disease\" is a dark pop, electropop, dance-pop, synth-pop, and EDM song. The melodramatic lyrics of the song discuss love's ability to heal a lover's disease. \"Disease\" received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its production and Gaga's vocals, although some found the lyrics uncreative.\nAn accompanying music video, directed by Tanu Muino, was released on October 29, 2024. It features Gaga facing different versions of herself and trying to control her personified fears. The video received praise from fans and critics, with critics particularly praising the video's theme and fashion costumes. \"Disease\" debuted at number 14 on the Billboard Global 200 chart and has reached the top 10 in Greece, San Marino, and the United Kingdom as well as the top 20 in Ireland and Latvia along with the top 30 in Brazil, Canada, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States.\nPromotion and release\nLady Gaga first spoke of new music while celebrating her 38th birthday on March 28, 2024, saying she was \"writing some of my best music in as long as I can remember\" and posted another update from a recording studio in July 2024. Following the release of \"Die with a Smile\", a collaboration with American singer Bruno Mars, on August 16, and while attending the 81st Venice International Film Festival ahead of the premiere of her film Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, Gaga announced that the lead single for her upcoming eighth studio album was to be released in October.\nOn October 18, 2024, Spotify updated the titles of seven different tracks from Gaga's discography to spell out the word \"disease\", hinting at an upcoming single. Three days later, the release of \"Disease\" was confirmed by Universal Music Group through a pre-save website. The cryptic website depicted a glitch of the phrase \"I could play the doctor\" against a black screen. Alongside the announcement, Gaga revealed via her social media the official logo of \"Disease\", a promotional poster, and the exact release time for cities globally. On October 25, Interscope Records released \"Disease\" worldwide digitally for download and streaming and in the United States to the contemporary hit radio. Universal released the song to the Italian radio airplay on the same day.\nComposition\n\"Disease\"\nA sample of the song's chorus, featuring electronic and techno-heavy beats, Gaga's growly vocals, and lyrics about the ability to cure a lover's disease.\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\n\"Disease\" is three minutes and 49 seconds long. It was written and produced by Gaga, Andrew Watt, and Cirkut, while Gaga's fianc\u00e9, Michael Polansky, co-wrote the track with them. Music journalists have identified \"Disease\" as an upbeat electropop, dark pop, dance-pop, synth-pop, and EDM song, with gothic, industrial rock, rock, and rage influences. It features \"simple\" vocal hooks singing \"ah-ah\", grungy guitars, ominous layered harmonies, and midtempo industrial, EDM, and techno-heavy four on the floor beats. On the final chorus, Gaga pares everything back to her falsetto register and piano notes, before a final growl and rip-roaring salvo. Critics found \"Disease\" thematically similar to Gaga's singles \"Bad Romance\" (2009) and \"The Cure\" (2017)\", with Alexis Petridis of The Guardian particularly finding Gaga's \"strident\" and \"imperious\" vocals similar to her singles \"The Cure\" and \"Poker Face\" (2008). Roisin O'Connor from The Independent found Gaga's vocals and the \"squelching\" synth line similar to those of George Michael's single \"Freeek!\" (2002). According to the Tunebat Platform and the sheet music published at SheetMusicDirect.com by Sony Music Publishing, the song is performed in the key of B minor with a tempo of 101 beats per minute in common time.\nIn \"Disease\", Gaga sings about love's potential to cure and heal a lover's \"tortured\" disease. She sings in the pre-chorus, \"Screamin'\u2005for me, baby/ Like you're gonna die/ Poison on the inside/ I could be your antidote tonight\", over a pulsing electronic beat. Describing the lyrics of the pre-chorus, Petridis stated that \"if they don't bear much resemblance to the work of the Metaphysical poets, do seem a bit dominatrix-y\". Gaga sings later in the chorus, \"I could play the doctor, I can cure your disease/ If you were a sinner, I could make you believe/ Lay you down like one, two, three/ Eyes roll back in ecstasy/ I can smell your sickness, I can cure your/ Cure your disease\". Elle's Erica Gonzales described Gaga's vocals in the chorus as \"rock\" and \"growly\". Robin Murray from Clash considered the chorus one of Gaga's best choruses and found the song's energy and directness similar to punk music.",
    "Tennis tournament\nThe 1993 Real Tennis World Championship (known in the US as the 1993 Court Tennis World Championship) was the 58th edition of the real tennis World Championship. It was held at the Racquet and Tennis Club in New York City for the 17th time. Incumbent champion Wayne Davies defended his title against Lachlan Deuchar seven sets to six.\nPlayers and venue\nAs the defending champion, Wayne Davies automatically qualified to the final. Davies had played five prior World Championships, losing his first two to Chris Ronaldson in 1983 and 1985, but winning the last three in 1987, 1988 and 1991. His only Open victory since the previous event was at the 1991 Australian Open. As the defending champion, Davies had the right to chose the host venue for the Championship, electing to play at the Racquet and Tennis Club in New York City, as he had done for his last two defenses.\nAt the time, players who had won a national Open (Australian, British, French or US) were eligible to challenge for the World Championship. Two players were eligible - Lachlan Deuchar had won three of four Opens (US, French and British) in 1991 and one (US) in 1992, while Julian Snow won three Opens in 1992 (Australian, French and British). Snow and Deuchar played an Eliminator match at the Royal Melbourne Tennis Club, with Deuchar the victor. Deuchar had been the challenger in the previous two World Championships (1988 and 1991), both times losing to Davies in New York. Davies and Deuchar regularly played doubles together, and were undefeated at the British Open between 1984 and 1992.\nMatch\nThe format for the Challenge was best of thirteen sets played over three days. Four sets were scheduled for the first two days, and up to five sets on the final day.\nDay 1\nThe first set on Day 1 was described as scrappy, with Deuchar recovering from a 2/4 deficit to win the set 6/4. The standard of play improved in the second set, with both players serving railroads to the other player's volley. Deuchar had a set point at 5/3 but couldn't beat chase 3. In the 5-all game, Deuchar made a critical error attempting to lob a giraffe serve, allowing Davies to capitalise by hitting consecutive grilles to win the set. Davies began to dominate the play thereafter, with Deuchar making repeated unforced errors. Davies won the final two sets of the day 6/3 6/1 to end the day with a 3\u20131 lead.\nDay 2\nDeuchar had a strong start to the second day, comfortably winning the first set 6/3. The second set was described as the highest quality of the match, until Deuchar made four unforced errors at 4-all. Davies took advantage of the opportunity and battled his way to win the second set 6/4. In the third set, Deuchar wrestled the momentum, quickly recovering from a 2/4 deficit to win 6/4. Davies focussed in on his floor game for the final set, holding a small advantage throughout the set to win 6/3, taking a 5\u20133 lead into the final day.\nDay 3\nFor the third day in a row, Deuchar came out the more confident player, taking the first set 6/2. Continuing into the second set, Deuchar had opportunities to take a 5/2 lead, but Davies fought back well, causing Deuchar to make a series of errors. Davies went on to win the 5-all game, leaving him one set away from the title. Deuchar changed tactics and started serving giraffes to great effect. Davies had no answers as Deuchar quickly won the next to sets 6/3 6/1, sending the match into a deciding set for the first time since 1910. Deuchar lead the final set 1/0 40\u201315 with a chase worse than 2. Davies played an excellent floor game to recover the game and dominated the rest of the play from the service end, winning the set 6/1 and the match 7 sets to 6.\nResult\n",

He worked with the Atabeg Barquq during the reign of Sultan al-Salih Hajji, and he rose through the ranks until he became the supervisor of the royal stables, holding the title of Amir Akhur (Master of the Horse).\nWhen Barquq assumed power in Egypt, he assigned Aytmish the position of Ras Nubah Kabir (Chief of the Guard), then purchased him from the heirs of Emir Jirji, the Naib of Aleppo, and appointed him Atabeg al-Askar (Commander of the Army) in Egypt. When a revolt broke out in Syria against the rule of Sultan Barquq, Aytmish was sent to suppress the rebellion but was captured and imprisoned in the Citadel of Damascus.

    "BL Lac located in the constellation of Hercules\n1ES 1741+196 is a BL Lacertae object (BL Lac) located in the constellation of Hercules. It is located 1.2 billion light years from Earth. It was first discovered in 1996 via an Einstein Observatory X-ray satellite. Because the galaxy's synchrotron peak is found above 1 keV, it is categorized as a high-frequency peaked object.\nCharacteristics\nThe nucleus of 1ES 1741+196 is active. It has been classified as an extreme blazar due to having a flat high energy gamma ray spectrum or alternatively, a high-energy BL Lac. One accepted theory for this energy source in most active galactic nuclei is a presence of an accretion disk around its supermassive black hole. The mass of the black hole in the center of the galaxy is estimated to be 8.93 \u00b1 0.70 M\u0298 based on a fundamental plane measurement.\nApart from that, 1ES 1741+196 has an isotopic luminosity of ~ 8.2  x 1043 erg s-1, making it less luminous amongst other TeV blazars. When observed in very high energy (VHE) band, 1ES 1741+196 shows no evidence of strong flares. Its X-ray spectrum is known to be variable compared to its steady gamma ray spectrum, with it rising up by a factor of 3 in terms of variability.\nThe host galaxy of 1ES 1741+196 is an elliptical galaxy, one of the largest and brightest BL Lac host galaxies observed. It has a redshift magnitude relation of -24.85 and a galaxy effective radius of 51.2 kiloparsecs, which its overall luminosity distribution is obtained via a de Vaucouleurs profile. Additionally, there are two galaxy companions within the galaxy's position. They have same redshifts, with projected distances of 7.2 and 25.2 kiloparsecs. Given 1ES 1741+196 has a flat luminosity profile, its position along an impact parameter towards the neighbors and a high ellipticity, this suggests tidal forces.  Further evidence also shows a presence of a tidal tail between the companions, indicating the three galaxies are interacting.\n1ES 1741+196 has an extended radio jet towards the east direction with a projected position angle of \u00b080. The jet is known to be straight despite showing signs of a 5\u00b0 bend towards south by 15-20 parsecs from its core. Furthermore, the jet is known to be aligned well with a parsec-scale jet.\n",
    "Austrian diplomat, journalist and writer\nFritz Br\u00fcgel (13 February 1897 \u2013 4 July 1955) was an Austrian-Czechoslovak diplomat, journalist and writer.\nEarly life\nBr\u00fcgel was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, on 13 February 1897. He was the son of the social democratic journalist and historian Ludwig Br\u00fcgel, who would perish in the Theresienstadt Ghetto in 1942, a victim of the Holocaust. Br\u00fcgel's family moved to Prague, Czechoslovakia, where he would spend most of his childhood. Following the end of his military service, he studied history at the University of Vienna. He graduated with a Doctorate in Philosophy in 1921, with a thesis on the study of Germans in Bohemia.\nCareer\nBr\u00fcgel soon became the head of the social science study library in the Vienna Chamber of Labor, and he worked as a journalist for several years on social democratic works. From 1923 to 1934, he was also a member of the Socrates Lodge at the Grand Lodge of Vienna. He co-founded the Association of Socialist Writers in 1933, and he participated in the February Uprising of 1934 after joining the Communist Party of Austria.\nA plaque dedicated to German and Austrian refugees in Sanary-sur-Mur that mentions Br\u00fcgel\nBr\u00fcgel fled to Czechoslovakia following the failed uprising, and took Czechoslovak citizenship in 1935 after his Austrian citizenship was revoked. He soon got a job as a legation councilor with the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry, helping contribute to several magazines. Br\u00fcgel traveled to the Soviet Union in 1936, and moved to France in 1938 after the Munich Agreement was signed in September that year. He first lived in Paris, before eventually moved to southern France. During the German invasion of France, he first fled to Spain, then Portugal, and then the United Kingdom.\nBr\u00fcgel returned to Prague following the end of the Second World War. He was deputy head of the Czechoslovak Military Mission in Berlin starting in 1946, before becoming the Charg\u00e9 d'affaires in 1949. Br\u00fcgel resigned in 1950 in protest of arbitrary justice in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. He moved to London via West Germany and Switzerland, where he would live until his death in 1955. His wife, Vera Br\u00fcgel, committed suicide the next year.\nIn addition to his work in journalism, Br\u00fcgel also wrote narrative works and poems; his best known being the lyrics for the Austrian socialist song \"Die Arbeiter von Wien,\" a song honoring the 1927 July Revolt where 89 people were killed. Br\u00fcgel also translated some works from Ancient Greek.\nAcademic works\nThis is a list of Br\u00fcgel's academic works.

    "Plato's Closet is a secondhand clothing store that buys and sells gently used clothing, shoes, and accessories. Currently, they have over 500 stores across the United States and Canada. While the company is a chain, stores are individually owned and operated. This store is targeted towards teen and young adults, however, anyone can shop there.\nHistory\nLynn and Dennis Blum started Plato's Closet in 1998. The ideas for Plato's Closet came after their previous business, Once Upon A Child, proved successful. The idea for the name came from their son's interest and research on Plato, who he believed was in favor of recycling. They sold the franchise rights for Once Upon A Child to Winmark Franchise Cooperation in 1993. As they expanded Plato's Closet, the Blum's contacted Winmark for scaling help once again, and Winmark purchased the brand in 1999.\nClothing Model\nPlato's Closet pays sellers same-day, in cash, for items sold to the store. They do not offer any other form of payment, including store credit. Clothes, accessories, and shoes are purchased at a price between 30% and 40% of what they intend to sell them at, but this varies by item and location. Items accepted by the store are typically name-brand items and were sold in stores within the past 12\u201318 months. Items are sold to customers at a discounted rate from the new-with-tags retail price, with price varying depending on brand, condition, and age. Additionally, customers receive points on every purchase through the company's loyalty program, which they can use for rewards.\nLocations\nThe first Plato's Closet store was opened in Columbus, Ohio in 1998. Since then, over 500 locations have opened across North America. \nAwards\nPlato's Closet was named a Top Retail Franchise by Entreprenuer Magazine in 2016 for the third consecutive year, along with sister company Once Upon a Child.\nPlato's Closet was named the Number One Franchise Investment by Forbes Magazine in 2015.\n",
    "1977 compilation album by Carmen McRae\nThe Greatest of Carmen McRae is a compilation album by American singer Carmen McRae, released in 1977 by MCA Records.

Ms. McRae sings excellent m terial with a natural feel for proper tempo and is an excellent interpreter of lyrics as well.

    "Use of high-end goods as status symbols\nBrands like Aritzia target middle-class consumers and brand themselves as more exclusive but still remains affordable\nAffordable affluence refers to a cultural phenomenon where consumers use accessible luxury goods and lifestyles to project status and align themselves with a higher social class, without requiring substantial wealth. This concept is embodied by brands such as Aritzia and Erewhon Market, which position themselves as offering high-end, trendy, or health-conscious products that are relatively accessible to the average consumer.\nA related concept is quiet luxury, where the ultra-wealthy signal wealth through subtle means. Quiet luxury emphasizes the widening gap between the ultra-wealthy and the general public,  whereas accessible affluence provides a way for the general public to indulge in the lifestyle of the ultra-wealthy.\nOrigin of the term\nThe phrase was first used in this context in a 2023 article in The Cut called \"Meet the People Working 3 Jobs to Afford Erewhon.\" One of the interviewees used Erewhon as an archetype of affordable affluence. It was described as \u201ca way for regular people to position themselves adjacent to the upper class.\u201d\nBackground and description\nThe phenomenon arises due to an individual's desire to showcase status. For years, companies have strategized how to target the average consumers by providing a product that signals an elevated social status. For instance, Aritzia partnered with celebrities and micro-influencers to make it an aspirational brand at an affordable cost. Erewhon similarly has allowed middle class consumers to subtly signal a higher degree of perceived wealth by purchasing higher priced, but still attainable items. It has allowed middle-class individuals to feel as though they are part of an exclusive culture.\nThis phenomenon has been seen particularly with Gen Z and Millennials in the setting of financial hardships in the 2020s. Affordable affluence is an example of the lipstick effect. Because traditional status symbols such as expensive cars became relatively more unattainable, posting clips on social media that showcase affordable affluence become an alternative status symbol. Particularly with food, the perception has evolved from a necessity to a luxury. A McKinsey & Company report demonstrated that these generations place a higher importance on groceries than restaurants, travel, and beauty/fashion.\nSee also\nLuxury goods\nQuiet luxury",

    "American archaeologist\nDoreen Damaris Spitzer (n\u00e9e Canaday; December 5, 1914 \u2013 September 6, 2010) was an American archaeologist.\nEarly life\nSpitzer was born in 1914 in New Castle, Indiana. She was the only child of Toledo industrialist and car manufacturer Ward Murphey Canaday and Mariam Canaday n\u00e9e Coffin. The family moved to Toledo, Ohio, when she was a toddler. She was educated at Dongan Hall boarding school, on Long Island, New York, which her mother also attended as a child. She learned to play the flute.\nCareer\nSpitzer first visited Greece in 1933 with her parents. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1936, where she had majored in archaeology and was a student of historian Rhys Carpenter and archaeologist Mary Hamilton Swindler.\nSpitzer moved to Greece in September 1936, despite her fathers worries about the political instability in the Balkan peninsula. She was enrolled as a student at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. Whilst studying, she learned the Greek language, was part of the \u201cOxford Movement\" and travelled with her fellow students to Egypt and Turkey, even swimming the Hellespont in Istanbul. Spitzer worked at the site of Ancient Corinth from the spring of 1937. She was forced to leave Greece at the end of 1938 due to the ongoing tensions in the lead up to World War II.\nBack in America, she raised money alongside her mother for the Greek War Relief Association. In 1942 she published an article in Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, regarding Roman relief bowls that had been excavated during her work at Corinth.\nSpitzer, her husband and young family moved to Princeton, New Jersey, in 1948, when he was appointed Professor of Astronomy at Princeton University. While living there, she volunteered as a docent in the Princeton University Art Museum and instituted an annual celebration of Greek Independence Day which was held at her home. She invited Princeton's Greek-American community and classics scholars from the university to eat Greek food and dance Greek dances. She organized the annual Bryn Mawr Book sale to raise funds for her alma mater.

    "\nThe house, in 2008\nBeck House is a historic building in Giggleswick, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe house was probably built by Charles Nowell in the 1720s, and was originally named Beck Hall.  It was altered in the early 19th century, and was extended to the left in the 1930s.  It was grade II* listed in 1958, but R. W. Hoyle in 2019 argued that it has been \"largely overlooked by local and architectural historians\".  It is currently used as part of Giggleswick School.\nThe house is built of stone with limestone dressings, chamfered quoins, a floor band, a moulded eaves cornice, and a slate roof.  It has two storeys and a front of seven bays, the middle three bays projecting under a large segmental pediment containing three windows, the outer windows round.  In the centre is a doorway with an eared architrave, a rectangular fanlight, a pulvinated frieze with carvings, and a segmental pediment on consoles.  The flanking windows each has a moulded architrave, a pulvinated frieze and a broken pediment, and the windows in the upper floor have triangular pediments; all the windows are sashes, and those on the ground floor are early 18th century.  To the left is the 1930s extension with two storeys and seven bays.  Inside, there is an early-18th century fireplace in the kitchen, and an 18th-century servants' staircase, while the main staircase is early-19th century.\nSee also\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\nListed buildings in Giggleswick",
    "\nChupa-Cu (Suck-Ass), also known as Chupa-Cu de Goianinha, is a fictional creature akin to the chupacabra and Slenderman. Created in February 2017 by Renan Ribeiro, owner of the TV Maresol profile, the character he invented quickly gained repercussion in the Brazilian internet scene.\nOrigins\nRenan Ribeiro first concocted the idea of the Chupa-Cu in February 2017. The creature is defined as a \"sort of extraterrestrial being mixed with a gay porn actor\" who attacked people in the inland village of Goianinha, Rio Grande do Norte, abusing the population in unconventional ways, by sucking the anuses of the victims. The first reference to Chupa-Cu emerged on February 17, 2017, on TV Maresol's Twitter profile. TV Maresol is a fictional television channel in Rio Grande do Norte which was created due to the rise of other satirical Twitter profiles, among them Jornal Metr\u00f3pole, to which TV Maresol is affiliated to.\nRenan chose Goianinha as the first thing that came from his mind, and the Chupa-Cu helped increase the number of followers on his profile; in two days, TV Maresol went from 150 followers to 1200, and other websites such as BuzzFeed Brazil started talking about the subject. The creature is also correlated with the Tupi-Guarani myth of the Kurup\u00ed, a creature with a large penis, who had a similar function to the Chupa-Cu, and the Ata\u00edde of Bragan\u00e7a. A similar indigenous narrative, the diabo sem cu (Assless Devil) circulated on social media in 2016, as means of debauchery.\nFictionally, as soon as the Goianinha Chupa-Cu sightings began to viralize, reports of sightings in other parts of Brazil becan to circulate on Twitter.\nOn October 22, 2017, a Twitter profile impersonating UOL Not\u00edcias posted a story about a supposed sighting in Manaus, causing collective hysteria in Manaus.\n",

    "American Viticultural Area in North Carolina\nCrest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County is an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located in Henderson County, North Carolina encompassing 215 square miles (137,600 acres). It was established on August 19, 2019, by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), Treasury after reviewing the petition submitted by Mark Williams, the executive director of Agribusiness Henderson County, and Barbara Walker, the county extension support specialist for North Carolina Cooperative Extension, on behalf of local vineyards and winery operators, proposing the viticultural area named \"Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County.\"\nThe AVA has 14 commercial vineyards cultivating approximately 70 acres (28\u00a0ha) and two wineries. Several existing vineyards are planning to expand by a total of 55 acres (22\u00a0ha) in the next 5 years. According to the petition, the distinguishing features of the Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA are its climate and topography\u2014specifically its elevation.\nHistory\nThe term \"Crest of the Blue Ridge\" was first used by Colonel Joseph Pratt, who was the\nchief of the North Carolina Geological and Economic Survey from 1906 to 1923. In 1910, Pratt proposed creating a scenic road and chain of tourist hotels atop or adjacent to the summit of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Pratt named the project the \"Crest of the Blue Ridge Highway.\" Several small sections of the road were built, but the start of World War I interrupted the work, and completion was put on hold. In the end, the project was never completed, but the\nterm \"Crest of the Blue Ridge\" survived and remains in widespread, present-day\nuse to describe areas of the Southern Appalachians, especially in North Carolina.\nName Evidence\nThe Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA straddles the ridge line that forms the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The ridge line forming the crest of the Blue Ridge is marked\nand labeled on eight of the nine U.S.G.S. topographic maps used to form the\nboundary of the AVA. Because the entire crest covers a multi-state region that is significantly larger than the AVA, the petitioners added \"Henderson County\" in order to identify the\nlocation of the AVA more specifically. TTB did not require the addition of \"North Carolina\" to the proposed name because TTB is not aware of the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains running through any other county named Henderson County.\nThe petition included examples of current use of the term \"Crest of the Blue Ridge\" to describe the region. Henderson County is also often promoted as the Crest of the Blue Ridge Agricultural Area for its variety of commercial agricultural products. For example, the Henderson County Tourism Development Authority's \"Cheers Trail\" publication, which advertises commercial breweries, cideries, and wineries in the county, notes that all the producers on the trail are \"located in Henderson County in the Crest of the Blue Ridge Agricultural Area.\" The county also promotes its apple orchards with its Crest of the Blue Ridge Orchard Trail guide. Agribusiness Henderson County, a local non-profit agriculture and agri-tourism advocate, promotes the county's farm businesses through its Southern Mountain Fresh brand, which states, \"Enjoy the freshness of the Crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains and sustain our local heritage.\"  Finally, two wineries with vineyards within the AVA use the term \"Crest of the Blue Ridge\" to describe their locations. Burntshirt Vineyards\u2019 website states that its vineyards occupy \"...a unique position with two vineyards on both sides of the Eastern Continental Divide on the Crest of the Blue Ridge.\"  St. Paul Mountain Vineyards\u2019 website describes its vineyards as being \"on the crest of the Blue Ridge in Edneyville.\"\nTerroir\nCrest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA straddles the ridge line that forms the\ncrest of the Blue Ridge Mountains. To the east and south of the AVA are the low, rolling hills of the Inner Piedmont region. To the west of the AVA are the rugged mountains of the Pisgah National Forest. To the north are the Asheville Basin, which is marked by the wide valley of the French Broad River, and the rugged highlands that surround the basin. The distinguishing features of the AVA are its elevation and climate.\nTopography\nThe petition describes the Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA as straddling two\nphysiographic provinces\u2014the Blue Ridge Escarpment and the Blue Ridge Plateau, which are separated by the Eastern Continental Divide, also known as the Crest of the Blue Ridge. To the north of the AVA are two distinct geomorphic regions: The Asheville Basin and a region of higher mountains known informally as the \"northern highlands,\" which includes\nthe Black Mountain range and Mount Mitchell, the highest point east of the\nMississippi River.

    "Gilded bronze statue of the Roman Imperial period\nCalvatone Victoria\nThe Calvatone Victoria is a gilt bronze statue from the Roman Imperial period. It belongs to the inventory of the Antikensammlung Berlin, but is now held in Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersberg.\nDescription and inscription\nSketch of the Calvatone Victoria\nThe piece is a 1.70 metre high statue of a winged woman cast from bronze. This is the traditional iconography of the Roman victory goddess, Victoria. She stands atop a globe and is depicted in the style of a Hellenistic maenad performing a movement somewhere between dancing and floating. She wears a chiton and has comparatively long legs, with the left leg forward, coming out of her dress. A panther skin is tied over her left shoulder and is fastened in place with a girdle at hip-height. The right arm of the figure extends forwards and may originally have held a wreath, while the left arm holds a palm frond (incorporating modern restorations). The head of the statue is based on 5th-century BC Classical Greek models and looks slightly to the right. The hair is held in place with a cord which wraps around the head twice and is tied in place above the forehead and at the back.\nOn the globe is an inscription in roughly 5.5\u00a0cm high letters, reading  Victoriae Aug(ustorum) / Antonini et Veri / M(arcus) Satrius Maior, \"To the Victory of Emperors Antoninus and Verus, Marcus Satrius Maior (dedicated this).\"\nThe inscription indicates that the dedicator was the otherwise unknown Marcus Satrius Maior, whose Nomen is well-attested in ancient Northern Italy. The inscription also indicates that the art work was dedicated during the joint-reign of the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, i.e. 161 to 169 AD. It symbolised the victoriousness and claim to power of these emperors and probably commemorates the successful conclusion to the Parthian War of Lucius Verus (161-166 AD). This could explain why Victoria is depicted, unusually, as a kind of maenad, one of the female companions of the god Dionysus. Lucius Verus was celebrated after the conclusion of the campaign as a \"new Dionysos,\" comparing his expedition to the mythic expedition of Dionysus to the east. The panther skin worn by the Victoria probably also refers to the Orient.\nNew investigations of the artwork between 2016 and 2019 have led to an alternative interpretation. It was discovered that the wings of the figure are modern restorations, which probably did not form part of the original sculpture. This led to the suggestion that the sculpture was not originally a depiction of Victoria, but of the hunting goddess Diana, who is often depicted wearing a panther skin.\nDiscovery, restoration, rediscovery\nDetail of the Calvatone Victoria.\nThe statue was discovered at Calvatone, near Cremona in Italy in 1836, in four pieces. In February, farmers working on the estate of Luigi Alovisi found the head. Alovisi instructed them to keep on the lookout for further pieces and on 14 March they found the body, globe, and right arm.  The broken pieces were fitted back together without difficulty. The remaining missing pieces were later restored by German conservators. These modern additions consist of: the left arm up to the shoulder (including the palm frond), the left leg (except for the upper ankle and the big toe), the nose, part of the left cheek, a tuft of hair, the wings, and the knot of cloth over her shoulder. The tail of the panther skin is missing. the gilding was still well preserved when the piece was discovered and was extended to cover the restored parts of the sculpture.\nIn December 1841, Gustav Friedrich Waagen, director of the Berlin Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, paid 12,000 lire to acquire the Calvatone Victoria for the Antikensammlung Berlin, where it remained on display until 1939, when the museum was closed owing to the outbreak of World War II. During this period, several copies were made, which were displayed in Berlin, Rome, Cremona, Moscow, and elsewhere. In 1941, the original was stored with other items from the Antikensammlung in the vault of the New Reich's Mint at Molkenmarkt, which was then still under construction. At the end of the Second World War, the Victoria was recorded as lost. It is now known that it was selected in 1946 by Russian experts in ancient art for transport to the Soviet Union. When it arrived in Russia, however, it was placed in storage at The Hermitage in Leningrad, where it was accidentally assigned to the department of 17th-century French sculpture. Through museological research and conservatorial analysis by Russian specialists, the Victoria was eventually identified and correctly catalogued. In 2016, Russian scholars revealed that it was one of the \"war-related transfers\" from Berlin museums in Russia. Thereafter, the president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, Hermann Parzinger, and the general director of the Hermitage, Mikhail Piotrovsky,  agreed to collaborate on researching and restoring the Victo",

    "Town hall in Marseille, France\nThe H\u00f4tel de Ville (French pronunciation: , City Hall) is a historic building in Marseille, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, southern France, standing on Quai du Port. It was designated a monument historique by the French government in 1948.\nHistory\nThe original city hall was an ancient structure dating back at least to the mid-13th century. By the mid-17th century, it was dilapidated and, in September 1653, the first consul of Marseille, Gaspard de Villages, proposed that the city council should demolish it and erect a new building on the site.\nThe foundation stone for the new building was laid by the bishop, \u00c9tienne de Puget, on 25 October 1653. Construction was significantly disrupted by armed bands terrorising the country. The building was designed by Gaspard Puget and Jean-Baptiste M\u00e9olans in the Baroque style, built in ashlar stone and was completed in September 1673.\nThe design involved a symmetrical main frontage of seven bays facing Quai du Port, with the last two bays on either side slightly projected forward as pavilions. The central section of three bays featured a square-headed doorway with round headed windows on either side. The ground floor bays were flanked by Corinthian order columns and pilasters supporting an entablature. The first floor featured a French door, flanked by a pair of sash windows with triangular pediments, and there was a balcony with a stone balustrade in front. On the second floor, there was a bust of Louis XIV surrounded by military flags in the central bay, sculpted by Martin Grosfils. On either side there were panels surmounted by segmental pediments and acroteria. The last two bays on either side were fenestrated with round headed windows on the ground floor, tall square headed windows with segmental pediments on the first floor, and by small square windows with segmental pediments and acroteria on the second floor. Internally, the principal rooms included a bourse on the ground floor and three large municipal offices on the first floor.\nIn 1792, during the French Revolution, the fleurs-de-lis, which had formed part of the city's coat of arms designed by Pierre Puget and placed above the front door, were torn off by revolutionaries and replaced by a Phrygian cap as a mark of protest. They were restored some 30 years later during the reign of Louis XVIII. In early 1943, the H\u00f4tel de Ville was one of only four buildings to survive when the German authorities decided to demolish most of the surrounding area.\nA large extension, built almost completely underground, was constructed to a design by Franck Hammout\u00e8ne and completed in 2006. The new facilities include a huge semi-circular council chamber, committee rooms and exhibition space. The project also created a new square, the Place Villeneuve-Bargemon, on the surface. The project was awarded the Prix de l'\u00c9querre d'Argent (the Silver T-square Prize) in 2006.\n",

    "Species of marsupial\nThe dark four-eyed opossum (Philander melanurus) is a species of opossum from Central and South America.\nTaxonomy\nThis species was originally described as a subspecies of Philander opossum, and was considered a subspecies until the late 2010s. Some sources, such as GBIF and the IUCN do not recognize this species's validity yet, while others, such as the American Society of Mammalogists, do recognize it as valid. The subspecies Philander opossum fuscogriseus was sometimes recognized as a valid subspecies, but is now considered a junior synonym of P. melanurus. If fuscogriseus would be revalidized, it would include populations in Central America, while the nominate subspecies would be the South American populations. When considered valid the two forms could be differentiated by fuscogriseus having a lighter-tipped tail and lighter fur color on average, while melanurus has a unicolored tail and darker upperparts.\nEtymology\nThe common name \"four-eyed opossum\" comes from the spots above the eyes of this species looking like another set of eyes. The specific name \"melanurus\" is derived from the Greek \"melas\" meaning \"black\" and \"oura\" meaning \"the tail\".\nDescription\nA dark four-eyed opossum in Colombia\nThis species ranges from 483 to 582\u00a0mm (19.0 to 22.9\u00a0in), averaging 527\u00a0mm (20.7\u00a0in). The tail makes up around 258.5\u00a0mm (10.18\u00a0in) of this length. This species closely resembles the gray four-eyed opossum, but is darker overall, with a usually darker tail. Populations in Central America have a lighter-colored tip of the tail, similar to most Philander opossums, but populations in the southern part of the range have a uniformly dark tail. The upper parts of the head, back, rump, and limbs are a dark gray to black color, with gray-tipped hairs. The sides of the body, the cheeks, and the eyebrows are a yellowish color, and the underside is white. This species is very similar to Philander vossi, but darker overall. \nRange\nThis species is found west of the Andes Mountains in Ecuador, Colombia, and Panama. Either this species or the northern four-eyed opossum occurs in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica but more surveying is needed in these regions. As of 2024, no research has been done to find the range border of this species and Philander vossi, but data from the citizen science website iNaturalist indicates it is around the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border. The holotype is from the town of Paramba, along the R\u00edo Mira, in northern Ecuador.\n",

He made his senior debut for IS Halmia in the 2015 Division 1, playing once that season, then played a majority of the games for Halmia in the Division 2 in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Receiving 6 youth caps for Sweden, P\u00e5hlsson was a squad member for the 2016 UEFA European Under-17 Championship.\nAhead of the 2019 season, he moved up two divisions to join the largest team in the city, then-Superettan club Halmstads BK. It was said to be the first direct transfer from Halmia to rivals Halmstad since 1977.\nP\u00e5hlsson made his Superettan debut on 27 August 2019 and his Allsvenskan debut on 28 August 2021, but both were one-off appearances for the time being. In 1021, P\u00e5hlsson also won the Allsvenskan U21 championship. The championship was decided through a penalty shootout, where P\u00e5hlsson was the one to convert the decisive penalty.\nIn the 2023 Allsvenskan, P\u00e5hlsson got the chance in several games after Malkolm Nilsson S\u00e4fqvist was sidelined due to mental problems. After the 2023 season, though, P\u00e5hlsson was not interested in prolonging his contract. He sought more playing time elsewhere. P\u00e5hlsson chose Superettan club \u00d6rebro SK, where he became the undisputed starter in 2024. The local newspaper praised P\u00e5hlsson for \"playing with a newly found confidence\". Wrote a commentator in Sydn\u00e4rkenytt, \"Without him, \u00d6SK would have languished in a relegation spot\". Still, the commentator criticized P\u00e5hlsson for feigning several injuries to waste time for the opposing team, throughout the season.\n",

    "Union Park, with South End House near the center of the row on the left (1917)\nSouth End House is a settlement house in South End, Boston, Massachusetts. It stressed education and study, but gradually extended its activities until it contributed in a multitude of ways to the life of Boston, particularly to the south End neighborhood. The house was controlled by a council of which William Jewett Tucker was the chairman; but the active work was carried on by a number of resident members.\nEstablished in 1892, and incorporated in 1897, South End House was Boston's first settlement house and the fourth in the country. Decades later, South End House and four other properties became an association, the United South End Settlements.\nOrganizational history\nForerunner\nThe Andover House commenced its work in January 1892 as a social experiment, without traditions, or experience, and with little help from example.\nWilliam J. Tucker\nRobert A. Woods\nThe movement for the Andover House began among a group of the younger graduates of Andover Theological Seminary, including Robert Archey Woods, who started the House, and was thereafter head of it. They got their inspiration from Professor William Jewett Tucker, afterwards president of Dartmouth College. Tucker encouraged Woods' desire for social service.The only pattern which Tucker and Woods had before them was Toynbee Hall. To London, accordingly, went Woods, and spent six months studying the methods of Toynbee Hall, under the direction of Canon Barnett. Canon Barnett's undertaking had at the heart of it two determining ideas. He desired to make the privileged of service to the unprivileged; to gather about him in the East End of London a group of men who should come from Oxford or Cambridge, as Arnold Toynbee had come, and share the rich happiness of their intellectual and social life with those from whom much of this joy had been barred by arbitrary and accidental environment. He desired also that this should be done in the spirit of the Christian religion, though the house had no formal connection with the church. It was understood to be an opportunity for the energies of some who, for various reasons, could not work under the conditions of the usual parochial societies. But the spirit of the founder was distinctively Christian. Jane Addams described it as \"a bent to express in social service and in terms of action the spirit of Christ.\" These two ruling ideas Woods had already in his mind when he went to London, and he came away confirmed in them as the method to govern the house. The results of Wood's study he put into a book entitled English Social Movements, and in the light of this experience, the Andover House was opened.\nAndover House Association\nTucker helped in many invaluable ways the establishment of the house -then, and for three years after, called the Andover House- and served as president of the Andover House Association. The Andover House Association, which stood responsible for the work, however, represented from the beginning a large variety of persons having no identity of interest except that in the more progressive lines of social activity.\nRestructure\nAfter three years, the name changed from Andover House to South End House to remove the association with the theological seminary. The House is located at 6 Rollins Street. The location was selected so as to allow the work to reach both ways-toward the richer working people and toward those of laboring classes. In the first instance, the House was the home of a group of educated men, who in one way and another enter actively into all the better interests of the immediate neighborhood. The keynote of every effort was personal friendliness. As far as possible, the attitude of patronage was completely avoided.\nWoods never fell into the snare of preparation. He met needs as they came, adapted his program to the changing situation, and freely followed opportunity wherever it led. He believed that the house was for the community, not the community for the house.\nAt the beginning, the work of the House necessarily had to be somewhat ill-defined. Indeed, the work of a university settlement could never take on the exact and highly organized form of an institution; however, the purpose of making the work regular and continuous was held strongly in mind. The original purpose included not only well-meaning effort, but careful study of actual conditions to accompany and inform such effort. As a rule, each resident visited a certain group of families and made it his duty to become thoroughly acquainted with them. As he learned about the life of the families, not as a canvasser learns, but as a friend learns about a friend, he made out a complete schedule, covering every significant point.  Much time was also given to careful investigation of social problems, affecting the life of the city as a whole. In several instances, through such study, residents did useful work in the way of the improvement and development of",
    "\nKarl Friedrich von Hagenow (19 January 1797 \u2013 18 October 1865) was a Pomeranian aristocrat, archaeologist, paleontologist, geologist, naturalist, inventor, and antiquarian. He studied megalithic graves in the West Pomeranian region as well its birdlife. He also collected and documented chalk fossils in R\u00fcgen, amassing nearly 10000 fossils by the 1830s.\nLife and work\nMap of R\u00fcgen by Hagenow, 1829\nHagenow was born in Langenfelde, Vorpommern, the eldest of nine children born in the manor of Friedrich Christoph Karl Hagenow and Marie Mentz. They were made nobility in 1802. The young Hagenow studied natural sciences at the University of Greifswald where he was influenced by Gustav Salomon Tillberg. After his father died, his mother married Tillberg. Hagenow initially studied agriculture and then went to Dargun, Mecklenburg where he worked as an adjunct in the judicial office. He worked as a military volunteer in 1817\u201318 with the Garde-Sch\u00fctzen-Bataillon in Berlin but also attended lectures in the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t. He moved to R\u00fcgen in 1818 to the Poggendorf Estate near Schaprode and married a relative, Elisabeth Karoline Hennings, the next year. They would have five children. He began to study West Pomeranian megalithic burials and also took an interest in the birds of the region. He found nearly 239 graves in the region. In 1830 he discovered a skeleton in a marl pit which drew a lot of attention. He received an honorary doctorate in 1830 from the University of Greifswald. In 1832 he setup Germany's first factory to produce chalk slurry (whiting or calcium carbonate) with equipment that he designed himself. He also gave lectures in applied mathematics at the Agricultural Academy in Eldena between 1835 and 1838. After the death of his mother in 1844 he inherited Nielitz estate. He began to use trigonometrical survey techniques to produce a map of Pomerania and R\u00fcgen in 1839. He sold off his factory in 1850 and spent all his time on scientific research. In 1851 he published a work on the Bryozoans of Mastricht cretaceous which he examined in the company of Charles Lyell, making use of an instrument he designed to draw fossils accurately. He called this camera lucida like instrument the dicatopter and patented it in 1851. He presented the dicatopter at the Vienna meeting of the Academy of Sciences in 1854. Failing eyesight led to a reduction in his paleontology work and he shifted to archaeology and history. He studied heraldry and began to reproduce old seals.\nHagenow's collection of antiquities was purchased after his death for 1550 thalers and are now held in the Stralsund Museum. Some of his fossils were in the state museum in Stettin but a lot was destroyed in World War II. From his manuscript notes, some of the fossils have been identified as that of Mosasaurs.\n",

    "Bruneian entrepreneur and philanthropist (born 1938)\nIn this Chinese name, the family name is  W\u0113n (\u6e29).\nOnn Siew Siong (Chinese: \u6e29\u745e\u7965; pinyin: W\u0113n Ru\u00ecxi\u00e1ng; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Un S\u016bi-si\u00f4ng; born 1938) was a Bruneian aristocrat, entrepreneur and community leader in both the business and educational sectors of Brunei. His commitment to philanthropy and collaboration with the government significantly shaped the community throughout his life. In 1997, he transitioned from the construction industry to focus more on serving his country and its people, all while maintaining his leadership roles, including chairman of the Belait Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Chung Hua School, Tutong, and holding directorships in several companies.\nEarly life and education\nBorn in 1938, Onn began his education at Chung Hua School in Tutong, Brunei, where he completed his elementary schooling in five years. He subsequently chose to suspend his studies to assist his father in managing the family business during a financial crisis, dedicating over 20 years to this endeavour. Although his formal education concluded at the elementary level, his extensive experience in operating the family business provided him with invaluable insights and expertise. This practical involvement not only honed his leadership skills but also contributed significantly to his profound understanding of local commerce and community engagement.\nCareer\nIn 1972, Onn joined the Belait Chinese Chamber of Commerce as a public relations secretary. His tireless efforts and the high regard in which he was held by his fellow members culminated in his election as chairman of the chamber in 1987, a position he has maintained to this day. Reflecting on his role, Onn articulated, \"The Chinese Chamber of Commerce is geared towards increasing the country's economy,\" thereby underscoring the chamber's commitment to fostering robust relations between the Chinese community and the government. He further emphasised the CCC's ongoing support and active collaboration in national festivities, highlighting its dedication to promoting community engagement and contributing to economic development.\nOnn has been involved in societal contributions and education since 1962, notably serving as a member of the Sultan's birthday celebration committee for many years.

It has a redshift of 0.140, and was discovered by astronomers in 1992 who conducted the Einstein IPC Slew Survey. It belongs to a class of high frequency-peaked BL Lac objects.\nCharacteristics\n1ES 0229+200 has an active galactic nucleus. It is classified either an extreme TeV blazar or an unusual high synchrotron peaked object, exhibiting a high synchrotron peak frequency of vsyn ~ 1019 Hz. It also shows X-ray polarization with a polarization degree found significantly higher, compared to the first IXPE observation on Markarian 501 but similar to the observation conducted on Markarian 421.\n1ES 0229+200 contains a hard intrinsic spectrum with a spectral index inside an energy range betwixt ~ 0.5 TeV and ~ 15 TeV. Because of its hard spectrum, the galaxy was used as a primary source to examine extragalactic background light and intergalactic magnetic fields.\nThe host galaxy of 1ES 0229+200 is a relatively normal elliptical galaxy without any visible galaxy companions within its position. It has a half-light radius estimated re = 3.25 \u00b1 0.07\" with a brightness of mhost,R = 15.85 \u00b1 0.01 magnitude. The supermassive black hole in the center of 1ES 0229+220 is 9.38 \u00b1 9.08 M\u0298 based on a fundamental plane measurement. However a study paper published in 2005, re-estimated the black hole mass as 8.68 \u00b1 0.13 M\u0298 according to a mass-dispersion of (M\u0298 -\u03c3) value and a fundamental plane relation.\n1ES 0229+200 contains two radio jets, comprising a parsec-scale jet and a kiloparsec-scale jet; the former which it is aligned to. Both of the jets located north and south, are found to be curved towards a west direction and they have position angles of -10\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 respectively. There is also a compact radio source that is found unresolved about 100\" to the north.\nA gamma ray signal has been found at a distance of less than 3\u00b0 from 1ES 0229+200. Although no clear associations are found relating with the signal, it has a point-like nature and a steep energy spectrum.\n",

Born in Guangdong province, Ho studied history at Lingnan University and Yenching University before serving as a research assistant to Chen Yinke in 1949. Chen arranged for Ho to travel in secret to the United States, where he attended Harvard University, receiving an M.A. in 1953. He was hired as the curator of Oriental and Chinese art at the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1958, where he worked under director Sherman Lee. In 1983, he transferred to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri. Ho and his wife Wai-ching organized the 1992 exhibition Century of Tung Ch'i-ch'ang, 1555-1636. He served as chief editor of the exhibition's catalogue, which received the first Shimada Prize in 1993. Alongside his curator duties, Ho worked as an adjunct professor at Case Western Reserve University and the University of Kansas.\nBiography\nWai-Kam Ho was born in Guangdong on 26 March 1924. He attended an undergraduate program at Lingnan University in Guangzhou, graduating in 1947. He transferred to the graduate history program at Yenching University in Beijing. Two years later, Ho returned to serve as a research assistant to Chen Yinke. Chen trained Ho in his specialty of Buddhist manuscripts and iconography.\nIn 1950, Chen arranged for Ho to travel to the United States in secret to study art history. Ho attended Harvard University, where he studied under Benjamin Rowland. He also studied Buddhist history under Kenneth K. S. Chen at the Harvard\u2013Yenching Institute. In 1953, Ho received a master's degree in Chinese history and Asian art. He remained at Harvard in a doctoral program until 1958. That year, he was appointed as the curator of Oriental and Chinese art at the Cleveland Museum of Art, where he worked under director Sherman Lee.\nCuration\nHo began publishing articles in the Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art soon after joining the museum, generally writing on Buddhist artifacts. He frequently worked at home, greatly irritating Lee; in one instance, Lee placed a wanted poster of Ho in his office. Ho prolifically documented pieces in the museum's exhibition catalogues, collaborating with Lee for the 1968 exhibition Chinese Art under the Mongols and the 1980 Eight Dynasties of Chinese Painting. Ho identified a painting belonging to the 10th-century master Juran by matching an inventory seal to one used by the Song dynasty government. In addition to his work at the Museum, Ho worked as an adjunct professor at Case Western Reserve University from 1962 to 1983. In 1976, he served as a visiting professor at Harvard.\nIn 1983, after requesting a position from curator Marc Wilson, Ho was appointed the Laurence Sickman Curator of Chinese Art at the Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.

Israel imposed a siege over the area and obstructed the entry of aid to Jabalia, which the Palestinian envoy to the United Nations described as \"a genocide within genocide\".\nAirstrike\nIsrael struck the primary school on 17 October 2024, killing at least 28 and wounding more than 160, claiming that the strike targeted an \"operational meeting point\" for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants, without providing substantial evidence. Israel named 18 men who it accused of conducting rocket attacks and attacking IDF soldiers. The Israeli military claimed to have worked to mitigate civilian harm in the airstrike, including by using aerial surveillance and a precise munition. \nHamas strongly denied the claim that it had used the UNRWA school for fighting purposes, and called it \"nothing but lies\" and a \"systematic policy of the enemy to justify its crime.\" The director of Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia reported that the hospital was small and could not receive all of the Palestinians injured by the strike, adding that most of those presented were women and children. He also stated that there was no water to extinguish the fire, and that the attack constitutes a massacre. Several tents caught fire, causing smoke to rise. A health ministry official stated, \"Civilians and children are being killed, burned under fire\". At least 5 children were killed in the strike.\n",

    "Organizations based in Indonesia\n5P Global Movement is a global initiative based in Indonesia that focuses on five core values: Peace, Prosperity, People, Planet, and Partnership. The movement was founded by Arsjad Rasjid, an Indonesian entrepreneur and community leader, and was officially launched in Jakarta on September 7, 2023. The movement aims to promote sustainable and inclusive development by emphasizing equality and international cooperation.\nHistory\n5P Global Movement originated from a dialogue initiated in 2022 between three global figures: Pope Francis, Michal Kurtyka (former president of COP-24), and Arsjad Rasjid. This dialogue resulted in the idea of advancing global change through the values of 5P, inspired by Indonesia's principles of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity) and Gotong Royong (mutual cooperation). These principles emphasize harmony in diversity and equitable collaboration.\nCore values\nPeace: A fundamental principle for ensuring balance, equality, harmony, and stability. Without peace, any effort becomes futile.\nProsperity: Contributes to the achievement of peace by reducing social and economic inequalities, which minimizes the likelihood of conflict.\nPeople: Aims at improving individuals' overall quality of life\u2014physically, mentally, and in terms of skills, fostering independence, economic development, and well-being.\nPlanet: Focuses on caring for and preserving the earth for the best future of humanity.\nPartnership: Inclusive collaboration that accelerates the world's progress in achieving all other goals without leaving anyone behind.\nActivities and programs\n5P Global Movement has participated in various international events, including the G20 Summit 2022 in Bali and the Tri Hita Karana Forum. The movement also supports the Scholas Occurrentes program in Southeast Asia to promote cross-cultural education. In May 2024, the movement launched 5P Kids, focusing on children's rights globally, and participated in organizing World Children's Day at the Vatican that same year. In August 2024, the 5P Global Movement supported the launch of the Scholas Citizenship program in Indonesia, marking the first time Scholas Occurrentes brought its program to Southeast Asia. This program, in partnership with the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of Indonesia, brought together 200 student delegates from various educational institutions across the country.\nA key focus of the 5P Global Movement is empowering Indonesian youth. Through its collaboration with Scholas Occurrentes, 5P has helped develop youth training programs, sending young Indonesians to Spain to receive intensive training in Scholas' methodologies. These youth are expected to bring these methods back to their communities, fostering global citizenship and promoting the values of diversity and inclusion.\nGlobal network\n5P Global Movement is headquartered in Indonesia with a representative office in Poland. The movement also plans to expand its network to Latin America, North America, Africa, and the Middle East.\n",

He was generally associated with the founding and continued success of National City, California.\nEarly life and career before California\nKimball was born in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, on January 26, 1832. His parents were Asa Kimball and Hanna Little. He began his career as a businessman when he opened a merchandise store. However, with the Panic of 1857, he fell into debt, which drove him to take out a loan and travel westward.\nLife in California\nSan Francisco Bay Area\nIn 1861, Kimball moved to San Francisco. In December 1862, Kimball's wife came to San Francisco aboard the Orizaba. In San Francisco, Kimball and his brothers began carpentry work, and were able to send money back to New Hampshire to pay off his debts there. Operating in Oakland as Kimball Brothers, they later moved to southern California, to the area that would become National City. Frank's brother, Levi Kimball, became a partner of Kimball Brothers briefly in National City, then returned to Oakland with his wife. In 1867, Frank Kimball was diagnosed with a lung disease and told to relocate to a place with a warmer and drier climate.\nNational City\nArrival in San Diego\nFrank Kimball House\nKimball arrived in San Diego, California, on June 1, 1868. He had purchased the Rancho de la Naci\u00f3n on June 15 for $30,000, but due to an error on the deed the sale from Fran\u00e7ois Louis Pioche was only finalized on June 18. At the time of purchase, no one resided on the lands of the rancho. The Kimball House was built in August-September 1868 and became the first house in National City. That same year Kimball had a hand in the founding of the San Diego Union.\nAgricultural industry\nKimball promoted fruit cultivation in National City, which led others to plant fruit elsewhere in San Diego County. In 1869, Kimball received Mission olive tree cuttings from Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1 in the San Diego River valley. By 1872, his cuttings had begun to bloom.:\u200a4\u200a He would later get Mission olive tree cuttings from Mission San Luis Rey de Francia and Las Flores Estancia.:\u200a5,\u200a6\u200a In 1873, Kimball began to raise sheep.:\u200a5\u200a In 1876, he planted the first eucalyptus in San Diego County.:\u200a1\u200a In 1879, Kimball received French olive trees from the government, and planted them.:\u200a7\u200a He also grew grapes and citrus crops, including a variety of lemon which he developed, known as the Agnes. Another orchard which Kimball grew was White Pearmin, an apple cultivar, which originated from a sapling from New Hampshire. In addition to the White Pearmin orchard, Kimball grew Ben Davis apples.\nIn 1880, Kimball was among those who helped organize the first San Diego County Fair. He would eventually grow more foreign olive cultivars, including the Cornicabra.:\u200a8,\u200a9\u200a By 1883, Kimball's olive grove was 5,000 trees strong.:\u200a10\u200a In 1884, he traveled to Philadelphia, and in 1885 to New Orleans, to advertise his productive horticulture business. At the end of 1886, an olive oil mill was constructed; olive from Kimball's mill competed with the olive oil produced by Elwood Cooper of Santa Barbara, who had previously been the only domestic olive oil producer in the nation.:\u200a9,\u200a10\u200a\nExpanding into railways\nBrick Row, A Avenue between 9th and 10th Streets, National City\nIn 1870, Kimball attempted to lure the Texas and Pacific Railway to build a transcontinental railroad Pacific terminus in National City, without success; this was in part due to the efforts of the Central Pacific Railroad. After traveling to Boston, Kimball was able to secure a deal with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to build a transcontinental rail terminus in National City in 1880, in exchange for him giving the railroad 16,000 acres (65\u00a0km2). To accomplish this goal, the railway established the California Southern Railroad as a subsidiary. In 1887, Kimball funded the building of the Brick Row to house individuals connected to the Santa Fe Railway.:\u200a3\u200a As a result of this, the railroad funded the construction of Sweetwater Dam in 1888, which secured Kimball and the rest of National City a reliable water source.\nOther ventures\nIn 1880, the Kimball brothers purchased half of Rancho Janal. In 1887, Kimball purchased the portion of Rancho Janal owned by his brother Warren. His Rancho Janal holdings were lost along with his other property.\nIn 1889, Kimball wrote a family history of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Estudillo. That same year Kimball was appointed commissioner of the State Board of Horticulture; in that role he lobbied for the passage",

In the Second World War she carried German refugees and wounded in the evacuation of East Prussia in 1945. A Soviet air attack sank her that April, killing about 250 of the people aboard her.\nShe was the first of two Seereederei \u201eFrigga\u201c ships to be called Vale. The second was a motor ship that was completed in 1957.\nOne of five sisters\nBetween 1935 and 1939, Nordseewerke Emden built three sister ships for Seereederei \u201eFrigga\u201c, a shipping company with which it had close links. The \u201eFrigga\u201c company named its ships after Norse gods. Yard number 176 was completed in 1935 as Widar, after V\u00ed\u00f0arr. Yard number 186 was completed in 1937 as Bragge, after Bragi. Yard number 192 was completed in 1939 as Vale, after V\u00e1li. All were built to the same design and specification.\nIn 1938, Nordseewerke also built two ships to the same design for the Bernhardt Howaldt shipping company in Flensburg. Yard number 188 was completed as Sabine Howaldt, and yard number 189 was completed as Klaus Howaldt.\nSpecifications\nVale's registered length was 443.6\u00a0ft (135.2\u00a0m), her beam was 59.0\u00a0ft (18.0\u00a0m), and her depth was 23.6\u00a0ft (7.2\u00a0m). Her tonnages were 5,950\u00a0GRT and 3,020\u00a0NRT. She had a cruiser stern, and a raked bow. She had four cargo hatches: two forward of her bridge, one amidships between her bridge and her funnel, and one aft.\nBrage, one of Vale's sister ships, showing her cruiser stern, and the separation between her bridge and the superstructure around her funnel.\nVale had a single screw. Rheinmetall-Borsig in Tegel, Berlin, built her engines. Her main engine was a four-cylinder compound steam engine, with two high-pressure and two low-pressure cylinders. Exhaust steam from its low-pressure cylinders drove an exhaust steam turbine, which drove the same propeller shaft via a F\u00f6ttinger fluid coupling and double reduction gearing. The combined power output of her two engines was rated at 478 NHP, and gave her a speed of 12 knots (22\u00a0km/h).\nVale's navigation equipment included wireless direction finding, and \nan echo sounding device. She was equipped with wireless telegraphy, but her maritime call sign was never entered in Lloyd's Register, possibly because the beginning of the Second World War intervened. She was registered in Hamburg.\nCareer and loss\nSabine Howaldt, one of Vale's sister ships, in 1942. She is painted in camouflage colours, and has anti-aircraft guns on raised platforms on her fo'c's'le and flying bridge.\nIn April and May 1941, Vale was off the west coast of Norway, heading north. On 27 June she arrived on Stavanger from Kristiansand.\nBy May 1944, all four of Vale's sister ships had been sunk. Mines sank Brage in May 1940; Widar in March 1941; and Sabine Howaldt in May 1944. An RAAF Hampden aircraft torpedoed Klaus Howaldt in May 1943.\nOn 13 January 1945, Soviet forces began the East Prussian offensive. On 20 January, German authorities began the evacuation of East Prussia to move millions of German refugees and wounded westward, away from the approaching Eastern Front. Most were moved by sea in Operation Hannibal, in ships leaving Danzig (now Gda\u0144sk), Gotenhafen (now Gdynia), and Pillau (now Baltiysk). Soviet submarines sank some of the ships, including the liners Wilhelm Gustloff on 30 January and Steuben on 10 February, killing thousands of refugees in each case.\nGerman refugees boarding a ship in Pillau (now Baltiysk) in early 1945.\nOn or just before 22 March, Vale landed hundreds of refugees and wounded at Swinem\u00fcnde (now \u015awinouj\u015bcie), where fishing boats took them across the Oder Lagoon to Ueckerm\u00fcnde. She then returned to East Prussia.\nAs the Battle of K\u00f6nigsberg continued, tens of thousands of refugees gathered in Pillau, about 25 miles (40\u00a0km) west of the city, to be evacuated by sea.

    "Public housing in Alexandria, Virginia\nHousing in Virginia comes in a wide variety of forms, from single-family homes to apartment complexes. The rate of home ownership in the Commonwealth of Virginia was measured at 69.1% in 2023, a 2.5% increase from 2022's figure of 67.4%.\nAs with much of the United States, housing in Virginia is extremely commodified. As with the rest of the United States and much of the western world, Virginia has an extreme crisis regarding housing affordability and availability. It is extremely prevalent in the state, with estimates saying that over 10% of the population lives below the poverty line. The U.S. Census Bureau reported in 2023 that the median cost for rent is $1,440, around $300 lower than the US average of $1,739.\nTypes of housing\nAffordable\nMostly an issue in major urban centers such as Alexandria and Virginia Beach, affordable (or low-income) housing is housing that is cheaper than the market in order to provide a home for people that have low income. Those most likely to be affected by the lack in affordable housing, a Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) study found, were renters, with low incomes, that live in urban centers, and work in common and essential occupations.\nThe study reported that 67% of cost-burdened households live in major population centers like Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, with the majority of them being in Hampton Roads than the rest of the state. The most likely professions to need affordable housing were home health aides ($22,000 salary), teaching assistants ($29,000 salary), bus drivers ($45,000 salary), and social workers ($51,000 salary). The same study further reported that the state has a shortage of at least 200,000 affordable housing units.\nApartment\nLarger apartment buildings are the second-largest group of houses to have been constructed in the past decade, only behind single-family homes. Multi-family apartments account for less than one in every four homes in Virginia. Almost half of renters (46%) live in large apartment complexes with five or more units. These apartments are more likely to be leased rather than owned; only 5% of owners live in multifamily buildings.\nThe increase in the construction of apartments is most noticeable in Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Hampton Roads. However, as of 2020, they were still behind four of Virginia's six small housing markets in terms of multi-family apartments. Since 2010, the construction of apartments has been largest in the Blacksburg-Christiansburg, Roanoke, and Lynchburg areas. In 2020, more than three-quarters of all new homes in the Blackburg-Christiansburg area were apartments, most likely due to an influx of graduates from Virginia Tech and Radford University.\nSingle-family\nA graph showing the rate of growth between Virginia's population (blue) and newly built houses (pink)\nA majority of Virginians live in single-family homes, and they make up nearly all newly built homes in the commonwealth. The rate of single-family home production has more than tripled that of multi-family home production. Compared to other states, it has the 9th largest amount of single-family homes. This extends into the neighboring state of North Carolina, even going throughout much of the rural Piedmont Crescent. A majority of these are in suburban markets, with most of them being built before 2008 (due to the 2008 housing crisis). A joint study by Virginia Housing and the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) found that for every home built in an urban core of a small or rural city, more than three single-family homes were built in suburbs. To further this, over 94% of owned houses in Virginia have a porch, deck, or patio of some sort.\nTownhouse\nTownhouses have only been a fraction of Virginia's newly constructed houses in the past decade, despite being the most affordable to construct. According to the Richmond Association of Realtors, the median sales price of a townhouse in the Richmond metro area was $388,000 in September 2024. The average sales price was around $405,000, a 4,3% difference. There were 347 new listings for townhouses in September 2024, but only 272 were pending, and 226 of those were closed. Similar to apartments, lots of townhouses have been built in the Blackburg-Christiansburg area due to an influx of graduates from schools such as Virginia Tech and Radford University.\nConcerns\nCost of living\nInfographic showing the cost of rent in across Virginia's counties and cities\nIn Virginia, around 264 thousand renter households (24%) are extremely low-income. 76% of these have a severe cost burden in terms of their home. The average income for a four-person extremely low-income household is $35,110, and the annual household income need to afford a two-bedroom rental home is $62,925. The median income in Virginia is $89,931, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nShortage of housing\nCertainly not unique across the US, Virginia's shortage of hou",

    "Television was introduced to Panama extra-officially in 1956 with the start of SCN in the Panama Canal Zone and officially on March 14, 1960, with the launch of RPC Televisi\u00f3n. Currently Corporaci\u00f3n MEDCOM and TVN Media dominate the landscape.\nHistory\nEarly years\nWith the support of American engineers, RPC Televisi\u00f3n started broadcasting on March 14, 1960, owned by Radio Programas Continentales. Its inaugural acts had the participation of President Ernesto de la Guardia, as well as other political personalities of the time. It broadcast from 4:30pm to 11pm, with an abundant quantity of live programs and two news bulletins. There was also coverage of the 1960 presidential elections, held in May of that year.\nA supposed appearance of candidate Chiari led to the appearance of a second television channel. Upon winning the 1960 elections, the plan to launch their station gained impulse. Since September 1959, Harmodio Arias Madrid has gained the license to operate on channel 2, but the station never made it to air. Some suggest that Arias lost the rights to the station but others say that Arias couldn't launch his license on time. Roberto Chiari took the occasion to set up a station on channel 2, Televisora Nacional, on April 23, 1962, whose first commercial name was Tevedos. The station had technical support from ABC International Television Inc. with a heavy emphasis on musical shows and American imports. It broadcast from 2pm to midnight, having a half-hour news bulletin at 10pm.\nWith two television stations (TVN-2 and RPC-4) joining the extant AFRTS station SCN-8, the Panamanian television market began to stabilize. On November 1, 1964, a regional television station in Chiriqu\u00ed Province, Tele-Bar\u00fa, started broadcasting. However, the station shut down on January 4, 1967, due to lack of viability.\nCompetition between RPC and TVN was made in several ways: who had the better imports, expansion of the coverage area and updated recording and transmission technologies. TVN had expanded to the provinces of Cocl\u00e9, Herrera, Los Santos and Venegas in 1965 and in 1968, Chiriqu\u00ed. RPC had covered all of Panama by the end of the decade.\nThe coup and color TV\nFollowing the 1968 Panamanian coup d'\u00e9tat, new technologies were being implemented. In the early 1970s, live sporting events became a possibility thanks to satellite technologies, while TVN became the first in Panama to broadcast in color in 1972. That same year, the two Panamanian networks broadcast a sum of 180 hours and 45 minutes per week, with 71.6% consisting of imports and the remaining 28.4% produced in Panama. A closed circuit educational television station started operations in November 1973 in the University of Panama before becoming a channel in its own right, Televisi\u00f3n Educativa Experimental, the current SERTV, on January 22, 1978, on channel 6, later moving to channel 11.\nNew legislation\nChanges to the legislation were enacted in 1980, breaking the commercial monopoly of the Eleta and Chiari families. The passing of Law 36 in the Official Gazette in 1980 gave licenses to Panavisi\u00f3n del Istmo, of Vice-president Ricardo de la Espriella, on channel 5 in Panam\u00e1 Province and Medios Paname\u00f1os, of ex-chancellor Nicol\u00e1s Gonz\u00e1lez Revilla, gained channel 13 in the metropolitan area of the capital, creating Telemetro. Telemetro started on October 13, 1981 as a subscription television channel with a six-hour schedule of three movies, mostly vintage.:\u200a28\u200a A relay station in Col\u00f3n was installed in 1983,:\u200a32\u200a before achieving total national coverage in 1992. Panavisi\u00f3n, on its hand, started broadcasting on October 21, 1983. Within a year, Panavisi\u00f3n had already set up relay stations to cover all nine provinces.\nAlthough Panavisi\u00f3n was an impartial network, the station was later taken by the military forces which ultimately led to De la Espriella losing its television license, upon losing support from Noriega. The exit of Nicol\u00e1s Ardito Barletta from its management caused Arturo del Valle to buy the station. Eventually Del Valle left the control of the station causing Panavisi\u00f3n to file for bankruptcy and shut down before the end of the dictatorship.\nThe Chiari family sold TVN to colonels and people with connections to the National Guard, however it has been theorized that the station was expropriated by orders of Noriega and the Defense Forces. The Chiaris moved to the agricultural industry, while one of their descendants, Rodolfo Chiari de Le\u00f3n, continued working at the station as general manager.\nIn 1989, RPC and Telemetro were sanctioned by Minister of Government and Justice, Rodolfo Chiari de Le\u00f3n, for its lack of support of its services for the State. TVN was faithful to the military regime and wasn't penalized. Tensions between the networks and the regime skyrocketed, to an extent where, ahead of the American invasion, all Panamanian media outlets closed. SCN TV continued operations.\nThe 90s\nOn December 25, 1989 (Christmas Day), RPC is authorized to return to the ",

    "Australian mining engineer (1873\u20131930)\nAllan Arthur Davidson (26 January 1873 \u2013 7 January 1930) was an Australian mining engineer, prospector and explorer who undertook some of his most notable work in the Northern Territory in his explorations of the Tanami Desert.\nEarly life\nDavidson was the son of James Johnson Davidson and Janet Davidson (n\u00e9e Aitcheson) and he was born in Harrow, Victoria. \nThe journalist James Edward Davidson (1870\u20131930) was a brother.\nBy 1886 the family had moved to Thackaringa Station, near Broken Hill, where his father had been appointed the manager.\nIn 1887 Davidson began working in mines nearby and, in 1889 moved to Adelaide where he was employed at the Australian Smelting and Refining Company and later graduated from the Adelaide School of Mines with qualifications in mining and metallurgy.\nIn the 1890s Davidson travelled frequently and undertook a variety of mining and prospecting work in Kalgoorlie, Mount Pleasant and New Guinea. For the trip to New Guinea, which took place between March and August 1897, he was commissioned by Zebina Lane and, from his exploration, found that the cost of gold mining there would be too high due to the isolation of the goldfields.\nLife in the Northern Territory\nIn 1897 Lane appointed Davidson as the manager of the Central Australian Exploration Company, which is also known as the Central Australian Exploration Syndicate Limited. Davidson and his team departed from Adelaide in November 1897 and spent three years exploring lands between Tennant Creek and Barrow Creek. Their major discovery was The Granites gold mine in the Tanami Desert. It was Davidson who named the Tanami Desert after the Warlpiri language name for the permanent waterholes near his gold find.\nDavidson drew accurate and detailed maps of the region, which was previously considered one of 'the largest block of unknown country in Australia', and these were used for many years by other prospectors and mining companies.\nDuring this expedition Davidson also discovered wolframite at Hatches Creek wolfram field but, as they were looking for gold, this discovery was not followed up at the time.\nAfter the completion of their journey Davidson published his 'Journal of explorations in Central Australia / by the Central Australian Exploration Syndicate, Limited, under the leadership of Allan A. Davidson, 1898 to 1900' (1905).\nLater life\nIn 1901, after the completion of this exploration in Central Australia, Davidson spent time mining in West Africa (Nigeria and Ghana) and later also in Chile. During World War I, when travelling between London and Nigeria his ship, the Fullabar, was sunk by a German submarine and he became one of the few survivors. He them returned to London and sold his interests in the Nigerian mining company and established himself as a consulting mining engineer there.\nHe died in London in 1930.\nLegacy\nThe following locations are named for Davidson: \nMount Davidson, Tanami Desert (Jarnami).\nDavidson Park, Tennant Creek (Jurnkkurakurr).\nDavidson Street, Alice Springs (Mparntwe).\nDavidson Street, Tennant Creek (Jurnkkurakurr).",
    "Mountain in Wyoming, United States\nMount Humphreys is an 11,019-foot-elevation (3,359-meter) mountain summit in Park County, Wyoming, United States.\nDescription\nMount Humphreys is set on the boundary that Yellowstone National Park shares with Washakie Wilderness. It ranks as the sixth-highest peak in the park. The mountain is located seven miles (11\u00a0km) east of Yellowstone Lake, 0.62 miles (1.00\u00a0km) southeast of Mount Schurz which is the nearest higher peak, and two miles (3.2\u00a0km) northwest of Eagle Peak, the park's highest point. The mountain is part of the Absaroka Range. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's south and west slopes drains into headwaters of Trappers Creek which is a tributary of the Yellowstone River, whereas the northeast slope drains into headwaters of Eagle Creek which is a tributary of the Shoshone River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises over 2,600 feet (792 meters) above Eagle Creek in one mile. Volcanoes of the early Eocene supplied the material that formed the mountain 50\u201355 million years ago, and here created the rugged terrain in Yellowstone Park. The mountain was named in 1871 by Captain J.W. Barlow for General Andrew A. Humphreys (1810\u20131883), at that time the Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army. Andrew Humphreys supported Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden's 1871 survey of Yellowstone, and later was helpful in establishing the United States Geological Survey. The mountain's toponym was officially adopted in 1930 by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\nClimate\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Mount Humphreys is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and cool to warm summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F. \nGallery\nSoutheast aspect of Mt. Humphreys, (with Mt.

    "Ethnic group\nThe Badiu people are a West African ethnic group predominantly located on the island of Santiago, Cape Verde. They trace their ancestry to enslaved Africans brought to the island during the transatlantic slave trade. The Badiu have developed a unique cultural identity influenced by their African heritage, historical experiences, and the geographic features of Santiago. Today, they form a significant part of the population on Santiago, the largest and most populous island in Cape Verde.\nOrigin\nThe ethnogenesis of the Badiu people began during the 15th century with the Atlantic slave trade, as enslaved Africans were transported to Santiago by European traders. These individuals came primarily from West African ethnic groups such as the Mandinga, Wolof, Fulani, Balanta, and Mandyako. Many escaped or freed Africans established communities in the island's interior, which contributed to the formation of the Badiu identity by preserving traditional African cultural practices and customs.\nHistory\nEarly history\nThe archipelago of Cape Verde was uninhabited before the Portuguese discovered it in the 15th century. They quickly established Santiago as a hub for the slave trade, bringing Africans from regions including Guinea-Bissau, Senegambia, and Sierra Leone to work on plantations. The Badiu emerged during this early colonial period, forming autonomous communities in the rugged interior of Santiago as runaway enslaved people. These communities, considered the first maroon society in the modern world, preserved African cultural elements and resisted colonial control.\nTransatlantic slave trade and African origins\nThe Badiu are predominantly descended from West and Central African ethnic groups such as the Mandinka, Wolof, Balanta, Fulani, and Kongo. These groups were forcibly transported to Santiago, where the island's mountainous terrain provided a refuge for escaped slaves who formed the core of the Badiu population. Over time, their culture diverged from that of the coastal Sampadjudo communities, who had more European cultural influences.\nPost-slavery period and Badiu identity\nAfter slavery's abolition, the Badiu people continued to maintain a rural lifestyle, emphasizing traditional African customs, language, and spiritual practices. Santiago, in contrast to other Cape Verdean islands, remained closer to its African roots, and the Badiu identity became a prominent symbol of African heritage in Cape Verde, distinguishing the island's inhabitants from other groups.\nCulture\nLanguage\nThe Badiu people speak Badiu Creole (or Santiago Creole), a variant of Cape Verdean Creole. This dialect retains features from African languages spoken by their ancestors and differs in pronunciation and vocabulary from other Creole varieties, influenced by the isolated nature of Santiago\u2019s interior.\nMusic and dance\nBadiu cultural contributions to Cape Verdean music include genres such as batuku and funan\u00e1, which are rooted in African traditions. Batuku features rhythmic drumming and call-and-response singing, often performed by women, while funan\u00e1 is a fast-paced dance genre using the gaita (accordion), popular throughout the archipelago.\nReligion and spiritual practices\nAlthough Roman Catholicism is prevalent, traditional African spiritual practices, such as ancestor veneration and beliefs in natural forces, persist among the Badiu. Over time, these practices have blended with Catholicism, resulting in a unique syncretic form of worship.\nSocial structure and customs\nBadiu society is characterized by strong kinship networks and communal ties. Traditional leadership roles, such as elders and councils, remain influential in rural areas. Agriculture and livestock herding continue to be central to their way of life.\nGeography and demographics\nThe Badiu primarily reside on Santiago, which has a population of around 300,000, making it the largest Cape Verdean island. Additionally, Badiu communities are present on the islands of Maio, Boa Vista, and Sal. The interior regions of Santiago, with their rugged terrain, historically served as refuges for runaway slaves, helping the Badiu to preserve their cultural heritage.\nNotable Badiu people\nProminent individuals of Badiu descent who have contributed significantly to various fields include:\nAmilcar Cabral \u2013 revolutionary leader and key figure in Cape Verde's and Guinea-Bissau's independence movements.\nAristides Pereira \u2013 first president of Cape Verde.\nDino d'Santiago \u2013 singer blending traditional Cape Verdean music with contemporary influences.\nZeca di Nha Reinalda \u2013 Cape Verdean musician.\nSara Tavares \u2013 acclaimed singer-songwriter and cultural ambassador.\nJos\u00e9 Ulisses Correia e Silva \u2013 current prime minister of Cape Verde.\nToni Varela \u2013 footballer representing the Cape Verde national team.\nEdimilson Fernandes \u2013 international footballer who has played for Switzerland.\nJ\u00falio Tavares \u2013 footballer with a career in France.\nDjaniny \u2013 footballer with experience in top leagues in Spain and ",
    "Rugby player\nBrian Carlyle Henderson (31 January 1939 \u2014 5 November 2020) was a Scottish international rugby union player.\nBorn in Edinburgh, Henderson attended Dalkeith High School and had three seasons in the first XV, then began playing for Edinburgh Wanderers in the 1956\u201357 season, following a stint with local side Dalkeith RFC. He served in Aden during his national service with the Northamptonshire Regiment.\nHenderson, a large centre three quarter, was a powerful runner and strong tackler. He stood at 6\u00a0ft 3 in and at close to 16 stone outsized many forwards. After debuting for Edinburgh District in 1960\u201361, Henderson gained his first Scotland cap in their final 1963 Five Nations fixture, against England at Twickenham. He won a further 11 caps over the next three years, forming a centre partnership with Iain Laughland. Both his two career tries came in a loss to France at Stade Colombes in 1965. He got recruited to tour Australasia with the British & Irish Lions in 1966, but was unavailable to make the trip.\nAfter retiring from rugby at 27, Henderson spent the remainder of his working life with Norwich Union.\nSee also\nList of Scotland national rugby union players",
    "River in Saskatchewan, Canada\nCut Knife Creek is a river in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The river begins about 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi) south of the Highway 40 / Highway 21 intersection and ends at Battle River in the Poundmaker Cree Nation. Battle River is a major tributary of the North Saskatchewan River. The Battle of Cut Knife of the North-West Rebellion took place on Cut Knife Hill near the river on 2 May 1885. The site of the battle was designated a National Historic Site of Canada and is the location of Chief Poundmaker's grave.\n'Cut Knife' is named after a Sarcee chief who was killed in a skirmish with the Cree near the area in the 1840s.\nHistory\nIn March 1885, Chief Poundmaker and fellow Cree band members travelled to Battleford in search of supplies and rations for famine relief. The local Indian agent refused to meet with Poundmaker and with \"a lot of restless Indians wandering the vicinity of the town\", the homesteaders fled to the nearby Fort Battleford. With the village deserted, the Indians looted it. In response, Lieutenant-Colonel William Otter and nearly 400 men were dispatched to attack Poundmaker. On 2 May 1885, Otter crossed Cut Knife Creek and attacked Poundmaker's camp at Cut Knife Hill. After a six-hour battle, Otter's attack was repelled by Poundmaker and his warriors. Otter and his forces retreated back across Cut Knife Creek and returned to Battleford. To prevent further bloodshed, Poundmaker ordered his forces not to pursue. Later that year, Poundmaker turned himself in and was convicted of treason. After serving seven months of a three-year sentence, he was released. He died in 1886 of a lung haemorrhage.\nCut Knife Hill has since been renamed to Chief Poundmaker Hill.\nDescription\nCut Knife Creek begins in the RM of Cut Knife No. 439 at a slough by Highway 21 and from there heads east towards Gallivan. Cut Knife Creek passes to the south of Gallivan then turns north where it crosses Highway 40 (Poundmaker Trail) and meets Saline Creek. From Saline Creek, the river winds itself back west then turns north into the Poundmaker Cree Nation. It meets Poundmaker Creek, winds around Chief Poundmaker Hill, and empties into Battle River.\nSee also\nList of rivers of Saskatchewan\nHudson Bay drainage basin\nCut Knife, Saskatchewan",
    "American health system in Florida\nBayCare Health System is a nonprofit organization headquartered in Clearwater, Florida, that operates 16 hospitals across Florida. In 2023, it was the third largest hospital network in Florida.\nHistory\nEarly history\nBayCare can trace its roots to the  CareFirst Health Network, a PPO network formed in 1995 by seven not-for-profit hospitals in Tampa Bay, with contracts with four others, which replaced SunHealth Care Plans-Gulf Coast\nBayfront Medical Center\nSt. Anthony's Hospital\nAll Children's Hospital\nSt. Joseph's Hospital\nSt. Joseph's Women's Hospital\nUniversity Community Hospital\nUniversity Community Hospital-Carrollwood\nMease Countryside Hospital\nMease Dunedin Hospital\nMorton Plant Hospital\nSouth Florida Baptist Hospital\nBy August of that year, it had been renamed BayCare Health Network Inc. due to trademark issues, and several member hospitals began withdrawing from other competing PPOs. In 1996, the 14-hospital BayCare Health Network hired The Hunter Group in the face of increasing competition with Columbia/HCA's 14-hospital Tampa Bay Health System. William Anderson, president and CEO of South Florida Baptist Hospital at the time, expressed the possibility of a merger, and unnamed sources at BayCare \"said the options range from forming a holding company with the hospitals retaining individual assets and partial autonomy to a full merger among some or all of the facilities.\" Membership in either managed-care network was not necessarily exclusive, as All Children's Hospital was a member of both. The Hunter Group presented BayCare with a 700-page report proposing a merger between 17 not-for-profit hospitals.\nIn July 1997, acting on The Hunter Group's report, BayCare Health System was formed as a 50-year pact and joint operating agreement. Bayfront-St. Anthony's Health Care in St. Petersburg, Morton Plant Mease Health Care in Dunedin, and St. Joseph's-Baptist Health Care in Tampa formed BayCare as a seven hospital network, with Mease's two hospitals initially excluded due to a 1994 antitrust settlement regarding parent Morton Plant Mease. The corporate parties to the JOA included Allegany Health System, owner of St. Anthony's and St. Joseph's, Morton Plant Mease, Bayfront, and South Florida Baptist Hospital.\nBayfront Medical Center\nSt. Anthony's Hospital\nSt. Joseph's Hospital\nSt. Joseph's Children's Hospital\nSt. Joseph's Women's Hospital\nMorton Plant Hospital\nSouth Florida Baptist Hospital\nIn March 1998, Morton Plant Mease Health Care Inc. began to manage North Bay Hospital in New Port Richey, before acquiring it entirely from Tenet Healthcare in a June 1999 transaction.\n2000-2009\nOn October 23, 2000, over a controversy with the City of St. Petersburg regarding abortions, BayCare members voted 3\u20131 to remove Bayfront from the alliance, with South Florida Baptist Hospital, Morton Plant Health Care, and Catholic Health East voting to remove Bayfront. Bayfront was the only vote against. St. Anthony's Hospital had previously consolidated its obstetrics department with its long time partner Bayfront in May 1999, with Bayfront-St. Anthony's CEO Sue Brody stating at the time that no changes would come to Bayfront's willingness to perform sterilization or \"medically necessary\" abortion procedures. Shortly thereafter in July, BayCare head Frank Murphy announced that roughly 10 abortions per year that were allowed at Bayfront in the past were now considered disallowed due to Catholic restrictions. This prompted inquiry from the St. Petersburg City Council in September, as Bayfront leased much of its property from the city, as well as a federal lawsuit filed by the City of St. Petersburg against Bayfront and BayCare on March 30, 2000. Bayfront filed its own lawsuit against the City of St. Petersburg the following day, and a second lawsuit was filed against BayCare, Bayfront, and the City of St. Petersburg by the ACLU and other civil rights groups on August 16, 2000. The partnership between Bayfront and St. Anthony's was formally dissolved on December 31, 2000.\nIn November 2000, BayCare signed a letter of intent with All Children's Hospital to \"create and jointly operate a not-for-profit children's healthcare system\", amidst rumors the hospital may join BayCare. The All Children's Health System would've provided healthcare to children at BayCare's hospitals, including Tampa Children's Hospital at St. Joseph's but the deal was scrapped less than one year later citing cost issues.\nIn April 2005, Morton Plant and Mease announced plans to finalize the merger they originally attempted in 1994, which the United States Department of Justice had initially blocked before limiting it in scope, and then reinvestigated in 1998. The Department of Justice eventually allowed the Morton Plant Mease merger to close later that year by filing no objections, fully combining the boards of Morton Plant Mease Health Care, Mease Health Care and the Morton Plant Hospital Association. This allowed Mease Countrys",

    "American builder-contractor, tiny-house movement advocate, reality TV co-host\nZack Giffin (born April 20, 1983) is an American carpenter and builder-contractor, tiny-house movement advocate, co-host of the FYI reality television series Tiny House Nation, and former professional freeskier.\nCareer\nRoad to Tiny House Nation\nBefore he was hired to be the co-host of the July 2014-launched FYI series Tiny House Nation wherein he also took the role of being the show's chief builder-contractor, Giffin ran with his brother Sam a production company they called Right On Brother Productions, producing short films. After gaining local fame with their material, Giffin was partnered with photographer Grant Gunderson to travel around the world to ski for bigger-budget production companies.\nIn the process of his being a skier born and raised in Gold Hill, Colorado who later decided to move to the Mt. Baker Ski Area in Washington, and previously a teenager who went on ski trips all over the United States and Canada on vehicles modified for the parking-lot lifestyle, and then with his globe-trotting with Gunderson, Giffin acquired ample appreciation for the practicality of mobile homes, and, as a professional carpenter and a new advocate of mobility, became attracted to the larger \"tiny house\" concept, philosophy and aesthetics after seeing one such house. Encouraged by his spouse Molly, he looked at the idea of travelling while shooting videos, and with the high cost of RV rentals the couple decided to build their own tiny home. With the help of one of his skiing sponsors, Outdoor Research, Giffin built his first tiny home in the fall of 2011, completing it with the help of friends and family in less than two months. Thereafter he set out on an almost-constant travel aboard the new house for three years while he produced short films that would later be known as the \"OR Tiny House Tour\" videos. As a culmination of this project, Giffin's brother Sam edited a 20-minute short film from the collection entitled \"Livin' Tiny - A Quest for Powder\", which received wide viewership on YouTube. The film was watched by television executives in New York City who, in early 2014, later called Giffin while he was camped in Asulkan Parking on Rodgers Pass, BC, to ask if he could be on a plane for New York within a week to meet with them. Giffin accepted the invitation, which led to the production of Tiny House Nation wherein he and John Weisbarth served as co-hosts and members of a team of co-producers.\nOperation Tiny Home nonprofit\nGiffin became not only an advocate for the tiny house movement as part of the overall environmental movement but also a participant in discussions about zoning policy (noting, for example, that zoning laws that limit the use of tiny homes also hamper efforts to improve cities' energy efficiency), affordable housing, and homelessness.\nIn 2015 he became involved with a nonprofit organization called Operation Tiny Home, which aimed to support the construction of tiny-home villages for homeless veterans. He has since then held workshops for groups of veterans in 16 different states in the United States. The organization's program later expanded to include Native American communities and women's shelters. Giffin also later formed a down-payment assistance program for \"local heroes\", regardless of military service.\nTiny Home Industry Association vice president\nThe Colorado Blueprint 2.0 Initiatives, in collaboration with the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade and under the direction of former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, supported the launch of the Tiny Home Industry Association (THIA) as a trade organization in 2016. In 2018, Giffin joined the board of the THIA where he would later serve as vice president. In this latter capacity he was invited to speak with the US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, DC, at the National Convention of Mayors in Miami, and at the Clinton Presidential Library in Arkansas as a de facto spokesman for the tiny-house movement and minimalism.\nOther achievements in media\n2011 \u2013 Cover of Powder Magazine (skiing magazine managing-edited by John Bresee)\n2011-2014 \u2013 Director, OR Tiny House Tour\n2013 \u2013 Director, Winter's People\n2013 \u2013 Featured athlete, Valhalla (Sweetgrass Productions)\n2015 \u2013 Featured athlete, Ruin and Rose (Matchstick Productions)\n2019 \u2013 Writer, director and star, Ridge of Dreams\nPersonal life\nGiffin is married to Molly Baker, a fellow professional backcountry skier and freeskier.\nHe owns a company named Zack Rabbit Tool Company.\n",
    "Carillon in Kaunas, Lithuania\nThe Kaunas Carillon (Lithuanian: Kauno kariljonas) is a carillon in the tower of the Vytautas the Great War Museum in Kaunas, Lithuania. The carillon officially belongs to the Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Lithuania and Vytautas the Great War Museum. In the interwar period, it was the only carillon in Lithuania, however currently four other carillons are also in Klaip\u0117da, Vilnius, \u0160akiai, and Gelgaudi\u0161kis Manor.\nThe tower where the Kaunas Carillon is located is 32 metres (105\u00a0ft) tall and has an observation deck. The total weight of the carillon's bells is 4,334 kilograms (9,555\u00a0lb). The largest bell weighs 751 kilograms (1,656\u00a0lb) and was funded by the Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus and his wife Alma Adamkien\u0117. Music played on the Kaunas Carillon can be heard within a 3-kilometre (1.9\u00a0mi) radius.\nHistory\nJuozas Tallat-Kelp\u0161a in Brussels selecting bells for the carillon in 1935\nIn 1933, a modern carillon was commissioned in a bellfoundry in Mechelen, Belgium, for the Vytautas the Great War Museum complex in Lithuania's temporary capital Kaunas. In 1935, the 35 bells and other components were cast by the foundry of Marcel Michiels Jr. in Tournai, Belgium, and transported to the Lithuanian port city Klaip\u0117da. In 1937, under the auspices of general Vladas Nagevi\u010dius and composer Juozas Tallat-Kelp\u0161a, the carillon was installed in the tower of the Vytautas the Great War Museum and replaced the previous 9-bell system. Since 15 February 1937, the carillon's bells are called the bells of battles (Kov\u0173 varpai). For example, the first bell of the carillon was given the name of Lithuania's capital Vilnius (at the time controlled by Poland), the twelfth bell was dedicated to the fighter of Vilnius (Vilniaus kovotojas), the ninth bell was baptized with the name of the Battle of Giedrai\u010diai, the tenth bell was dedicated to the volunteers of the Lithuanian Armed Forces during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence (K\u016br\u0117jas savanoris), and the thirteenth bell was dedicated to the participants of the Klaip\u0117da Revolt (Klaip\u0117dos vaduotojas, literally vaduotojas means a person who liberates). In 1938, a knight sculpture was added to the tower exterior, which was created by the sculptor Juozas Mik\u0117nas from bullet muzzles collected from fields during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence and bullet muzzles from warehouses of the intendant. Until the Second World War, patriotic Lithuanian music was played on the Kaunas Carillon during flag ceremonies (e.g. Lithuanians we are born by Stasys \u0160imkus).\nAfter the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, the flag of Lithuania was lowered from the tower of Kaunas Carillon on 1 August 1940 and the playing of music on the carillon ceased. The only brief exception was on 23 June 1941 when, during the June Uprising, the Red Army was expelled from Kaunas. During the German occupation of Lithuania in 1942, the tower's knight sculpture was torn down and destroyed.\nGiedrius Antanas Kuprevi\u010dius at Kaunas Carillon in 2023\nAfter the Soviet re-occupation of Lithuania in 1944, playing the carillon was resumed only in 1956 by composer Viktoras Kuprevi\u010dius and his son Giedrius Antanas Kuprevi\u010dius, and since 1957 the playing of music became regular. In the Soviet period the Kaunas Carillon was the only carillon in Eastern Europe (excluding East Germany) and with its Belgian-made bells the music was played daily. During visits to the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, political leaders of the Warsaw Pact including Erich Honecker, J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r, and Edward Gierek had listened to performances on the carillon.\nFollowing the re-establishment of the State of Lithuania in 1990, the carillon began playing every weekend. During a major restoration in 2006, an additional 14 bells were installed.\nCommemoration of the January Events in 2010\nOn 16 February 2015, a new knight sculpture was installed on the tower exterior\u2014at 28 metres (92\u00a0ft) up\u2014and was unveiled by commemorating the anniversary of the Act of Independence of Lithuania. The new knight sculpture\u20142.7 metres (8\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) tall and weighing 200 kilograms (440\u00a0lb)\u2014is made from copper and was created by the sculptor Jonas Malinauskas, based on a project by the sculptor Juozas \u0160livinskas. The knight sculpture restoration which cost 26,000 Lithuanian litas was funded by the Kaunas City Municipality and Kaunas residents' donations, while the Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Lithuania gifted cannon ammunition nozzles which weighed several hundred kilograms.\nSince 2017, every year in September the International Kaunas Carillon Music Festival is held with Lithuanian and international carillonists (e.g. from the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, and Japan).\nOn 27 February 2022, the carillon played Ukrainian music to demonstrate support for Ukraine just a few days after the beginning of the Russia's invasion. On 24 February 2024, the carillon once again played Ukrainian music to commemorate the 2nd anniversary of th",
    "Skyscraper in Le\u00f3n, Mexico\nTorre 40 Lumi\u00e9re is a residential skyscraper in the Gran Jardin district of Le\u00f3n, Mexico. Built between 2016 and 2020, the tower stands at 162\u00a0m (531\u00a0ft) tall with 44 floors and is the current 35th tallest building in Mexico.\nHistory\nArchitecture\nThe tower was designed by Lujan Arquitectos and is located in the Gran Jardin district of Le\u00f3n. It is the tallest residential building in the Baj\u00edo region. The building was created in order to establish a dominant vertical ax in its residential neighborhood and give identity to the edifice. The main goal of the project was to maximize sustainability in the building, with even the shared spaces being powered by solar panels.

    "\nErich Ernst Kops (January 20, 1905 \u2013 May 28, 1961) was a German politician, diplomat, and Holocaust survivor.\nLife\nErich Kops was born on January 20, 1905, to a working-class family in Jena; his father was a metalworker. In 1922, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In Jena, he became chairman of the Sozialistische Arbeiter-Jugend\u00a0 (trans. Socialist Workers' Youth) for Thuringia. In August 1923, he left both the SAJ and SPD; joining the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Kops then became chairman of the Young Communist League of Germany (KJVD) in Thuringia. Party leadership considered him to be associated with the left communist faction of the party. In October 1924, Kops was arrested; he was sentenced to two years in prison in Leipzig at the end of 1925 for \"preparing for high treason\" but was released shortly afterwards due to an amnesty. From 1925 to 1928, he worked in the youth section of the Roter Frontk\u00e4mpferbund. Between 1928 and 1929 he attended the International Lenin School in Moscow, after which he became local editor of the \"Neue Zeitung\" newspaper in Jena.\nAfter the Nazi Party seized power in 1933, Kops joined the underground resistance against Nazism. Government crackdowns forced him to emigrate to Czechoslovakia in 1934. In Czechoslovakia, Kops assisted with the smuggling of anti-fascist literature into the German Reich. In 1935, he went to the Soviet Union and worked there as a machine fitter. In 1937, he enlisted in the International Brigades, and fought in the Spanish Civil War as an officer in the Th\u00e4lmann Battalion. Following the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War, he was interned in France, along with many other members of the Th\u00e4lmann Battalion. In 1943, Vichy French authorities handed Kops over to the Nazi authorities. He was transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he would remain until the conclusion of the Second World War.\nIn 1945, he was appointed as the Landrat of Ludwigslust by the Soviet occupation authorities. When the KPD merged into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1946, Kops joined the SED. He then held a series of regional leadership roles in Thuringia for the SED. In 1949, Kops was appointed as the first ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to Hungary. He held this role until 1951, when he was replaced by Stefan Heymann. In 1959, he was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in bronze. Kops died on May 28, 1961, in Dresden.\n",

    "\nJohn Francis St John Eber (1916\u20131994) was a politician and lawyer.\nBiography\nEber was born in colonial Singapore the son of Reynold Lionel Eber (1886\u20131968), a lawyer. He attended Harrow School and later Christ's College, Cambrdige before being called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1939, after which he returned to Singapore.\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Singapore, Eber was interned at Changi Prison before being moved to the Sime Road Camp. After the war, he served as the prosecuting counsel against seven Japanese officers over their involvement in the construction of the Burma Railway.\nEber was involved as a founding member and later vice chairman of the Malayan Democratic Union, and participated in the All-Malaya Council of Joint Action to agitate for a new constitution to replace that of the Malayan Union. He was involved in authoring the People's Constitutional Proposals that were rejected by the British government in favour of what eventually became known as the Federation Agreement, which formed the basis of the Federation of Malaya.\nFor alleged membership of and involvement in the Singapore Anti-British League, Eber was arrested by the Singaporean Special Branch on 8 January 1951 during the Malayan Emergency and detained at Changi Prison for two years without trial until being released on 23 February 1953.\nEber became disillusioned with the legal practice in Singapore after his detention and left for the United Kingdom with his wife, Wee Swee Lian, after failing to find employment, vowing to return to Malaya in the future. In November 1953, he was elected secretary of the Malayan Forum, an association of Malayan university students. He was removed from this position in February 1956 via a no-confidence vote after he referred to Malayan chief minister Tunku Abdul Rahman as \"General Bourne's messenger boy\" and the Communist-led Malayan Races Liberation Army as \"true nationalists\" in the forum's paper.\nFrom March 1959 to December 1965, Eber served as the general secretary of the Movement for Colonial Freedom (today known as Liberation), during which he took measures to limit the influence of the Communist Party of Great Britain within the organisation.\nEber was dogged by accusations of being a communist for much of his life, though he identified himself as a Malayan nationalist and socialist.\n",
    "South Korean businessman and journalist (born 1970)\nIn this Korean name, the family name is  Myung.\nMyung Tae-kyun (Korean:\u00a0\uba85\ud0dc\uade0, born 1970) is a South Korean businessman and journalist who is known to be a key figure in the 2024 political scandal involving first lady Kim Keon-hee and several conservative politicians. He is well known in South Gyeongsang Province and is suspected of conducting unverified polls and illegally intervening in various elections through the \"Future Korea Research Institute\" (\ubbf8\ub798\ud55c\uad6d\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c) he founded.\nIt is suspected that Lee Jun-seok and Kim Young-sun, as well as President Yoon Suk Yeol, received help from Myung during the election process. The main opposition DPK and Cho Kuk's Rebuilding Korea Party called the series of incidents are \"Myeong Tae-kyun Gate\" (\uba85\ud0dc\uade0 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8) and compared him to Choi Soon-sil, a key figure in the 2016 South Korean political scandal.\n2024 South Korean political scandal\nOn September 19, 2024, News Tomato (\ub274\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9c8\ud1a0), a small media outlet, raised suspicions that during the 2022 by-election, President Yoon Suk Yeol and his wife Kim Keon-hee suddenly pressed for the nomination of Kim Young-sun in Uichang, Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province, after a call with Myung. Kim Young-sun was nominated and elected as a candidate for the People Power Party in the by-election and served as a member of the National Assembly until 2024.\nA follow-up report released on the same day indicated that Myung and the first lady were also involved in the PPP's nomination process for the 2024 parliamentary election. Kim Young-sun also reportedly had a meeting with Lee Jun-seok of the New Reform Party at Chilbulsa Temple in Jirisan when he was eventually cut off from the 2024 nomination, and demanded the No. 1 position as proportional representation of the NRP on the condition that he reveal his plotting with Kim Keon-hee.\nOn September 20, JTBC reported that the prosecution confirmed circumstantial evidence that Kim Young-sun delivered 63 million South Korean won to Myung shortly after the 2022 by-election.\n\"Future Korea Research Institute\"\nHe worked under the title of the chairman of the \"Future Korea Research Institute\" (\ubbf8\ub798\ud55c\uad6d\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c), a polling firm. The institute mainly conducted polls in the form of being listed as a client for surveys conducted by other pollster, PNR. Yoon Suk Yeol was found to have topped 49 of the 50 surveys conducted by the institute in the face of the 2022 presidential election, which led to suspicions of tampering with samples since it differed from the general toss-up between Yoon Suk Yeol and Lee Jae-myung in other surveys.\nOn October 6, The Hankyoreh's report revealed that the Future Korea Research Institute was accused of illegal polling four times from 2019 to 2022 and received three warnings and one fine.\nOn October 11, No Cut News (\ub178\ucef7\ub274\uc2a4) reported that Myung collected personal information of about 570,000 members of the PPP in 2021, especially 8,500 of which were stored in the form of internal codes by encrypting their propensity to support, age, gender, and region. Pointing out that Myung did not publish it even after conducting the poll, the report said it is necessary to explain why he conducted the poll which he would not even publish, and where he tried to use the collected information.\nOn October 15, an exclusive report by News Tomato revealed a recording of Myung's phone call directing the specific results of the polls during the PPP's presidential primary. In the call, he asked a working-level official to adjust the approval ratings of Yoon Suk Yeol and Hong Joon-pyo, the two main candidates of the race at the time, to make Yoon appear ahead.\nRevelations\nMyung used his Facebook page as a window of disclosure, revealing his relationship with key political figures as if showing off, but the parties generally denied the allegations.\nLee Jun-seok, a member of the New Reform Party, was suspected to have been able to win as a sudden sensation in the 2021 PPP leadership election and the 2024 parliamentary election thanks to the help of Myung. Na Kyung-won, who was originally a strong candidate for the party's leadership but lost to Lee, argued with him, referring to his early morning meeting with Myung at Chilbulsa Temple. Lee has largely denied any connection to Myung, pointing out his relationship with another axis to the allegation, the Yoon Suk Yeol couple.\nOh Se-hoon, the mayor of Seoul, was suspected of receiving assistance by contacting Myung during the 2021 by-election when he was elected. Myung claimed this to himself in a media interview, saying that Oh also cried in front of him four times to seek help. In response, Oh strongly denied Myung's claim, saying that he had written a complaint against him.\nOn October 15, Myung released a record of his messages with Kim Keon-hee on his Facebook page. The messages generally contained Kim Kun-hee apologizing for her \"oppa (\uc624\ube60) who talks without thinking\" and relying on Myung. Under speculation that the word \"oppa",
    "Blog and social media accounts\nSupper Mario Broth is a blog and series of social media accounts known for posting obscure and humorous content related to the Mario franchise. Since the blog's creation in 2012, it has shared thousands of facts and pieces of media from the series, often in the form of educational entertainment.\nCreation\nThe Supper Mario Broth blog, described as a \"Super Mario variety blog\", was launched in 2012 by two authors, both of whom have maintained anonymity. The name of the blog came from a brainstorming session in which the authors agreed to choose a food-related name due to this being a regular theme of the Mario series. One of the authors focused on posting entertainment content, while the other focused on posting factual material. Following a hiatus, the former author left the blog in 2016, after which many of the humor-related posts were removed from the site, though some of them were subsequently reinstated with disclaimers following backlash from fans.\nActivity\nThe Supper Mario Broth blog and social media accounts have been owned and run by one individual, a German man in his 30s who prefers to be known as simply \"Broth\". Content regularly shared on the sites includes sprites, models, glitches, advertisements, merchandise, screenshots, GIFs, and artwork. The most popular post on the Supper Mario Broth blog is a GIF from Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour. Supper Mario Broth has also amassed large followings on Tumblr and Twitter.\nThe sites have followed a strict \"veracity policy\" since 2017, and posts deemed to be in violation of said policy have been removed. Despite some of Supper Mario Broth's content being perceived as ironic humor, the sites' author has stated: \"I'm not a humorous person. I'm the sort of person who likes facts. If you have looked at my blog for even a second, you might have noticed that the content post is very outlandish, but it is all factual. And I realized that outlandish factual content looks a lot like joke content.\"\nThe author of the Supper Mario Broth sites has experienced financial difficulties, despite having a job working with elderly individuals with mental illnesses such as Alzheimer's. An interview with Vice revealed that the author had sold all of his video games as well as their corresponding consoles. The author has relied on a Patreon to continue running the accounts, as well as work on a comic inspired by Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. As of September 2018, the Patreon was being backed by 222 people.\nIn October 2024, the author of Supper Mario Broth sites revealed that following the recent death of his mother, whom he had been the primary caretaker of for the past six years, he would have to discontinue the accounts. After the owner posted a now-unlisted YouTube video in which he asked for help, the number of Patreon supporters for the blog increased from a few hundred to more than 4,000. In a subsequent Twitter post, the owner announced that he would be able to continue running the sites full time, as well as \"invest into material and equipment for more and better Mario content\".\nReception\nReception toward both the Supper Mario Broth blog and social media accounts has been overwhelmingly positive. Writing for Vice, Patrick Klepek described the tone of the blog as \"equal parts fascinating and bewildering\". Frank Cifaldi, a video game historian and founder of the nonprofit archival-focused Video Game History Foundation, stated: \"You'd think everyone has said all there is to say about Super Mario Bros. by now. Broth proves that if you dig deep into ephemera and data-mine the games themselves, you can find all kinds of new and interesting talking points.\"\nWriting for The Verge, Ash Parrish lauded the Supper Mario Broth blog as \"one of the most wholesome Mario blogs on the internet\" and \"a celebrated institution in the broader Nintendo community\". In his own blog on the video game website Aftermath, Luke Plunkett referred to the Supper Mario Broth Twitter account as \"quite frankly exceptional\" and praised its official response to negative feedback. Writing for TheGamer, Mike Drucker referred to Supper Mario Broth as \"the best Super Mario archivist on planet Earth\".\n",
    "\nSMS Wolf was the lead ship of the Wolf class of steam gunboats built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s.\nDesign\nMain article: Wolf-class gunboat\nGerman economic activity in Qing China in the 1870s faced significant threats from piracy and resistance from local officials, so the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) stationed warships in East Asia to protect its trade interests. At the same time, the old J\u00e4ger-class gunboats that had been ordered in 1859 needed to be replaced. The two Albatross-class gunboats and the rebuilt Cyclop were too few for the task of patrolling the Far East, so another three vessels were ordered according to the fleet plan that had been approved in 1872. The design for the new ships was completed in 1876, and it called for reusing the engines from three of the Cam\u00e4leon-class gunboats that had also been ordered in the 1859 plan. These three ships became the Wolf-class gunboats. They were to be used extensively abroad to support the fleet's larger cruising screw corvettes and screw frigates.\nWolf was 47.2 meters (154\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 7.66\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.1\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in). She displaced 490 metric tons (480 long tons) as designed and 570\u00a0t (560 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 5\u00a0officers and 80\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a marine steam engine that drove a 2-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by two coal-fired trunk fire-tube boilers. The engine was taken from the old gunboat Blitz. Her propulsion system was rated to produce a top speed of 8.5 knots (15.7\u00a0km/h; 9.8\u00a0mph) at 340 metric horsepower (340\u00a0ihp), but she reached 9.4 knots (17.4\u00a0km/h; 10.8\u00a0mph) in service. At a cruising speed of 9 knots (17\u00a0km/h; 10\u00a0mph), she could steam for 1,640 nautical miles (3,040\u00a0km; 1,890\u00a0mi). To supplement the steam engine on long voyages, the ships were fitted with a barque sailing rig.\nThe ship was armed with a pair of 12.5\u00a0cm (4.9\u00a0in) K L/23 built-up guns, which were supplied with a total of 270\u00a0rounds of ammunition. She carried an additional pair of 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) K L/24 built up guns and three 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon.\nService history\nThe contract for Wolf was awarded to the Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven in September 1876, under the contract name Ersatz Salamander. The keel for the new ship was laid down later that year. She was launched on 21 March 1878, and Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Gustav Klatt gave a speech at the launching ceremony. The new gunboat was named for an earlier gunboat of the same name that had been built in the 1860s. The ship was commissioned six months later on 1 October. She thereafter began sea trials, but these were cut short by the need to send the ship to Asia immediately.\nFirst overseas cruise, 1878\u20131884\nGerman 1872 map of China, Japan, and Korea\nWolf got underway on 26 October, bound for China, but already on 4 November, she had to stop in Sheerness, Britain, after damaging her screw. Repairs lasted until 11 November, and the following day, the ship's engine broke down, forcing her to stop in Margate for further repairs. The crew's luck improved for the rest of the voyage, and on 2 February 1879, Wolf arrived in Singapore. She thereafter joined the cruiser squadron in East Asia, which was led by the screw corvette Leipzig and included the corvettes Freya and Luise and the gunboat Cyclop. Wolf initially visited Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Hainan Island, and Beihai, along the south China coast. She then sailed south to visit Annam before returning north to Hong Kong on 1 May. Wolf thereafter sailed on 12 May to visit northern waters, which included a stop in Yokohama, Japan, on 1 July. There she met the corvette Prinz Adalbert, which had relieved Leipzig as the squadron flagship. Wolf got underway again on 22 July and returned to the coast of China. She cruised in the Yellow and Bohai Seas, visiting many ports in the region, including Shanghai. On 30 November, she anchored in Yantai, China, where she spent the winter months.\nIn early 1880, tensions between Japan and China threatened to erupt into war, which prompted the German vessels in the region to assemble at the mouth of the Yangtze river to await developments. Wolf embarked Kapit\u00e4n zur See (Captain at Sea) Archibald MacLean, the commander of Prinz Adalbert, along with Prince Heinrich (who was serving as a watch officer aboard Prinz Adalbert), to Shanghai and back. By 10 May, the crisis had been defused, allowing the German ships to disperse; that day, Wolf got underway to visit other ports in the region. Kapit\u00e4nleutnant (KL\u2014Captain Lieutenant) Johannes Strauch took command of the ship. In late October, the ship sailed up the Hai River to stop in Tianjin, for another period of inactivity during the winter months. The crew took down the ship's rigging for storage ashore, and an upper deck structure was erected to protect the ship. In January 1881, the cruiser squ",
    "2015 death of a Russian student\nOn November 23, 2015, 16-year-old Russian student Renata Kambolina committed suicide in Ussuriysk. Her death drew attention online, particularly her last post on VKontakte (where she went by the name Rina Palenkova), in which she wrote \u201cnya,bye\u201d. Kambolina's death has influenced and been exploited by Russian \u201cdeath groups\u201d that encourage teenagers to commit suicide.\nBackground\nRenata Kambolina was born on December 18, 1998, in Ussuriysk. In 2015, after receiving a certificate of basic general education from school No. 28, she entered the Far Eastern Technical College of Ussuriysk to specialize in computer networks.\nWhile studying at school and college, she attended the Ussuriysk \u201cSchool of Rock Music\u201d, where, along with her friends, who took the name Needless in honor of the anime series of the same name, she mastered the art of playing percussion instruments.\nDeath and traction online\nOn November 23, 2015, the teenager came to a train crossing at 10:30 local time at 9179\u00a0km of the Far Eastern Railway to a spot near the bridge over the Komarovka River, near the Sakhzavod station, she posted selfies with the caption \u201cnya.bye\u201d before committing suicide; her death was then discussed on internet forums and groups. Online, anonymous people posted links to Renata's page, her relatives. Renata became a virtual idol of suicide. Teenagers from all over the country started writing messages to Renata's friends, offering money for pictures of the girl or some additional information. Locals went to the grave, filming videos from there.\nInvestigation\nOn the fact of the girl's death, the Investigative Committee opened a criminal case. A criminal case was opened against Renata's mother under Article 110 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation for 'driving her to suicide'.\nOn May 21, 2016, Renata's case materials from Vladivostok were transferred for additional investigation to Moscow. According to the investigator, \u201cpossibly due to the public outcry, the capital requested the criminal case for verification.\u201d\nIn late 2016, the Russian Investigative Committee closed the case of Kambolina's death, concluding that she had voluntarily committed suicide. According to the dead girl's mother, the case of leaked photos from the scene of the incident to the Internet was also closed. The perpetrators were not found.\nOn June 7, 2017, Russia passed a law criminalizing the creation of online \u201cdeath groups\u201d provoking suicides - up to six years in prison.\nAccording to the statements of the victim's acquaintances, one of the reasons for the suicide could have been difficulties in her relationship with a young man.\nSocial popularity and imitation\nMain article: Blue Whale Challenge\nAfter her death, Kambolina became a kind of icon for depressed teenagers on social networks. New cases of suicides were added to the group stories. In April 2016, Russian journalist Galina Mursalieva first wrote about \u201cdeath groups\u201d in an article published in the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. The article described the \u201cF57\u201d groups on the Russian social network VKontakte, which it claimed incited 130 teenagers to commit suicide. Among other pages, Renata was subscribed to the group f57, a public with psychedelic content. After her death, the group was actively promoted on the internet as a cult, of which Renata was the first victim. Participants were offered to \u201clearn the truth\u201d through suicide.\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation launched an investigation into the activities of suicidal communities on the social network VKontakte at the request of Elena Mizulina, deputy chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Constitutional Legislation.\nOne case of possible imitation of Renata occurred on October 17, 2019, when an 18-year-old student in Moscow broadcast his suicide on his VKontakte page. He reportedly held a Saiga-12K carbine to his head, after which he shouted a phrase from Renata Kambolina's suicide post \u201cnya.bye!\u201d and pulled the trigger.\nNotes\nSuicide in Russia\nBlue Whale Challenge",
    "\nPlasmagene is a term used to describe genetic elements that exist outside of the nucleus, typically within the cytoplasm of a cell. These elements are usually associated with organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts, which contain their own genetic material and replicate independently of the nuclear genome. Plasmagene theory as proposed by Tracy Sonneborn has significantly contributed to the understanding of non-Mendelian inheritance patterns, where traits are passed through cytoplasmic inheritance rather than through nuclear DNA.\nFunction and characteristics\nPlasmagenes play crucial roles in various cellular processes, especially those involved in energy production. For instance, mitochondrial plasmagenes are integral to oxidative phosphorylation, the process responsible for generating most of the cell's ATP, the main energy currency of cells. Though they can replicate independently, plasmagenes are often semi-autonomous, as they rely on nuclear genes for many essential proteins that support their functions.\nInheritance and implications\nFurther information: Extranuclear inheritance and Structural inheritance \u00a7\u00a0History\nSee also: Non-Mendelian inheritance\nOne of the most noteworthy aspects of plasmagenes is their involvement in non-Mendelian inheritance patterns. Unlike nuclear genes, which are inherited from both parents, plasmagenes are typically inherited maternally. This occurs because cytoplasmic organelles, like mitochondria, are transferred primarily through the egg cell during fertilization. Consequently, mutations or abnormalities in plasmagenes are linked to various inherited disorders, particularly those affecting muscular and neurological systems.\nHistorical context and research\nResearch on plasmagenes dates back to the mid-20th century, focusing on their role in extranuclear inheritance and its implications for genetic diseases. These studies have been instrumental in elucidating how genetic information can be passed outside the nuclear DNA, altering the understanding of inheritance patterns and disease transmission. The plasmagene theory was later disproved, and in 1976 Sonneborn affirmed this. But later researches after Sonneborn's death, provided validation allowing continued studies.\n",

    "\nAnthony Stephen Serianni (born November 18, 1953) is an American biochemist, university professor and entrepreneur. He is professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame, and President and CEO of Omicron Biochemicals.\nSerianni's academic research focuses on carbohydrate and nucleoside chemistry and biochemistry, catalysis in chemical and enzymatic systems, conformational equilibria and dynamics using NMR and computational methods, stable isotope labeling of biologically important compounds, and NMR-based studies of chemical reaction mechanisms. He received Michigan State University's John A. Boezi Memorial Alumnus Award in 2001, University of Notre Dame's Kaneb Teaching Award in 2003, and American Chemical Society's Horace S. Isbell Award (1988) and the ACS Melville L. Wolfrom Award in Carbohydrate Chemistry (2006).\nSerianni is an elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, the American Chemical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\nEducation\nSerianni graduated with a BS in biochemistry from Albright College in 1975, and earned his PhD from Michigan State University in 1980 under the guidance of Robert Barker. Following doctoral studies, he studied as a postdoctoral research associate in the Section of Biochemistry at Cornell University from 1980 to 1982.\nCareer\nIn 1982, Serianni co-founded Omicron Biochemicals, and has held the position of President and CEO since then. Concurrently, he started his academic career at the University of Notre Dame as an Assistant Professor, later advancing to Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry in 1999.\nSerianni has held leadership positions in the American Chemical Society, serving as Secretary, Chairman-elect, Chairman, Past-chairman, and Councilor of the Division of Carbohydrate Chemistry and Chemical Glycobiology. \nSerianni founded the Lake Papakeechie Sustainability Initiative (LaPSI) in 2011, which focuses on evaluating and preserving the health of the Wawasee Area watershed in Indiana. The activities of LaPSI, supported by funds from Omicron Biochemicals, provide guidance to the Papakeechie Protective Association (PPA), which is headquartered in Syracuse, Indiana.\nResearch\nSerianni has contributed to the fields of chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine by studying the structural and dynamic properties of saccharides, their reactivities, and their roles in biological processes, including metabolic pathways and disease mechanisms. He holds a patent for determining the structure of a novel non-protein thermal hysteresis glycolipid based on a  xylo-mannan oligosaccharide scaffold.\nSynthesis of labeled saccharides\nDuring graduate studies at Michigan State University, Serianni developed improved synthetic methods to prepare stable isotopically labeled saccharides, primarily using 13C, for use in structural, dynamics, and reactivity studies by NMR spectroscopy. To address the limited synthetic methods to prepare labeled saccharides, he introduced a chemical method for site-specific incorporation of 13C and other stable isotopes into aldoses through cyanohydrin reduction, bypassing the traditional Kiliani-Fischer synthesis. He demonstrated the use of enzymes to convert isotopically-labeled aldoses into other biologically-important (phosphorylated) sugars and into oligosaccharides, and discovered a new mechanism of aldose backbone rearrangement (C1\u2013C2 transposition) during C2-epimerization catalyzed by molybdate ion.\nNMR methods for saccharide structure and reactivity\nSerianni's early research centered on NMR-based kinetic measurements of saccharide anomerization, the use of stable isotopes to investigate in vivo biological metabolism, and the application of ab initio molecular orbital calculations to saccharide structure and conformation. He showed that saturation-transfer NMR methods could be applied to measure unidirectional rate constants of aldose anomerization by selectively saturating C1 or H1 of the acyclic aldehydic form, allowing precise determinations of ring-opening and ring-closing rate constants. This work showed that furanose ring anomeric configuration influences ring-opening rates via anchimeric assistance. Kinetic studies of phosphorylated sugars highlighted the role of intramolecular catalysis by phosphate in anomerization.\nIn collaboration with John Duman at Notre Dame, Serianni developed isotope-based NMR tools to study sugar metabolism in the Arctic freeze-tolerant organism, Gynophora groenlandica. His lab designed a 16-mm 13C NMR probe to study live larvae that were injected with labeled saccharides, allowing real-time, non-invasive monitoring of the metabolic fates of specific carbons in the sugars. To complement in vivo studies, he conducted in vitro experiments, incubating specific larvae organs with labeled sugars to map metabolic pathways, revealing metabolic triggers for polyol production, such as glycerol, and explored the effects of hypoxia and mitochondrial changes on cryoprotec",

    "\nHistoric site in Queensland, Australia\nThe Downs Club is a heritage-listed gentlemen's club at 15 Mylne Street, Toowoomba, Toowoomba Region, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by James Marks and Son and built in 1900. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 December 2020.\nHistory\nThe Downs Club is situated in a central location in Toowoomba on the corners of Margaret, Mylne and Isabel streets. Constructed in 1900 as the second clubhouse for the exclusive gentlemen's club, the Downs Club (established in 1889), the stately brick building with generous grounds and gardens, reflects the members' desire to convey a sense of prestige, exclusivity, and privacy. Designed by prominent and innovative Toowoomba architecture firm, James Marks and Son, the club was modelled on the principles of 19th century British gentlemen's clubs and showcases the firm's characteristic architectural features. Within the grounds is an original stable (1900) and a detached steward's room (1909). As at 2020, the Downs Club continues its tradition as a gentlemen's club.\nEuropean settlement of the Toowoomba area, traditional country of the Giabal and Jarowair people, commenced in 1840 when squatters occupied pastoral runs on the Darling Downs. The small settlement of Drayton evolved from 1842, but was soon surpassed by a more desirable location six kilometres to the northeast, known as Toowoomba from the 1850s. Better suited to market gardening, with a more reliable water supply, and supported by squatters and land speculators, Toowoomba was incorporated as a municipality in 1860. Its rapid economic and social development was influenced by local residents who strongly promoted the prospects of the town, and political representatives who successfully lobbied for government funding for civic improvements.\nAs Toowoomba progressed in the 1870-80s, a commercial centre emerged. The construction of a police station and post office near the courthouse firmly established the upper (eastern) end of Margaret Street as a government precinct. By the 1880s the Russell, Ruthven, and Margaret Street block (western end) was pre-eminent as the commercial centre of Toowoomba. Banks, retail stores, hotels, and commercial businesses flourished as the population of the town increased. The surrounding pastoral properties depended on these businesses to provide services and products. Visits to town often became social occasions.\nThe first gentlemen's club in Toowoomba was established by a group of wealthy squatters (pastoralists with large holdings often termed 'Pure Merinos') in the early 1860s, eager to have their own private club in town, where they could stay overnight and socialise with other men of similar social standing. Just prior to this, in 1859 the prestigious Queensland Club had been founded in Brisbane. Once established, the new Toowoomba club became known as \"The Union Club\", with a stately clubhouse constructed on Russell Street (as at 2020, known as Clifford House). Only the wealthy could afford membership fees, ensuring the club's exclusivity. This was, however, short-lived, and by 1870 the building had been sold and the club dissolved.\nBy the 1880s in Toowoomba, the dominance of the squattocracy in Darling Downs society had been supplemented by a wealthy and influential professional and business class. A desire emerged amongst men in both the town and pastoral districts, for the establishment of a new gentlemen's club. At a meeting held 20 July 1889 in the Club Hotel (on the corner of Margaret and Ruthven streets), the decision was made to form such an association. The club was to base their rules on those of the Queensland Club and membership would consist of a four guinea entrance fee (just over \u00a34) and an annual subscription of two guineas for town members, with country members (those who lived more than 10 miles (16\u00a0km) from Toowoomba) to pay approximately half this amount. Although not as expensive as the Queensland Club's membership at the time, which was \u00a312 per year, it was still a considerable sum. The club was a private club for men of distinction and provided a social and recreational venue for those with common interests and socio-economic backgrounds. Initially called the \"Darling Downs Club\", it began with a membership of 44. By July 1890, this had increased to 66. One could only become a member if voted in by the members, thus ensuring exclusivity. The first president of the club was William Alexander Jenyns Boyd, headmaster of the Toowoomba Grammar School. Members included \"Pure Merinos\" such as Robert Ramsay of Eton Vale Homestead and William Ball Slade of Glengallan Homestead. Several doctors, solicitors and politicians were also amongst the first club members, including the Minister for Railways at the time, Hon. Hugh Nelson.\nThe Darling Downs Club's first club rooms were within the Club Hotel. These were specially built for them, to a design by Toowoomba architect James Marks, described at the first annua",

    "Techniques for lossy compression of neural networks\nModel compression is a machine learning technique for reducing the size of trained models. Large models can achieve high accuracy, but often at the cost of significant resource requirements. Compression techniques aim to compress models without significant performance reduction. Smaller models require less storage space, and consume less memory and compute during inference.\nCompressed models enable deployment on resource-constrained devices such as smartphones, embedded systems, edge computing devices, and consumer electronics computers. Efficient inference is also valuable for large corporations that serve large model inference over an API, allowing them to reduce computational costs and improve response times for users.\nModel compression is not to be confused with knowledge distillation, in which a separate, smaller \"student\" model is trained to imitate the input-output behavior of a larger \"teacher\" model.\nTechniques\nSeveral techniques are employed for model compression.\nPruning\nPruning sparsifies a large model by setting some parameters to exactly zero.  This effectively reduces the number of parameters. This allows the use of sparse matrix operations, which are faster than dense matrix operations.\nPruning criteria can be based on magnitudes of parameters, the statistical pattern of neural activations, Hessian values, etc.\nQuantization\nQuantization reduces the numerical precision of weights and activations. For example, instead of storing weights as 32-bit floating-point numbers, they can be represented using 8-bit integers. Low-precision parameters take up less space, and takes less compute to perform arithmetics with.\nIt is also possible to quantize some parameters more aggressively than others, so for example, a less important parameter can have 8-bit precision while another, more important parameter, can have 16-bit precision. Inference with such models requires mixed-precision arithmetics.\nQuantized models can also be used during training (rather than after training). PyTorch implements automatic mixed-precision (AMP), which performs autocasting, gradient scaling, and loss scaling.\nLow-rank factorization\nMain article: Low-rank approximation\nWeight matrices can be approximated by low-rank matrices. Let  be a weight matrix of shape . A low-rank approximation is , where  and  are matrices of shapes . When  is small, this both reduces the number of parameters needed to represent  approximately, and accelerates matrix multiplication by .\nLow-rank approximations can be found by singular value decomposition (SVD). The choice of rank for each weight matrix is a hyperparameter, and jointly optimized as a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem.\nTraining\nModel compression may be decoupled from training, that is, a model is first trained without regard for how it might be compressed, then it is compressed. However, it may also be combined with training.\nThe \"train big, then compress\" method trains a large model for a small number of training steps (less than it would be if it were trained to convergence), then heavily compress the model. It is found that at the same compute budget, this method results in a better model than lightly compressed, small models.\nIn Deep Compression, the compression has three steps.\nFirst loop (pruning): prune all weights lower than a threshold, then finetune the network, then prune again, etc.\nSecond loop (quantization): cluster weights, then enforce weight sharing among all weights in each cluster, then finetune the network, then cluster again, etc.\nThird step: Use Huffman coding to losslessly compress the model.\nThe SqueezeNet paper reported that Deep Compression achieved a compression ratio of 35 on AlexNet, and a ratio of ~10 on SqueezeNets.\n",
    "2024 song by Tyler, the Creator featuring Daniel Caesar\n\"St. Chroma\" is a song by American rapper Tyler, the Creator, released on October 28, 2024 from his eighth studio album Chromakopia (2024). It features Canadian singer Daniel Caesar.\nBackground and composition\nThe song finds Tyler, the Creator rapping in a whispering tone, over a beat consisting of marching stomps and handclaps, synthesizers, choir and flute. Daniel Caesar performs in soulful vocals reminiscent of gospel, singing \"Can you feel the light inside? Can you feel that fire?\" The artists' vocals also intertwine during this part. The title refers to Tyler, the Creator's new alter-ego.\nCritical reception\nThe song was well-received by music critics. Tom Breihan of Stereogum remarked, \"Judging by its brief length and past precedent, the video probably doesn't include the entire song. What we hear, however, is awesome. Tyler raps in a menacing whisper over marching boots, eerie John Carpenter-ass synths, and gospel-informed choirs. Just as the video ends, the beat drops and immediately slides into the chaotic Playboi Carti song. Mission accomplished. I'm excited.\" Niall Smith of Clash stated \"The march-bound opener 'St. Chroma' sets pace pretty effectively. The song's soulful vocals crescendo into a fiery, sweltering cocktail of self-doubt, rumbling drums and mantras of anti-fame.\" Jeff Ihaza of Rolling Stone wrote of the song, \"a familiar constellation of sounds that arrives with a level of precision that seems final, as if Tyler's now seen his signature sound to completion. Tyler's penchant for angelic-sounding string arrangements is at its most potent on the track, with vocals from Daniel Caesar, while, lyrically, he's vibrant and dynamic, switching up his flow as he brags from a place less material and more metaphysical.\" Heven Haile of Pitchfork wrote, \"A flute mimicking ululations sounds like a battle cry under militaristic stomps on opener 'St. Chroma.' Tyler whisper-raps as if to say, Listen close, I have something important to tell you. That, along with Daniel Caesar's ethereal gospel vocals asking 'Can you feel that fire?' and a modular synth speeding up its frequency like a kettle about to blow, makes it feel like we're traversing space and time straight into Tyler's psyche.\" David Crone of AllMusic considered it \"Tyler's strongest intro to date\", calling it \"an immediate collage of intent, flip-flopping from scratchy militarism to soaring gospel\", and described the song as part of a \"militia-like opening trio\" (alongside the songs \"Rah Tah Tah\" and \"Noid\") that \"creates a brilliant, unified new sound\".\nMusic video\nA music video was released for the song on October 16, 2024, and was the first promotional material for the album. Initially shot with a sepia filter, a masked Tyler with a green suit leads a line of 10 men wearing matching suits, their faces hidden. Tyler steps out of the line and directs the men to a large green shipping container with the Chromakopia logo spray-painted on the front. The men go inside, as well as Tyler who rejoins the line. The container closes, and Tyler appears in the foreground and detonates the container via button press. At the end of the video, it cuts to the word \"Chromakopia\" in all black against a solid green background.\nCharts\n",

    "California Assembly Bill 2097 (AB 2097) is a 2022 California statute which prohibits California cities and other public agencies from mandating parking for most development projects within 0.5 miles (0.8\u00a0km) of a major transit stop. The law also establishes a \"substantial hardship exception\" which allows a public agency to impose a parking mandate within 0.5 miles of a major transit stop if the agency submits an application with evidence of a negative impact upon either the agency's ability to meet its RHNA obligations for low and very low income residents, disabled and elderly residents, or existing residential or commercial parking within 0.5 miles of a housing development project.\nThe law was drafted by Laura Friedman, and emanated from portions of California Senate Bill 50, an unsuccessful 2019 bill which would have both prohibited parking mandates within 0.5 miles of a major transit stop as well as mandated minimum four-plex residential zoning in the same locations. The bill was passed by both houses by August 30, 2022, and signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 22, 2022. Taking effect on January 1, 2023, California became the second state after Oregon to eliminate parking minimums near public transit.\nAmendments\nOn September 19, 2024, Newsom signed into law AB 2553, which expanded both the definition of \"major transit stop\" under the California Environmental Quality Act to service frequency of 20 minutes or less, as well as eligibility for reduced traffic impact fees under the Mitigation Fee Act from \"transit station\" to \"major transit stop\". Previously, CEQA defined \u201cmajor transit stop\u201d as the intersection of two or more major bus routes with service of fifteen minutes or less during peak commute periods. By extension, AB 2553 expanded the number of locations prohibited from parking mandates under AB 2097.\nOn September 22, 2024, Newsom signed AB 2712, also drafted by Friedman, into law, prohibiting the city of Los Angeles from issuing preferential parking permits to residents of new developments which are exempt from parking mandates under AB 2097 unless the city provides a written application for hardship.\n",

    "Entomologist (1899\u20131974)\nClarence Cottam (January 1, 1899 \u2013 March 30, 1974) was an American conservationist, civil service employee in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and inaugural director of the Welder Wildlife Foundation.\nBiography\nClarence Cottam was born and grew up in St. George, Utah. During his teen years and early twenties, he worked as a farmhand and ranch hand. He studied at Dixie College from 1919 to 1920 and at the University of Utah in the summer of 1923. In May 1920 he married Margery Brown (1894\u20131975). For two years from 1920 to 1922 he served in the central United States as a missionary for the LDS Church. From 1922 to 1925 he was a school principal in Alamo, Nevada, where his wife Margarey also taught.  In 1925 he matriculated at Brigham Young University (BYU), where he graduated in 1926 with a B.S. degree in zoology and entomology and in 1927 with an M.S. His master's thesis is entitled Distributional list of the birds in Utah. At BYU he was an instructor from 1926 to 1929.\nIn 1929 Cottam became a junior biologist with the U.S. Division of Biological Survey in Washington, D.C. In 1934 the Division of Biological Survey was reorganized as the Bureau of Biological Survey. Jay Norwood \"Ding\" Darling, the bureau's director, gave Cottam much of the responsibility for duck hunting regulations. Cottam was from 1931 to 1935 an assistant biologist, from 1935 to 1940 a senior biologist in charge of food habits in the Division of Wildlife Research. During the early years of his federal government career, he was also a part-time student at George Washington University, where he graduated in 1936 with a Ph.D. His Ph.D. thesis Food habits of North American diving ducks was the basis for a 140-page publication in 1939 by the United States Department of Agriculture. In 1939, the Bureau of Biological Survey was removed from the U. S. Department of Agriculture and assigned to the U. S. Department of the Interior. In 1940, the Bureau of Biological Survey and the Bureau of Fisheries were combined to form the U. S. Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service. In the Fish and Wildlife Service, Cottam was from 1940 to 1942 a senior biologist in charge of food habits and from 1942 to 1944 was in charge of economic wildlife investigations in the Division of Wildlife Research. From 1944 to 1946 he was the chief of the Division of Wildlife Research. For the Fish and Wildlife Service he served as assistant director briefly in 1944 and again as assistant director from 1946 to 1954, when he retired from federal government service. During his career, he was sent on assignments to every state in the US and most of the Canadian provinces, as well as Mexico and New Zealand.\nIn 1943 Cottam at the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service was responsible for promoting Rachel Carson from junior aquatic biologist to aquatic biologist. He worked with her until 1952, when she retired from government service to write full time, and remained a close friend until she died in 1964. He provided her with valuable documentation on existing DDT research. In her 1962 book Silent Spring, she cited his investigations of the harmful effects of insecticides.\nFor the academic year 1954\u20131955 Cottam returned to BYU as a professor of biology and dean of the College of Biological and Agricultural Sciences and then went on leave of absence from 1955 to 1958, when he resigned from BYU. In 1955 Cottam became the director of the Welder Wildlife Foundation (the institution managing  the Welder Wildlife Refuge) with W. Caleb Glazener as assistant director. Cottam served as director until his death in 1974, when Glazener became his successor as director. Cottam was the author or coauthor of about 250 scientific papers. He accumulated a comprehensive library of ornithological journals and textooks on American for the use of students at the Welder Wildlife Refuge.\nIn March 1974, Clarence Cottam died from cancer in Sinton, Texas. He was buried in Orem, Utah. His widow died in February 1975. At the time of her death, there were 4 daughters, 23 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren.\nAwards and honors\nCottam was elected in 1934 a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He received in 1955 the Aldo Leopold Memorial Award of the The Wildlife Society (TWS) and in 1961 the Audubon Medal of the National Audubon Society. In 1962 he received both the Frances K. Hutchinson Medal of the Garden Club of America and the Paul Bartsch Award of the Audubon Naturalist Society. He was the president from 1949 to 1950 of The Wildlife Society, from 1957 to 1958 of the Texas Ornithological Society (founded in 1953), and from 1960 to 1963 of the National Parks Association.

The album features guest appearances from Daniel Caesar, Doechii, GloRilla, LaToiya Williams, Lil Wayne, Childish Gambino,  Lola Young, Santigold, Schoolboy Q, Sexyy Red, and Teezo Touchdown, with physical releases of the album additionally featuring Playboi Carti.\nChromakopia received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the lyricism, cohesiveness, and production, and even noted its messy and confusing nature as a positive. The album was supported by its lead single, \"Noid\", as well as two promotional samples, from \"St. Chroma\" and \"Thought I Was Dead\". The album was a massive commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200. This earned Deegan his third US number-one album and it is by far his fastest-selling album to date. Several other songs from the album also charted on the Billboard Hot 100, such as \"Noid\" and \"St. Chroma\".\nBackground and recording\nOn October 27, 2024, during Tyler, the Creator's Chromakopia exclusive listening event, Tyler revealed the meaning behind the album, noting that the album was originally about him growing up in Hawthorne, Inglewood. He revealed on stage that \"no one knows anything about me from before I was like 17\" and that the record turned into Tyler \"taking a bunch of shit my mom told me as a kid.\"I was born and raised in L.A., Inglewood, Hawthorne to be exact. This album originally started about growing up in these areas. I was like, \"Oh, shit, no one knows anything about me from before I was like 17.\" Folks are like \"Oh, he's from the suburbs.\" No, nigga, I was down the street here. And I don't mirror what they expect, so\u00a0... But the album now has turned into me taking a bunch of shit my mom told me as a kid. Now that I'm 33 all of that stuff is like, \"Oh, that's what the fuck she was talking about. Oh, I'm not the guy that I was at 20. Like, oh shit, people are getting older\u00a0... Folks having kids and families and all I got is a new Ferrari.\" And it does feel kind of weird. I'm gaining weight, I've got gray hair on my chest, life is life-ing. I don't know, I just wanted to kind of just write about stuff that I think about when I'm dolo. And I'm happy y'all got a chance to experience it in my hometown. So thanks y'all for coming.\nComposition\nMusic\nPrimarily a hip hop, R&B, and jazz album, Chromakopia embraces eclectic instrumentation. It blends musical styles reminiscent of Tyler's fifth album Flower Boy (2017), such as neo soul melodies and synthesizer-based arrangements. Military cadences and soulful elements are also present on the album.\nThemes and lyrics\nChromakopia is narrated by Tyler's mother, Bonita Smith. Its concept was inspired by his experience growing up in Greater Los Angeles and the life lessons he learned from Smith as a child, that he began to understand and appreciate as he grew older. Before the album's release, publications speculated that the album could be based on the story of Chroma the Great, a powerful conductor whose orchestra creates the colors of the world, from the 1961 children's novel The Phantom Tollbooth. Dork's Jake Hawkes notes the character ties into the album's aesthetics, but has little impact on the lyrical material.Music critics characterized Chromakopia as an early midlife crisis album revolving around the concerns young adults have over their newfound adulthood. Its protagonist, St. Chroma, is introduced on the opening track of the same name.\nSmith describes him as the light and tells him to never dim his light for anyone. \"Rah Tah Tah\" features braggadocios lyrics, as Tyler declares himself as the biggest rapper from Los Angeles after Kendrick Lamar. \"Noid\", on the other hand, explores his anxieties with celebrity culture and parasocial relationships. In \"Darling, I\", featuring vocals by Teezo Touchdown, Tyler reflects on his artistic ambition and the practice of monogamy.\nTitled after the abortion-related healthcare company, \"Hey Jane\" stages a conversation between Tyler and an anonymous, older woman in the wake of an unplanned pregnancy. Billboard's Mackenzie Cummings-Grady wrote that on the record, Tyler \"speaks on his consuming paranoia\" while narrating his \"desire for children\".\nRelease and promotion\nThe Chromakopia logo, using the font Poleno Semi Bold, with horn-like accents\nProvoked by Beyonc\u00e9's surprise release of her 2013 self-titled album, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) changed the day of the week when music is released worldwide from Tuesday to Friday. Tyler criticized the industry standard in a 2023 interview with Nardwuar, suggesting that it promotes \"passive listening\". He chose to release Chromakopia on Monday, October 28, 2024, at 6 a.m. ET.\nTrucks ",

    "Youth arts centre in Adelaide, Australia\nCarclew, North Adelaide in 2011\nCarclew is an Australian youth arts centre based in Adelaide, South Australia. It was founded in 1971 as the South Australian Performing Arts Centre, with its name changed on several occasions to variations of Carclew Youth Performing Arts Centre, until it was renamed to simply Carclew in 2013. Its name is derived from the historic mansion North Adelaide in which it is based, also known as Carclew.\nAs of 2024 Marjorie Fitz-Gerald, an arts philanthropist who was instrumental in the establishment of Carclew, is patron of Carclew.\nHistory\nIn 1971 Premier Don Dunstan created the South Australian Performing Arts Centre for Young People, which was incorporated in 1972. Based at the historic home known as Carclew in North Adelaide, the centre was renamed the Carclew Youth Arts Centre in 1976. Its mandate was changed in 1982 to focus on performing arts, and the name was changed to the Carclew Youth Performing Arts Centre.\nFrom late 1988, the mandate was widened to include a broader range of the arts, and to include people up to 26 years old and the name changed back to Carclew Youth Arts Centre to reflect this in March 1991. In 2009 the name again changed, this time to Carclew Youth Arts, and finally to Carclew in 2013.\nCarclew is unique in South Australia as a multi-art-form centre for young people. It runs programs, workshops, projects and funding opportunities, including scholarships, project grants and mentoring opportunities. It also provides connections with schools and other arts organisations.\nIn February 2019, a new program by Creative Consultants was launched through Carclew, to help young artists to earn a stable income over the course of their careers. Also in 2019, the City of Adelaide is collaborating with Carclew to deliver the \"Emerging Curator Program\", a six-month engagement in which three aspiring curators are supported in their professional development.\nGovernance\nHistory\nThe centre was managed by the Youth Performing Arts Council from 1980, which was established specifically to manage Carclew. After a need for an organisation with a broader focus to manage youth arts policy and programs, the South Australian Youth Arts Board was created and took over in November 1988, at which time the centre's focus was also expanded.\nReporting to the Minister for the Arts, Carclew's funding was the responsibility of Arts South Australia until 2018, when the position of Arts Minister was abolished and it was moved, along with the History of South Australia, Patch Theatre Company and Windmill Theatre Company, to the Department of Education.\nIn July 2019, the state budget slashed funding to the History Trust, Carclew and Windmill, as part of \"operational efficiency\" cuts.\nIn October 2024, a new four-year strategic plan was published, under CEO Mimi Crowe. At the same time, Megan Antcliff was announced as new chair, after former chair Rachel Healy had resigned after being appointed CEO of the Queensland Performing Arts Centre.\nToday\nAs of October 2024, Megan Antcliff is chair of the board and Mimi Crowe is CEO of Carclew.\nMarjorie Fitz-Gerald, an arts philanthropist who was instrumental in the establishment of Carclew, is patron.\nAwards and scholarships\nFrom 2002 or earlier until 2016, in some years Carclew has offered awards and scholarships to young creatives, including:\nColin Thiele Scholarship for Creative Writing (after Colin Thiele)\nCarclew Film and New Media Scholarship, previously BHP Billiton Scholarship for Film and New Media\nDame Ruby Litchfield Scholarship for Performing Arts (after Ruby Litchfield)\nRuth Tuck Scholarship for Visual Arts (after Ruth Tuck)\nThe Dame Ruby Litchfield Scholarship for Performing Arts was established by the state government in 1993.\nAs of 2024 the above awards are no longer offered, but there are various other fellowships, awards and grants offered.\nIn 2015, and continuing as of 2024, Carclew offered the Independent Arts Foundation Franz Kempf Printmaker Award (after Franz Kempf).\nPast winners\n1993:\nInaugural Dame Ruby Litchfield Scholarship for Performing Arts \u2013 Stephen Noonan\n2002:\nColin Thiele Scholarship \u2013 Finegan Kruckemeyer and Samantha Schulz\n2005:\nColin Thiele Creative Writing Scholarship \u2013 Jason Fischer\nDame Ruby Litchfield Scholarship for Performing Arts \u2013 Daniel Daw, dancer\n2009:\nDame Ruby Litchfield Scholarship for Performing Arts \u2013 Matthew Sheens\n2011:\nDame Ruby Litchfield Scholarship for Performing Arts \u2013 Jody Fisher, classical guitarist\n2012:\nColin Thiele Creative Writing Scholarship \u2013 Phillip Kavanagh\nInaugural BHP Billiton Scholarship for Film and New Media \u2013 Michael Richards, animation\nRuth Tuck Scholarship for Visual Arts \u2013 Amy Joy Watson\nDame Ruby Litchfield Scholarship for Performing Arts - Robert MacFarlane\n2013:\nDame Ruby Litchfield Scholarship for Performing Arts \u2013 Quentin Angus, jazz guitarist\n2014:\nColin Thiele Creative Writing Scholarship \u2013 Matt Vesely, filmmaker (Monolith)\n201",
    "\n1984 single by Scritti Politti\n\"Hypnotize\" is a song by British pop band Scritti Politti. It was released in 1984 by Virgin Records, as a single from the album Cupid & Psyche 85. It peaked at number 68 on the UK Singles Chart, as well as number 43 on the Billboard Hot Dance/Disco chart. The music video was directed by Peter Care.\nCritical reception\nBrian Chin of Billboard described the song as \"his third and most oblique comment on American funk, swinging the pendulum way back past 'Wood Beez' after the clearly pop-minded 'Absolute.'\" He added, \"We hope his exemplary electronic creations will find an audience here despite an apparently unreceptive radio environment.\" In a review of Scritti Politti's 2011 compilation album Absolute, Jude Clarke of MusicOMH wrote, \"Although released as a single, it failed to make much impact in the UK or US charts: a shame, as its slightly harder-edge and interesting way of playing fast-and-loose with melody and rhythm make it one of the most textured and enjoyable inclusions on this album \u2013 as it was on Cupid\u2026 back in the '80s.\"\nTrack listing\n12-inch single\nSide A\n\"Hypnotize (Long)\" \u2013 4:26\n\"Hypnotize (Short)\" \u2013 3:36\nSide B\n\"Hypnotize (Version)\" \u2013 6:32\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from liner notes.\nGreen Gartside \u2013 vocals, production\nDavid Gamson \u2013 keyboards, production\nFred Maher \u2013 drums, production\nNick Moroch \u2013 guitar\nB.
