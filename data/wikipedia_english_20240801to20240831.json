    "British psychiatrist\nGill Livingston is a British psychiatrist and Professor of Psychiatry of Older People at University College London. Her research involves a life-course analysis of dementia risk and the development of strategies to delay or prevent dementia. She creates evidence-based interventions to improve the lives of people living with dementia and their families.\nEarly life and education\nLivingston's grandmother emigrated from Eastern Europe to Scotland in the early 1900s. Her father was the first in her family to go to university. Livingston studied medicine at the University of Glasgow. She specialised in psychiatry after a placement in Friern Hospital. Livingston became interested in dementia during her work as clinical psychiatrist, where she observed the difference that family carers made to the prognosis of dementia patients. This motivation to specialise in dementia strengthened after watching both of her parents struggle with the condition; her father developed progressive supranuclear palsy and dementia in the 2000s and her mother in the 2010s. Her first senior house officer position was at the Royal Free Hospital.\nResearch and career\nLivingston is an interdisciplinary researcher who combines psychiatry, epidemiological and biopsychosocial enquiry. She was made a professor of Old Age Psychiatry in 2007. Her research investigates new modifiable risk factors for dementia risk, the impact of hearing impairments, and how to help the families of people living with dementia.  She led The Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care. She combines new research with meta analysis to develop better understanding of dementia risk. Her research has influenced UK and US policy on dementia risk, and revealed evidence-based interventions that could improve the lives of people with dementia.\nShe pioneered the STrAtegies for RelaTives (START) programme, an 8 session intervention that helps the carers of people with dementia develop coping strategies. START increases the quality of life and reduces incidence of depression amongst the carers of people living with dementia. She also launched the MARQUE project, a 5-year programme that looked to understand agitation, dementia and how to achieve culture change in care homes. In 2024 she reported that half of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by addressing various risk factors, particularly high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or \"bad\" cholesterol, social isolation and lower levels of education.\nSelect publications\nGill Livingston; Jonathan Huntley; Andrew Sommerlad; et\u00a0al.

    "\nAzerbaijani Gitara is a series of compilation albums released by Swiss label Bongo Joe. \nThe albums compile music in the genre of Azerbaijani gitara, which was first developed in the 1960s as Azerbaijani musicians like Rafiq H\u00fcseynov fused traditional genres such as mugham with western styles on Czech Jolana guitars.\nThe first volume (2020) compiles music by R\u00fcst\u0259m Quliyev, a native of Nagorno-Karabakh who remains popular in Azerbaijan thanks to the YouTube channel run by his nephew.\nThe second volume (2024) compiles music by R\u0259hman M\u0259mm\u0259dli, one of the first players to replicate traditional vocals with heavy distortion on the electric guitar.\nVolume 1\nR\u00fcst\u0259m Quliyev was born in 1969 in Kosalar, a village in Nagorno-Karabakh.

    "Stephen Proctor or Procter (died 1619) was an English courtier, a minerals and financial speculator, and Yorkshire landowner who built Fountains Hall.\nLife\nFriar's Head Hall, Flasby with Winterburn (rebuilt in the 17th century).\nFireplace at Fountains Hall with the Judgement of Solomon\nProctor was a member of a family from Ripon and Friar's Head and Cowper Cote at Gargrave. In 1513, Stephen and Ralph and Roger Proctor of Flasby were mentioned in the Flodden muster. Gabriel Proctor was the receiver of Flasby and other manors (formerly the property of Furness Abbey) for the Duchy of Lancaster in 1556, when the Earl of Cumberland's servants attacked his family during a territorial dispute.\nHis father, Thomas Proctor (or Procter) is sometimes said to have made a fortune from a 1589 patent to smelt iron with wood, and he is known to have been a lead-mining entrepreneur. The iron patent was sold to Edward Fitton in 1592 and he later complained that it was worthless. In the 1540s, Thomas Proctor leased lead mines from Sir Arthur Darcy on Appletreewick Moors formerly the property of Bolton Abbey. The mines were operated by a consortium of merchants from York who sent the ore to Flanders and paid a rent to Proctor. This phase of business came to an end in 1549 when Sir John Yorke bought the manor of Appletreewick and evicted Proctor, his tenants, and his workers. A Chancery case over the crown lease of the Appletreewick (Greenhow) lead mines resulted, between John Yorke, knight, and Thomas Proctor of Cowpercote, yeoman.\nStatues of Mars and Saturn in niches at Fountains Hall\nStephen and his brother Elias Proctor were involved in some aspects of a family iron business, and Stephen's father-in-law, the court musician Ralph Green was an investor. For a time, they had a bloomery at Shipley and used a forge at Summerbridge, not far from the medieval iron-working site of Smelthouses. They used ironstone brought from Gildersome rather than any more local source. A blast furnace constructed at Shipley proved unsuccessful. Stephen Procter gained a patent from Elizabeth I for coal and ironstone at Fulwood, near modern day Huthwaite.\nBefore he bought the Fountains estate, Proctor lived at Warsill Grange, and at Westminster. Fountains Hall was built partly using stone taken from Fountains Abbey in the late 1590s after Proctor acquired the estate from Thomas and William Gresham for \u00a34,500. The inclusion of the lands of Bewerley, with its lucrative lead mines, in his purchase was disputed. Rivalry between landowners in exploiting the mineral resources of former monastic lands became the determinant of his career. Proctor placed a placed an image of Saturn on Fountains Hall, a planet associated with melancholy and the metallic element lead, and a figure of Mars, representing iron.\nThomas Proctor, probably his brother, lived at Cowper Cote in 1601, and was appointed a collector of the tax or subsidy. Stephen Proctor was knighted by James VI and I in March 1604. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in November 1605. Prince Charles travelled to London from Dunfermline Palace with his physician Henry Atkins in July 1604 and they stopped at Fountains Hall.\nProctor worked on the leases of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby following an inheritance dispute, and supported Robert Cecil to gather and improve crown revenue from lands and woods. The King gave Proctor \"free gifts\" of money in 1609 and 1610.\nReligion and country house drama\nAn author, Thomas Bell, formerly a Catholic, after his conversion dedicated his Christian Dialogue (1609) to members of the Yorkshire Puritan gentry, including Proctor, Timothy Whittingham, Timothy Hutton, and the exchequer official Vincent Skinner.\nProctor argued with William Ingleby, who sided with tenants and villagers at Kirkby Malzeard who dismantled his enclosure made on the common land of Grewelthorpe Moor where he had commenced mining for coal. The village activists included 31 women led by Dorothy Bayne, known as Captain Bayne. Proctor's title was strengthened by a deal made by the Earl of Derby. Proctor had captured a priest, Christopher Wharton, within Ingleby's park at Ripley Castle in 1598.\nProctor seems to have been anxious about his neighbour's religious beliefs, suspecting that Sir John Mallory supported a Catholic seminary in Studley Royal Park. A convicted and condemned burglar, David Paler or Paley, in prison at York Castle, alleged that Mallory pretended that he hosted priests in his park, so that his keepers could accidentally kill Proctor as a poacher, if he came to investigate at night. Paler mentioned other enemies, and Proctor's involvement with properties having disputed title due to the Earl of Derby's inheritance.\nIn August 1609, Proctor and Timothy Whittingham were involved in the capture of the Catholics John Mush and Matthew Flathers at Upsall Castle. Proctor investigated Sir John Yorke (1566\u20131635) of Nidderdale and Gowlthwaite Hall (a relation of William Ingleby) after hearing of thea",
    "Austrian-American candy maker\nLeo Hirschfield was a German-American candymaker known as the inventor of the Tootsie Roll, the first individually wrapped penny candy, and Bromangelon, the first commercially successful gelatin dessert mix, which preceded Jell-O by two years.\nEarly life\nHirschfield was an Austrian Jewish immigrant to the United States of America, the son of an Austrian candy maker.\nCareer\nIn 1895, Hirschfield created Bromangelon, the first commercially successful gelatin dessert mix.\nDetails of his early career are disputed. The more common version has him starting a candy shop in Brooklyn that later merged with Stern & Saalberg. Another version has him starting at the factory and rising to a senior development position. According to the Tootsie Industries' official company history, he started his own career in the candy business at a small shop or factory in New York City in 1896. However, this version of events, which is repeated in sources such as the Cleveland Jewish News, is disputed by Rutgers University Professor Emerita Samira Kawash, who addressed the conflicting origins of the candy on her blog Candy Professor. Citing a 1913 Pittsburgh Press interview, Kawash states that Hirschfield had been working for Stern & Staalberg before moving to Manhattan to work there in the early 1890s. He invented the candy in 1907, and named it after his then-5-year-old daughter Clara, whose nickname was \"Tootsie.\" He appied for a patent on the unique texture of Tootsie Rolls that same year and was awarded one in 1908. Stern & Staalberg began marketing Tootsie Rolls a year later. Kawash concluded from the patents issued for the candy between 1907 and 1908 that the invention of Tootsie Rolls in 1896 in Hirschfeld's Brooklyn candy store was a myth. In addition, Kawash points out that Tootsie was also the name of the child spokesperson for Bromangelon, leading Kawash to surmise that while the Tootsie Roll may have been \"christened\" in Clara's honor, she first \"did her time as the child spokes-model for fruity gelatin.\"\nBefore the adoption of modern refrigeration technology, candy sellers would spend hot summers selling candy that did not easily melt, such as taffy and marshmallows. This precluded chocolate, which melts easily. Since Tootsie had a nominally chocolate taste, it was a first for summer candies. Its patent describes that the moderately hard texture of Tootsie \u2014 in contrast to the light, porous texture of other pulled candies \u2014 was achieved by baking it at a low temperature for about two hours, giving it \"a peculiar mellow consistency\" that maintained its shape and did not melt. It was the first penny candy to be individually wrapped, and its low price led to its remarkable growth, making it a Depression-era favorite. During World War II, when the need for shipping food that did not spoil quickly to battlefront soldiers prompted considerable development in the field of processed food, Tootsie Rolls, which stayed fresh for a long period of time, became part of soldiers' ration packs, further solidifying Americans' love for the candy.\nHirschfield left the company in 1922, shortly before his death.\nDeath\nBy early 1922, Hirschfield was wealthy, and his businesses were doing well. However, he was despondent over his long illness and his wife's mental breakdown, which left her committed in a sanitarium. On January 13, 1922, he took a revolver and intentionally killed himself via a gunshot to the head. He left a note stating that he was \"sorry, but could not help it.\" He was survived by his daughter, who was married to an Arthur Ludwig.\n",
    "Municipal building in London, England\nThe Old Town Hall is a former municipal building at the corner of Poplar High Street and Woodstock Terrace in Poplar, London. The building, which currently accommodates the Lansbury Heritage Hotel, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe building was commissioned by the Poplar District Board of Works to serve as its hall and offices. The site the board selected, on the north side of Poplar High Street, had been occupied by a row of alms houses erected by the East India Company in 1628.\nConstruction of the new building started in 1869. It was designed by Walter Augustus Hills and Thomas Wayland Fletcher with Arthur and Christopher Harston in the Gothic Revival style, built in yellow brick at a cost of \u00a37,500 and was completed in October 1870. The design involved a distinctive three-stage octagonal tower at the southeast corner. The first stage involved a round headed opening flanked by Corinthian order colonettes supporting an archivolt and a keystone with elaborate carvings in the spandrels. There were sash windows on the first floor and sash windows with tracery on the second floor, all surmounted by a dome, a spire and a weather vane. The rest of the building was fenestrated by sash windows. The floors were separated by bands with mosaic detail. At roof level, there was a modillioned cornice and a series of dormer windows.\nThe building became the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar in 1900. It was the scene of the Poplar Rates Rebellion, led by George Lansbury, which advocated the use of rates for social reform, and ultimately resulted in 19 councillors being put in prison in 1921. The building ceased to be the local seat of government when the council moved to the new town hall in Bow Street in 1938.\nThe old town hall remained in council ownership, being used as a district housing centre from 1986, until Tower Hamlets London Borough Council sold it to a developer, Dreamstar Limited, in 2011. It was subsequently converted into a boutique hotel, opening as the Lansbury Heritage Hotel in 2015.\n",

    "Road in Kenya\nThe A11 road is a road in Kenya situated in the easternmost part of the country. Spanning a distance of 107 kilometers, this route connects Lamu to Kiunga, a location near the international border with Somalia. Currently, the A11 exists as an unpaved dirt road, traversing a remote and potentially challenging terrain. Despite its rugged nature, this road plays a crucial role in linking these far-flung regions and facilitating movement within the area.\nRoute\nThe A11 is a rudimentary sandy path that traverses the coastal plain, stretching from its intersection with the A10 north of Lamu to the small coastal town of Kiunga. Located over 10 kilometers from the Somali border, Kiunga serves as the terminus of the A11. Notably, from Kiunga, informal tracks continue across the beach, providing a crossing point into Somalia. This primitive route highlights the region's remote and understated connectivity, with the A11 playing a vital role in linking these coastal communities.\nHistory\nThe A11 designation was introduced in 2016, likely in anticipation of the proposed deep-sea port construction in Lamu. The assignment of this number suggests ambitions to establish a connected route to Somalia, with the A11 envisioned as a key branch road. However, as of now, the A11 remains a basic dirt road, far from the envisioned standard. Despite its current simplicity, the A11 holds potential as a strategic link in the regional transportation network, pending future development and upgrades.\n",

    "Species of stick insect\nObrimus bufo is a stick insect species from the family of the Heteropterygidae native to the Philippine island of Luzon.\nDescription\nObrimus bufo is the largest species of the genus. In this species, too, the slits in the metasternum that are typical of the genus are very narrow and barely recognizable. The females known to date reach lengths of between 10.6 to 10.9 centimetres (4.2 to 4.3\u00a0in). The coloration when alive is unknown. The coloration of the collection specimens varies between iron-, medium- and ochre-brown, with the ochre-brown specimen showing an olive-green shimmer. The body spines of the females are similar to those of the smaller and stockier Obrimus bicolanus. From these, Obrimus bufo females are distinguished by the presence of a pair of small but distinct anterior spines on the pronotum (anterior pronotals), the absence of a second, posterior pair of spines on the abdominal terga II to IV, as well as by a differently shaped preopercular organ, which has a transverse and slightly double-humped swelling on the posterior edge of the sternum VII of the abdomen.\nThe males reach a length of about 6.85 to 7.3 centimetres (2.70 to 2.87\u00a0in). They are as slender and spiny as those of Obrimus bicolanus, but differ from these in that their anal segment which is broadened transversely and more rectangular. Its posterior margin is broader, slightly bilobed and has a shallow pit near each posterior-lateral angle. The anal segment of the males of Obrimus bicolanus is, on the other hand, almost hexagonal.\nThe only known egg is 5.3 millimetres (0.21\u00a0in) long, 3.0 millimetres (0.12\u00a0in) wide and 3.8 millimetres (0.15\u00a0in) high, bulbous and of a typical shape for the genus. The capsule is slightly domed and shows the transverse indentation typical of Obrimus at the lower pole, which makes the eggs there appear double-humped. The dorsal surface is more convex than the ventral. The micropylar plate is 3.9 millimetres (0.15\u00a0in) long and wide, three-armed, inverted T-shaped. It is noticeably inflated and clearly raised above the capsule surface. The lid (operculum) is round, flat and sits on the capsule with an opercular angle of about 15\u00b0, which slopes slightly towards the ventral side. In Obrimus bicolanus this is larger and amounts to 25\u00b0.\nOccurrence\nIn the first description, only the Philippine islands are mentioned as locality of the described material. Later, the place of discovery is given as Manila and thus the island of Luzon. The more recent finds that can be definitely assigned to this species come from the province of Ilocos Norte or, somewhat less precisely, from the Ilocos Region and thus from the northwest of Luzon.\nDrawing from the original description by Westwood 1848\nDrawing of a female nymph from Westwood 1859\nTaxonomy\nJohn Obadiah Westwood described the species in 1848 as Phasma (Acanthoderus) bufo. The chosen species name \"bufo\" (Latin and borrowed there for the family of true toads (Bufonidae) or the genus (Bufo)) is not explained. Westwood depicts a female and describes in particular the spines. The description of the males is reduced to the statements that they are smaller and slimmer and have the same spines as the females. In 1859 he transferred the species, like many others, to the former subgenus Acanthoderus, which is now listed as a genus. Here, too, he describes the females and depicts an animal that he suspects to be a juvenile female, but does not rule out that it could also be a male. Whether this is the specimen to which the short description of the male appended in 1848 refers is not clear from the text. This is supported by the fact that among the four syntypes of the species there is also a juvenile female, which was sometimes referred to as a male until the 2020s.\nCarl St\u00e5l transferred the species in 1875 to the specially for it created genus Obrimus, making it its type species. Joseph Redtenbacher also worked on the species in 1906. He assigned Obrimus mesoplatus, known only from the male holotype, as a synonym of Obrimus bufo and obviously used its holotype to describe the morphology and size of the males. He mentions material from his collection that is said to come from Manila. This specimen from his collection is now in the Natural History Museum, Vienna and is characterized by slightly more pronounced spines. Redtenbacher's synonymization of Obrimus mesoplatus was revised again in 1939 by James Abram Garfield Rehn and his son John William Holman Rehn. They also pointed out that Redtenbacher's specimen from Manila could be either Obrimus bufo or Obrimus uichancoi they had newly described.\nOf the four syntypes of the species, one female is deposited at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. The two remaining adult females and the juvenile female are kept at the Natural History Museum. Frank H. Hennemann chose the Oxford female as the lectotype in 2023, as this is apparently the specimen from which Westwood had described the species in 18",
    "Road in Havana, Cuba\nThe V\u00eda Monumental (2-400) is a six-lane expressway, with three lanes on each side. It connects the Malec\u00f3n with Habana del Este in Havana, Cuba.\nCharacteristics\nIt has six lanes, with 3-metre-wide (9.8\u00a0ft) lanes, and a central divider. The speed limit on most sections is 70 kilometres per hour (43\u00a0mph).\nConstruction\nDuring the 1950s, the towns in eastern Havana weren't connected to the main city. There was no adequate road to pass near there. The V\u00eda Blanca had just been built, which connected Havana and the tourist center of Varadero with Matanzas, Guanabacoa, Regla, Diez de Octubre, Marianao and San Miguel del Padr\u00f3n. One of the first ideas to build a road was to cross the Bay of Havana. Two proposals were made: a bridge and a tunnel. For the bridge it was a problem, because if a hurricane occurred the bridge would likely collapse. Then a tunnel, instead, would be a better option, 12 meters below sea level, allowing any ship to cross the entrance channel. Since 1954, construction of this road began, which passed through Casablanca, the Reparto Camilo Cienfuegos, the Villa Panamericana, Coj\u00edmar and Berroa.\nRoute\nThis road has 7+1\u20442 kilometres (4.7\u00a0mi) bordering the entire east of Havana, where it is part of the Circuito Norte from the tunnel to the intersection with V\u00eda Blanca, in Berroa.\n",
    "\nRuler of Wey\nDuke Huan of Wey (Chinese: \u885b\u6853\u516c; pinyin: W\u00e8i Hu\u00e1n G\u014dng, died 719 BC), personal name Ji Wan (\u59ec\u5b8c), was the 13th ruler of the state of Wey during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. \nBackground\nPrince Wan was born to Duke Zhuang I of Wey and his concubine Dai Gui\u00a0. Dai Gui's elder sister, Li Gui\u00a0, was also one of his concubines; she had given birth to Count Xiao (\u5b5d\u4f2f), who had died young. After Dai Gui died, Duke Zhuang had Zhuang Jiang\u00a0, his principal wife who had no children, raise Prince Wan. It was then that Duke Zhuang made Prince Wan the crown prince.\nAccession and Reign\nPrince Wan succeeded his father upon his death in 735 BC.\nIn 733 BC, Duke Huan dismissed his younger brother Zhouyu of all his posts on account of his arrogance and extravagance. Zhouyu, who was greatly favored by his father Duke Zhuang, went into exile.\nIn 722 BC, Duke Huan went to Lu to attend the funeral of Duke Hui of Lu. In the same year, Gongshu Duan, younger brother of Duke Zhuang of Zheng, rebelled against him, but he was defeated and forced into exile. Prince Hua (\u6ed1), a son of Gongshu Duan, fled to Wey. Duke Huan, on behalf of Prince Hua, attacked Zheng, occupying the Zheng settlement of Linyan (\u5eea\u5ef6). Duke Zhuang of Zheng then launched multiple counterattacks against Wey: once in the same year, once in the next.\nDeath and Succession\nIn 719 BC, Zhouyu gathered his fellow Wey exiles and murdered Duke Huan. This was the first known case of regicide in the Spring and Autumn period.\nZhouyu then seized the throne for himself. Less than a year later, he was arrested in the neighboring state of Chen in a plot led by Wey Minister Shi Que\u00a0, sent back to Wey, and executed. Wey officials then invited Prince Jin (\u6649), Duke Huan and Zhouyu's younger brother who was then a political hostage in the neighboring state of Xing, back to Wey to take the throne. Prince Jin would become known as Duke Xuan of Wey.\nBibliography\nZuo Zhuan, Duke Yin\nShiji, vol. 14, 37\nDurrant, Stephen; Li, Wai-yee; Schaberg, David (2016).

    "\nBarbara Brooke (23 March 1925 \u2013 21 March 1980) was a contemporary art dealer and partner in Gallery 91 and the Brooke Gifford Gallery in Christchurch. She was also the co-founder and co-editor of the art magazine Ascent from 1967 to 1969 and a key supporter and advocate for contemporary art and craft in New Zealand.\nLife and art career\nElsie Barbara Brooke was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, the daughter of Alexander and Mary Anne Brown. In 1945 she married Andr\u00e9 Brooke, an artist who had emigrated to New Zealand from Hungary. In the 1960s she began to be known as Barbara Brooke.\nGallery 91\nIn 1959 the Brookes opened what would be the third contemporary art gallery in New Zealand. Gallery 91 was located at 91A Cashel Street and for almost a year became a centre for contemporary art in Christchurch. Along with exhibitions, the Gallery 91 exhibition programme included discussions, demonstrations and poetry evenings. To cater for these activities the Gallery's hours were long: 9.30am \u2013 5.30pm and 7pm \u2013 11pm on weekdays and on Saturday from 7pm \u2013 11pm. Home and Building magazine described the gallery as, \u201ca stylish, large and open exhibition space, Gallery 91 seemed to declare that New Zealand art was something of value and that its practitioners should be respected. The emphasis was on younger artists and the programme included loan exhibitions from the Auckland City Art Gallery including Contemporary New Zealand Drawings.\nAmong the many exhibitions shown, one stands out: the largest exhibition of Colin McCahon's paintings shown up to that time in Christchurch. Art critic and McCahon biographer Peter Simpson has named it, \u2018the most remarkable exhibition of new paintings McCahon ever held\u2019. Christchurch City Librarian and art collector Ron O\u2019Reilly started a campaign to buy the painting Tomorrow will be the same but not as this is to gift to the Robert McDougall Art Gallery. This first attempt failed but the idea was successfully revived three years later. Lack of sustained sales forced the Brookes to close Gallery 91 after ten months.\nCanterbury Society of Arts\nIn January 1960 Andr\u00e9 and Barbara Brooke were jointly appointed as Secretary Manager of the Canterbury Society of Arts. The reaction from the artworld was enthusiastic, \u201cone-man shows and other exhibitions by small groups of artists will inevitably result in a change of emphasis\u201d. The couple brought to the CSA's Canterbury Society of Arts Durham Street premises a range of younger artists and initiated high-profile exhibitions such as the Hay's Limited Art Competition (later known as the Hay's Art Prize).\u00a0 Andr\u00e9 Brooke resigned from the position in 1963 and Barbara was appointed as the sole Secretary Manager of the Canterbury Society of Arts. She remained in the job for the next two years with  early work on planning for the construction of a new building for the CSA.\nCaxton Press and Ascent\nAfter leaving the CSA, in 1966 Barbara Brooke was employed part-time at Caxton Press to edit the New Zealand Local Government Magazine. The following year, at the suggestion of the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council, Leo Bensemann and Brooke started up a new magazine for contemporary art, Ascent. For the first two issues Brooke is listed as \u2018assistant editor\u2019 but by issue three she is noted as co-editor alongside Bensemann. Ross Fraser reviewed the first issue in Landfall. Push the writers \u201cextend\u201d them with critical writers who also provide feedback \u2013 positive or otherwise \u2013 to our artists.  Five issues of Ascent were published before it closed in 1969.

    "Danish syndicalist organisation\nThe Trade Union Opposition Federation (Danish: Fagoppositionens Sammenslutning; FS) was a Danish trade union federation. Established in 1910 by syndicalist opponents of the social-democratic dominance over trade unions, the FS pursued a strategy of dual unionism and worked within existing trade unions with the intention of radicalising them. The membership of the FS consisted largely of industrial workers in Copenhagen, where they carried out a series of strike actions, including wildcat strikes, to improve working conditions. \nThe FS experienced a surge in growth during World War I, as the social-democratic unions failed to keep up with the rising cost of living, while the syndicalists secured reductions in working hours and wage increases. By the end of the war, the FS had reached its peak with 3,000 members; its members participated in the storming of the Stock Exchange, secured the eight-hour working day and the weekend, and contributed to the reduction of unemployment. But around the time of the Easter Crisis of 1920, the syndicalist movement experienced a series of defeats and splits that led to its decline. Divides between the anarcho-syndicalists and communists resulted in the FS splitting, with the former establishing their own small federation, while the latter merged into the Communist Party of Denmark (DPK). \nEstablishment\nThe growth of syndicalism in Denmark was slower than in Norway and Sweden, as Danish trade union leaders had been able to establish collective bargaining rights much earlier than in the other Scandinavian countries. But following a wave of lockouts, when the social-democratic leadership of Danish trade unions agreed to a compromise deal with business owners, disillusionment among the rank-and-file began to increase. By the end of the 1900s, revolutionary syndicalist ideas had begun to gain traction within the Danish labour movement.\nIn December 1908, the country's first syndicalist organisation, the Danish Syndicalist Federation (Danish: Syndikalistisk Forbund; SF), was established. Christian Christensen, the editor of the SF's magazine, soon became the leader of the Danish syndicalist movement. In 1910, he established the Trade Union Opposition Federation (Danish: Fagoppositionens Sammenslutning; FS), which became the country's main syndicalist organisation during the 1910s. In December 1911, the FS began publishing its weekly journal Solidaritet (Solidarity), which was edited by Christensen. The ideological platform of the FS was closely influenced by the industrial unionism of the British syndicalist Tom Mann, who was invited to speak before the FS in Denmark.\nEarly activities\nAlthough they had relatively few active members, the syndicalists were effective at securing wage increases and cultivating social unrest within the labour movement. The Danish syndicalists pursued a strategy of dual unionism, organising within existing unions in order to influence their direction towards syndicalist practices. During its early years, the FS had only 30-40 members, largely drawn from Copenhagen's soil and concrete industries. When 1,200 soil and concrete workers went on strike in the winter of 1911, their social-democratic union leaders resigned, leaving the inexperienced syndicalists in charge of directing the strike. The social-democrats attempted to delegitimise the strike by alleging that the workers had been manipulated by the syndicalists, a claim which Christensen rejected.\nIn the spring of 1911, in response to a series of lockouts in Copenhagen, members of the FS called sympathy strikes in support of the affected workers. Over the subsequent years, the FS made notable progress in increasing its trade union presence, gaining the adhesion of blacksmiths, mechanics, dockworkers and construction workers in the Danish capital. But the advancement of collective bargaining procedures by the social democrat-led unions, both among skilled and unskilled workers, caused difficulties for the growth of the FS. Attempts to gain a foothold in the provincial towns were also largely unsuccessful, with the FS mainly gaining members in Copenhagen.\nThe social democrats came to see syndicalists as the main threat to their political party's leadership over the trade unions. Social democrats infiltrated syndicalist meetings to disrupt their proceedings and report on their activities to the party leadership, with one interrupting a speech by Christensen on syndicalism in France to defend the social-democratic unions in Denmark and Germany. In 1912, Carl Madsen, the general secretary of the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions, published a critique of the syndicalists' program of direct action, industrial unionism and decentralisation, claiming it would cause the \"breaking up of the economic community\".\nThe FS was closely connected to the Central Organisation of Swedish Workers (SAC), a relatively powerful syndicalist union with 32,000 members in several industries.

    "1912 American film\nMiss Robinson Crusoe is a 1912 silent film romance-adventure produced by the Thanhouser Company starring Florence LaBadie and James Cruze. The narrative scenario is derived from Daniel Defoe's 1719 adventure novel Robinson Crusoe.\nPlot\nA well-to-do American couple are traveling abroad with their only daughter. When they discover that a young nobleman is courting her, they arrange for her to accompany the count and his mother on an ocean liner cruise bound for the tropics. The girl's parents hope that she will fall in love on the long voyage, with the prospect that marriage will follow. A wealthy young American has also fallen in love with their daughter. Lacking noble ancestry, the family discourages his advances.\nWhen news arrives that the cruise ship has been lost at sea, the girl is reported among the missing. Distraught, but refusing to believe the love of his life is dead, the American swain embarks on his yacht in search of her. Unbeknownst to him, the girl has survived the disaster and finds herself a castaway on a tiny island occupied solely by hostile indigenous people. The tribes consider killing the intruder, but hesitate when she handles an emormous, venomous snake and survives. The tribal leaders decide she is an enchanted goddess, and commence worshiping her.\nAfter traveling to many strange tropical lands, the young American begins to question if his search is hopeless. Persevering, he lands on a remote island and discovers his sweetheart. A prisoner in her own domain, the inhabitants are loath to relinquish her, and a violent struggle ensues between the young American and the natives to possess her. The couple escape and return home to the United States. The parents, overjoyed at reuniting with their only child, consent to their marriage.\n\nCast\nFlorence LaBadie as Miss Robinson Crusoe\nJames Cruze as her American recuser\nHenry Benham as an American\nFrancis \"Frank\" Newburgh as the Nobleman\nWilliam Russell\nMignon Anderson\n=Release\nFlorenceLaBadieMiss Robinson Crusoe was released October 8, 1912.\nThe film was issued on two reels. The first reel ran 1,210 feet. The second reel, a so-called \"split-reel\" completed the picture The remainder of the reel provided footage of animals from the New York Zoological Park.\nReception\n\"There is such variety to the plays that I never know what I may be called upon to do next. Not long ago I had the lead in Miss Robinson Crusoe. They left me floating on a log, so far out that, though I am a good swimmer, I really wondered if I'd ever get back to land.\"\u2014Florence LaBadie in Moving Picture Story Magazine, January 1913.\nA reviewer for The Moving Picture World, October 19, 1912, after a brief sketch of the plot, declared Miss Robinson Crusoe \"a highly artistic picture and, where it fails to be so, it is nevertheless effective, and makes a very desirable offering.\"\nThe reviewer adds that LaBodie's \"handling of a huge rattlesnake makes a most startling scene.\"\nA critic at The Morning Telegraph, October 13, 1912, noted the tropical settings in the film. Allowing that \"the photoplay is well carried out to the end,\" the review concluded by informing readers that \"A reel and a half are necessary for the tale.\"\nRetrospective appraisal\nLiterature and film critic Edward Wagenknecht declares that Miss Robinson Crusoe \"does not deserve to be memorialized; it must have been a terrible picture.\"\nWagenknecht, who viewed the film upon its release when he was a 12-year-old boy, recalls the film from his juvenile perspective:\n  I shall never forget it. The heroine (Florence LaBadie) was wrecked on a desert island, after which she appeared dressed in a leopard skin (as I remember it) and nothing more. A large brown snake approached her, and she picked it up and played with it...to my eyes that were not accustomed to seeing bare legs even on little girls she seemed startlingly and wonderfully naked, and her beautiful body combined with the horror of the snake created an impact that was unforgettable.\nNotes\n",

    "Country house in Weston under Penyard, Herefordshire\nBollitree Castle is an historic site on the edge of the village of Weston under Penyard, Herefordshire, England. The site consists of Bollitree Castle farmhouse, two barns, a dovecote, a gate, and a series of mock castellated curtain walls from which the site takes its name. Bollitree Castle Farmhouse is a Grade II* listed building, one of the barns, which contains genuine medieval fragments, is listed at the highest grade, Grade I, while the other structures have their own Grade II listings.\nHistory\nThere is architecture evidence of habitation at Bollitree Castle from medieval times. In the 15th century, the estate was owned by the Merryk family, of whom the most notable member was Richard Amerike (c. 1440\u20131503), a Bristol-based merchant whose name has been suggested as the origin of America although this is disputed. The castle farmhouse dates from c.1700. Later in the 18th century, the major transformation of the farmhouse and the wider site was undertaken. Local tradition suggests this was carried out by a Thomas Merrick, in pursuit of a Spanish woman whom he wanted to marry and who had indicated that she wished to live in a castle, but there is little documentary evidence for this. Historic England records the sham castle fortifications, but posits no suggestion as to their builder's motivations.\nBollitree is owned by Richard Hammond, the television presenter, who bought the castle in 2012. In 2023, redevelopment plans submitted by Hammond were turned down by Herefordshire County Council following objections from the Georgian Group.\nArchitecture and description\nThe main barn at Bollitree, with the bulk of the castellated curtain walls, contains some genuine medieval fragments, and is listed at Grade I. The farmhouse, which forms the main residence on the site, is listed at Grade II*.

    "Northern Irish Gaelic footballer and manager (1936\u20132024)\nHugh Joseph O'Neill (17 August 1936 \u2013 3 August 2024), known as Jody O'Neill, was a Gaelic footballer and manager from Northern Ireland. At club level he played with Coalisland Na Fianna and at inter-county level with the Tyrone senior football team.\nPlaying career\nO'Neill first played Gaelic football to a high standard as a student at St Patrick's Academy in Dungannon. He was part of the first team to have success for the school when the Corn na n\u00d3g title was claimed, while he also earned selection to the Ulster Colleges team. He later studied at the College of Technology in Belfast but declined an offer from Queen's University to line out with them in the Sigerson Cup. By that stage O'Neill had begun his club career with Coalisland Na Fianna. He won two Tyrone MFC medals in 1950 and 1952, before winning his sole Tyrone SFC medal in 1955.\nO'Neill first appeared on the inter-county scene with Tyrone as a member of the minor team in 1951. It was the first of four successive years with the under-18 team before later lining out with the junior team. O'Neill began his association with the senior team in 1952. He was just 19 when he captained Tyrone to their very first Ulster SFC title in 1956. O'Neill won a second successive provincial title in 1957, as well as claiming Dr McKenna Cup and Dr Lagan Cup successes. He retired from inter-county activity in 1968 after serving as player-manager for his last season with the team.\nO'Neill's inter-county performances earned his inclusion on the Ulster inter-provincial team on 10 occasions. His five Railway Cup wins came in 1960, 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1966.\nManagement career\nO'Neill first became involved in team management in the twilight of his inter-county playing career. He managed the Tyrone junior team to the All-Ireland JFC title in 1968. He also took charge of the Tyrone senior team for the first time that year. O'Neill's team claimed their first Ulster SFC since his own playing days in 1973. He also served as under-21 team manager at this time and secured back-to-back Ulster U21FC titles in 1972 and 1973. O'Neill stepped down from his position in 1975, before returning for a second stint as manager between 1977 and 1980. He later returned or a second spell as under-21 manager.\nO'Neill was also heavily involved in coaching and management at club level with Coalisland Na Fianna. He guided the club's minor team to Tyrone MFC titles in 1985, 1991 and 1995.

    "Shipping route across the Bass Strait\nFor the former designation along the Atlantic Seaboard, see Ocean Highway.\nFor the former state highway in New Jersey created in 1909, see Ocean Highway (New Jersey).\nA container ship in the Port of Melbourne\nThe Sea Highway is an Australian colloquialism and figurative shipping route used to describe the sea lines of communication between the state of Victoria on the Australian mainland and island state of Tasmania across the Bass Strait.\nSince the mid-1970s, there have been measures taken by the Australian Government to formalise and integrate the Sea Highway into the nation's National Highway network as a means to ensure equal transport opportunities and economic integration across the entire country.\nBackground\nSee also: History of tariffs in Australia, Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme, and Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme\nThe Princess of Tasmania in 1958\nAs an island, Tasmania heavily relies on maritime trade to sustain its communities and economy, with a dependency on interstate shipping that is two and a half times greater than any other Australian state.\nBefore federation, the Colony of Tasmania depended on intercolonial tariffs for revenue. However, post-federation, only the Commonwealth could impose tariffs, and only on overseas goods. During the 1898 referendum, Tasmania's Premier, Edward Braddon, fought to ensure continued tariff revenue for the colony. The referendum failed in the Colony of New South Wales, leading to a 'secret' Premiers' conference where amendments were agreed upon. These amendments, known as the \"Braddon Clause,\" became Section 87 of the Constitution of Australia, enabling the return of revenue from customs and excise to the states.\nThe term \"Sea Highway\" was being used colloquially to describe the merchant shipping route by the early 20th century. The premise of the \"Sea Highway\" became popularised following the advent of the MS Princess of Tasmania ferry services departing the Port of Melbourne. The MS Princess of Tasmania was the largest roll-on/roll-off passenger ship in the southern hemisphere at its launch in the 1950s and greatly enhanced Tasmania's popularity as a tourism destination.\nWith over 99% of Tasmania's freight by volume moved by sea, the federal government introduced the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme in 1976 to assist subsiding shipping costs. The Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme was implemented in 1996 to further subsidise passenger shipping costs.\nNational Highway subsidy rationale\nPort of Burnie in 2008\nShipping goods to and from Tasmania involves additional costs compared to road or rail transport on the mainland. These costs include fuel, freight charges, and the need for specialised transport infrastructure like sea ports and ferries. Additionally, Tasmania's smaller population and economy mean there is less demand for goods and services compared to larger states. This lower demand can lead to higher per-unit costs for goods and services due to less bulk purchasing and production.\nAs Australia's National Highway System is federally funded, except for the sea route to Tasmania, advocates for the Sea Highway seek for its formal recognition as part of the National Highway based on transport equity, aiming to enhance sea connections between Tasmania and mainland Australia. Similar to land highways that connect Australian regions, such as the Eyre Highway or Hume Highway, the Sea Highway requires considerable federal support to provide reliable, affordable services crucial for Tasmania's economic activities and smooth Bass Strait transportation.\nSea Highway operators\nThe Sea Highway is routinely traversed by several shipping and ferry companies that provide vital transport and logistics services to Tasmania and its Bass Strait islands. Major Tasmanian ports include Devonport, Burnie, Bell Bay and the Port of Launceston. These shipping companies play a primary role in Tasmania\u2019s economy, handling both passenger and freight services, supporting industries such as agriculture, retail, and manufacturing, while also maintaining the flow of essential goods and services. These companies collectively ensure connectivity between Tasmania and the Australian mainland. \nTT-Line Company\nPrimarily known for passenger and vehicle ferry services, TT-Line Company ferries MVs Spirit of Tasmania I and Spirit of Tasmania II, operate between Geelong, Victoria and Devonport, Tasmania.

    "\nDominican general (1818\u20131900)\nPedro Valverde Lara (July 5, 1818 \u2013 March 31, 1900) was a Dominican general and independence activist.\nEarly years\nHe was born in Ban\u00ed on July 5, 1818. He was the son of Miguel Valverde and Marcela Lara. He grew up in the Capital.\nHe was at the Puerta del Conde on the night of February 27, 1844, in which the Dominican Republic was proclaimed. During the Dominican War of Independence, he reached the rank of colonel.\nWar of Restoration\nIn 1861, when the annexation was proclaimed, he was enlisted in the reserves with the rank of general. Close defender of annexation, He served the Spanish as Governor of Santo Domingo and remained in office even after The Dominican Restoration War was in progress. The Spaniards rewarded the services of Valverde, and in October 1863, he was awarded the medal of Charles III. Valverde and Lara fell under suspicion of disaffection on the part of the Spanish and his confinement was arranged in a cell in the Ozama Fortress. General Pedro Santana interceded for him before the Captain General Carlos de Vargas and managed to have it delivered to him to take with him to the camp of Guanuma. At that point, Valverde and Lara deployed a silent and effective campaign between the soldiers, who began to defect from the anti-national side in ever-increasing quantity. The troops of San Crist\u00f3bal, in which Santana deposited a large trust, deserted en masse. He was finally discovered, arrested again and exiled on March 9, 1864, to the Spanish island of Santa Catalina, in C\u00e1diz, where he arrived the following April.\nBefore the end of the war, on his return, he approached President Pedro Antonio Pimentel and found Valverde who had been treated with disdainful coldness by President Pimentel. Angered and humiliated, he approached General Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral and, together with Eusebio Manzueta and Marcos Evangelista Ad\u00f3n, encouraged the insurrection by which Cabral overthrew Pimentel and proclaimed a new government just 27 days after the Spanish left.\nFinal years and death\nThen Pedro Valverde Lara served as the Secretary of War and Navy. Under the dictatorship of the Six Years' period, he opposed the projects for years of annexationists of Buenaventura B\u00e1ez and his clique and in 1868, at the very beginning of that regime, he returned to the jail. They sent him again to exile, from where he continued fighting against B\u00e1ez. He died at the dawn of the twentieth century, on March 31, 1900. He was 81 years old.\nSee also\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral\nMarcos Evangelista Ad\u00f3n\nPedro Santana\nCarlos de Vargas\nJuan Gervasio",
    "Road in Kenya\nThe A6 road is a road in Kenya spanning 113 kilometers which serves as an east\u2013west artery in Kenya, connecting the Tanzanian border at Taveta to the bustling A8 route at Voi. The trunk road provides a crucial link between the two points, facilitating the flow of traffic and commerce across the region.\nRoute\nThe A6 highway begins at the Tanzanian border in Taveta, where sleek, modern facilities facilitate seamless travel. On the opposite side, the T15 road connects from Himo and the majestic Kilimanjaro region. As the A6 unfolds, it reveals a modern, paved path situated at an elevation of 800 meters above sea level. To the west, the silhouette of Mount Kilimanjaro dominates the horizon, its towering peak soaring above the surrounding landscape. The A6 bypasses Taveta, charting an eastward course through arid savannah landscape. As it winds its way forward, the road passes Taita Hills before ultimately converging with the A8 highway at Voi, marking its terminus.\nHistory\nThe road has undergone several transformations, initially bearing the designation A23, which spanned from Himo in Tanzania to Voi in Kenya. The route formed a link in the long-distance corridor connecting Arusha and Mombasa. In 2016, the road was rechristened as the A6. Historically, the entire stretch of the A6 was a dirt road, but a major upgrade was undertaken in November 2013, with a contract awarded to pave the road in its entirety and construct a northern bypass around Taveta. The paving project was largely completed by 2016, while the Taveta bypass was finished in 2017. Additionally, the border crossing with Tanzania underwent significant expansion in 2014, further enhancing the road's importance as a regional artery.\n",
    "Carousel in California\nExterior in 2024\nThe Seaport Village Carousel, also known as the Fair Park Looff Carousel, is a historic wooden carousel in the western wing of Seaport Village of San Diego, California. It was built by noted carver Charles I. D. Looff, who also constructed the Santa Monica Pier, in 1895. The carousel costs a small fee to ride and contains 54 animals and 2 chariots.\nHistory\nCharles I. D. Looff hand-carved the carousel in Brooklyn, New York City in 1895. It was not until 1904 when it was opened, however, when it debuted at Fair Park, in Dallas, Texas. It was not until the it was moved to Pacific Ocean Park in Santa Monica, California in 1958 when the carousel had rounding boards and scenery panels installed. These were designed in a style reminiscent of the 1930s. It moved again in 1967 to an amusement park in Spanaway, Washington, where it stayed until 1982.\nThe Perron family had bought the carousel in September 1979 in an auction and transported it to Willamette Center in Portland, Oregon in 1984. The Perrons converted all the figures on the carousel to Looff-made ones, as they had previously been made by other manufacturers. It moved to Lloyd Center in 1988. Historic Carousels, Inc. restored the carousel in 1991 to prepare it for the AmeriFlora '92 exhibition in Columbus, Ohio. It was later relocated to Burbank Town Center in Burbank, California in 1997. The carousel moved to its current location at Seaport Village in 2004. It replaced the Broadway Flying Horses Carousel, which had been at the location since 1977.\nFeatures\nThe carousel is hand-carved nearly entirely from wood. With three rows, it has a menagerie style, with assorted animals being included aside from the horses. There are 54 animals in total, with 2 chariots that can hold multiple people. Out of the 54 animals, 30 are jumping horses and 11 are standing horses. The horses' tails are made of natural horsehair. The other 13 are the menagerie animals, with the carousel containing 3 camels, 3 giraffes, 1 teddy bear, 1 dog, 1 dragon, 1 goat, 1 lion, 1 burro, and 1 elephant. There is no fairground organ playing music at the carousel.\n",
    "\nThe coat of arms of Cusco is the official coat of arms of the city of Cusco, Peru, and is also used by the region, the province, and the district with the same name. Its current version was approved by the Provincial Council of Cusco in a solemn session on July 23, 1986.\nCoat of arms\nCoat of arms of 1540: In a field of gules (red), a silver castle on the fortress of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n; a gold border charged with eight (3,2,2,1) black condors, and topped with a Spanish helmet\nThe historian and university professor from Cusco, David Vicente de Rojas Silva, cited by Angles Vargas, shows that Guam\u00e1n Poma de Ayala included in his chronicle two drawings corresponding to the first and second coats of arms of Cusco during the Incan Empire. Both are quartered Iberian-style shields corresponding to two successive dynasties, the first with divine evocations and the second with royal attributes. The first shield contains a sun, a moon, a star, and the idol of Wanakaure on Paqarejtampo. The second contains the Qori-q'enque bird, a jaguar, a mascaypacha, and a double serpent.\nRojas Silva indicates that the dean Diego de Esquivel y Navia stated in his \"Annals\" that the city of Cusco received from Carlos I of Spain the monarch's own arms as King of Spain, which were displayed until 1540. These arms were illustrated on a banner located at the head of the council hall of the Palace of the Cabildo until 1824 when it was donated to Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar during his visit to Cusco. The military leader sent the banner to Caracas, where it is preserved in the Historical Museum of that city. In 1534, thanks to a donation made by the city to the king to finance the war in Flanders, Carlos I granted two heraldic eagles to be included in the city's shield. These eagles, along with the fact that the city used the emperor's arms, supported the appellation of the city as the Imperial City.\nOn July 19, 1540, King Carlos I of Spain issued a Royal Decree qualifying Cusco as the \"Most illustrious, most noble, loyal, and faithful city of Cusco, the most important and head of the kingdoms of Peru,\" adding the grant of a coat of arms:\nIn Madrid, on the 19th day of July in the year 1540, a Privilege of Arms was dispatched to the city of Cuzco in which a shield was granted, inside of which is a castle of gold on a red field, in memory of the fact that said city and its castle were conquered by force of arms in our service; and a border of eight condors, which are large birds resembling vultures found in the province of Peru, in memory of the fact that at the time the said city was conquered, these birds descended to feed on the dead who died there, which are on a gold field.- Signed by the Cardinal of Seville.- Countersigned by S\u00e1mano.- Signed by Dr. Beltr\u00e1n.\nThese arms were later ratified by Philip II of Spain according to the decree of May 5, 1593, and also by Carlos II on January 17, 1661, and by Carlos III in 1788.\nVariations of the shield\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the city's granted coat of arms underwent variations, the most notable being the change of the castle to a tower. The reasons for this change are varied, ranging from similar coats of arms granted to local residents to the intention of recreating Inca towers like those that existed in Sacsayhuam\u00e1n or in the Huacaypata. Another common variation was the removal of the border of condors, though the reasons for this change are not well-known.\nCurrent coat of arms of Cusco\nMain article: Sol de Echenique\nSide door of the Palace of the Cabildo displaying the new coat of arms.\nIn a solemn session on June 23, 1986, the Provincial Council of Cusco signed Municipal Agreement No. 063 A/MC-SG-86 along with the Mayor of Cusco, Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, which decided to establish the disk known as the Sol de Echenique as the official coat of arms of Cusco. Furthermore, it banned \"all heraldic representations imposed by the conquest as the Coat of Arms of Cusco.\" This municipal agreement was published in the official newspaper El Peruano on July 2, 1986. Various historians have questioned the choice of the Sol de Echenique as the emblem of Cusco. As summarized by Cusque\u00f1o anthropologist Jorge Flores Ochoa in 1997, the plaque \"is not Inca, it is not a sun... neither is it from Cusco\".\n",

Coenen has competed in the Motocross World Championship since 2022 in the MX2 class. He currently competes for the Red Bull KTM Factory Racing team.\nCoenen took his first overall Grand Prix win during the 2024 FIM Motocross World Championship by winning the MX2 class at the Latvian round.\nCoenen is the twin brother of Lucas Coenen, who is also a World Championship-level motocross racer.\nCareer\nJunior Career\nAlongside his brother, Coenen debuted in the European Motocross Championship in 2016, in the 65cc class. Returning the following year, he was able to finish tenth overall in the same class. In his first season in the 85cc class in 2018, Coenen competed on a small wheel machine for most of the year due to his size. The Coenen brothers competed around Europe in 2019, joining the Grizzly Racing Yamaha team for their second season in the 85cc class. This resulted in him winning the 85cc class at the Coupe de l'Avenir event and scoring points in both the European Motocross Championship and the FIM Motocross Junior World Championship. 2020 was Coenen's final year racing an 85, this time on a KTM. This saw him win the Espoirs 85cc class as part of the French Elite Motocross Championship, winning all but one race on the way to this title.\nFollowing his success on an 85, Coenen moved up to compete full-time in the EMX125 class of the 2021 European Motocross Championship for the Bud Racing team. At the first round of the season, Coenen immediately showed his potential, qualifying second and finishing third in the opening race. By the third round in Germany, he was able to take his first European Championship-level race win. A hand injury stopped him racing in the final four rounds of the season and he eventually finished fifteenth in the final standings. In addition, Coenen finished runner-up behind his brother in the Junior 125cc of the French Elite Motocross Championship, winning three races and two overall rounds.\n250 Career\nContinuing his rapid rise through the ranks Coenen, alongside his brother, moved to the Jumbo Husqvarna BT Racing Team for the EMX250 class of the 2022 European Motocross Championship. The young Belgian rider showed race winning speed throughout the season, but crashes cost him notable results - such as in the second race at the German round when he was leading. This combined with two rounds missed due to injury saw him finish nineteenth in the standings. Alongside this he also made his FIM World Motocross Championship debut in the MX2 class at the Czech round.\nAfter this single season in EMX250, Coenen was signed by the Red Bull KTM Factory Racing team to compete in the MX2 class of the 2023 FIM Motocross World Championship.

Upon his return, Coenen quickly proved his competitiveness with several top-ten finishes throughout the rest of the season. Sixth overall at the Swedish round was his highest result on the way to fourteenth in the final standings. The 2024 season saw Coenen continue his rapid adaption to the MX2 class, as he scored regular holeshots to lead races and contend for finishing positions in the top-six places. This went alongside multiple crashes which saw him miss some notable results, such as at the sixth round in Galicia where he crashed on the last lap of the qualifying race whilst leading. By the ninth round in Latvia, he was able to transform his speed into taking his first race win and with it his first overall grand prix victory.

    "\nMilitary unit\nThe King's County Royal Rifle Militia was an Irish Militia regiment in King's County (now County Offaly) dating back to 1776. It later became a battalion of the Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians). It saw action during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and the Second Boer War, and trained thousands of reinforcements during World War I. It was disbanded in 1922.\nBackground\nAlthough there are scattered references to town guards in 1584, no organised militia existed in Ireland before 1660. After that date, some militia forces were organised in the reign of King Charles II: in 1683 Sir Lawrence Parsons, 1st Baronet of Birr Castle, was appointed to command all the militia in King's County. It was not until 1715 that the Irish Militia came under statutory authority. During the 18th Century there were various Volunteer Associations and unofficial militia units controlled by the landowners, concerned mainly with internal security. During the War of American Independence, the threat of invasion by the Americans' allies, France and Spain, appeared to be serious. While most of the Regular Army was fighting overseas, the coasts of England and Wales were defended by the embodied Militia, but Ireland had no equivalent force. The Parliament of Ireland passed a Militia Act, but this failed to create an effective force. However it opened the way for the paramilitary Irish Volunteers to fill the gap. Sir Lawrence Parsons (grandson of the above) commanded the mounted militia Troop in King's County. The county also had the Parsonstown Loyal Independent Volunteer Corps raised at Birr in 1776.\nThe Volunteers were outside the control of either the parliament or the Dublin Castle administration. When the invasion threat receded they diminished in numbers but remained a political force. On the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War In 1793, the Irish administration passed an effective Militia Act that created an official Irish Militia, while the paramilitary volunteers were essentially banned. The new Act was based on existing English precedents, with the men conscripted by ballot to fill county quotas (paid substitutes were permitted) and the officers having to meet certain property qualifications.\nKing's County Militia\nThe Parsonstown Volunteers were placed on the militia establishment in 1793 as the King's County Royal Rifle Militia under the command of Sir Lawrence Parsons, 5th Baronet, later 2nd Earl of Rosse. King's County was given a quota of 420 men to fill, in eight companies.  Henry Peisley L'Estrange took over as Colonel of the Regiment from 2 April 1798.\nFrench Revolutionary War and Irish Rebellion\nThe French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars saw the British and Irish militia embodied for a whole generation, becoming regiments of full-time professional soldiers (though restricted to service in Britain or Ireland respectively), which the regular army increasingly saw as a prime source of recruits. They served in coast defences, manned garrisons, guarded prisoners of war, and carried out internal security duties.\nThe King's County regiment served mainly in the south and west of Ireland in the early part of the war. In August 1794 it was quartered with three companies at Killarney and Ross Castle, two at Tralee, two at Dingle and one at Castleisland. The Irish Militia was augmented in 1795, King's County's quota being increased to 612 men.\nAnxiety about a possible French invasion grew during the autumn of 1796 and preparations were made for field operations. A large French expeditionary force appeared in Bantry Bay on 21 December and troops from all over Ireland were marched towards the threatened area. However, the French fleet was scattered by winter storms, several ships being wrecked, and none of the French troops succeeded in landing; there was no sign of a rising by the United Irishmen. The invasion was called off on 29 December, and the troop concentration was dispersed in early 1797. At the same time the Light companies were detached to join composite battalions drawn from several militia regiments; the King's County company joined the 1st Battalion. When the militiamen of 1793 reached the end of their four-year enlistment in 1797, most of the Irish regiments were able to maintain their numbers through re-enlistments (for a bounty). At the time of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 the strength of the militia was boosted by further re-enlistments and recruiting for bounty rather than the ballot.\nThe men of the King's County Militia were predominantly Roman Catholic, and at the time of the rebellion were not fully trusted by the authorities. However, part of the regiment was in action at Newtownbarry (now known as the Battle of Bunclody) in King's County, where Col L'Estrange had 230 of his King's County Militia, a troop of Dragoons and about 100 Yeomanry Cavalry under his command. With this force he successfully defended the town from attack on 1 June, after which the King's County Militia was",

It is located on the historic street of Calle Real in Iloilo City Proper.\nIt hosted at the Elizalde Building (Spanish: Edificio de Elizalde y Cia), which used to be the office of the Commission on Audit (COA) before it was donated to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) in 2015.\nHistory\nConstructed in 1905, the building that now houses the museum was originally known as the Edificio de Ynchausti y Cia. This structure served as a branch of the Ynchausti y Compa\u00f1ia in Iloilo, a significant trading company founded in 1816 by Basque entrepreneurs Jose Joaquin de Ynchausti Y Gurchategui and Joaquin Elizalde. The company was involved in various industries, including abaca, tobacco, sugar, shipping, banking, and hemp.\nIn 1934, the building was renamed the Elizalde y Compa\u00f1ia Building after the Elizalde family acquired the Ynchaustis' shares. The building was used as the family's residence, with the ground floor hosting the city's first comprehensive grocery store. The Commission on Audit (COA) later purchased the building and used it as its regional office until the agency relocated to Pavia, Iloilo. During COA's tenure, the building was also commonly referred to as the Elizalde Building and also hosted various offices of the Iloilo City Government, including the city health department, local civil registrar, city planning, city budget, and city tourism, among others, were located in the building.\nIn 2016, the COA donated the building to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines.

These galleries collectively narrate the evolution of the Philippine economy, highlighting significant industries and historical developments.\nThe ground level features exhibits on the history of the building itself, Iloilo's role as an economic center, and an overview of the country's economic history. It also displays antiques, including century-old paper bills from the Japanese and American eras, encased in glass.\nOn the second level, the galleries explore ten major industries that have shaped the Philippine economy, such as rice production, boat making, pottery, body ornaments, textiles, blacksmithing, tobacco, sugar, abaca, and coconut. The exhibits also depict the diverse livelihoods of Filipinos across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, and showcase collections related to the history of trade and commerce in the Philippines. The galleries are carefully curated to provide a comprehensive understanding of these industries and their impact on the nation's economic development.\nSee also\nMuseum of Philippine Maritime History\nMuseum of Philippine Political History",
    "Scottish physician and nutrition scientist\nBruce Milligan Nicol (born 24 March 1913 in Ayrshire died 29 November 1988) was a Scottish physician and nutrition scientist. He researched and published extensively on Nigerian foods and nutrition.\nBiography and career\nNicol had his primary and secondary school education at Edinburgh Academy where he excelled at learning, cricket, and rugby football. He qualified as a physician from University of Aberdeen in 1935. In his immediate postgraduate career he worked for Professors James Learmonth and Stanley Davidson. When the latter moved to University of Edinburgh, Nicol went with him.\nWhile working with Davidson, Nicol's interests matured and focused on peptic ulcer disease. His clinical work and research were supplemented by a stint as a ship's surgeon. In this capacity, he obtained a wide exposure to medicine and his knowledge of ulcers was broaded through visits to hospitals in his ports of call in India and the Far East.\nIn 1936, he joined the 51st Highland Division as a Territorial Officer in the British Royal Corps of Signals. He was sent to France in a non-medical role at the outbreak of World War I. His qualifications in medicine did not go unnoticed and he was transferred to the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was awarded the Officer of the British Empire (Military Division) for his role at the Battle of Arnhem.\nIn 1947, Nicol transferred to the Colonial Medical Service and was assigned to Nigeria where he spent two decades as a doctor and nutritionist. As a District Medical Officer in Northern Nigeria, he became interested in Nigerian foods and food production. As a result, he conducted extensive studies into the staple food of different Nigerian groups and published eight substantial journal articles on the subject in the British Journal of Nutrition alone.\nAfter Nigeria achieved political independence from Britain, Nicol joined the Food and Agriculture Organization. His first assignment was as a Liaison Officer with UNICEF in New York. While there, he made significant contributions to the understanding of the Alfatoxin problem in tropically grown groundnuts and its role in the genesis of liver cancer. This was a serious problem at a time when groundnut production was being heavily in Third World countries.\nIn 1962, Nicol was assigned to FAO Headquarters in Rome as deputy director of the Nutritions Division, and later as acting director during the prolonged illness of Marcel Autret. He retired from FAO in 1973 to live in Dorset. In his retirement, he undertook consultancies in Malaysia and Indonesia, and devoted several years to Ecology of Food and Nutrition journal serving as a reviewer and member of the editorial board.\nSelected publications\nNicol, B.

They play their home games at Acrisure Arena.\nThis is the first season of Derek Laxdal being the Firebirds' head coach, as he replaced Dan Bylsma at the position on July 5, 2024. This is because Bylsma was heading to the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Seattle Kraken to replace Dave Hakstol as their head coach.\nBackground\nMain article: 2023\u201324 Coachella Valley Firebirds season\nSee also: 2023\u201324 Seattle Kraken season\nDan Bylsma left the Firebirds in order to become the Seattle Kraken's head coach on May 28, 2024.\nThe Firebirds were founded as an expansion team in the Coachella Valley as the AHL affiliate of the NHL's Seattle Kraken, and started play during the AHL's 2022\u201323 season. During that season, the Firebirds achieved 103 points during the regular season, and eventually climbed to the Calder Cup Finals, only to lose to the Hershey Bears. During the Firebirds' 2023\u201324 season, they also achieved 103 points during the regular season, climbed to the Calder Cup Finals, and lost to the Hershey Bears.\nOn April 29, 2024, following the end of the Seattle Kraken's 2023\u201324 season, their head coach, Dave Hakstol, was fired. The Kraken organization made the decision to replace him with Coachella Valley Firebirds head coach Dan Bylsma on May 28. This was important for the Firebirds because, as previously mentioned, Bylsma had coached them all the way to the Calder Cup Finals in both of their seasons. On July 5, it was announced that Derek Laxdal was going to replace Bylsma.\nOn June 30, the Kraken prepared for the upcoming free agency by re-signing four players, all of whom had contributed to the Firebirds strong efforts the previous season\u2014John Hayden, Luke Henman, Ales Stezka, and Firebirds captain Max McCormick.\nOff-season\nSee also: 2024\u201325 Seattle Kraken season\nOn July 1, the first day of free agency, the Kraken lost six players, who had spent much of their time during the 2023\u201324 season with the Firebirds\u2014Devin Shore, Connor Carrick, Kole Lind, Cameron Hughes, Jimmy Schuldt, and Chris Driedger. Lind had been one of the driving forces in Coachella Valley\u2014over their two seasons, he had the most games played (141), the most assists (80), and was tied with Max McCormick for the most points (127). Driedger was yet another factor in the Firebirds' success, as he led the Firebirds in both games played (53) and wins (33) by a goaltender. The trend of players who had spent time with the Firebirds leaving continued on July 2, when and Peetro Seppala left the Kraken.\nThe Kraken made history on July 3, by hiring Jessica Campbell as an assistant coach, as she became the first woman to be in a coaching position in the NHL. She had spent the previous two seasons with the Firebirds, helping them reach the Calder Cup Finals during both of them. Also that day, Firebirds alternate captain Andrew Poturalski left the Kraken.\nTo replace Campbell, the Firebirds hired Brennan Sonne to be an assistant coach for the team on July 15. The previous season, Sonne had served as the head coach of the Western Hockey League (WHL)'s Saskatoon Blades, leading them to achieve the best regular season record in the WHL with 105 points.\nOn July 16, the Kraken saw the departure of another player who had spent time with the Firebirds, Mitch Reinke. On July 18, the first player who was directly under contract to the Firebirds left the team\u2014Justin Nachbaur. On August 1, the Firebirds re-signed player Ian McKinnon for one year. On August 8, the Firebirds signed their first player of free agency, Cam Morrison. The Firebirds re-signed goaltender Jack LaFontaine, on August 15. On August 20, the Firebirds signed Damien Giroux. Two days later, the Firebirds re-signed Max Andreev. During the previous season, Andreev qualified for the ECHL's 2023\u201324 All-Rookie Team after achieving 72 points in 61 games. On August 27, the Firebirds signed a former captain  of the WHL's Everett Silvertips, Jackson Berezowski. On August 29, the Firebirds signed another ECHL All-Rookie Team member, Cade Borchardt.\nStandings\n\u00a0y\u2013\u00a0 indicates team has clinched division and a playoff spot\n\u00a0x\u2013\u00a0 indicates team has clinched a playoff spot\n\u00a0e\u2013\u00a0 indicates team has been eliminated from playoff contention\nStandings as of June 25, 2024\nEastern Conference\nWestern Conference\nSchedule and results\nPreseason\nOn August 6, 2024, it was accounted that the Firebirds were going to play two games at Cable Dahmer Arena, the home of the Firebirds' ECHL affiliate Kansas City Mavericks on October 4 and 5, both games against the Milwaukee Admirals.\nTransactions\nThe Firebirds have been involved in the following transactions during the 2024\u201325 season.\nTrades\n",

The group is effectively the Syrian regime's main control of Aleppo.\nHistory\nThe group was established on February 27, 2017, after the Aleppo Defenders Legion brought together many of the local militias with support from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps with its formation occurring near the time where regime sponsored militias took control of Aleppo's eastern city and neighborhoods. This group serves as an umbrella organization which emerged during the first quarter of 2017 as the regime expanded against the Islamic State in east Aleppo. The groups backing and purpose is to also deepen Iran's ties with Aleppo and it's region. As a governing body and militant group, the Aleppo Defenders Legion has participated and held meetings with the Aleppo sector of the Syrian Ba'ath party, Liwa al-Baqir, and Liwa al-Quds. The armed battalions of the Aleppo Defenders Legion include Fawj al-Safira, Fawj Hadher, and Fawj Azan with the ruling commander of all of them, including the group itself, Aleppo Defenders Legion, being Saber Rameen after succeeding Javad Ghaffari in 2021.\nIn the areas of Aleppo and Syrian Democratic Forces territory, the Aleppo Defenders Legion is one of the primary traffickers of narcotics through those areas, specifically, Manbij, Tell Rifaat, and the Aleppo countryside adjacent to Afrin.\nThe Aleppo Defenders Legion has the city of Aleppo primarily divided into four sectors known as squares, the second square is considered to be the most influential which is located in the central district of al-Telfon al-Hawaei. These squares are basically the governing bodies of the cities sectors which further exercises the control of local leaders and neighborhood councils that consist of individuals close to the ADL. The legion is also represented in Aleppo's provincial and city councils. Each square has sub-offices that directly oversee the provision of services related to education, culture, religious affairs, and other matters. Within all these squares of influence and control, the group maintains control of the law enforcement and local governance.\nIn 2021, the Aleppo Defenders Legion established a Shia faction, specifically people from the Twelver-Ja'fari sect, of the group after recruiting people from villages in the Aleppo Governorate and Idlib Governorate including the villages of Nubl, Al-Zahra, Kafriya, and Al-Foua in addition they recruited Sunni Muslims from the area to teach them Shi'ite doctrine.

The investigation later allegedly uncovered preliminary evidence of fraud and identity theft related to her mother\u2019s acquisition of South African citizenship in 2001. It was asserted that she was unable to participate in the contest due to her mixed heritage and the purported ongoing investigation concerning her mother.\nControversy\nAdetshina\u2019s participation in the Miss South Africa pageant faced scrutiny due to questions about her citizenship and eligibility. Concerns were raised regarding her dual citizenship of South Africa and Nigeria, leading the South African Department of Home Affairs to investigate her background. The investigation allegedly revealed preliminary evidence suggesting potential issues with her mother\u2019s acquisition of South African citizenship. It was said that the Department of Home Affairs planned to take further action, which may have included potential criminal charges based on the investigation's findings. Adetshina garnered support from the public who saw her as a representation of South Africa's diverse population. A South African far-left political party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, publicly defended her, calling for an end to xenophobia in South Africa and advocating for inclusivity. While other parties, namely the African National Congress and the Patriotic Alliance advocated for an investigation into her nationality. The minister of Home Affairs Leon Schreiber confirmed that the department would investigate the nationality of Adetshina only after her family requested it. Additional controversy emerged due to a video of Adetshina celebrating her progress in the pageant with her Nigerian relatives circulated online.\nThe Miss South Africa pageant maintained that Adetshina fulfilled all the requirements to participate in the competition.\nMiss Universe Nigeria 2024\nOn 31 August 2024, Adetshina, representing Taraba State competed in and won Miss Universe Nigeria 2024, at the Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. Competing against 24 other contestants, the event was broadcast on GOtv and YouTube. Adetshina will represent Nigeria at Miss Universe in Mexico scheduled in November 2024.\nPersonal life\nAdetshina was previously married, and divorced in February. She has one child.\n",

She created the characters of \"Ada and Elsie\" during WW2.\nLife\nFoster was born in 1908 in Devonport, Tasmania. Her parents Mary Isabel (born Collett) and Charles Marshall Foster who were both born in Australia. Her father was an engineer. She was educated in Hobart at St Michael's Collegiate School and her first job was in radio.\n\"Ada and Elsie\" in 1942\nShe went to Melbourne in 1934 as a secretary to the impresario John Tait and she was employed at radio 3UZ in 1935. Later at 3AW \"Dilly\" became a comedian on the \"Shell Show\" which was recorded each week in front of a live Melbourne audience.\nFoster had heard of a successful British comedy act named \"Gert and Daisy\" who were created by Elsie and Doris Waters. Foster wrote a similar conversational comedy script and then auditioned for a comic partner. She chose the haughty Rita Pauncefort and \"Ada and Elsie\" was formed. \"Dilly\" Dorothy Foster married, for the second time, a wool buyer named Robert Gray Nicolson in 1939.\n\"Calling the Stars\" was an expensive radio show created by 2GB in Australia and sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive.

    "Road in Kenya\nThe A10 road is a road in Kenya stretching a diagonal trajectory from Lokichar in the northwest to the port city of Lamu in the southeast, covering a planned distance of 970 kilometers. Currently, the route is in various stages of development, with certain sections yet to be constructed. As a key development axis, the A10 has the potential to play a role in connecting disparate regions and fostering economic growth. However, its full realization requires further infrastructure development to complete the envisioned route.\nRoute\nThe A10 is a proposed upgrade to a network of road connections, which, as of 2020, consisted largely of underdeveloped dirt roads, with several sections missing and others merely consisting of desert tracks. Only limited portions had been paved, including a short stretch from Isiolo and a section between Kinyang and Loruk. The envisioned route will span from the A1 near Lokichar, traversing the Rift Valley and northern Kenya's deserts, to the coastal town of Lamu on the Indian Ocean. Notably, the route intersects with the A2 at Isiolo, a critical juncture, and crosses the A3 at Garissa. The terminus in Lamu also marks the endpoint of the A7 coastal road, highlighting the A10's potential as a vital link in Kenya's transportation infrastructure.\nHistory\nLamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor\nThe A10 road is being developed as part of the Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor (LAPSSET) project, a comprehensive initiative aimed at enhancing regional connectivity. Although initial feasibility studies date back to 1975, it wasn't until 2008 that a detailed study was undertaken to develop a new deep-sea port in Lamu and establish a transport corridor linking Kenya to Sudan, with the scope later expanded to include the newly independent nation of South Sudan. The project seeks to foster economic growth and facilitate trade across the region.\nThe project includes several elements:\nAn oil refinery in Lamu\nThree airports\nThree resort towns: Lamu, Isiola and Lake Turkana\nA deep-sea port in Manda Bay, called Lamu Port\nA railway line from Lamu to Juba (South Sudan) and Addis Ababa (Ethiopia)\nA road network\nAn oil pipeline\nConstruction of a paved road\nThe majority of the A10 route currently consists of unpaved dirt roads, dirt paths, and sandy tracks. However, some limited progress has been made in upgrading the road. Around 2012, a brief 4-kilometer stretch was paved, connecting the A2 highway in Isiolo to the east. Nevertheless, as of 2021, further development of this project had not commenced. Additionally, a 30-kilometer section between Nginyang and Loruk, formerly designated as the B4, was asphalted around 2017, marking a minor improvement in the road's overall condition. Despite these incremental upgrades, the route remains largely underdeveloped.\nRoad number history\nIn 2016, the A10 designation was introduced as part of a comprehensive renumbering effort. This new classification encompassed a combination of existing roads and proposed connections, some of which were still in the planning stages or under construction at the time. The A10 route was thereby established, incorporating a mix of already-built infrastructure and envisioned links, with the aim of creating a cohesive and interconnected transportation network.\nThe A10 was routed over the following roads:\nC113: Lokori - Kinyang\nC46: Lokichar - Lokori\nB4: Kinyang - Loruk\nmissing corridor: Kubi Turkana - north of Garissa\nC81: north of Garissa - Garissa\nmissing corridor: Garissa - Ijara\nD568: Ijara - Hindi\nC112: Hindi - Lamu\nD370: Loruk - Mugle Ranch\nMissing corridor: Mugle Ranch - Isiolo\nB9: Isiolo - Kubi Turkana",
    "\nThe Dutch Association of Journalists (Dutch: Nederlandse Vereniging van Journalisten, NVJ) is a national trade union for journalists, part of the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions. Anyone who fits the description of journalist in the broadest sense of the term can be a member. This includes reporters, investigative journalists, photographers, editors and producers. Both those who work full-time or part-time in any of these capacities are members. The association publishes the Villamedia Magazine, focused on journalism news.\nThe aims of the association are to defend the freedom of the press against governmental and other threats, as well as to defend and improve the work conditions of journalists. The association also strives to defend and maintain journalistic integrity and ethics. It provides legal aid to its members, gives out press cards, and takes part in conflict-resolution between journalists and their employers, and engages in strike action.\nAs of November 2023 the chair of the NVJ is Folkert Jensma, former editor-in-chief of the NRC, who was elected with 95% of the vote. Rowan Blijd was elected vice-chair.\nHistory\nIn 1884 the Dutch Journalist Circle (Dutch: Nederlandse Journalisten Kring, NJK) was founded by A.G.C. van Duyl senior, then editor in chief of the Algemeen Dagblad. The NJK's aim was to increase solidarity among journalists and serve as a platform for them to discuss and advance their interests.\nIn 1898 prominent journalist, theologian and future Prime Minister Abraham Kuyper became chair of the NJK, greatly raising its reputation and influence. \nDue to the pillarization of the Netherlands at the time, Catholics and Protestants set up their own alternative journalistic associations in the years after the NJK's founding. However, the NJK remained the largest and most influential, with the Catholic association having 14 publications as its members in 1902 as opposed to the 250 members of the NJK.\nIn 1949 the various journalistic associations decided to cooperate in the Federation of Dutch Journalists (FNJ), which in 1968, with the erosion of pillarization, combined to form the NVJ.\n",
    "Polish malariologist and medical entomologist\nLeonard Jan Bruce-Chwatt (born Leonard Jan Chwatt on 9 June 1907 in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and died 18 May 1989) was a Polish medical doctor, malariologist and medical entomologist who worked extensively on malarial research in Nigeria with the British colonial medical service, and later with the World Health Organization and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nBiography and career\nBruce-Chwatt was educated first in Saint Petersburg, and later in Warsaw where he obtained his degree in medicine with distinction in 1930. He spent two years as RMO in the Polish Army. He then took a postgraduate degree in microbiology and serology in 1933, after which he moved to France for two years to pursue a diploma in colonial medicine. He worked at the Pasteur Institute and the H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis until the outbreak of the Second World War when he joined the Polish Army Medical Corps. He later escaped to England where he joined the Polish Rifle Brigade. While serving with the Polish Army in Britain, Bruce-Chwatt earned a Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and the Duncan Medal at the LSHTM.\nIn 1942, he was transferred to the Royal Army Medical Corps and sent to No. 7 Malaria Field Laboratory in Nigeria. He was demobilized in 1946, and began working as a medical entomologist with the Colonial Medical Service in Nigeria. In 1948, Chwatt became a British subject, married Joan Margaret Bruce and added her name to his own. In 1948, he was assigned to the Rockefeller Yellow Fever Research Institute in Lagos. From 1949 to 1958, as Senior Specialist (Malariologist), he organised and managed Nigeria's Federal Malaria Service.\nIn 1958 Bruce-Chwatt became Chief of Research and Technical Intelligence in the Malaria Eradication Division of the World Health Organization in Geneva, where he remained for the next 10 years. In 1968, he joined the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as Professor of Tropical Hygiene, becoming Director of its Ross Institute the following year. Upon his retirement in 1974 he joined the Wellcome Museum of Medical Science and, in 1985, the Wellcome Tropical Institute. It was during this period that he was able to indulge his long-standing interest in the history of malaria. Over the course of his career, Bruce-Chwatt published numerous works on malaria.\nHonours\nBruce-Chwatt received the Officer of the British Empire during the 1953 Coronation Honours, and the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George during the 1976 Birthday Honours. In 1971, Bruce-Chwatt was conferred with the Darling Foundation Prize awarded by League of Nations.

    "\nHanlan's Point Amusement Park  was an attraction on Hanlan's Point on the Toronto Islands that operated from the 1880s until the 1930s and was regarded as \"Canada's answer to Coney Island\".\nHistory\nHanlan's Point is the most westerly of the Toronto Islands. Originally a cottage community, one of the first settlers there were was John Hanlan, after whom the island is named, and his family in 1862. In 1878, the Hanlan family converted their cottage into a hotel, and then replaced it with a new, larger 25-room Hanlan's Hotel in 1880, and began to develop the island as a tourist attraction. The Hanlan's Point Amusement Park was one of a series of attractions built by the Hanlans in the 1880s. In 1892, Ned Hanlan sold the amusement park, hotel, and other amenities to the Toronto Ferry Company which operated all the ferries travelling between the islands and the mainland, providing the only means for the general public to travel to the island.\nIn its heyday the amusement park was one of Toronto's major attractions and included a roller coaster, a miniature train, midway, grandstand, a vaudeville theatre, dancing pavilion, shooting gallery, tea garden and various rides and games. It is best remembered for having a 40 foot high platform from which diving horses would leap into Lake Ontario. Hanlan's Point Stadium was built next to the amusement park and was the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team, both of which were also owned by the ferry company.\nA fire on August 10, 1909, destroyed the hotel, the wooden stadium and all but five concession stands of the amusement park and did $200,000 in damage. The amusement park and a stadium, now made of concrete, were rebuilt in time for the 1910 season.\nThe park started to decline in the 1920s due to competition from the Sunnyside Amusement Park which opened on the mainland in 1922 and was accessible by automobile and streetcar, making it easier to access than Hanlan's Point which could only be reached by ferry. Attendance declined further in 1926 when the Maple Leafs baseball team moved from Hanlan's Point Stadium to Maple Leaf Stadium at the foot of Bathurst Street. In 1927, Lol Solman sold the Toronto Ferry Company, which owned the ferry service to the island as well as the amusement park, the stadium, and other amenities, to the City of Toronto with the Toronto Transportation Commission assuming operation of the ferries and the amusement park. The park was demolished in 1937 in order to make way for the Toronto Island airport. Today, the portion of Hanlan's Point which is not occupied by the airport remains a public recreation area consisting of Hanlan's Point Beach, a baseball diamond, bicycle and hiking trails, a tennis court, a volleyball court, picnic areas, fire pits and parkland as well as the Gibraltar Point Lighthouse.\nSee also\nHanlan's Point Beach\nCentreville Amusement Park - a smaller amusement park on the Toronto Islands which replaced Hanlan's Point\nScarboro Beach Amusement Park - a competing amusement park operating in the east end of Toronto in the same period",
    "Species of flowering plant\nMangifera caloneura (also known as poh in Javanese or Ma muang paa in Thai) is a fruit bearing tree in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to Mainland Southeast Asia.\nDescription\nThe tree has been observed growing up to 40 meters (130\u00a0ft) tall, however, a height of roughly 20 meters (66\u00a0ft) is much more common. It excretes a resin upon injury that sets into a black colour. The diameter of the tree's trunk varies but is typically around 60 centimetres (24\u00a0in), although it has been seen at sizes of over 1.2 metres (3\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in). It has fissured bark of a colour  that varies between black, grey and brown.\nIt's leaves are glabrous and take on an oblong to lanceolate-oblong shape. Like other Mangifera species, their texture has been described as chartaceous to subcoriaceous. The petioles are typically 2 to 7 centimetres (0.79 to 2.76\u00a0in) long. Leaf sizes vary, roughly, between a width of 3 centimetres (1.2\u00a0in) and 9 centimetres (3.5\u00a0in), as well as a length of 10 centimetres (3.9\u00a0in) to 22 centimetres (8.7\u00a0in).\nThe fruit are small compared to other species in the genus, such as Mangifera indica, however, they are similarly shaped. The fruit are 3 to 5 centimetres (1.2 to 2.0\u00a0in) in size and the seed's endosperm is ruminate. When ripe, the fruit has greenish-yellow to orange skin and the flesh is white. When fully developed, the fruit are roughly 40 grams (1.4\u00a0oz).\nIt's flowers are small, typically measuring around 0.6 to 0.8 centimetres (0.24 to 0.31\u00a0in). There are 5 stamens on each flower. The flowers have 4 to 5 petals, each is typically 0.5 centimetres (0.20\u00a0in) long. The petals are white with a longitudinal yellow colouration. The flowers stalks are very short.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe species is native to Mainland Southeast Asia. Specifically, it is native to Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar. It occurs within monsoonal deciduous forests, savannas and lowland tropical rainforests\nDue to its appearance in the local dialect, it appears to have been introduced into the more eastern islands in Southeast Asia, such as Java.\nUses\nThe young leaves of the tree can be eaten uncooked, they have been described as sour tasting.\nThe fruit itself is also eaten, the taste has been described as sweetly acidic.\nThere has been research into potential pharmacological applications of the leaf extract of Mangifera caloneura due to its antioxidant and antidiabetic properties. A 2015 study was conducted on rats that had been artificially induced with diabetes following a controlled application of streptozotocin. These rats were then given a dosage of the leaf extract at a concentration of 250\u00a0mg/kg for 6 weeks. When comparing with the control it was shown that the blood-glucose levels of the rats had significantly decreased to the point where the leaf extract may be viable as a potential diabetes medication.\nNotes\n",
    "Indian comedian and actor (born 1966)\nEvangelisto Diogo Agnelo Fernandes (born 10 September 1966), known professionally as Ben Evangelisto, is an Indian comedian, actor, singer, and playwright known for his work in Konkani films and tiatr (theatre) productions.\nEarly life\nEvangelisto Diogo Agnelo Fernandes was born on 10 September 1966 in Margao, Goa, India. He was the son of Caetano Fernandes, a seaman from Benaulim, and Maria Purifica\u00e7a\u00f2 Goes, a homemaker from Colva. Fernandes's paternal uncle was a performer of moderate acclaim, known for his contribution in a minor capacity to the Konkani film Jivit Amchem Oxem. From a young age, Fernandes demonstrated an interest in Goan Konkani theater, known locally as tiatrs. During his childhood at the age of 9, he was a frequent spectator at the non stop dramas presented by Rosario Rodrigues, a popular figure in the Goan khell tiatr tradition. Fernandes was also influenced by the similar works of young tiatr artists from Colva, such as Rosary Ferns. Following the viewing of these performances, he would go back to his uncle's residence in Sernabatim and replicate the cants or songs from the tiatrs, with a focus on those created by Rodrigues.\nAt the age of 12, Fernandes matriculated at St. Anthony's boarding school located in Duler, Mapusa. During this period, he commenced composing his own unique tiatrs, marking the start of his career as a Konkani playwright. During his tenure as a young boarding student at St. Anthony's, Fernandes exhibited an aptitude for acting, which was initially identified by the Franciscans brothers. While studying at the institution, he crafted brief dramatic pieces in Konkani and English, with the assistance of the brothers in bringing these theatrical works to life on stage. Fernandes also received additional training in music and singing from mestre Anthony Velho. Among Fernandes's early dramatic writings was an English-language play titled Goa Today that addressed the emerging issue of drug addiction in the Goa region.\nCareer\nFernandes rose to prominence in the Konkani theater scene in the late 20th century. In 1980, his foray into acting commenced with the creation of the play Goa Today for an English theatrical production, ultimately winning in an inter-house competition by clinching the first prize. Over the following years, he continued to participate in and win fancy dress competitions in his local community. He then transitioned to acting in small Konkani tiatrs directed by local figures such as Cyril Fernandes and the Affonso Brothers. Fernandes' big break came when he was cast in a children's tiatr directed by Mini Mario, titled Adim Tum, Atam Hanv (Before You, Now I Am). After this production, he achieved his goal of performing in tiatrs directed by the popular director Rosario Rodrigues. He was cast in Rodrigues' play Hanv Kallokant Sandlim (I've Lost in Darkness) as well as several other shows directed by Rodrigues. He later began collaborating with another well-known director, Roseferns, appearing in his tiatr Beiman Tum (You Faithless One). This production ran for 60-70 shows, with Fernandes playing a comedic role as a \"spring priest\" that drew both praise and criticism from audiences. Following his work with Roseferns, he continued to act in multiple additional tiatrs directed by him over the subsequent years.\nFernandes' career has spanned multiple roles, including both acting and producing. Early in his career, he was cast by Roseferns to portray the role of a grandmother in the tiatr Xinxe (Glass). He went on to perform in a series of tiatrs directed by other popular playwrights, including three productions by Jose Rod, as well as works by C. D'Silva, John D' Silva, Rosario Rodrigues, Prem Kumar, Pascoal Rodrigues, and Mario Menezes. Fernandes has also expanded his reach beyond Goa, traveling abroad to perform tiatrs in the Gulf region, the United Kingdom, France, Portugal, and Canada. In addition to his acting work, he has penned several non-stop tiatrs, including Chondrim (Moon), Kidd (Worm), Pez (Congee), Devak Zai Zalear (If God Wills), among others. After collaborating with John D' Silva, he joined the troupe of Mario Menezes, appearing in acclaimed plays such as Mhoji Maim, Mhoji Dusman (My Mother, My Enemy) and Sangat Ami Bhurgim Konanchi? (Say, Whose Children Are We?). Fernandes has also directed and staged his own productions, including the play Kidd which was performed in London. His play Chondrim was particularly well-received, set against the backdrop of a waterfall.\nFernandes is known for his dynamic and convincing performances in a range of roles. One of his acclaimed portrayals was in the production of To Amkam Visorlo (He Forgot Us), penned by playwright Jacinto Vaz, imitating as Vaz himself. His talents were further showcased when he took on the same role in a revival of the classic work Sounsar Sudorlo by M. Boyer, directed by Anil Kumar. He convincingly embodied Vaz's character, creating a performance",

    "Historical place in Albany County, Wyomingy, United States\nTrail to Laramie Peak\nCamp Esterbrook is a historical site in the Medicine Bow National Forest in Albany County of eastern Wyoming in the United States in the Laramie Mountains. Camp Esterbrook was in the in the Laramie Peak area, closest town is the community of Esterbrook, Wyoming north of the camp. Camp Esterbrook is at about 7,400 feet (2,300\u00a0m) elevation near the Esterbrook Creek. Camp Esterbrook opened in spring 1944 and operated as World War 2 Prisoner of war (POW) camp.  Today there are a few remains of the camp.\nCivilian Conservation Corps\nEsterbrook CCC Camp was one of 15 United States Forest Service Civilian Conservation Corps camps in the state Wyoming during the Great Depression. Medicine Bow National Forest had other US Forest Service Civilian Conservation Corps camps: Ryan Park, Forest\u2014at Pole Mountain, Chimney Park, Centennial Work Center, Arlington, Encampment, and French Creek. The worker first lived in tents and them built their own housing. The camp was made up of young unmarried men from the East Coast of the United States. The camp planted tree, build roads, trails, campgrounds, and US Forest ranger stations. The camp built the Esterbrook fire lookout. When needed the camp also worked as firefighters. Many of the Esterbrook CCC Camp projects are still in use today.\nPrisoner of war camp\nDuring World War 2, starting in spring 1944 German prisoners were housed at Camp Esterbrook. Camp Esterbrook prisoners of war were used for timber operations. Prisoner of war labor worked for civilian employers under the military officials and the Department of Agriculture's Extension Service. The camp worked six days a week, with Sunday off. The POW Labor Program benefited the US as there was shortage of labor during the war. About 75 POWs lived at the camp, with about 7 Army guards. Most POWs came from Camp Douglas (Wyoming). The local logging companies paid the prisoner labor, now lumberjacks, the same as local civilians. The POWs cut timber for railroad ties`. Evidence can still be found of the camp, including building foundations, wells and latrine pits. At the end of the war the camp closed in January 1946. At first the camp held Italian POWs. In April 1944 the Italians POWs were moved out. German  POWs moved in.  In April 1944 the Italians were able to volunteer for Italian Service Units, this was non-combat duty in special service units of the United States Army. To join the Italian Service Unit, each Italians volunteer could sign a pledge to perform any non-combat duty to help the United States against the now common enemy, Nazi Germany.\nDuring World War II, two large POW base camps, (Camp Douglas and Fort Francis E. Warren), and seventeen smaller camps that did agricultural and timber work were located in Wyoming. Other smaller camps in Wyoming were: Basin, Wyoming (sugar beet harvest), Clearmont (sugar beet harvest), Deaver (sugar beet harvest), Dubois (timber camp), Esterbrook (timber camp), Huntley (sugar beet harvest), Lingle (agriculture), Lovell (remodeling the Lovell Armory and Cavalry Barn, and then sugar beet harvest), Pine Bluffs (sugar beet and potato harvest), Powell (sugar beet harvest), Riverton (sugar beet harvest), Torrington (agriculture), Veteran (agriculture), Wheatland (agriculture), Ryan Park Camp  (timber), Centennial POW Camp (timber) and Worland (agriculture).\nSee also\nCamp Douglas (Wyoming)\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Laramie Peak.\nEsterbrook at Wyoming places\nHR Wilderness Camp in Esterbrook Wyoming\n\"World War II POW Camps of Wyoming with Author Cheryl O'Brien\" on YouTube",

    "Mountain in Montana, United States\nSheep Mountain is a 10,608-foot (3,233-metre) summit in Park County, Montana, United States.\nDescription\nSheep Mountain is located 3.75 miles (6.04\u00a0km) north of Cooke City, Montana, in the Beartooth Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. It is set within the New World Mining District and the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's northwest slope drains into Goose Creek which is a tributary of the Stillwater River, whereas the other slopes drain into Fisher Creek and Lady of the Lake Creek which together form the headwaters of the Clarks Fork Yellowstone River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises approximately 1,650 feet (503 meters) above Fisher Creek in one mile (1.6\u00a0km). The area from Cooke City to Sheep Mountain offers some of the finest backcountry snowmobiling in the country. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. This peak should not be confused with the other Sheep Mountain also in Park County, Montana, but in the Absaroka Range.\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Sheep Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F.\nSee also\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains",

    "First full-time secretary hired for a Major League Baseball player\nCarla Koplin Cohn (born January 17, 1947) is an American former secretary who served as the personal secretary to Henry Aaron, Hall of Fame baseball player and one of the greatest players in baseball history, during his chase of Babe Ruth's home run record of 714. She was the first full-time secretary ever written into the contract of a Major League Baseball player.\nEarly life and education\nKoplin was born in 1947 to a Jewish family in Macon, Georgia. Her parents were Nora (n\u00e9e Coolik) and Alvin Koplin. She graduated from Miller High School for Girls and then attended the University of Georgia for two years, after which she enrolled in a secretarial school in New York City.\nCareer\nAfter finishing school, Koplin applied for a position with the Atlanta Braves in 1969. Dick Cecil, Vice President of the Braves, hired her to work as the assistant of the director of a new youth summer camp. She worked in an office situated in the tunnel leading to the Braves' clubhouse, which was how she met Aaron.\nWhen Aaron hit his 600th home run and the possibility of him breaking Babe Ruth's record became inevitable, he asked Koplin to help out with his increasing mail. After a year working for both the summer camp and Aaron, with her workload becoming extraneous, he had Koplin written into his contract, making her the first full-time secretary to a baseball player.\nKoplin primary duty was to sort through Aaron's large numbers of mail; in 1973, he received approximately 900,000 letters. She organized the mail into congratulatory notes, and another pile for fans who sent baseball cards for Aaron to autograph. She sorted out hate mail and death threats, the latter of which she would report to the FBI. Koplin herself received death threats as well: \"They knew I was white, Jewish, and working for a Black man.\" Additionally, she also scheduled his personal appearances and handled his business correspondence.\nKoplin was present in the ballpark when Aaron hit his 715th career home run, passing Babe Ruth. Later on, when Aaron went to the Milwaukee Brewers, Koplin moved there with him and continued to work in the same position as she did with the Braves until Aaron's retirement. She then moved to New York City and eventually Westport, Connecticut.\nPersonal life\nKoplin married Al Cohn and had one child with her, a daughter named Jennifer, through whom she has a grandchild. Widowed in 2007, she retired to Boca Raton, Florida in 2009. Her daughter called Aaron \"Uncle Henry\".\nShe and Aaron remained close for the rest of his life. Aaron attended her wedding and also spoke at her daughter's wedding. Cohn attended all of Aaron's major events. When Aaron died in 2021, she was one of the few people allowed to attend his private funeral, gatherings at the time having been restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

Well recognized on the international stage, he served as an Olympic diving coach in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and most recently the 2012 London Olympics.\nEducation\nPanzano was born in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where he attended nearby Upper Merion High School, and as a multi-sport athlete competed as a diver on the swim team and was a high-jumper and pole-vaulter on the track team. In March, 1967 at the Pennsylvania State Championships at the Bucknell Pool in Lewisburg, he placed fifth overall, a solid performance for a High School underclassman. In March, 1968 Panzano placed third diving in the Pennsylvania Boy's High School State Championship in Lewisburg, Pennsylania.\nHe attended Ohio State from 1969 to 1973, where he dove competitively for Coach Ron O'Brien.

At Tennessee, Panzano was mentored by Hall of Fame Head Swim Coach Ray Bussard, and his teams produced at least one Southeastern Conference Champion in each of the five years he coached.  As an indication of his improvement as a young coach, and the regional recognition of his diving program, he was named SEC Diving Coach of the Year in 1977 after only four years coaching Tennessee.  Panzano acknowledged how his skills had grown under Bussard, noting, \"I've learned what coaching is about through him\".\nOhio State\nHe was hired to coach at Ohio State University in 1978 where he remained through his retirement on August 5, 2013. His thirty-five years of service was the longest tenured coaching position at Ohio State at that time.   During his lengthy coaching career he excelled on the national stage and led Ohio State and McDonald's Diving, an age group team, to six national team titles.  Demonstrating the excellence of his program at Ohio State, he developed two Olympic medalists, 13 NCAA champions, 23 U.S. national diving champions and 59 Big Ten champions.

Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California.\nHistory\nThe building that would become the Ritz Theatre was originally built for retail in 1930. In 1939\u20131940, it was repurposed into the 386-seat News View Theatre (also known as Newsreel Theater), designed by Norton & Wallis and featuring a streamline moderne interior and art deco lettering on its exterior.\nThe theater opened on May 2, 1940, boasting a policy of screening newsreels air-expressed from New York in 15 hours and London in 40. The theater's first screening included views of the siege of Warsaw, a special reel that applied words of Washington to European events of the day, and lighter fare such as sports, woman's issues, Lew Lehr commenting on bathing beauties, and various other items. The Bear's Tale, a Merrie Melodies cartoon, was also screened, as was Carey Wilson's commentary on A Door Will Open and Pete Smbth's Spots Before Your Eyes.\nBy 1944, the theater was owned by ABC Theatres. In 1949, the theater starting going by Hollywood Newsreel, and in 1954, it changed its name to New View Theatre as it transitioned from newsreels to features. In 1968, Pacific Theatres acquired the theater and renamed it Pacific New View, and the theatre was renovated, including the addition of a snack bar, in 1969.\nIn 1974, the theater was taken over by the porno theater chain Pussycat Theaters, where Deep Throat would play for more than ten years, ending in 1989. Additionally, from August 1977 to January 1978, the theater's neighbor housed Los Angeles's first punk rock club in its basement, with a secondary access point through a staircase from this theatre.\nIn 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and while this theater is in the district, it was not listed as a contributing or non-contributing property.\nIn 1989, the theater became the Ritz Theatre, which closed in 1991. It was managed by Johnny Legend and Eric Caidin.\nIn 1994, the theater became a church, which closed in 2015. In November 2017, the building was reopened by Alki David as Hologram USA Theater, which closed one year later.\nIn 2020, the building was used as a marijuana lounge.\nIn popular culture\nThis theater has been featured in numerous films, including Lethal Weapon, Alex in Wonderland, Death Wish II, Exit Through the Gift Shop, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n",

    "The Woytinsky-Tarnow-Baade plan, abbreviated as the WTB plan, was a proposed debt-financed public employment program in Germany in 1932. It was intended to ease the effects of the Great Depression by ending the country's deflationary spiral and increase purchasing power. The plan would have seen the federal government fund one million public jobs via a loan from the German Central Bank of three billion Reichsmark (equivalent to 3% of GDP).\nThe plan was named for its three key proponents: Russian economist Vladimir S. Voitinsky (in German Woytinsky), woodworkers' union president Fritz Tarnow, and Social Democratic agriculture spokesman Fritz Baade. The three presented their plan to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and German Trade Union Confederation in January 1932, but it was not adopted.\nBackground\nWoytinsky was a Russian economist and politician who had emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1921. He spent most of the 1920s in Germany, where he published a series of statistical economics books, The World in Figures. In the latter part of the decade he contributed to the Social Democratic theoretical journal Die Gesellschaft, through which he was hired by the General German Trade Union Federation (ADGB) as head of statistics and economic advisor.\nAfter the onset of the depression, the government of Heinrich Br\u00fcning implemented a harsh austerity programme involving reductions in wages, welfare, and public expenditure, combined with tax increases. These policies were implemented via emergency decree and proved deeply unpopular. Contrary to Br\u00fcning's intentions, they also had the effect of worsening the depression, reducing growth and increasing unemployment.\nWoytinsky identified deflation and the resultant lack of spending in the economy as a chief cause of the worsening economic situation and mass unemployment. During the years of 1931 and 1932 Germany was experiencing a 10% annual rate of deflation. In early 1931 Woytinsky began developing a preliminary version of what would become the WTB plan, proposing the injection of money into the European economy via large-scale public works on an international scale.:\u200a159\u200a He was supported by the ADGB and began publishing articles advocating his ideas in the union theoretical journal Die Arbeit in June 1931, opening debate over the concept of \"active economic policy\".\nToward the end of the year, Woytinsky had narrowed the scope of his proposals to a domestic scheme financed by bank loans. He continued to refine the plan and its theoretical basis. Previous opponents in the union movement including Fritz Tarnow were converted, and the two began to collaborate in promoting active economic policy to combat the depression. Along with Fritz Baade, the three presented their plan to a joint meeting of the SPD and ADGB boards.:\u200a162\u200a\nReception\nThe plan had widespread appeal among the union movement and the lower levels of the Social Democratic Party, who were desperate for a strategy to reduce unemployment. Six million workers were unemployed during 1932 and as a result were facing destitution, exacerbated by cuts to unemployment benefits and social welfare. Woytinsky's work in Die Arbeit had sparked wide debate over active economic policy in the party and the unions, and some aspects garnered widespread support.:\u200a164\u2013165\u200a\nWhile Woytinsky had won over the bulk of the union movement by the end of 1931, most Social Democratic leaders were skeptical. Rudolf Hilferding, the party's widely respected chief theoretician and economist, opposed Woytinsky's ideas throughout their development and promotion. Hilferding adhered to the economic orthodoxy of the time. He believed that the periodic crises of capitalism were unavoidable and that state intervention could do little if anything to facilitate recovery. Fear of inflation was also widespread after Germany's experience with hyperinflation in the early 1920s: Hilferding believed that the inflationary impact of debt financing would erase any positive effects.:\u200a164\u200a Moreover, many socialists were disturbed by the idea of attempting to \"rescue\" capitalism from a crisis of its own making. Fritz Tarnow, though a supporter of the plan, articulated this dilemma:\nNow, however, we stand at the sickbed of capitalism not only as diagnosticians, but also \u2013 yes, what can I say? \u2013 as a doctor who wants to heal? Or as a cheerful heir who can't wait for the end and would prefer to help things along with poison? This double role, doctor and heir, is a damn difficult task.\nThese arguments proved persuasive for large parts of the party. Social Democratic leaders also viewed the plan as an intrusion into the sphere of policymaking, which traditionally lay with the party, not the unions. Considering these factors, and with Hilferding staunchly opposed, the SPD board rejected the WTB plan in January 1932. The ADGB reluctantly followed their lead, declining the endorse the plan, but continued to call for large-scale public works and against defla",
    "\nShaukat Bukhari (Persian: \u0634\u0648\u06a9\u062a \u0628\u062e\u0627\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u06cc) was a 17th-century poet who wrote in Persian.\nIn his early years, Shaukat lived in Bukhara, following his father's trade as a money changer before moving to Khorasan. Around 1677/78, he started working for Safi Qoli Khan Shamlu, the governor of Herat. Mirza Sa'd al-Din, the vizier of Khorasan, had a long-standing association with Shaukat and showed him much kindness. Despite this, Shaukat eventually chose to withdraw from public life to live in seclusion. He moved to Isfahan, living in self-imposed poverty until his death in 1695/96. There he was buried in the cemetery made in honor of the spiritual leader Shaykh Ali ibn Suhayl ibn Azhar Isfahani.\nShaukhat played a key-role in making the Indian style widespread in Persian poetry. Early Persian writers did not acknowledge his work. Nonetheless, in the Ottoman Empire, he was greatly revered, and the Scottish orientalist Elias John Wilkinson Gibb noted that \"he continued for more than half a century to be the guiding star for the majority of Ottoman poets.\"\n",
    "\nTeungku Ishak Daud (12 January 1960 - 8 September 2004) is the Commander of GAM in the Peureulak region. He was once imprisoned by the Indonesian government, but was released again during the reign of president Abdurrahman Wahid on 21 May 2000. Subsequently, he rejoined GAM, and died in an ambush by the TNI, in 2004.\nBiography\nIshak was born in Blang Glumpang Kuala Idie Village, Idie Rayeuk District, East Aceh on January 12, 1960. He is the first child of Muhammad Daud bin Tengku Basyah and Nuriah. As a child, Isaac lived in a village where the average life was below the poverty line. His father worked as a fisherman, while his mother sold cakes. Ishak Daud felt that he was never satisfied with this condition.\nIn early 1984, when he was 24 years old, Ishak decided to migrate to Malaysia. In the neighboring country, Isaac Daud worked odd jobs, as a construction worker or restaurant keeper. Because he couldn't stand living like that in Malaysia, Ishak Daud decided to migrate to Singapore. Moreover, there are many Aceh people in that country. Just like in Malaysia, Ishak Daud also works odd jobs, from construction worker to transport driver. It was also in Singapore that Ishak Daud became aware of the Free Aceh Movement, especially at that time many Free Aceh activists held political meetings. Practically, while working in Singapore Ishak often attended these meetings. This also opened his insight into the history of Aceh.\nIn June 1987, Ishak was finally sworn in by Tengku Abdullah Musa as a member of GAM. Moreover, Hasan Tiro, who controls GAM from Sweden, needs Acehnese youth to be trained in military education and sent to Libya. Ishak Daud was part of a group of 40 Acehnese youth who were sent to Libya. After returning from Libya, he stopped in Singapore for 12 days.\nIshak Daud decided to return to Aceh via the Port of Tanjung Balai. From there he took a bus and returned to his hometown of Idi Rayeuk. Initially he worked as a fish trader and secretly recruited young people to become involved in GAM. Ishak was one of the first figures to raise the Aceh Merdeka flag at Idi Rayeuk High School, East Aceh on December 4, 1989, after Hasan Tiro raised the flag on Mount Halimun, Pidie on December 4, 1976.\nDied\nOn May 20, 1990, Ishak Daud attacked an ABRI post in Buloh Blang Ara, North Aceh. In the attack, two soldiers and a junior high school student died. Ishak Daud's group also succeeded in taking 22 M-16 weapons and Minimi weapons. For his actions, Ishak Daud was sentenced to 20 years in prison by the Lhokseumawe District Court. The trial was held in Sabang because in several previous trials, Ishak Daud was always hailed by his sympathizers. At that time, Ishak was said to be the Head of the Free Aceh Information Bureau. However, Ishak Daud only served two years, because during the leadership of President Abdurrahman Wahid, on May 21, 2000, Ishak Daud was released. Ishak decided to re-join GAM, his final position being GAM Commander in the Peureulak-Teumieng Region. Ishak died in an ambush by the TNI at the end of 2004.\n",

    "CSL-TV was the callsign of a television station operated by the American Forces Network in the Lajes Field in the Azores. The station was the first regular television station under the aegis of the AFRTS, being founded in 1954. It last operated in 2011, by then acting as a relayer of AFN Prime Atlantic.\nHistory\nUp until 1954, the US Armed Forces exclusively provided radio broadcasts. Plans to introduce a television station were proposed to Gen. Curtis E. LeMay to boost morale for servicemen in US Air Force bases.\nTo this end, AFRS was renamed AFRTS on April 21, 1954.:\u200a81\u200a CSL-TV became the first television station set up by them, and started broadcasting on October 17, 1954, after receiving a permit from the Portuguese Government.:\u200a81\u200a The station was the first television station of any kind in Portugal (two and a half years before RTP started regular broadcasts) and the Azores (nearly 21 years before the start of RTP A\u00e7ores). Until its launch, Portuguese people had never seen television before. In theory, it was the second AFN station overall (after the first experiment at Loring Air Base in December 1953), in practice, it was the first in a series of stations catering overseas bases. Lajes was selected as a \"proving ground\" for television broadcasts due to its relative isolation. The government dictated that television sets were limited to U.S. and Portuguese military personnel, as there was no Portuguese TV available locally in the area. Television receivers were heavily controlled and were registered like firearms. Equipment was provided by the DAGE company on the cheap, which was inadequate for broadcasting.\nThe station broadcast on VHF channel 8 using a low-power transmitter and an ERP of 30 watts (50 watts in some sources). Following the Limestone Air Base 20-watt experiment, it was determined that all AFRTS television stations would operate on low-powered transmitters. CSL's transmitter signal covered a radius of 3.5 miles from the transmitter to the shore line. The station broadcast seven hours a day on average.\nCSL-TV moved to new facilities in mid-1958 on a hilltop overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and the base. The station also started using kinescopes while other stations in the AFRTS circuit were starting to air videotaped content.\nAs of 1964, the station was operating daily from 6pm to midnight. It also produced a live evening newscast with pictures sourced from newspapers and magazines rather than film. At the time, it was one of the seven stations in the USAFE tri-continental network. Programming was received in tapes from the United States until the entrance of the station to the AFRTS SATNET system. The station had two newscasts, a half-hour bulletin at 6pm with news coming from the United States, as well as sports and a local weather forecast; but news about the Azores and Portugal were few to none. One of the few cases where CSL-TV did cover a local event was during an earthquake that almost destroyed the island in 1980.

    "Genus of mammals\nIndodelphis is an extinct genus of opossum-like metatherian from Eocene of Cambay Shale Formation of India. The type and the only species is Indodelphis luoi.\nIndodelphis is the only known metatherian from Insular India (another, Jaegeria, has had its metatherian status questioned). It is known from the well-preserved lower molars of two individuals. This species probably represents the oldest known record of Cenozoic metatherians from Asia, and it occurs in association with a diverse land mammal fauna comprising perissodactyls, artiodactyls, insectivores, laurasiatherians, apatotherians, bats, rodents, and several other taxa currently under study.\nIt was initially assigned to the Peradectidae, but more likely belongs to the Herpetotheriidae. It may possibly be a junior synonym of Asiadidelphis from the Paleogene of Pakistan and Kazakhstan, which is known only from upper molars. It is unknown whether Indodelphis descended from a metatherian that colonized Insular India from Asia, or if it was a relict of India's original Gondwanan mammalian fauna.\n",

According to Mohammad Hanifnejad, \"the killing of people who were empty-handed showed that I can no longer continue fighting with the old methods.\" In addition to the struggle, they studied Islam and Western schools and the struggles of the people of Iran and the rest of the world, and reached armed struggle and founded the organization.\nHanifnejad and the early members of the People's Mojahedin Khalq Organization have done a lot of work in examining new answers to old and new issues from the heart of Islam, and in this way achieving a new and coherent reading of Islam and compiling and presenting it. They were trying To find a way to fight with the new era from the heart of Shia history.

    "Road in Kenya\nThe A7 road is a road in Kenya that spans 923 kilometers. It connects the Ugandan border to the port city of Mombasa, passing through Eldoret and Nairobi. The road is one of the main transportation routes in Kenya, providing an east\u2013west connection. It also serves as a route for international traffic to and from Uganda.\nRoute\nThe Highlands\nThe A8 highway begins at the Malaba border crossing with Uganda. From there, it extends eastward across the Kenyan highlands at an elevation over 1,100 meters above sea level. The road is paved and gradually increases in elevation to over 2,000 meters above sea level near Eldoret. The route passes through a rural area with a moderate population density and no large towns. There is a short section near Webuye where the A8 shares its route with the A1 highway.\nIn the vicinity of Eldoret, a highway-style bypass circumvents the town to the west and south, while the original route passes through the center. From Eldoret, the A8 proceeds in a southerly direction, gaining elevation to reach its highest point of approximately 2,800 meters above sea level, roughly midway between Eldoret and Nakuru. This section traverses a plateau, forming a transitional zone between the Rift Valley's vast expanse. Notably, the equator crosses the route at this point. Near Moli, a grade-separated interchange connects to the A12 highway. The A8 then enters Nakuru, a town situated at 1,800 meters above sea level, featuring a 2x2 lane passage and a viaduct with 2x3 lanes. As the route continues south, the terrain becomes more undulating, with moderate elevation changes. The A4 converges at Gilgil. North of Nairobi, the road ascends to higher ground, reaching an elevation of approximately 2,700 meters, followed by a steady descent towards Nairobi.\nNairobi Region\nFrom Limuru, the A8 highway features dual 2x2 lanes and begins its descent into the Nairobi metropolitan area, a vast urban expanse situated at approximately 1,700 meters above sea level. To facilitate through traffic, the Nairobi Southern Bypass offers an alternative route around the city, while the Nairobi Expressway, a toll road elevated on viaducts, provides a central passage. Notably, the A8 shares dual designation with the A2 within Nairobi. South of the city center, the A8 continues as a dual-lane road, providing access to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. In Athi River, the A2 diverges southward, while the A8 proceeds with a subsequent stretch featuring dual 2x2 lanes.\nSoutheastern Kenya\nBeyond the Nairobi region, the A8 traverses a more sparsely populated and arid area, characterized by a prolonged stretch of dry savannah en route to the coastal city of Mombasa. The road narrows to a single-lane paved thoroughfare, gradually descending to sea level. The terrain transitions to a flatter landscape, punctuated by occasional low-lying hills. The route alternates between lengthy straight sections and more winding passages. At Emali, the A5 branches off towards Himo, Tanzania, while at Voi, the A6 diverges towards the same destination. Approximately 100 kilometers west of Mombasa, the dry savannah gives way to a more humid, tropical lowland. The A8 eventually reaches Mombasa, a major port city, where it merges with city roads leading to the central business district. Alternatively, the Dongo Kundu Bypass Highway offers a branch route to the port of Mombasa. The A8 terminates in the old town of Mombasa, converging with the A7 highway.\nHistory\nColonial period\nDuring the British colonial era, significant investments were made in Kenya's infrastructure. In 1890, construction began on the Mackinnon-Sclater road, a dirt track suitable for oxcarts, connecting Mombasa to Busia on the Ugandan border. This early road followed the present-day A8 and A12 routes through western Kenya. However, its importance was soon eclipsed by the completion of the Uganda Railway in 1901, a rail line linking Mombasa to Kisumu on Lake Victoria. This railway created a vital connection between the Indian Ocean port city of Mombasa and Kisumu, later extended to Uganda, eliminating the need for lake crossings. The Kenyan highlands, a productive agricultural region with high population density and significant coffee and tea production, were already relatively developed during the colonial period. As a result, a network of paved roads was established in this area, setting it apart from other parts of East Africa.\nIndependent Kenya\nUpon gaining independence, Kenya inherited a relatively well-developed road network from British colonial rule, surpassing many other former colonies. The A8 route was the most advanced road in Kenya at the time, with the Busia border crossing initially serving as the primary entry point between Kenya and Uganda. However, the Malaba border crossing later gained prominence. During the 1980s and 1990s, the A8 remained Kenya's primary paved road. In Nairobi, the capital city, the road is remarkably well-developed by African standards,",

    "Military engineer (1704\u20131773)\nPortrait of Jacob von Eggers by Jacob Wessel\u00a0\nJacob von Eggers (before 1772 Jacob Eggers; 14 December 1704 \u2013 12 January 1773) was a military engineer and Swedish friherre (baron). He was born in a German-speaking family in present-day Tartu, then known as Dorpat, in Russian-occupied Swedish Livonia, during the Great Northern War. Around the age of four he was deported together with his mother to Russia, where in 1713 she remarried a Swedish baron. After the war, the family moved to Sweden where Jacob pursued studies in fortification. He became an officer in the Swedish military in 1729. Following his stepfather's death in 1733, he sought opportunities to further his career abroad as well as in Sweden. In 1734 he accompanied the troops of Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski during the War of the Polish Succession and participated in the siege of Danzig (modern-day Gda\u0144sk). He then spent some time as a volunteer in imperial, Saxon and French service, as well as making study trips around Europe. From 1737 he formed a more lasting link with the Electorate of Saxony, and was formally employed both by the Swedish and Saxon militaries until 1758.\nHe participated in several campaigns during these years, and wrote an appreciated account of the French siege and capture of Bergen op Zoom in 1747. He went on to further edit and expand a French military dictionary, and provide an influential and expanded German translation of the same work. He was furthermore entrusted with the military education of the Saxon princes Charles and Xavier. He was promoted in both Swedish and Saxon service, ending the latter with the rank of major general in 1757. In Sweden, he was elevated to the rank of friherre or baron, awarded the Order of the Sword and elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1757 he however left both Swedish and Saxon service and settled in Gda\u0144sk, where he would spend the rest of his life as commander of the city's fortifications. He kept in contact with the Swedish academy, and donated his extensive library to it. He died in 1773.\nBiography\nEarly life\nJacob von Eggers was born in present-day Tartu, then known as Dorpat, in the middle of the Great Northern War. The city was then part of Swedish Livonia, but just a few months before his birth the city had surrendered, after a long siege, to Russian troops and thus came under Russian occupation. He came from a Baltic German family; his father was a baker originally from Holstein, and was killed in an armed robbery before the birth of Jacob. His mother, n\u00e9e Sophia Margaretha Kr\u00fcger, was the daughter an alderman in the guild of bakers in Tartu. Around the age of four Jacob and his mother, together with the entire German-speaking population of Tartu, were deported to Arkhangelsk. He attended a school set up for deported Swedish citizens in Archangelsk by pietist Swedish officers. Subsequently, Jacob and his mother was moved between different localities in Russia. While in Veliky Ustyug n 1713, his mother remarried a Swedish officer in Russian captivity, friherre (baron) Captain Knut Gustaf Sparre\u00a0, who thus became Jacob's stepfather. Jacob could pursue further studies among the captive Swedish officers in Veliky Ustyug, who taught him Latin, French, Italian, mathematics and music, though he would later describe his studies in these subjects as haphazard. He also learnt Russian in captivity,\nJacob's stepfather Knut Gustaf Sparre\u00a0. Portrait by Johan Henrik Scheffel.\nFollowing the Peace of Nystad in 1721, Jacob followed his mother and stepfather to Sweden, where Jacob soon began studies in fortification. He spent a few years in the Royal Swedish Regiment in France, in order to widen his knowledge abroad, and made a study trip to the Dutch Republic to see the fortifications of Menno van Coehoorn. After his return to Sweden in 1729 he became an officer in the Swedish military, in the predecessor of today's Swedish Fortifications Agency, and worked at the construction of the fortification of Fredriksborgs f\u00e4stning\u00a0 outside Stockholm.\nAn itinerant career\nJacob von Eggers' stepfather died in 1733, and in 1734 Jacob left Sweden and enrolled with the troops of Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski, who was attempting to regain the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the ensuing War of the Polish Succession, Jacob was Eggers fought on the side of Leszczy\u0144ski, was promoted to the rank of captain, and participated in the siege of Danzig (modern-day Gda\u0144sk). Following the failed campaign, he was commissioned by the King Frederick I of Sweden, who was equally Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, to inspect and improve the fortifications of Rheinfels Castle. He then spent two years accompanying the Swedish Count Adam Horn af Ekebyholm\u00a0 on travels to Vienna and Venice, after which he in 1737 spent time as a volunteer in imperial service, fighting in Hungary and Serbia during the Austrian campaign against the Ottoman Empire with field marshal Friedrich Heinrich v",

    "American restauranteur (1948\u20132024)\nGlen Yoshiaki Gondo (1948 \u2013 July 1, 2024) was an American businessman, restauranteur, and cultural advocate. Gondo, whose parents opened the first Japanese restaurant and sushi bar in Houston, Texas, is credited with popularizing Japanese cuisine and culture in the city. In 1993, Gondo founded the Japan Festival of Houston, a free annual event which showcases Japanese culture. The Japan Festival is now one of the largest Japanese cultural festivals in the United States.\nGondo transitioned to catering in the 1990s. His family-owned company, Tokyo Gardens Catering, supplies Sushiya brand sushi to H-E-B, a supermarket and now operates sushi kiosks in more than 290 supermarkets across Texas.\nBiography\nEarly life\nGondo was born in 1948 in Los Angeles, California, to Japanese-immigrant parents, Eugene and Hisako Gondo. His parents had been forcibly relocated and imprisoned during the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Shortly after his birth, the Gondo family moved to Watsonville, California, where he was raised as a child. He then moved with his parents to Dallas, Texas, where they opened a Japanese restaurant.\nThe family moved again, this time to Houston in 1962. In 1966, his parents opened Tokyo Gardens restaurant, located at 4701 Westheimer Road, the first Japanese restaurant and sushi bar in Houston. The family-owned restaurant also introduced aspects of Japanese culture which were new to the city. Tokyo Gardens incorporated elements of Japanese architecture, cultural performances and a koi pond into the space.\nGlen Gondo married his wife, Kathleen, in 1973.\nCareer\nHe began catering his own events and parties separate from his parents' business. By 1975, Gondo owned small sushi bars inside eight Fiesta Mart locations. Fiesta Mart, a regional supermarket chain, later discontinued Gondo's sushi bars. Glen and Kathy Gondo then moved to California, where he worked in the frozen food industry. Following two years in California, they moved to New York City, where Gondo joined his family's jewelry business.\nIn 1984, Gondo and his family moved permanently from New York City to Houston and adopted the city as his hometown. He also took over the family restaurant from his parents beginning in 1984. Gondo owned and operated the restaurant for 14 years until its closure in 1998.\nHe then transitioned the family business into catering, renaming it Tokyo Gardens Catering, short for Tokyo Gardens Catering and Sushic, LLC. Gondo provided catering for universities regionally, as well as Continental Airlines, which was headquartered in Houston and offered flights to Japan. In 2002, Gondo's Tokyo Gardens Catering began supplying sushi to the H-E-B supermarket chain under the \"Sushiya\" brand name at the invitation of then H-E-B president, Martin Otto. Gondo's first Sushiya sushi bar opened at the H-E-B location in Friendswood, Texas. His company's Sushiya sushi kiosks now operate in more than 290 H-E-B supermarkets across Texas, as of 2024. (His son, Robert Gondo, now heads the family's catering business after his father's retirement.) Gondo also started an international trade consulting business and opened several stores at George Bush Intercontinental Airport.\nGondo has been credited with pioneering Japanese culture in Houston as a longtime community leader in the city's Japanese and Japanese American community. In 1987, Gondo was elected to the board of directors of the Japan America Society of Houston (JASH) and joined the organization's membership committee beginning in 1988. He then served as vice president for Special Events at JASH from 1989 until 1992, when he was appointed President of the Japan America Society of Houston. He served as president from 1992 to 1999. In 1999, Gondo became JASH's Vice President of Business Initiatives and then the co-chair of its advisory committee. He organizaed a Mayor's Challenge baseball game between Houston and its Japanese sister city, Chiba City, to mark the 2000 Millennium Matsuri. Gondo was re-elected as President of the Japan America Society of Houston in 2005. He served his second term as JASH president from 2006 until 2010, when he retired from the JASH leadership. However, he remained active with JASH for the rest of his life. Gondo also served on the boards of other organizations, including the Texas Asia Society.\nGondo's election as President of the Japan America Society of Houston in 1992 coincided with JASH's 25th silver anniversary. At the time, Houston had just completed the Japanese Garden in Hermann Park in 1992. Glen Gondo conceived the idea of holding a Japan Festival in Hermann Park as a way to showcase the new Japanese Garden to the community. Gondo pitched the idea to Houston Mayor Bob Lanier and the city government, who allowed the Japan Festival to utilize Hermann Park. The first Japan Festival of Houston, which was founded by Glen Gondo through his work as JASH president, was held in the park in 1993. The fr",

His vice-president, civilian Luis Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez, was designated provisional president and sworn in the following day. Gonz\u00e1lez's goal as interim president and first presidential designate was to call elections within 4 months.\nThe presidential elections were called on October 20, which gave victory to the civilian Miguel Ortiz Passareli against the military Miguel Yd\u00edgoras Fuentes. General Yd\u00edgoras denounced the results as electoral fraud. Protests and riots by Yd\u00edgoras supporters broke out across the country.

He received his education at the Academy of Li\u00e8ge. Recognizing his son's potential, his retired father decided to relocate the family to Brussels to further Adolphe's studies. Adolphe became a student of Jan Frans Portaels at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels. He made his debut as a painter at the Brussels Salon in 1893, where he won the Godecharle Prize for his drawing \"Wandering Souls.\" Adolphe eventually settled in Uccle.\nStarting in 1897, Adolphe Wansart worked in the studio of Charles Van der Stappen at the Brussels Academy, where he increasingly focused on sculpture while continuing to draw and paint. He created busts, memorials, funerary monuments, medals, and reliefs. Henri Kerels' monograph on Wansart lists a total of 85 works: 68 monuments, compositions, and portraits, 13 medals, and 4 pieces of copperware. Wansart also sculpted several pieces featuring his wife, the artist Lucie Desmet (1873\u20131943), whom he met at the Brussels Academy. One notable work, a bust of Lucie exhibited in 1925 at the Ghent Triennial Exhibition, was praised by art critic Leo Van Puyvelde. He described Wansart as an artist \"whose strong Portrait of his Wife is a magnificent example of the modern feeling for volume with solid surfaces and large lines, without too great a deviation from nature or too strict an attachment to reality.\" In 1927, Wansart moved with his wife and son, Eric, to Rueil-Malmaison, near Paris, while maintaining his studio in Uccle. He primarily designed in France but produced his works in Belgium.\nHis largest works were created for the city of Li\u00e8ge. The most notable is the 24-meter-long relief titled \"Li\u00e8ge, Arts et Sciences,\" which adorns the entrance to the Palais des F\u00eates, constructed for an international exhibition on water technology in 1939. This work is an allegorical representation of Li\u00e8ge, highlighting its industrial and cultural heritage. Another significant piece is a six-meter-high statue of a knight with a shield and sword (1948\u201350), carved from blue stone. This knight symbolizes the Burgundian Netherlands, one of the four historical periods depicted on either side of the Pont des Arches in Li\u00e8ge. Wansart passed away at the age of 80, and an avenue in Uccle was named in his honor.\nFootnotes\n",

The mountain is a laccolith composed of Cambrian limestone, breccia, and Eocene dacite porphyry. Gold was discovered on Henderson Mountain in 1888. In the mid-1990s, Henderson Mountain was the epicenter of legal fighting over plans to mine a billion dollars' worth of gold and silver from the mountain which would threaten nearby Yellowstone National Park. The environmental controversy ended when the US government bought out the mining claim. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names, and has been featured in publications since at least 1893. Bart Henderson was one of the four trappers who discovered the New World Mining District in 1869, with the others being Adam Miller, J. H. Moore, and James Gourley. (Miller Mountain is 1.61 miles (2.59\u00a0km) west-southwest of Henderson Mountain).\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Henderson Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F.\nSee also\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains",

    "Itinerant book trade in China\nBook boats (Chinese: \u66f8\u8239; pinyin: sh\u016bchu\u00e1n) were small merchant ships used by itinerant booksellers in China during the Ming and Qing dynasties.\nHistory\nAlthough the practice of itinerant merchants travelling along rivers and canals to sell books may have originated as early as the Song Dynasty, book boats' ubiquity to the Chinese book trade arose during the Ming Dynasty in response to expansions and repairs to waterway infrastructure.\nThe Grand Canal was a vital waterway utilized by book boats to bring books to the capital at Beijing.\nThe Jiangnan region along the lower Yangtze saw widespread infrastructure improvements during the Ming dynasty. The complex network of rivers, lakes, and canals in the region was maintained and expanded by the Ming state, allowing passenger and merchant vessels to travel between towns and cities across eastern China. The city of Huzhou, in Zhejiang, became a major center for book publishing and printing, so associated with the itinerant booksellers that book boat merchants were often referred to as \"merchants of Huzhou\" even when coming from other regions.\nThe Grand Canal was reopened under the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r.\u20091402\u20131424) in order to supply the newly establish capital city of Beijing. In addition to the flow of grain to the capital, massive numbers of books were shipped from Jiangnan via the canal. During the High Qing era, Beijing saw heavy demand for books, met mainly by book boats plying the canals from Jiangnan. This was intensified during large editing projects such as the compilation of the Siku Quanshu under the Qianlong Emperor. Although mainly bringing rare books to sell to scholars and bureaucrats, the book boats also brought more popular works, especially including law books. Floods and blockages along the Grand Canal in 1824 led to the disruption of this trade, and saw publishers move operations to Beijing in order to meet demand for legal texts.\nRiver and canal infrastructure declined as a means of transport in China over the course of the 19th century. Especially following the 1850\u20131864 Taiping Rebellion, itinerant book peddlers were sidelined in a reorganized book trade.\nBusiness practices\nBookstores were rare during the High Qing, often only found in market towns and major cities. As such, book boats were common in rural areas and smaller towns along river routes. Some peddlers specialized in rarer books for scholars and officials, while others sold for vernacular consumption across the Jiangnan.\nSongjiang, Hangzhou, and Dantu were major hubs for book trading and frequented by book boat traders.\n",
    "Road in Kenya\nThe A9 road is a road in Kenya spanning a total distance of 398 kilometers. It traverses the central region of the country in a north\u2013south direction, connecting the towns of Subuiga, Meru, and Embu, before terminating in Kibwezi. The road plays a role in facilitating the movement of people and goods within the region.\nRoute\nThe A9 trunk road originates in Subuiga, intersecting with the A2 highway on the northern slope of Mount Kenya, Africa's second-highest peak at 5,199 meters. From there, the A9 traverses the eastern flank of the mountain, navigating through a densely populated region known for its fertile soil. The road winds its way through the contours of the mountain's slopes, passing through varied elevations: approximately 2,000 meters in the north, and 1,300-1,500 meters in the eastern and southern sections. South of Mount Kenya lies the town of Embu, a significant urban center along the route. The A9 continues southward, entering a drier savannah region at an elevation of around 1,000 meters. The road crosses the Kamburu Dam and remains paved throughout this section. A brief overlap with the A3 highway occurs before the A9 resumes its southern trajectory, traversing a more sparsely populated area characterized by flat terrain, dry savannah, and occasional low ridges. The road gradually descends to approximately 700 meters above sea level before terminating in Kibwezi, where it meets the A8 highway.\nHistory\nThe northern section of the A9 route traverses densely populated areas surrounding Mount Kenya and the highlands further south, which have been paved for an extended period. Notably, the construction of the Kamburu Dam, spanning the A9 motorway, took place between 1971 and 1974. In contrast, the southern portion of the route was paved later, with initial efforts focusing on the segment between the A3 highway and Kitui, which was fully completed in the mid-2000s. The 192-kilometer stretch south of Kitui remained unpaved for a longer duration, with paving commencing around 2017 and substantially concluding in 2021. The A9 is strategically positioned as a bypass for through traffic between Ethiopia and the port city of Mombasa, diverting traffic away from Nairobi. The paving of this route was financed by China, underscoring the importance of this transportation artery in regional connectivity.\nRoad number history\nHistorically, the road was categorized as a lower-class route, designated as B6 in the northern section spanning from Mount Kenya to Embu, and B7 in the southern section from Embu to Kibwezi. In 2016, these sections were unified and reclassified as the A9, elevating the road's status and reflecting its growing importance in the regional transportation network. This reclassification acknowledged the route's expanded capacity and connectivity, solidifying its role as a vital transportation artery.\n",

    "H\u00ebna (Albanian indefinite form H\u00ebn\u00eb; Gheg: Hana, indef. Han\u00eb), the Moon, holds a prominent position in Albanian pagan customs, beliefs, rituals, myths, and legends. In Albanian traditions the Moon's cyclical phases have regulated many aspects of life, defining agricultural and livestock activities, various crafts, and human body.\nAlbanians were firstly described in written sources as worshippers of the Sun and the Moon by German humanist Sebastian Franck in 1534, but the Sun and the Moon have been preserved as sacred elements of Albanian tradition since antiquity. The symbolization of the crescent Moon, often combined with the Sun, is commonly found in a variety of contexts of Albanian folk art, including traditional tattooing, grave art, jewellery and house carvings.\nIn Albanian pagan beliefs and mythology the Moon is a personified female deity, and the Sun (Dielli) is her male counterpart. In some folk tales, myths and legends the Moon and the Sun are regarded as wife and husband, also notably appearing as the parents of E Bija e H\u00ebn\u00ebs dhe e Diellit (\"the Daughter of the Moon and the Sun\"); in others the Sun and the Moon are regarded as brother and sister, but in this case they are never considered consorts. In Old Albanian the name Hana/Han\u00eb was attested also as a theonym \u2013 the Albanian rendering of Roman goddess Diana.\nAlbanian beliefs, myths and legends are organized around the dualistic struggle between good and evil, light and darkness, which cyclically produces the cosmic renewal. The most famous representation of it is the constant battle between drangue and kulshedra, which is seen as a mythological extension of the cult of the Sun and the Moon. In Albanian traditions, kulshedra is also fought by the Daughter of the Moon and the Sun, who uses her light power against pride and evil, or by other heroic characters marked in their bodies by the symbols of celestial objects, including in particular the Moon. Among Albanians the dualism between black/darkness and white/light is also remarkably represented by the Moon's phases, which symbolize both fertility (increase) and sterility (decrease).\nName\nThe Albanian word h\u00ebn\u00eb (definite form: h\u00ebna; Gheg: han\u00eb, def. hana) is generally considered to be from the Late Indo-European *skond-nah\u2082 \"the shiny one\".\nAs an Albanian theonym, Hana/Han\u00eb is recorded as early as 1685, in the Cuneus Prophetarum (\"The Band of the Prophets\") by the Old Albanian writer Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani, as the Albanian rendering of Roman goddess Diana.\nHistory\nHuman's imagination has always been stimulated by the light of the Moon that pushes away the darkness of the night, as well as by the Moon's occult influence on the movement of the waters and on the life of plants and animals, giving rise to countless and suggestive myths, symbols, and legends across different cultures. Since ancient times the personified Moon has expressed maternity, and the celestial body has carried all these motifs in astrological symbolism.\nPrehistoric Illyrian symbols used on funeral monuments of the pre-Roman period have been used also in Roman times and continued into late antiquity in the broad Illyrian territory. The same motifs were kept with identical cultural-religious symbolism on various monuments of the early medieval culture of the Albanians. They appear also on later funerary monuments, including the medieval tombstones (ste\u0107ci) in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the burial monuments used until recently in northern Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, southern Serbia and northern North Macedonia. Such motifs are particularly related to the ancient cults of the Sun and Moon, survived until recently among northern Albanians.\nThe widespread deification of the Moon among Albanians is considered to have been related to the ancient worship of a local deity associated with agriculture and nature. Hana/Han\u00eb as a theonym is recorded by Bogdani as the Albanian rendering of Roman Diana. Of the Albanian mythological figures, Zana \u2013 usually associated with mountains, springs and streams, forests, vegetation and animals, human vital energy and sometimes destiny \u2013 is thought to have been originally a pre-Roman deity, and an Illyrian goddess equivalent of the Ancient Greek Artemis and Roman Diana. As such she would have been the personification of the Moon and the lady of the forests, protector of animals, guardian of springs and streams, protector of women, as well as distributor of sovereignty. Many statues and other items associated to this goddess have been found in the Shkodra region in northern Albania, maybe more than of any other goddess of the Illyrian pantheon. There is also an exceptional frequency of ancient inscriptions of the Roman era dedicated to the cult of Diana in Albania and the rest of the Balkans, which gives reason to think of an interpretatio romana of an indigenous pre-Roman goddess. Innumerable Albanian folk poems, myths and legends that are dedicated to Zana and her friends have been handed down to modern tim",

    "1989 professional wrestling video game\n1989 video game\nSgt. Slaughter's Mat Wars is a professional wrestling sports video game developed by Beam Software and published by Mindscape. It is based on the professional wrestler Sgt. Slaughter and was released on November 15, 1989, exclusively for the Commodore 64.\nGameplay\nThe game requires a Commodore 64 joystick to play and features a unique gameplay mechanic involving managers. Players can choose from five managers: Delores, Fast Ed, Big John, Abdul Makash, and Lucky. These managers play a crucial role in the game's trading system, allowing players to buy and trade wrestlers in Sgt. Slaughter's Auction House. The game also allows players to bet on matches and bribe other wrestlers to throw their matches.\nSgt. Slaughter does not appear as a playable character but he makes occasional appearances as a  commentator and referee during matches. The game includes multiple match types such as singles and tag team bouts, and features multiple game modes, including a narrative-driven story mode and an exhibition mode for quick matches.\nDevelopment\nNigel Spencer, the programmer behind the game shared insights into the game's development in an interview. Spencer highlighted the game's technical advancements, particularly the use of real-time scaling of high-resolution screens, a first for the C64.\nRelease\nSgt. Slaughter's Mat Wars was released on November 15, 1989, for the Commodore 64. The game was developed by Beam Software and published by Mindscape during the height of Sgt. Slaughter's popularity in the late 1980s.\nReception\nSgt. Slaughter\u2019s Mat Wars has received a mixed reception over the years. Critics and players appreciated the game's unique blend of wrestling and management simulation, which set it apart from other wrestling games of its era. The game's graphics were particularly praised, with many noting the impressive detail in the arenas and the diverse, albeit fictional, roster of wrestlers. The visual presentation was considered a high point, showcasing what the Commodore 64 could achieve.\nHowever, the game was not without its criticisms. Players described the in-ring action as simplistic and repetitive, which detracted from the overall experience. A common point of contention was the minimal involvement of Sgt. Slaughter in the game, which many fans found disappointing. This perceived underutilization of the popular wrestling figure led to some considering the game to be a missed opportunity.\nSee also\nList of professional wrestling video games",
    "Boxing match\nKen Norton vs. Larry Holmes was a professional boxing match contested on June 9, 1978, for the WBC heavyweight title.\nBackground\nMultiple-time heavyweight title challenger and number-one ranked contender Ken Norton earned his fourth world title shot after defeating the number-two ranked contender Jimmy Young by a close split decision in a 15-round \"eliminator\" bout on November 15, 1977. Though he was now mandated by the WBC to face Norton in his next defense, then-undisputed heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali had already agreed to face the winner of the Leon Spinks\u2013Alfio Righetti fight that was scheduled on November 18, 1977, only three days after Norton's victory over Young, which Spinks ultimately won. The WBC threatened to strip Ali of their heavyweight title should he go forth with his planned match against Spinks instead of facing Norton, but eventually relented, instead sanctioning the Ali\u2013Spinks fight as long as Ali, the expected winner, agreed to negotiate with Norton and then face him after his expected victory over Spinks. Two weeks after the WBC gave Ali that ultimatum, he officially agreed to a $12 million deal that would see him face Norton for what would be their second world title fight and fourth fight overall. However, these plans were cancelled when Ali shockingly lost to Spinks by split decision on February 15, 1978. Though Spinks was now obligated by the WBC to face Norton, he immediately pursued a rematch with Ali. Norton was given a lowball offer from Spinks' promoter Bob Arum of just $200,000 to accept a fight against Spinks. Though Norton stated he was \"insulted\" by the offer, he chose to accept it, effectively calling Arum and Spinks' bluff, who had hoped he would decline so they could pursue the lucrative rematch with Ali. A week after Norton accepted Spinks' offer, Spinks reneged and officially announced that he would make his first defense against Ali instead. One week after Spinks announced his intentions, WBC president Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n warned that Spinks would be stripped of their title if he did not agree to face Norton by midnight on March 18, 1978. When Spinks reaffirmed that he would still face Ali and not Norton, the WBC voted to strip Spinks of the title and immediately recognize Norton as their heavyweight champion.\nEven before the Spinks\u2013Ali rematch was made official, the WBC had sanctioned an eliminator bout between their number-three ranked contender Earnie Shavers and the number-four ranked contender Larry Holmes. As it was not known at the time who the winner would face, the fight's promoter Don King stated at the time that the winner would get a title shot \"one of these days.\" On March 25, 1978, Holmes defeated Shavers, sweeping every round on two of judge's scorecards and all but one on the third scorecard. With Spinks now out of the WBC's plans by this time, this officially made Holmes the first challenger to Norton's title. The Norton\u2013Holmes fight was somewhat overshadowed by the highly anticipated Spinks\u2013Ali rematch that was scheduled that September, with the New York Times calling the fight \"The Other Title Fight.\" As Norton had not won the title in the ring, he was derided as a \"paper champion\" by some in the media. Norton responded \"How do I feel about being called the paper champion? Well, when you get down to it, it's all on paper anyhow. I said that if I ever became champion I would fight all comers and Larry Holmes is next up. I feel that Holmes is a better fighter than Leon Spinks.\" While Holmes chimed in \"A lot of people ask me about fighting the paper champion, too, but right now Ken Norton is the champion and you have to respect him for that.\"\nNorton entered the fight as a slight 6\u20135 favorite. Holmes, six years Norton's junior, disputed this telling the press \"Norton is too old. I will outbox him. I'm not a devastating puncher, but the fight will not go 15 rounds.\" The fight was broadcast live in the United States by ABC, who estimated that some 40 million people would tune in to watch the fight.\nThe fight\nIn an extremely close fight that went the full 15 rounds, Holmes earned a razor-thin split decision victory as two judge's scored the fight in his favor 143\u2013142 while the third judge scored the fight the same in favor of Norton. Holmes got off to a quick start winning four of the first five rounds as he served as the aggressor while Norton took a more defense and tactical approach. As the sixth round began, Norton abandoned his defensive approach and began to dominate Holmes as he continuously advanced forward and landed punches on Holmes often, winning five of the next six rounds after his slow start whilst also opening a cut inside Holmes lip in the eight. With both fighters starting to tire, Holmes got back on track taking both the 12th and 13th rounds, staggering Norton twice in the latter. Norton then took the penultimate 14th round, staggering Holmes twice and landing a six punch combination just before the round ended. The two fight",

    "Return on Time Invested (ROTI) is a metric employed to assess the productivity and efficiency of time spent on a specific activity, project, or product. The concept is similar to return on investment (ROI), but instead of financial capital, ROTI measures the qualitative and quantitative outcomes derived from the time invested. The metric is relevant in contexts where time is a significant resource, including product management, personal productivity, business process optimization, and education or training evaluation.\nThe Moneylender and his Wife by Quentin Matsys (1514)\nCalculation\nWhile the specific calculation of ROTI can vary depending on the context, a general formula can be expressed as: ROTI = Total\u00a0value\u00a0or\u00a0Output\u00a0obtained / Total\u00a0time\u00a0invested.\nAfter a meeting\nSome organizations use the ROTI method to evaluate meetings.\nAreas\nProject management\nROTI is a metric used in product management to evaluate the efficiency of time allocation across various tasks and development phases. Product managers employ ROTI calculations to identify areas where time is being used effectively and those that may require optimization. This approach aids in resource allocation and productivity improvement efforts.\nPersonal productivity\nIndividuals use ROTI to enhance personal productivity by evaluating how their time is spent on different activities. This helps in prioritizing tasks that offer higher returns on time invested and minimizing time spent on low-value activities. Media outlets like Inc. frequently offer tips on maximizing personal productivity, often referencing the principles behind ROTI.\nBusiness process optimization\nOrganizations leverage ROTI to improve overall efficiency by analyzing how employee time contributes to business goals. By understanding the ROTI of different processes and functions, organizations can streamline operations and allocate resources more effectively. Reports in Harvard Business Review have highlighted case studies where businesses improved their efficiency through better time management and ROTI assessments.\nSee also\nAgile software development\nCost\u2013benefit analysis\nFeedback\nMeeting science\nOpportunity cost\nPareto principle\nPersonal development\nTime-use research\nTime value of money\nFurther reading\nTracy, Brian (2007).

    "Species of fungus\nExidia subsaccharina is a species of fungus in the family Auriculariaceae. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are gelatinous, reddish brown, button-shaped at first then often coalescing and becoming irregularly effused. It grows on dead branches of pine and is currently known only from France and England. Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has shown that the species is distinct.\nDescription\nExidia subsaccharina forms reddish to vinaceous brown, gelatinous fruit bodies that are button-shaped at first, typically coalescing with age and becoming irregularly effused, around 10\u00a0cm (4\u00a0in) across. The upper, spore-bearing surface is smooth to weakly papillate. The spore print is white.\nMicroscopic characters\nThe microscopic characters are typical of the genus Exidia. The basidia are ellipsoid and septate. The spores are weakly to distinctly allantoid (sausage-shaped), 12.5 to 17.5 by 4 to 5.5\u00a0\u03bcm.\nSimilar species\nFruit bodies of Exidia saccharina also occur on conifers and are not distinguishable in the field, but have smaller basidia and spores (10 to 14 by 3 to 4.5\u00a0\u03bcm).\nHabitat and distribution\nExidia subsaccharina is currently only known from the type collections made on dead trees of Pinus sylvestris in France and a single collection, also on pine, from England.\n",

    "United States historic place\nThe Austin Pass Warming Hut was constructed in 1940 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The Washington Junior Company 2915, was based at Camp F-12 near Glacier. Other contributions include 43 miles (69\u00a0km) of truck roads, the Glacier Ranger Station, four lookouts and 100 miles (160\u00a0km) of trail. The Austin Pass Warming Hut represents the Region 6 rustic style. The building is a fine example of CCC work. It's Region 6 rustic style includes: irregular plan, roof and porch projections, intersecting gables, dormers, multi-paned windows, and variations in exterior texture. The use of native wood and stone are a fine example. The columnar andesite veneer in the first floor walls is a figurative link to the rock on which it stands. The use of vertical siding moves the eye to the roof peak, linking the building to the surrounding peaks. Non-contributing structures include the radio mast, flagpole, propane tanks and septic tank.\nAppearance\nThe Warming Hut is a two and one-half story masonry and wood-frame building located in a subalpine habitat at 4,440 feet (1,350\u00a0m).  The area is surrounded by scattered mountain hemlock and Pacific silver fir. The building is rest atop a knob of columnar andesite, with a sharp drop into the Bagley Lakes basins. A parking lot for about 16 cars is located just to the south.  When originally constructed, the Warming Hut had a T plan, facing the northwest. The steeply-pitched, cross-gabled roof is covered with cedar shakes. The roof and a gabled dormer extend beyond the front to create a wide porch. The porch has a flagstone floor with the main entrance in the center. The second entrance is on the southeast elevation. A third entrance, now the primary (2024) is located on the second-story porch in the south angle. Windows are surrounded by quarter-pole trim. The chimney is made of courses of columnar andesite. The first-floor walls are concrete with an exterior masonry veneer of coursed, rough-cut columnar andesite. The second floor and gables are covered with horizontal ten-inch clapboard siding. In the southeast gable and the northwest dormer the boards are placed vertically.  A chevron pattern is used below the dormer windows.\nThe Warming Hut was constructed as a ski shelter, supporting the development by the Mt. Baker Development Company. The interior included a large warming room, waxing and drying room, and sleeping loft. It also contained either a lunch room or kitchen at different times. The warming room was finished with knotty pine paneling.  The large massive fireplace is made from rough-cut columnar andesite.\nThe Warming Hut was not functional. Heavy snowfall made it difficult to maintain supplies, which had to be skied in. During the Second World War, the State highway department discontinued plowing of the road. After the war, difficulties delayed the return of a ski area until the late 1950s.\nIn 1972, the University of Washington used the Warming Hut as a field station. The first floor was modified with the removal of rest rooms partitions to accommodate electric generation equipment. The second floor saw the main room divided into four bedrooms, a toilet, and a living area. The food service area was remodeled by installing a drop ceiling, removal of the knotty pine paneling, replacing both the ceiling and walls with drywall. The original andesite fireplace located in the living area remained intact.\nOn the exterior, modifications were less extensive. A single-story room with a flat roof was added to house a 2000-gallon diesel storage tank. The walls are concrete with a coursed andesite veneer. Clapboard was used on the upper part of the walls. A pair of 1,200 US gallons (4,500\u00a0L) propane tanks are 50 feet (15\u00a0m) south of the Warming Hut, and a concrete septic tank, is  located 50 feet (15\u00a0m)  feet north.  The Warming Hut was used as housing for Forest Service work crews. During the University of Washington or recent Forest Service occupation, a metal radio mast was added to the southeast elevation, and a flagpole placed in the south angle. In 2024, the building is the Heather Meadows Visitor Center.\nBibliography\nHeller, Ramon, 1980 Mount Baker Ski Area: A Pictorial History. Mt.

    "Website about potentially active volcanoes in Iceland\nThe Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes (CIV) is a web resource that was created to serve as an official source of information about potentially active volcanoes monitored by Iceland. The creation of the website followed the disruptive 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull and allows access to a database of recent eruptions and their details. The website's design was subsequently used in creating the website European Catalogue of Volcanoes that covers a larger area, and which has much, but not all the functionality of the Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes.\nCurrent Status\nThe website displays information on 32 Icelandic volcanic systems in English or Icelandic. It also provides information on the Beerenberg volcano.\nHistory\nVolcano observatory functionality in Iceland was prior to the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption partially joint funded by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) The initial June 2010 meeting of the International Volcanic Ash Task Force (IVATF), created by the ICAO after the eruption, had a working paper on improvement of volcanic monitoring and advice presented by the World Organization of Volcano Observatories that recommended increased support for the volcano observatories of the world.\nSeed funding originally came from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2010, for what was projected as a 3-year project to collate relevant knowledge and create a comprehensive catalogue readily available to decision makers, stakeholders and the general public. In September 2011 this project analysing and categorising volcanic activity in Iceland was noted to be beneficial for the larger long term risk assessment project funded by the Icelandic government. Later funding also came from the European Commission with the FUTUREVOLC project.\nBy 2012 the task mainly financed by the ICAO, to improve the knowledge and behaviour information in the then catalogue of Icelandic volcanoes supplemented by information about ash particle grain-size distribution was reported to be underway.\nPrepublication extracts of the new catalogue were being used by 2014.\nThe web site was showcased in April 2015 to praise and a beta version launched later that year with data on B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga, Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn, Hekla and Katla.\nThe website was launched formally internationally in 2016, and is official. The Global Volcanism Program website recognises it as an additional web resource.\nIn 2019 the Icelandic version of the website was launched.\nBy November 2020 the almost identically formatted Catalogue of European Volcanoes website went live, initially with information on active volcanoes or volcanic areas monitored by France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain as well as Iceland.\nIn 2024 the two websites were recognised in a peer-reviewed academic paper on tephra dispersion as important resources for modelling this. As of 2024, of the two similar websites, only the Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes has an additional data portal functionality.\nSee also\nVolcanoes portal",

Section 143 of that Act requires that motorists be insured against liability for injuries to others (including passengers) and for damage to other persons' property, resulting from use of a vehicle on a public road or in other public places.\nFormerly, an alternative to compulsory insurance existed, whereby an individual could make a specified deposit (\u00a3500,000 in 1991) and keep the sum deposited with the Accountant General of the Supreme Court. However, this option was abolished in 2019.\nIt is an offence to use a motor vehicle, or allow others to use it without insurance that satisfies the requirements of the Act. This requirement applies while any part of a vehicle (even if a greater part of it is on private land) is on the public highway. No such legislation applies on private land. However, private land to which the public have a reasonable right of access (for example, a supermarket car park during opening hours) is considered to be included within the requirements of the Act.\nPolice have the power to seize vehicles that do not appear to have necessary insurance in place. A driver caught driving without insurance for the vehicle he/she is in charge of for the purposes of driving, is liable to be prosecuted by the police and, upon conviction, will receive either a fixed penalty or magistrate's courts penalty.\nThe registration number of the vehicle shown on the insurance policy, along with other relevant information including the effective dates of cover are transmitted electronically to the UK's Motor Insurance Database (MID) which exists to help reduce incidents of uninsured driving in the territory. The Police are able to spot-check vehicles that pass within range of automated number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, that can search the MID instantly. Proof of insurance lies entirely with the issue of a Certificate of Motor Insurance, or cover note, by an Authorised Insurer which, to be valid, must have been previously 'delivered' to the insured person in accordance with the Act, and be printed in black ink on white paper.\nThe insurance certificate or cover note issued by the insurance company constitutes the only legal evidence that the policy to which the certificate relates satisfies the requirements of the relevant law applicable in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Island of Guernsey, the Island of Jersey and the Island of Alderney. The Act states that an authorised person, such as a police officer, may require a driver to produce an insurance certificate for inspection. If the driver cannot show the document immediately on request, and evidence of insurance cannot be found by other means such as the MID, then the Police are empowered to seize the vehicle instantly.\nThe immediate impounding of an apparently uninsured vehicle replaces the former method of dealing with insurance spot-checks where drivers were issued with an HORT/1 (so-called because the order was form number 1 issued by the Home Office Road Traffic dept). This 'ticket' was an order requiring that within seven days, from midnight of the date of issue, the driver concerned was to take a valid insurance certificate (and usually other driving documents as well) to a police station of the driver's choice. Failure to produce an insurance certificate was, and still is, an offence. The HORT/1 was commonly known \u2013 even by the issuing authorities when dealing with the public \u2013 as a \"Producer\". As these are seldom issued now and the MID relied upon to indicate the presence of insurance or not, it is incumbent upon the insurance industry to accurately and swiftly update the MID with current policy details and insurers that fail to do so can be penalised by their regulating body.\nVehicles kept in the UK must now be continuously insured unless a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) has been formally submitted. This requirement arose following a change in the law in June 2011 when a regulation known as Continuous Insurance Enforcement (CIE) came into force. The effect of this was that in the UK a vehicle that is not declared SORN, must have a valid insurance policy in force whether or not it is kept on public roads and whether or not it is driven.\nInsurer, and Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) / licence data, are shared by the relevant authorities including the police and this forms an integral part of the mechanism of CIE. All UK registered vehicles, including those that are exempt from VED (for example, Historic Vehicles and cars with low or zero emissions) are subject to the VED taxation application process. Part of this is a check on the vehicle's insurance. A physical receipt for the payment of VED was issued by way of a paper disc which, prior to 1 October 2014, m",

Dedicated to the Archangel Michael, it was built in the 9th or 10th century. The use of ancient spolia indicates that it was possibly built on the remains of an early Christian basilica. The church is a small three-aisled basilica, with a narthex and a dome, added after the original construction was finished. A few traces of its original fresco decoration show similarities with the art of Cappadocia, but are too fragmentary to draw any conclusions. The current fresco series dates from the renovation of the church in 1359/60, and represent a distinctive regional style evident in other churches in Kastoria, but also Ohrid.\nIn the 20th century, the remains of the Greek national hero of the Macedonian Struggle, Pavlos Melas, and his wife Natalia, were placed in a tomb inside the church.\n",

The larvae grow longer than 2\u00a0cm and are the largest caddisflies in the region. In the Primorsky Krai, they constitute 77% of all the trichopteran biomass and 35% of all riverine benthic biomass. The larvae live amid mussels which they use to anchor their filter nets in the Primorsky region. In Japan they are used for monitoring pollutants.\nThe family Stenopsychidae has three genera Stenopsyche McLachlan, 1866, Pseudostenopsyche D\u00f6hler, 1915, and Stenopsychodes Ulmer, 1916 and they are among the largest of net-spinning caddisflies growing to nearly 5\u00a0cm.

In 1885, Lowthian Bell commissioned Robert James Johnson to rebuild the church. He retained only parts of the north wall, including a lancet window and doorway, and perhaps the east end of the building. Two stained glass windows were later designed by Douglas Strachan. The east window is the more conventional. The north window is a memorial to Gertrude Bell and depicts scenes relating to her life: a monk, Magdalen College, the Matterhorn, a woman in Arabic dress, the Al-Kazimiyya Mosque, and a camel train, along with Arabic text taken from a poem by Hafez. The south window is by Morris and Co. The church was grade II listed in 1966.\nThe church is built of sandstone with a red tile roof. It consists of an undivided nave and chancel, and a south porch. At the west end is a coped gable with a stone bellcote and a cross, and at the east end is a three-light window with a hood mould. Inside, there is an exposed timber truss roof, two aedicules in the Baroque style, believed to have been relocated from Newcastle Cathedral, and a gallery at the west end.\nSee also\nListed buildings in East Rounton",

    "American author and anti-suffragist (1869\u20131926)\nGrace Duffield Goodwin (October 2, 1869 \u2013 January 8, 1926) was an American anti-suffrage activist, writer, and poet. \nServed as president of the District of Columbia Anti-Suffrage Association and holding a position on the executive committee of the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage. Her contributions to the movement included public speaking, writing influential articles, and engaging in debates. Goodwin also authored the treatise Anti-Suffrage: Ten Good Reasons in 1914, in which she argued against women's suffrage, advocating for traditional gender roles and the idea that women were better suited to the domestic sphere.\nAlongside her activism, Goodwin was a prolific writer, contributing to various newspapers, magazines, and literary publications. Her literary works included poetry and essays that explored themes of suburban life, nature, and societal roles.\nEarly life and education\nGrace Duffield was born on October 2, 1869, in Adrian, Michigan, to Reverend Samuel Willoughby Duffield and Harriet Hayward Duffield. She attended Bishopthorpe Seminary in South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and later pursued additional courses at Pembroke College, the women's college affiliated with Brown University.\nAnti-Suffrage advocacy\nGrace Duffield Goodwin played a significant role in the anti-suffrage movement by actively participating in and supporting anti-suffrage campaigns. She served as the president of the District of Columbia Anti-Suffrage Association and was a member of the executive committee of the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage.\nIn 1912, she was the chairman of the District of Columbia Auxiliary of the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage.\nGoodwin participated in a notable suffrage debate against Carrie Chapman Catt during the City Club's fifth season in 1913\u201314. This debate was a significant event, attracting a large audience and contributing to the club's prominence in political and social discourse.\nShe was featured as a speaker at various anti-suffrage events, including mass meetings in Utica and Gloversville, where she worked alongside other prominent anti-suffragists like Alice Hay Wadsworth. Goodwin's involvement included public speaking and participating in organized efforts to sway public opinion against women's enfranchisement. Her efforts extended to responding to the shifting political climate during World War I, particularly the framing of suffrage as a \"war measure,\" which she and her fellow anti-suffragists opposed.\nGoodwin's article, \"The 'Feminist' Woman \u2014 A Thorough Radical Who Repudiates All Restraint,\" published in The New York Times on November 9, 1913, Goodwin critiqued the use of the term \"feminist\" in contemporary discourse. She argued that \"feminist\" had come to signify the most radical and revolutionary women who rejected traditional customs, social norms, and moral limitations. Goodwin distinguished between feminists and suffragists, suggesting that while all feminists are suffragists, not all suffragists are feminists. She criticized the feminist movement as overly radical and dangerous, asserting that it aimed to liberate women from all forms of restraint, extending beyond just the suffrage movement.\nGoodwin argued that feminists were mentally defective, comparing their intellectual capabilities to that of an eleven-year-old. She suggested that adopting feminist ideals would increase women's risk of psychiatric disorders by 25%, based on the assumption that public life would exacerbate their supposed mental and emotional vulnerabilities.\nGoodwin, along with other anti-suffrage activists, utilized medical language to reinforce their arguments. They claimed that women's so-called \"temperamental disabilities,\" lack of \"endurance in things mental,\" and insufficient \"nervous stability\" would lead to debilitation if they engaged in public life. This rhetoric was used to argue that women required special care and education, as opposed to participating equally in society. This view was rooted in the belief that women's supposed disabilities justified their exclusion from public life, and that only medical experts could properly address these issues.\nAnti-Suffrage: Ten Good Reasons (1915)\nIn 1914, she contended that government stability relied on physical enforcement, which women were not involved in, and claimed that suffrage was a matter of policy, not a fundamental right. Goodwin believed that the push for women's suffrage came from a minority and would only worsen political corruption. She argued that women had advanced significantly without the vote and were more effective as political outsiders. Her views were grounded in a belief that suffrage would disrupt natural gender roles, fail to improve public morals, and diminish women's existing privileges.\nGoodwin argued that women's natural role in the home and motherhood justified their exclusion from politics. She asserted that engaging in political activit",

He inspired the creation of Florida's first specialized business court, and was considered a leader on improving the quality and efficiency of business litigation.\nJudicial service\nState court judge\nIn December 2001, Florida Governor Jeb Bush appointed Smith as a judge of Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court, covering Orange and Osceola Counties. He was later successfully elected as a circuit court judge. He served as a circuit court judge from early 2002 until 2011, when he became a Magistrate Judge in the United States District Court of the Middle District of Florida. He was replaced on the Ninth Circuit by John Jordan.\nSmith first served in the court's criminal division and then its domestic division. During his early time on the court, in 2003, Smith pursued the concept with Chief Judge Belvin Perry of establishing a specialized business court in the Ninth Circuit. This would be a specialized court program with jurisdiction over complex business and commercial cases, with a single judge hearing the case from beginning to end. Smith's goal was to \"give Orlando-area businesses greater certainty, consistency and efficiency in the courtroom -- with judges who know business law, make consistent rulings and move cases through the system quickly.\"\nLater in 2003, Perry issued orders creating the Specialized Business Court Sub-Division of the Civil Division of the Circuit Court, which would become operational in January 2004.  This was the first functioning business court in Florida's state court system. Judge Renee A. Roche served as the first business court judge. In 2009, Smith himself served as the Ninth Circuit's Business Court judge. The Ninth Circuit Business Court inspired other Florida circuits to create their own business courts.\nNationally, Smith was a founder and director of the American College of Business Court Judges (ACBCJ), and he, Perry, and Roche all participated in the first meeting of the ACBCJ in 2005.\nWhile a Florida state court judge, the Florida Supreme Court made him the first chair of its newly established Committee on Standard Jury Instruction\u2013Contract and Business Cases.\nFederal judiciary\nIn 2011, the Judges of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida unanimously selected Smith to serve as a Magistrate Judge for the Middle District of Florida. He retired from that position in 2019, but was recalled for two more years, fully retiring in 2021.\nThe position of federal magistrate judge was created by Congress in 1968. Magistrate judges are federal judicial officers, but they are appointed by a vote of United States District Court Judges in a judicial district, rather than by the President of the United States and the United States Senate. Although not as broad as the powers held by district court judges, magistrate judges have a wide range of authority, and can even preside as judges over civil trials if the parties all agree. Among their many functions, they often entertain pretrial motions and hearings.\nSmith was considered \"a pioneer known both statewide and nationally for his cutting edge innovations in the field of business litigation\" in part based on his expertise in addressing developing technologies and electronic discovery.  As a magistrate judge, his written decisions on discovery of electronically stored information have been looked to for guidance on grasping issues dealing with this type of technical discovery.\nMore generally to all cases, Smith provided the following advice in a 2019 federal judicial order, on how opponents should and should and should not communicate during the litigation process: \"Both sides need to learn that frequently the best response to immature behavior is to ignore it. Don't react, don't sink to the other side's level, don't try to fight fire with fire. There are disagreements in every case, that is what litigation is about. Most adversaries work out their disagreements while remaining calm and professional.\"\nLegal practice\nSmith was admitted to the Florida bar in 1978, and began his legal career as a solo practitioner that same year. He became an Assistant State Attorney in Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit in 1979. In 1982, he became a business litigator at the private law firm of Maguire, Voorhis & Wells, P.A. for 16 years. In 1998, he became a law partner at the national and international law firm Holland & Knight, LLP.\nEducation\nSmith obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of South Florida in 1974, and his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Florida College of Law (now the University of Florida Levin College of Law) in 1977.\nPositions and honors\nSmith has held the following positions and received the following honors, among others;\nMember (20 years), Executive Council of the Business Law Section of the Florida Bar\nFirst chair appointed to Florida Supreme Court Committee on Standard Ju",

    "Scottish \u202ageomorphologist\nColin Kerr Ballantyne FRSE FRSA FRSGS (born 7 June 1951 in Glasgow, Scotland) is a Scottish geomorphologist, geologist, and physical geographer.\nEducation and career\nColin K. Ballantyne graduated in 1973 with an M.A. from the University of Glasgow, where he was influenced by Robert John Price (1936\u20132012) to study geomorphology and Quaternary geology. Ballantyne graduated in 1975 with an M.Sc. from Ontario's McMaster University, where he was part of a team led by S. Brian McCann (1935\u20132004) studying high arctic hydrology and fluvial processes. In 1975 Ballantyne returned to Scotland and became a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh. There he graduated in 1980 with a PhD thesis on the periglacial geomorphology of mountains in northwestern Scotland. His PhD thesis was supervised by Brian Sissons (1926\u20132018).\nAt the University of St Andrews, Ballantyne was a lecturer in geography from 1980 to 1989, a senior lecturer in geography and geology from 1989 to 1994, and  a professor of physical geography from 1994 to 31 January 2015, when he retired as professor emeritus. In the School of Geography and Geosciences of the University of St Andrews, he was the head from 1998 to 2000 and the director of research from 2007 and 2012. Since 2000 he is a guest professor at University Centre Svalbard in Svalbard, Norway. He was twice an Erskine Fellow at New Zealand's University of Canterbury, where he has taught summer school courses over many years. As a professor at the University of St Andrews, Ballantyne conducted annual honours field courses in Norway \u2014 on one such occasion his students included the future Duke of Cambridge.\nResearch\nColin K. Ballantyne is the author or co-author of more than 150 articles in refereed journals.\nMuch of Ballantyne's reputation is based upon his reconstruction of the extent and deglaciation chronology of the last British-Irish ice sheet and his 2002 model of paraglacial landscape modification. He and his co-workers have done research on geomorphological mapping, glaciation, and periglaciation, as well as many related topics such as frost weathering, nivation, solifluction, hydrology, debris flow, rockfall, slope stability, and wind erosion. He was the co-author, with Charles Harris, of The Periglaciation of Great Britain (Cambridge University Press, 1994), which for the next two decades was an essential reference for periglacial research in the British Isles. In the Hebrides, Ballantyne single-handedly did field mapping and theoretical reconstruction of former glacier limits on all the major islands between Orkney and Arran. In 2012 he was the co-author, with Derek Fabel and Sheng Xu, of an important article that presented convincing evidence that periglacial trimlines, instead of representing the maximum altitude of the last ice sheet, actually represent thermal boundaries which separated wet-based ice at pressure melting point from cold-based ice on summit plateaus. The evidence consisted of establishing the dates of high-level erratic boulders above trimlines on five mountains in northwestern Scotland and empirically demonstrating that the last ice sheet overtopped the five mountains.\nAvocations\nIn addition to his interest in music, history, and travel, Ballantyne is a skilled mountain climber. He climbed all the Scottish Munros at least twice (and many of them three or more times). He ascended Mount Kilimanjaro (on the summit of which he proposed to his future wife Rebecca). He climbed many mountains in New Zealand and Europe, including many of Norway's peaks over 2000 meters. Accompanied by Chris Bonington, he ascended Mount Elbrus.\nFamily\nColin K. Ballantyne married Rebecca Josephine Trengove in August 1996. They have a son and a daughter.\nAwards and honours\nBallantyne received in 1986 the Warwick Award and in 1999 the Wiley Award of the British Society for Geomorphology (formerly the British Geomorphological Research Group). The Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS) awarded him in 1990 the RSGS's President's Medal, in 1991 the Newbigin Prize, and in 2015 the Coppock Research Medal. In 1996 he received the Saltire Society's Scottish Science Award and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In 2000 he was awarded a D.Sc. from  the University of St Andrews. In 2010 the Edinburgh Geological Society awarded him the Clough Medal. In 2015 the Geological Society of London awarded him the Lyell Medal.\nSelected publications\nArticles\nBallantyne, C.

Rivas in 1980 along with seven other new Limia species (L. fuscomaculata, L. garnieri, L. immaculata, L. miragoanensis, L. pauciradiata, L. sulphurophila, and L. yaguajali) and made the type species of the newly erected subgenus Odontolimia. Odontolimia are characterized by their large conical teeth. The teeth of L grossidens are larger than in any other Limia species, which is reflected in both their scientific and common name.\nThe maximum reported standard lengths are 49.2\u00a0mm (1.94\u00a0in) for females and 48.2\u00a0mm (1.90\u00a0in) for males.\nL. grossidens is known solely from the coastal freshwater Lake Miragoane in south-western Haiti and is apparently endemic to it. There it shares its habitat with five other Odontolimia species (L. ornata, L. fuscomaculata, L. garnieri, L. immaculata, and L. miragoanensis) as well as with L. nigrofasciata.\nL. grossidens is listed by the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered. The species' survival is threatened primarily by deforestation, which is a major problem in Haiti; pollution; invasive species (including tilapias Oreochromis aureus and Coptodon rendalli and the common carp Cyprinus carpio); and climate change-induced flooding.\n",
    "Historic home in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States\nUnited States historic place\nThe Brigham Young Forest Farmhouse is a historic home in Salt Lake City, Utah. The building was once owned by Brigham Young, an early leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and first governor of Utah Territory. Built between 1861 and 1863, it was located on Young's Forest Farm near the southern boundary of Salt Lake City. Restored from 1969 to 1970, the home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and subsequently relocated to This Is the Place Heritage Park in 1975.\nForest Farm\nBrigham Young's Forest Farm was located approximately 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) southeast of downtown Salt Lake City; today this area is known as Forest Dale. The farm was well known for its agricultural experiments, especially attempts to grow crops new to the area. It was the first location where alfalfa and sugar beets were grown in Salt Lake Valley. The local silk industry (overseen by Zina D. H. Young) was also moved to a cocoonery on the farm, where nearly 30 acres (12\u00a0ha) of mulberry trees were planted to provide food for the silkworms. For many years, the farm's primary produce came from its large dairy.\nFarmhouse\nDwellings on the farm were adobe or log cabins until construction of the farmhouse began in 1861 and was completed in 1863. The home was constructed with a rock foundation and wood frame walls, covered with stucco. It was built using the balloon framing technique, likely the first such structure in Utah. The floor plan is a double cross-wing and its style is Gothic Revival Cottage. Its original cost was $25,000 (equivalent to $618,649 in 2023). The front door opened to the dining room and on either side were the kitchen, social room, and sitting room; the second floor contained the bedrooms.\nSusannah Snively Young, who lived at the farm longer than any other of Young's wives\nBrigham Young did not regularly live in the Forest Farmhouse, and one of his 56 wives (the \"wife in residence\") would supervise the farm. Young's wife Ann Eliza Young later complained that the home was inadequate against the winter cold and summer heat, and that Young only sent disliked wives to Forest Farm, where they were heavily worked. Susannah Snively Young lived at the farm longer than any other of Young's wives; she was particularly skilled with the dairy work. Young would commonly bring guests to stay at the Farmhouse, including actress Julia Dean Hayne.\nAfter Young's death\nYoung died in 1877 and the farmhouse remained in his family until 1889, when it was sold to George Mousley Cannon. Cannon divided up the farm land into building lots, creating what is today Forest Dale. After Young's death and as the new neighborhood grew, the farmhouse was used as a schoolhouse, ward meetinghouse, and community gathering place.\nIn 1923, the home was heavily remodeled, including removing the porches and southern portion of the building, to create a \"modern\" house. What remained of the home was purchased by Frank and Gwen Wilcox in the 1950s, and after learning it had once belonged to Brigham Young, they started to restore what had survived. In 1968, the Wilcoxes donated the equity in the house to the LDS Church, which then owned the building after paying off the remaining mortgage. The Wilcoxes, together with the church (and its curator Florence S. Jacobsen), restored the farmhouse, including rebuilding the demolished portion of the home. On April 2, 1970, Spencer W. Kimball, the LDS Church's Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, dedicated the home as a historic site visitors' center of the church. The restored home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 14, 1971.\nRelocation\nIn 1974, the LDS Church and Utah state government agreed to a property trade, in which the church would give the Forest Farmhouse to the state and in return the state would give the church two historic sites it owned in southern Utah (the Brigham Young Winter Home and Office and Jacob Hamblin House). The church would then operate the two southern Utah homes as historic site visitors' centers and the state would move the Forest Farmhouse to Pioneer Trail State Park (currently This Is the Place Heritage Park) where it would be a feature of Old Deseret Village.\nIn order to move the house from its original location, the building was sawed in half horizontally, where the gables reached the walls. On Monday, May 12, 1975, the top half of the home was lifted off and placed on a large moving carriage. The following day this half was moved to the park, and on Wednesday the bottom half of the home followed. The two pieces were then joined at their new location on Saturday, May 17. During the move, original pieces of stucco were discovered, which appeared to be deep red and scored to look like brick. Because of the move, the walls had to be redone and craftsmen were brought in to complete the work. At the park, the farmhouse",

Its length is 30\u00a0km, making it the second longest tributary of the Tsibritsa.\nThe river takes its source at an altitude of 816\u00a0m in the Vlashko Pole locality on the northern slopes of the Shiroka Planina division of the Pre-Balkan range, a system of low-lying mountains and hills between the Balkan Mountains and the Danubian Plain. It flows in general direction northeast. The river runs in a deep forested valley until the village of Dolna Riksa. Downstream, it enters the Danubian Plain and the valley widens, surrounded by farmland.

    "Uniparty is used as a term to suggest that ostensibly separate political parties actually function as a single party. It is often used describing the United States Republican Party and Democratic Party as two faces of a uniparty. The implication of the term is that despite their public differences, the two parties operate behind closed doors as a single entity, intentionally creating social strife and dividing people between them while pursuing a single secret uniform set of actual goals. It is further supposed that this \"uniparty\" actively works to suppress any genuine alternatives from arising, using control of the media and ballot access limitations.\nHistory\nA 2017 Politico piece examining the history of the term traced it back to a 1944 scandal wherein a letter (which turned out to be a forgery) was claimed to show that Franklin D. Roosevelt had selected Wendell Willkie to be his opponent in the 1940 election. Supporters of the 2000 Green Party presidential bid of Ralph Nader used the term extensively, and Nader himself called the prevailing political structure a \"corporate uniparty\" in his 2002 book Crashing the Party.\nThe term has been resurgent in 2024 with claims by figures including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the two-party system operates as a uniparty, which system Kennedy himself then returned to.\nSee also\nBipartisanship in US politics\nBoll weevil (politics)\nDominant-party system\nDuverger's law\nProblem Solvers Caucus\nRepublicrat\nRockefeller Republican\nSouthern Democrats\nThird party (United States)\nTwo-party system",

    "Der Hengst Houssan (English: \"The Stallion Houssan\") is a Sudanese folktale from Kordofan, first collected in German by ethnologist Leo Frobenius and published in 1923.\nIt is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 314, \"Goldener\". Although it differs from variants wherein a hero acquires golden hair, its starting sequence (persecution by the hero's stepmother) is considered by scholarship as an alternate opening to the same tale type.\nSummary\nA sultan has a wife who gives birth to a son, while a mare in the stables gives birth to a male foal. The sultan's son and the foal grow up as best friends and companions. One day, the sultan's wife dies and he marries another woman. The second wife gives birth to her son and decides to get rid of her step-son. The sultan's first son, named Schatr Mohammed, comes  home after school and pets his horse. One day, the horse, named Houssan, cries and warns the boy that his step-mother intends to kill him. She first tries to poison the boy's food, then gives him a new clothe laced with magic, but he declines the offer on both occasions. A slave tells the step-mother of the deep affection there is between the boy and his horse, and deduces the horse is helping him. With a trusted doctor's aid, she feigns illness and demands the horse be put down and its liver given to her as cure. Schatr Mohammed learns of his stepmother's ploy from his horse, and tells his father he wants to ride it one last time.\nThe next day, the sultan allows his son to saddle and ride Houssan, while the stepmother secretly orders her slaves to attack the boy. Houssan takes its riders beyond his father's city gates, and rides through the desert to another city. They stop before the gates; the horse tells the boy to take off his rich garments and find shabby one, and take seven hairs from its mane, which he can use to summon the horse whenever he wishes. Schatr Mohammed enters the city in his new identity, and finds work with the royal gardener as his assistant. One day, while there is a festival in the city, Schatr Mohammed seizes the opportunity to ride Houssan in secret, since everyone has gone to the festival. What he does not know, however, is that the sultan's seventh daughter watches him undress, take a bath and ride the horse. She begins to be fond of the gardener, and goes down to the garden to give him some food. After three years, the sultan's eldest daughter announces her plans to marry, and the sultan organizes a festival where his seven daughters are to select their husbands by throwing a kerchief to them. The sultan's six elder daughters choose respectable suitors, but the seventh does not throw her kerchief to any one the passing men. The sultan brings the gardener and the apprentice, and the princess gives him the kerchief. The sultan becomes enraged and exiles his daughter and her lowborn husband to the slaves' quarters.\nOne day, an enemy sultan arrives with his army and prepares to invade the city. The sultan summons his six sons-in-law to lead the army and protect the city. The battle is fierce and they barely resist, when Schatr Muhammed comes in riding his horse Houssan and makes the enemy army retreat. He then rides back to his wife, changes his clothes and feigns ignorance about recent events. The next day, the princess tells her husband that the sultan, her father, will go to the battlefield to discover the identity of their mysterious knight (Faris) and lead their army to victory. This becomes a fallible strategy, as the enemy king's troops close in on him to take him prisoner, but once more Schatr Mohammed appears in the nick of time to ward off the enemy army and defend his father-in-law. He is hurt in his arm, and the sultan closes the wound with a cloth. Schatr Mohammed races back to his wife in the city, now that the threat is over.\nLater, the sultan announces that the Faris will inherit the kingdom, whoever he is. Schatr Mohammed goes to sleep in his shabby room, and his arm begins to bleed. His wife, the princess, notices the bleeding and rushes to her mother. The princess's mother goes to the slaves' quarters to heal him, and sees that the sultan's cloth is wrapped in his arm. His identity discovered, the princess's mother alerts the sultan, who summons him to his chambers as soon as he awakes. Schater Mohammed awakes, learns of this, and goes to his father-in-law's palace riding on Houssan.\nAnalysis\nTale type\nThe tale is classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as type ATU 314, \"The Goldener\": a youth with golden hair works as the king's gardener. The type may also open with the prince for some reason being the servant of an evil being, where he gains the same gifts, and the tale proceeds as in this variant.\nIntroductory episodes\nScholarship notes three different opening episodes to the tale type: (1) the hero becomes a magician's servant and is forbidden to open a certain door, but he does and dips his hair in a pool of gold; (2) the hero i",
    "In this Chinese name, the family name is  Tong.\nTong Guogang (died 3 September 1690) was a Qing dynasty official. He was a maternal uncle of Kangxi Emperor.\nTong Guogang was the first (or the second) son of Tulai. According to the Comprehensive history of Eight Banners (\u6b3d\u5b9a\u516b\u65d7\u901a\u5fd7), The Tong (\u4f5f) family from Fushun was a sinicized Jurchen clan, they were incorporated into the Han Chinese Plain Blue Banner. However, Pamela Kyle Crossley stated that they were actually Han Chinese and falsely claimed to be related to the Manchu Tunggiya (\u4f5f\u4f73) clan of Jilin, using this false claim to get themselves transferred to a Manchu banner in the reign of the Kangxi Emperor.\nIn 1662, Tong Guogang succeeded to the hereditary rank Third class jinkini hafan and appointed the deputy commander of the imperial bodyguard (\u5167\u5927\u81e3). In 1675 he assisted Oja (\u9102\u624e) in the suppression of the rebellion of the Chahar Mongols led by B\u00fcrni (\u5e03\u723e\u5c3c) and was designated North Pacifying General (\u5b89\u5317\u5c07\u8ecd). In 1677, Tong Tulai was granted the hereditary rank First class Duke (\u4e00\u7b49\u516c) posthumously, Tong Guogang inherited this rank in the same time.\nTong Guogang was one of the members of the mission to Russia in 1688 led by Songgotu, which was dedicated to resolving border disputes between China and Russia. In the next year a border treaty was signed in Nerchinsk, the signatories were Songgotu on behalf of the Chinese emperor and Fyodor Alexeyevich Golovin on behalf of the Russian tsars. Songgotu's signature was followed by those of Tong Guogang, Langtan (\u90ce\u5766), Bandar\u0161a (\u73ed\u9054\u723e\u6c99), Sabsu (\u85a9\u5e03\u7d20), Mala (\u746a\u5587) and Unda (\u6e29\u9054).\nTong Guogang was killed in action by Dzungars in the Battle of Ulan Butung. He was given the posthumous name Zhongyong (\u5fe0\u52c7) by Kangxi Emperor. After Yongzheng ascended the throne, Tong was awarded posthumous appointment of Grand Tutor (\u592a\u5085).\nTong Guogang and Tong Guowei were said to believe in Christianity, though their political lives prohibited their formal conversions. They maintained close relationships with two Jesuit missionaries, Lodovico Buglio and Gabriel de Magalh\u00e3es.\nFamily\nFather: Tulai\nMother: Lady Gioro\nSiblings:\nEldest sister: Empress Xiaokangzhang (mother of Kangxi Emperor)\nEldest brother: Tong Guoji (\u4f5f\u570b\u7d00)?\nYounger brother: Tong Guowei (\u4f5f\u570b\u7dad)\nSons:\nEldest son: Olondai, served as the commander of the imperial bodyguard (\u9818\u4f8d\u885b\u5167\u5927\u81e3)\nSecond son: Fahai, served as minister of War from 1726 to 1727\nThird son: K\u016bwadai, served as minister of Works from 1727 to 1729",
    "\nSecularism in Kosovo has a complex history and is influenced by political and social developments in the country. Since the declaration of independence in 2008, Kosovo has followed a clear course towards the separation of religion from the state, promoting freedom of belief and human rights.\nThe Constitution provides that secularism is a key element in building a democratic and just society, ensuring that all religious communities and individuals have the right to freely exercise their faith, while the state remains neutral and separate from religious matters.\nHistory\nYugoslav period\nDuring the period of Yugoslavia, especially under the Constitution of 1974, Kosovo had an autonomous status within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Yugoslavia's constitution provided for the separation of religion and state and guaranteed religious freedom, but the state remained largely secular. Religion had a limited role in public life, and religious institutions were separated from state affairs.\nAfter the Kosovo War and Independence\nAfter the Kosovo war in 1999 and NATO intervention, Kosovo went into a period of international administration under UNMIK. During this time, the foundations were laid for building democratic institutions and respecting human rights, including religious freedom.\nUpon declaring independence in 2008, Kosovo adopted a constitution that reflected these principles. The Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo guarantees the separation of religion from the state and promotes a secular state where all religions are treated equally.\nLegal framework\nConstitution of Kosovo\nArticle 8 of the Constitution of Kosovo defines the state as secular and guarantees the separation of religion from the state. Article 38 guarantees freedom of belief, conscience and religion, giving citizens the right to practice their faith freely and without interference.\nAdditional Legislation\nLaws in Kosovo support these constitutional principles by ensuring that every individual has the right to religious freedom and not to be discriminated against on the basis of religious belief. Religious communities have the right to register and operate in accordance with the laws of the country, managing their assets and institutions.\nSecularism in Practice\nIn practice, Kosovo has a religiously diverse population where the majority are Muslim, but there are also Christian and other religious communities. Secularism in Kosovo means that the government does not interfere in religious matters and maintains a neutral approach to all faiths. This is evident in public education, where religious instruction is not part of state school curricula, and in the way holidays and religious symbolism are treated in state institutions.\nChallenges and controversies\nHowever, the clear separation of religion and state has also encountered challenges and contestations, especially in contexts where religious beliefs clash with secular practices and laws. Some such cases include issues of women's rights, the rights of the LGBTQ+ community and the use of headscarves in public places.\nSee also\nConstitution of Kosovo\nSecularism in Albania\nIrreligion in Albania\nSeparation of church and state\nSecularism in Turkey",
    "Buddhist temple in Tokyo, Japan\nSainen-ji (\u897f\u5ff5\u5bfa) is a Buddhist temple belonging to the J\u014ddo-sh\u016b sect, located in Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo, Japan. It is known as the temple founded by Hattori Hanz\u014d, a famous samurai of the Sengoku Period who served Tokugawa Ieyasu. The temple is the family temple of the Hattori clan, and contains the graves of Hanz\u014d and other members of the Hattori clan. In addition, there is a memorial tower that is said to have been built by Hanz\u014d for Tokugawa Ieyasu's eldest son, Nobuyasu, whom Hanz\u014d served as guardian.\nHistory\nSainen-ji Temple was founded in 1594, shortly after the Tokugawa clan took possession of Edo , when Hattori Hanz\u014d founded its predecessor, An'yoin, in Shimizudani, Kojimachi, Edo (near modern-day Shimizudani Park in Kioicho, Chiyoda Ward). Hanz\u014d took the Buddhist name Saien to commemorate the soul of Matsudaira Nobuyasu, who had died an untimely death. He built a memorial tower at An'yoin and spent the rest of his life praying for Nobuyasu's soul. After his death in 1597, he was posthumously given the Buddhist name Senshoinden An'yo Saien Daizenjomon and was buried in the same hermitage.\nLater, due to the expansion of Edo Castle in the surrounding area, An'yo-in was moved to its current location in around 1634 and newly built as a temple. The current mountain name and temple name of Sainen-ji are derived from his posthumous name.\nHistoric sites and cultural properties\nTokugawa (Matsudaira) Nobuyasu Memorial Tower: Shinjuku Ward designated historic site. Located behind the current main hall on the right side, it is a large Gorinto (stone tower) in a stone fence with a stone door bearing the three-leaf hollyhock crest, and has an inscription on the front that reads \"Sanshu Tatsuiwa Zentsu Daikoshi in front of Seiryu-ji Temple.\" There is an explanatory board for the \"Okazaki Saburo Nobuyasu Memorial Tower\" installed by the Shinjuku Ward Board of Education.\nThe Grave of Hattori Hanz\u014d: A designated historic site by Shinjuku Ward.

    "Sahel Alma or Sahel Aalma is a Late Cretaceous paleontological site and Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte in Keserwan-Jbeil, Lebanon. Located near the town of the same name, it documents well-preserved deepwater marine fossils dating to the late Santonian stage of the Cretaceous. It is often associated with the slightly older, similarly famous Sannine Formation sites (Haqel, Hadjula, and Nammoura), with these four sites being together referred to as the \"Fish Beds\" of Lebanon.\nIt is one of the few fossiliferous units of the Chekka Formation, a wider geological formation in Lebanon deposited from the Late Cretaceous to the early Paleogene.\nDescription\nMuch like the fossil sites of the older Sannine Formation, Sahel Alma contains exquisitely preserved marine fossils from the Tethys Ocean, deposited off the northern coast of the Afro-Arabian continent. However, unlike the Sannine Formation sites, which were deposited in relatively shallow waters near the shore on the inner continental shelf, Sahel Alma was deposited in a deepwater habitat off the continental slope, at depths estimated to be greater than 150 metres (490\u00a0ft), likely at the transition between the sublittoral and bathyal zones in dysphotic or aphotic conditions. This has caused it to preserve a distinct fauna from the Sannine Formation, with a significant number of deepwater arthropods and chondrichthyans.\nAs with the sites of the Sannine Formation, the fossils of Sahel Alma are very well-preserved, and include the soft body parts of cartilaginous fish and cephalopods. Palaeoctopus, the first fossil octopus discovered with preserved soft tissues, was discovered from Sahel Alma.\nHistory\nThe Sahel Alma monastery, built with bricks from the site\nSahel Alma is one of the oldest-known fossil sites in Lebanon, second only to the Haqel site of the Sannine Formation. It has been known of since the Seventh Crusade in the 13th century, when bricks quarried out of it were used to build the eponymous Maronite monastery at Sahel Alma. A fossil fish presented to King Louis IX around this time may have been from the site. The site was also likely documented by C. F. Volney during the early 1780s. British adventurer Lady Hester Stanhope settled near Sahel Alma in the early 19th century, and helped to collect and circulate fossils from the site and Haqel. Paul-\u00c9mile Botta was also another prolific early researcher of the site.\nThe site is no longer accessible for scientific research as buildings were constructed over it, due to the purchase of the site by a private company, which restored the Sahel Alma monastery as a hotel.\nPaleobiota\nVertebrates\nCartilaginous fish\nRay-finned fishes\nInvertebrates\nArthropods\nMolluscs\n",

She did not exhibit her own work during her lifetime. But 440 of her works were discovered in 1998 in a trunk in a family residence. Many of these works have been given to some of the world's best known museums, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (45 paintings), the Tate Gallery (29), the National Gallery of Art (25), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (22), the Brooklyn Museum (20), the Ashmolean Museum (19), as well as the Sargent House Museum (15) in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where several of her ancestors lived.\nSargent at her easle, as painted by her brother John\nThe first major exhibition of her work Emily Sargent, A Glimpse into her World was held at the Cape Ann Museum in Gloucester, Massachusetts in 2022.\nEarly life\nEmily Sargent was a descendant of Epes Sargent, a colonial military leader and jurist. Her father, FitzWilliam (b. 1820 in Gloucester, Massachusetts), was an eye surgeon at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia from 1844 to 1854.  Her mother, Mary Newbold Sargent (n\u00e9e Singer, 1826\u20131906), suffered a breakdown after the death of her first child, and the couple decided to go abroad to recover. They were nomadic expatriates for the rest of their lives. Sargent's parents were based in Paris, but moved regularly, spending time at the sea and at mountain resorts in France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.\nWhile Mary was pregnant with her son, John Singer Sargent, they stopped in Florence, Tuscany, because of a cholera epidemic. John was born there in 1856. A year later, his sister Emily was born, also in Italy. After her birth, FitzWilliam resigned his post in Philadelphia and accepted his wife's request to remain abroad. They lived on a small inheritance and savings, leading a quiet life with their children. They generally avoided society and other Americans, except for friends in the art world. Three more children were born abroad, of whom only two lived past childhood.\nAt age four, Emily Sargent had a serious spinal injury, followed by a prolonged immobilization, resulting in lifelong frailty. Nevertheless, she traveled and painted throughout Europe and the Near East. Their mother made sure that all the children learned to draw and paint.\nEmily and John were close and both lived in Europe most of their lives, often traveling together.

    "\nThe Illawarra Grevillea Park is a botanical garden located in Bulli on the south coast of New South Wales, Australia.\nOpened in 1993 by professional gardener Ray Brown, it is notable for its extensive collection of grevilleas, both cultivars and naturally occurring species. It also features many other plants from all over Australia as well as a naturally-occurring rainforest, a small chapel, public toilets, parking and picnic facilities.\nHistory\nDuring the mid-1980s, a permanent location for Australian Plant Society Grevillea Study Group's collection of grevilleas and other native plants was needed, which at the time were being kept in pots by founder and professional gardener, Ray Brown. He had designed the layout of the park five years prior to its creation, but did not have the land available to begin construction.\nRay made an approach to Wollongong City Council for a land lease, and in 1987, the Illawarra Grevillea Park was established.\nThe park was officially opened to the public on September 25, 1993.\nTo honour Ray's work and long contribution to the collection, horticulture and growing of grevilleas and the creation of the park, a newly described species of grevillea, Grevillea raybrownii was named after him by Peter Olde and Neil Marriott in 1994.\nOn August 12, 2022, the park gained official status as a botanical garden, with an opening being conducted by NSW governor Margaret Joan Beazley.\nDescription\nBanksia oblongifolia prostrate form\nSet on 2.4 hectares of land on the outskirts of Wollongong, the Illawarra Grevillea Park is a not-for-profit botanical garden featuring multiple display gardens primarily consisting of grevillea species, cultivars and hybrids, as well as a variety of other Australian native plants and a native rainforest.\nThe park was created with the aim of showcasing and encouraging the appreciation of Australia's plant biodiversity, providing information on native plant gardening and contributing to the study and conservation of rare and endangered plants. The park is continually maintained by volunteers throughout the year, but is only open to the public on open days on the first two Saturdays and Sundays of Autumn, Winter and Spring each year.\nGrevilleas\nThe park contains an extensive collection of 300-400 grevillea species, cultivars and hybrids. Many of the grevillea species were collected from the wild by Ray Brown and botanist, Peter Olde. Many of the grevilleas seen in the park are grafted. This allows a variety of new forms to be created, such as ground cover grevilleas being grafted onto Grevillea robusta to create a tall \"weeping\" form. Another reason grevilleas are grafted is to allow species from all across Australia, particularly those from Western Australia and the Northern Territory to grow within the park, as their roots would not survive otherwise.\nChapel\nThe park has a small chapel, built as an interdenominational church in a long-gone village named Sherbrooke, which was resumed by the NSW Government and flooded for the Cataract Dam Project in 1902. Before Sherbrooke was flooded, the church was relocated in parts to Woonona near Wollongong to be used as a private residence. It was relocated again to the Illawarra Grevillea Park in 1992 to prevent it from being bulldozed for new home units. Today, the chapel serves as a wedding venue, administration venue and bookstore during the park's open days.\n",
    "Mountain in Montana, United States\nCrown Butte is a 10,225-foot (3,117-metre) summit in Park County, Montana, United States.\nDescription\nCrown Butte is located 2.7 miles (4.3\u00a0km) north-northwest of Cooke City, Montana, in the Beartooth Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. It is set within the New World Mining District and the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's west slope drains into headwaters of the Stillwater River, whereas the east slope drains into Miller Creek \u2192 Soda Butte Creek \u2192 Lamar River. Topographic relief is modest as the summit rises 1,225 feet (373 meters) above Miller Creek in one mile (1.6\u00a0km). The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. The area around Crown Butte from Cooke City to Scotch Bonnet Mountain offers some of the finest backcountry snowmobiling in the country. On January 17, 2009, a snowmobiler riding on Crown Butte triggered an avalanche resulting in one fatality. On December 31, 2022, one snowmobiler was killed in a very large avalanche on Crown Butte.\nCrown Butte in summer\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Crown Butte is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F.\nSee also\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains",
    "Road in Kenya\nThe A7 road is a road in Kenya that runs along the Indian Ocean coastline. It spans 428 kilometers, starting at the Tanzanian border and passing through the port city of Mombasa before ending in Lamu. The road connects various locations along the coast.\nRoute\nThe A7 highway originates at the Tanzanian border, where it connects with the Tanzanian T13 road from Dar es Salaam. From there, it proceeds as a modern, paved road along the coast to Mombasa, passing through a relatively densely populated rural area characterized by flat terrain and tropical vegetation. In Mombasa, the road becomes a multi-lane city road, crossing an estuary via the Nyali Bridge, before narrowing to a single lane and continuing north along the Indian Ocean coastline.\nThe route traverses various landscapes, including a bay near Kilifi, and forms a boundary between cultivated savannah and undeveloped forest areas. The road passes through the coastal town of Malindi and continues north, following the coast along Ungwana Bay before turning inland near Garsen. The final stretch to Lamu is also paved, winding through a cultivated rural area in the coastal plain. The A7 terminates just before reaching Lamu, which is located on an island without a bridge connection.\nHistory\nThe southern segment of the A7 highway, spanning 110 kilometers from the Tanzanian border to Mombasa, was initially designated as the A14. The subsequent sections, from Mombasa to Garsen and Garsen to Lamu, were previously numbered as the B8 and C112, respectively. In 2016, these routes were consolidated into the A7 motorway, a more significant transportation artery.\nHistorically, the original A14 has been a vital road along Kenya's east coast, and as such, it has been fully asphalted. However, a notable limitation has been the absence of a fixed crossing over the Kilindini Harbour in Mombasa. To address this, a western bypass of Mombasa was under construction in 2021, undertaken by a Japanese company. While a bridge over the harbour would be beneficial, it would require a substantial structure with a clearance height of 60 meters to accommodate the port's significant traffic. A tunnel is not feasible due to the harbour's depth.\nIn Mombasa, a pontoon bridge over Tudor Creek was initially opened in 1931, followed by a fixed box bridge with 2x3 lanes in 1980, constructed by Japan. An additional bridge is currently being built in Mombasa, with construction commencing in 2021. Between 2017 and 2021, the northernmost section of the A7, from Garsen to Lamu, was paved, completing the entire motorway.\n",

    "Transportation in Ann Arbor, Michigan is served by several highways, Amtrak and intercity bus lines, and the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport. Local public transportation is provided by Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority (AAATA).\nStreets and roads\nThe streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though this pattern is less common in the surrounding areas. Major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. The city is belted by three freeways: I-94, which runs along the southern and western portion of the city; U.S. Highway 23 (US\u00a023), which primarily runs along the eastern edge of Ann Arbor; and M-14, which runs along the northern edge of the city. Other nearby highways include US\u00a012 (Michigan Ave.), M-17 (Washtenaw Ave.), and M-153 (Ford Rd.).\nSeveral of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 interchange in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas. Over 80,000 people commute into Ann Arbor each day from surrounding areas.\nPublic transportation\nAn AAATA bus in front of the Blake Transit Center\nThe Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority (AAATA), which brands itself as \"TheRide\", operates public bus services throughout the city and nearby Ypsilanti. The AATA operates the Blake Transit Center on Fourth Ave. in downtown Ann Arbor, and the Ypsilanti Transit Center.\nA separate zero-fare bus service operates within and between the University of Michigan campuses. Since April 2012, the \"AirRide\" connects to Detroit Metro Airport a dozen times a day.\nIntercity buses\nGreyhound Lines provides intercity bus service. The Michigan Flyer, a service operated by Indian Trails, cooperates with AAATA for their AirRide and additionally offers bus service to East Lansing. Megabus has direct service to Chicago, Illinois, while a bus service is provided by Amtrak Thruway for rail passengers making connections to services in East Lansing and Toledo, Ohio.\nWalking and cycling\nAnn Arbor is considered one of the US's most walkable cities, with one sixth of Ann Arborites walking to work according to the 2020 census. Ann Arbor has a gold designation by the Walk Friendly Communities program. Since 2011, the city's property taxes have included a provision for sidewalk maintenance and expansions, expanding the sidewalk network, filling sidewalk gaps, and repairing existing sidewalks. The city has created a sidewalk gap dashboard, which showed 143 miles of sidewalk gaps in May 2022. The outlying parts of the city and the township districts between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti still contain markedly unwalkable areas.\nIn 2019, 36% of trips in Ann Arbor were taken by walking, biking or transit. In 2020, the city introduced a Healthy Streets program to encourage non-motorized transportation. Between 2019 and 2022 Ann Arbor's Downtown Development Authority built four two-way protected bikeways downtown. Early studies have shown a significant increase in bicycle use downtown since the construction of these bikeways. In 2023, the city reported over 900 bicycle parking spaces downtown, though this is still a small portion compared to the over 8,000 car parking spots for cars.\nThe Washtenaw County Border-to-Border Trail connects Ann Arbor to Ypsilanti, mostly along the Huron River, for pedestrians, bicycles and other non-motorized transportation. In 2017, Spin scooters started providing a scooter share program in Ann Arbor, expanding this to include dockless e-bikes in 2023.\nRailroads\nMichigan Central Depot, Ann Arbor\nThe city was a major rail hub, notably for freight traffic between Toledo and ports north of Chicago, Illinois, from 1878 to 1982; however, the Ann Arbor Railroad also provided passenger service from 1878 to 1950, going northwest to Frankfort and Elberta on Lake Michigan and southeast to Toledo. (In Elberta connections to ferries across the Lake could be made.) The city was served by the Michigan Central Railroad starting in 1837. The Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti Street Railway, Michigan's first interurban, served the city from 1891 to 1929.\nAmtrak, which provides service to the city at the Ann Arbor Train Station, operates the Wolverine train between Chicago and Pontiac, via Detroit. The present-day train station neighbors the city's old Michigan Central Depot, which was renovated as a restaurant in 1970.\n",
    "American judge\nCraig J. Bobay is an American judge who has served in Indiana's state courts in Allen County.  He has served on the Superior Court since 2013, and held various leadership positions on that court. He also played a key part in establishing and developing Indiana's Commercial Courts, both as a leader in studying and planning for these courts creation and operation in numerous Indiana counties, and in serving as a specialist business court judge himself in Allen's Commercial Court. Before going to law school, he worked for Indiana's Superior Court as an administrator, and was a juvenile probation office. After law school, he served as a federal judicial clerk before entering the practice of law.\nJudicial service\nIn 2013, after a merit-based selection and screening process, Indiana Governor Mike Pence appointed Bobay to Allen County's Superior Court's civil division, filling the vacancy left by Judge Daniel G. Heath when he changed divisions to replace retiring Judge Stephen M. Sims. Bobay was subsequently elected and reelected in 2014 and 2020. The Allen Superior Court is a trial court of general jurisdiction with civil, criminal, and family relations divisions.\nBobay was elected by the Allen Superior Courts judges as Chief Judge for the 2016 to 2017 term. He later served as Administrative Judge of the civil division. Among other things as administrative judge, he has been involved with the newly created office of the \"Protection Order Specialist,\" who is to provide technical assistance to those seeking judicial relief and protection from domestic or family abuse, sexual offenses, or stalking.\nFrom 2003 to 2013, Bobay had been a Magistrate in the Allen County Circuit Court, and from 1997 to 2002 he had been a Magistrate in the Allen Superior Court.  The circuit court's jurisdiction is expressly limited to felonies involving driving while intoxicated, traffic violations, nonsupport of children, as well as some civil cases, domestic relations cases, paternity and child support cases, mortgage foreclosures, and it includes problem solving courts such as the Veteran's Court. Magistrates in the Superior and Circuit Courts have certain judicial powers, for example in probate, guardianship, and trust matters and matters concerning children in need of services.\nAs a judge, Bobay has served on the Board of Governors of the Judicial Conference of Indiana. He has served on the Conference's Civil Jury Instructions Committee, Judicial Administration Committee, Problem Solving Courts Committee, Domestic Relations Committee, Jury Rules Committee, and Magistrate Committee.  Bobay chaired the committee that rewrote the Appointed Judicial Officers Deskbook for Indiana Judges and Magistrates. He has served as a member of the Indiana Judges Association Board of Managers, the Allen County Bar Association Board of Directors, and Volunteer Lawyers Program of Northeast Indiana Board of Directors.\nRole in creating Commercial Courts in Indiana\nIn 2013, Indiana's Supreme Court initiated an effort to evaluate the idea of creating specialized commercial courts in the state.  A Business Courts Subcommittee was assigned this task. Bobay was one of the three people on that subcommittee (which also included Marion County Superior Court judge Heather A. Welch). After researching the concept, in 2014, Bobay and Welch formed a broader, informal, Commercial Courts Working Group (the working group) to advise the subcommittee. The working group and subcommittee ultimately urged creating a commercial court pilot project. In 2015, the Indiana Supreme Court formalized the working group. In 2016, Indiana's Supreme Court followed the committee's and working group's recommendations to create a pilot Commercial Court. Bobay was a chair of the working group.\nIn 2016, Bobay was one of the six original pilot Commercial Court judges. The working group tracked and studied the pilot program for three years, and after its reports and recommendations over that time, the Supreme Court made the Commercial Courts permanent in 2019. Bobay was again one of six Indiana judges assigned to the Commercial Court in 2019, and has continued as a Commercial Court judge to the present (as of August 2024). The working group's role ended in 2019, but the Indiana Supreme Court immediately created a Commercial Court Committee as an adjunct to the permanent Commercial Courts. Bobay has served as co-chair, with Welch, on this permanent committee.\nBobay has also served as chair of the Commercial Court Handbook and Treatise Subcommittee of the Commercial Courts Committee, which created a written legal treatise in 2022 as a guide to attorneys practicing in the Commercial Courts, covering areas of Indiana law that arise in the Commercial Courts.\nLegal practice and prior work\nAllen was in private practice for five years as a litigator before joining the judicial branch in 1997.\nBefore going to law school, Allen worked as an administrator in the Superior Court in the 1980s, ",

    "Heat event caused by polar vortex weakening\nThe 2024 Antarctica heat wave refers to a prolonged and significant mid-winter increase in Antarctic temperatures compared to prior winters, causing several regions of Antarctica to reach temperatures 10\u00a0\u00b0C (18.0\u00a0\u00b0F) above normal in July 2024, up to a 28\u00a0\u00b0C (50.4\u00a0\u00b0F) increase above average. The heat wave was significant for occurring during the middle of the Antarctic winter when little to no sunlight shines on the continent, and temperatures are annually at their lowest historically.\nBackground\nIn March 2022, a heat wave struck Antarctica that reached 39\u00a0\u00b0C (70.2\u00a0\u00b0F) above average. The increased heat led to a portion of an ice sheet that was roughly \"the size of Rome\" to fall apart into the Southern Ocean.\nThis heat wave lead to some regions of Antarctica facing temperatures that were up to 22\u00a0\u00b0C (39.6\u00a0\u00b0F) higher than normal and caused significantly reduced levels of sea ice, leading to extensive research on the event by a major global research project consisting of 54 members, who described the complexity of the heat wave's cause as \"head-hurting\".\nMeteorology\nModels from climate researchers mapping the areas of the world indicated that the regions most impacted by anthropogenic climate change would be on Earth's poles in the Arctic and the Antarctic. Prior increases in temperatures in these regions have led to the collapse of Antarctic ice sheets that in turn significantly contribute to rising global sea levels.\nClimate researchers found that a weakening in the Antarctic polar vortex, a \"band of cold air and low pressure that spins in the stratosphere around each pole\", was the primary cause of the heat wave. Atmospheric scientist Amy Butler reported that the weakening of the polar vortex was caused by atmospheric waves interfering with the vortex, meaning that higher altitude regions in the Antarctic were more susceptible to elevated temperatures. The disturbances in the polar vortex also caused \"massive\" quantities of freezing air to be pushed toward the equator, causing unseasonably colder temperatures and cold fronts throughout the Southern Hemisphere, including the Southern Cone of South America, New Zealand, and Australia. MetDesk director Michael Dukes noted that 2024's El Ni\u00f1o was a significant contributor to increased Antarctic temperatures in addition to anthropogenic climate change.\nETH Z\u00fcrich climate researcher Jonathan Wille attributed the heatwave to a \"really rare\" several week long \u201csouthern stratospheric warming event\u201d across the continent. University of Washington atmospheric scientist Edward Blanchard believed that warmer temperatures in the Southern Ocean and decreased sea ice around Antarctica further increased the susceptibility of Antarctica to warmer temperatures during its winter.\nHeat wave\nIn July 2024, a heat wave stuck most of Antarctica, primarily in the Eastern and Central regions of the continent. Average temperatures were at \u22124\u00a0\u00b0C (24.8\u00a0\u00b0F), extensively higher than average winter temperatures, especially for the time typically associated with Antarctica's coldest annual temperatures. As a result, the Southern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent as plotted on a University of Maine Climate Reanalyzer graph reached its second lowest area having at least 15% ice cover on record for its respective day of the year, with only 2023 having a lower area that time of year. Extrapolation of the graph indicated that 2024 would soon surpass 2023 as the lowest ice cover recorded, potentially in August 2024. Decreased ice cover was reported to cause a feedback loop involving more sunlight absorbed in areas with less ice cover, further contributing to warming surface temperature and greater areas of melted ice.\nClimate researchers predicted that average East Antarctic temperatures from 3 August to 13 August would persist at 36 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit above average, higher than temperatures in the last week of July 2024 that were 12\u00a0\u00b0C (21.6\u00a0\u00b0F) above average. The Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station recorded its warmest average July temperature since 2002 at 6.3\u00a0\u00b0C (11.3\u00a0\u00b0F) above average, with an average temperature of \u221247.6\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221253.7\u00a0\u00b0F) from 20 to 30 July, meeting the average February Antarctic temperature at the typical end of summer. Vostok, in the center of Antarctica's ice sheet, also recorded its warmest average July temperature since 2009, at 6.4\u00a0\u00b0C (11.5\u00a0\u00b0F) above average.\nForecasting director of MetDesk Michael Dukes stated that in addition to recordings of exceptionally high daily temperatures at several individual locations, there was a significantly prolonged rise in average temperatures throughout July 2024, which was more impactful towards the melting of ice. Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather stated that the Antarctic heat wave was a primary contributor to the hottest days of the planet in meteorological history recorded during July 2024. University of Washington atmospheric scientist Edward Blanchard called the heat wave a \"n",
    "Painting by George Jones\nFor the musical work by Beethoven, see Wellington's Victory.\nThe Battle of Vittoria is an 1822 history painting by the British artist George Jones. It depicts the Battle of Vittoria fought in Spain on 21 June 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars. The battle resulted in a decisive victory for Allied forces led by the Duke of Wellington, effectively ending the rule of Napoleon's brother Joseph Bonaparte over Spain. Wellington is shown mounted on a white charger and is directing the final assault towards Vittoria. It is set in the early evening with French troops in disarray while British units including the Hussars, Guards and Rifles are shown in command of the field.\nGeorge Jones was himself a veteran of the Peninsular War and went on to become an established artist and member of the Royal Academy. The work was commissioned by George IV. Jones also produced a companion piece depicting the Battle of Waterloo. These were hung together at St James's Palace in London along with De Loutherbourg's Glorious First of June and The Battle of Trafalgar by Jones' friend Turner. However the king disliked the latter and soon had it shifted to Greenwich Hospital. Both works by Jones remain in the Royal Collection.\nJones' 1827 version of The Battle of Vittoria now at Petworth House.\nJones was later commissioned to produce another version of the Battle of Vittoria by Earl of Egremont, whose son Henry Wyndham had served under Wellington during the campaign. It is now at Petworth House in Sussex.\n",

    "Canadian naturalist and ornithologist\nDavid Hamilton Mack Laing (6 Feb 1883 \u2013 15 Feb 1982), known for most of his life as \"Mack Laing\", was a naturalist, writer, ornithologist, artist, photographer, taxidermist and hunter who greatly increased the knowledge of Western Canadian flora and fauna in the early years of the twentieth century. He was a prolific writer about nature; about 900 of his stories appeared in popular magazines of the time. Many of his mounted bird and animal skins, collected during scientific expeditions, are in the collections of museums and universities around the world.\nEarly life and education\nLaing's parents, William Oswald Laing and Rachel Melvina Mack, met in Ontario and wed in 1874, then moved west to the pioneer township of Clearsprings, Manitoba (near Steinbach) to clear bushland and start a farm.:\u200a13\u200a When Rachel became pregnant in 1882, they temporarily returned to Hensall, Ontario to be with her parents. That is where Hamilton Mack Laing was born in February 1883. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved back to Clearsprings, and Laing was raised on their farm.:\u200a17\u200a\nEarly in life, Laing showed a strong interest in birds. He also displayed talent in sketching and painting.:\u200a41\u200a The young boy was given the responsibility of trapping \"bad\" animals, pests and predators that threatened the farm's domestic stock. By age 10, Laing was bartering mink and weasel pelts at the local general store for school supplies. At age 11, Laing was shown how to shoot a rifle:\u200a197\u200a and added crows, hawks and other carnivorous birds to his list of \"bad\" animals.:\u200a22\u200a\nAfter graduating from a local middle school, Laing moved to Winnipeg at the age of 15 to attend Winnipeg Collegiate Institute.:\u200a30\u200a Upon graduating in 1900, Laing took four months to earn a teacher's diploma.:\u200a33\u200a\nTeacher and principal\nLaing taught in various small schools for four years. During this time, Laing began to keep a daily diary of the wildlife he saw, particularly birds, a habit he would keep for the rest of his life. He also took a correspondence course in story writing, and wrote his first published story, \"The End of the Trail\", which appeared in My Tribune Sunday Magazine on 24 March 1907.:\u200a38\u200a This was the first of over 900 stories that would be published over the next seventy years.\nLaing became an art teacher for a year before becoming a high school principal in 1908, a post he would hold for 3 years. The Boy Scout movement arrived in Canada in 1908, and Laing started one of the first  troops in Canada.:\u200a39\u200a His future as an educator seemed assured. But Laing nurtured a secret dream to become a writer-naturalist.:\u200a40\u200a\nTraveller, artist and writer\nBefore colour photography, naturalists were expected to paint accurate pictures of birds. At the end of the 1911 school year, at the age of 28, Laing abruptly resigned his post as principal and moved to Brooklyn, New York to enrol as an art student at the Pratt Institute.:\u200a41\u200a He also learned photography, and started to use his photographs to illustrate the nature stories he was selling to large circulation magazines.:\u200a57\u200a\nWhile still studying art, Laing published his first book in 1913, Out with the Birds, describing the birds of Manitoba. The book was well received, and prominent scientific journal The Auk commented, \"Laing seems not only to know his birds but to know how to tell us about them, and as we turn the pages of his book we share with him the enthusiasm of the nature lover and the excitement of the bird photographer.\"\nUpon graduating from Pratt in the spring of 1914, Laing used the money he had earned from his published stories to buy himself a 1914 Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Assuming he was going to resume his teaching career again, Laing spent the summer of 1914 riding his motorcycle from Brooklyn to Winnipeg, where he applied to be an art teacher. However, a global war had broken out in Europe that had swept up Canada, and no teachers were being hired.:\u200a58\u200a Laing travelled back to New York by train, where he settled down for the winter to write more of his popular nature stories.:\u200a58\u200a\nOn the road with \"Barking Betsy\", 1915\nWhile in New York, he met Francis Harper, who had just returned from an ornithological expedition to Lake Athabasca in northern Canada, and was organizing a return expedition that he hoped would be sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution.:\u200a58\u200a Harper was an admirer of Laing's stories and asked Laing to be a part of his expedition. However, Harper was having trouble with funding, and when the project seemed to be indefinitely stalled, Laing bought another Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which he nicknamed \"Barking Betsy\". Laing rode \"Barking Betsy\" back to Winnipeg in the summer of 1915. With his younger brother Jim outfitted on Laing's older motorcycle, the two rode from Winnipeg to San Francisco, a feat of endurance given the lack of paved roads at the time. Laing's parents, William and Rachel, had retired first to Winnpeg and then to Portla",

As First Secretary, he was a powerful leader in the GDR's most important mining company, the fourth largest uranium producer in the world.\nHe committed suicide in January 1990, having lost power in the Peaceful Revolution.\nLife and career\nEarly career\nRohde was born as the son of a locksmith and a factory worker. He attended elementary and vocational school until Easter 1935. Between April 1935 and February 1939, he trained as a machinist and subsequently worked in this profession in Dresden from March 1939 to October 1940 and in Leipzig from October 1940 to March 1942.\nFrom March 1942 to May 1945, he served in the Wehrmacht. From May to September 1945, Rohde was held as a British prisoner of war in Schleswig-Holstein. After his release, he worked again as a machinist in Dresden until December 1950.\nIn September 1945, he joined the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany) in 1945, which was forcibly merged with the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) to form the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany) in 1946. Additionally, he joined the FDGB (Free German Trade Union Federation) in 1946.\nFrom 1946 to 1950, he was the chairman of the BGL (company trade union leadership) and, after attending the state party school \"Ernst Th\u00e4lmann\" in Mei\u00dfen, served as secretary of the SED party organization at VEB Universelle-Werke, a factory making machines for the production of cigarettes, from January to November 1951 and as a member of an SED city district leadership in Dresden.\nFrom December 1951 to June 1952, he was the head of the organization and instructor department of the Dresden SED and from July 1952 to February 1953, the head of the department for party organs and mass organizations of the Dresden-Land SED.\nFrom February 1953 to September 1955, he participated in the first three-year course at the \"Karl Marx\" Party Academy. He graduated with a diploma in social sciences (Dipl.-Ges.-Wiss.). From November 1955 to June 1966, he subsequently worked as an instructor in the party organs department and as a political staff member in the Central Committee of the SED.\nSDAG Wismut SED\nFormer SDAG Wismut SED building in Chemnitz in August 2008\nIn 1969, Rohde was transferred to the Soviet-German joint-stock company (SDAG) Wismut SED as Second Secretary, succeeding G\u00fcnter Eichmann, who left to study at the Bergakademie Freiberg.\nThe SDAG Wismut SED party organization, titled territorial party leadership (German: Gebietsparteileitung), held the rank of a Bezirk party organization, unlike all other industrial party organizations, as SDAG Wismut was a massive mining undertaking with dozens of locations. It was described as a \"state within a state\".\nIn December 1970, First Secretary Kurt Kie\u00df surprisingly died at the age of 56. Rohde was elected to succeeded him in February 1971. He additionally became a full member of the Central Committee of the SED in June (VIII. Party Congress), serving until its collective resignation in December 1989, and of the Volkskammer in November, nominally representing a constituency in the Ore Mountains in Bezirk Karl-Marx-Stadt.\nRohde was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in bronze in 1968, in silver and in Gold in 1986, the Order of Karl Marx in 1981, the Banner of Labor in 1984 and the Order of Lenin.\nPeaceful Revolution and Death\nDuring the Wende, on 12 November 1989, the SDAG Wismut SED removed him from the position of First Secretary and installed his longtime deputy Heinz Freitag as his successor.

    "American football player (born 1952)\nAmerican football player\nJimmie Dale Kennedy (born July 30,1952) is a former American football player who played for three seasons for the Baltimore Colts of the National Football League (NFL). Throughout his time in the NFL he was a blocking tight end used almost exclusively in short-yardage situations and on special teams as a coverage player on kickoff and punt returns. Kennedy played collegiately for Colorado State University after spending one semester at Hiram College.\nBiography\nEarly years\nJimmie Kennedy was born July 30, 1952, in Laurel, Mississippi. His family moved to Sandusky, Ohio during his childhood and he grew up in that city, attending Perkins High School.\nThe stout Kennedy played as a fullback in high school but never recorded gaudy offensive statistics. \"I've always been a blocker,\" he told the Baltimore Sun in 1976. \"I was a blocking fullback in high school \u2014 I never got a chance to run the ball because I was always blocking.\"\nThis ability would later prove a valuable career skill.\nCollege career\nKennedy first enrolled at Hiram University, a small, private liberal arts school in Ohio where he studied sociology. He transferred to Colorado State University after only one semester, however.\nKennedy was a starter for Colorado state during the 1972 and 1973 seasons \u2014 his junior and senior years, respectively. Once again, Kennedy found himself mostly opening running lanes for teammates, this time as a tight end. \"They didn't even know I could catch until my senior year, they had me blocking so much,\" he later recalled. He relished the role, noting, \"I like to block \u2014 I figure it's just me one-on-one with the dude across the line.\"\nDuring his time at CSU, Kennedy caught a total of 55 balls for 481 yards and 6 touchdowns. His performance as a senior earned him All-Western Athletic Conference honors in 1973.\nProfessional career\nKennedy was selected as a tight end by the Washington Redskins in the 9th round of the 1974 NFL draft. The late-round pick's chances of catching with the club was threatened by the emergence of legal troubles during the summer. The case, an assault charge in Fort Collins, Colorado, stemmed from a fight in an intramural basketball game played shortly before Kennedy graduated from CSU, was expedited at the request of defense counsel due to the coming of NFL training camp. After a short bench trial, on July 2 Judge William Smoke ruled in favor of the plaintiff, sentencing Kennedy to a six-months in jail and a $500 fine \u2014 with the jail term and all but $150 of the fine suspended.\nA photo of Kennedy's career-best 32-yard catch against Tampa Bay made the front page of the Baltimore Sun in 1976.\nHis legal difficulties behind him, Kennedy was able to attend Redskins training camp to attempt to make the newly-expanded 47-man roster. He was a rookie \"on the bubble,\" ultimately released by the Redskins two days before the start of the 1974 season, however. The free agent subsequently signed a deal with the Chicago Fire of the World Football League (WFL) on October 11, 1974.\nKennedy saw action in four games for the Fire, starting at tight end, but the financially troubled team breached his contract, making him once again a free agent.\nKennedy signed with the NFL's Baltimore Colts on April 16, 1975, and made the team's roster as a backup for the rugged Raymond Chester. He appeared in every Colts game of the 1975 and 1976 seasons, playing primarily on special teams and as an extra blocker in short yardage situations.\nSeldom used as an offensive weapon during his career, Kennedy scored his one career touchdown in 1975 against the Los Angeles Rams when he successfully grabbed a pass in the end zone from the 3-yard line. His career long came in 1976 against Tampa Bay, when he snagged a ball in heavy traffic from Colts quarterback Bill Troup and rambled for 32 yards, before being dragged down on the 5-yard line.\nAlways a solid blocker, Kennedy was also an effective special teams coverage player, making 7 tackles and 3 assists on kickoffs and punts during the 1976 season.\nThe league reduced its active roster from 47 players to 43 for the 1977 NFL season and Jimmie Kennedy was one of the victims of the change, falling on September 12, 1977, during the final round of cuts made by the Colts prior to the start of their season. His career was not quite done yet, however, as injury created opportunity and he was brought back by the team on October 20. Kennedy saw action in the last 9 games of the year.\n",
    "2015 young adult novel by Jason Reynolds\nThe Boy in the Black Suit is a 2015 young adult novel by Jason Reynolds.\nIt is a 2016 Coretta Scott King Award honor book.\nPlot\nReception\nThe Boy in the Black Suit received mixed reviews from critics, who often found the plot to be lacking, despite strongly-written characters.\nPublishers Weekly referred to The Boy in the Black Suit as \"an affecting story,\" while Kirkus Reviews called it \"a vivid, satisfying and ultimately upbeat tale of grief, redemption and grace.\" They highlighted how \"Reynolds writes with a gritty realism that beautifully captures the challenges\u2014and rewards\u2014of growing up in the inner city.\" According to School Library Journal, the \"sensitive novel  reads like a light vignette\", despite dealing with \"weighty subjects.\"\nReviewers often praised Reynold's character development, with School Library Journal writing, \"He excels at writing an authentically teenage voice  and his characters are believable without being predictable.\" They added, \"Reynolds has a great ear for dialogue overall and his transitions into memories and back to the present of the narrative are seamless.\" Booklist's Michael Cart called the protagonist \"a wonderfully sympathetic, multidimensional character whose voice is a perfect match for the material and whose relationships  are beautifully realized.\"\nHowever, reviewers often criticized the plot development, with Publishers Weekly noting that the novel's \"faults offset its strengths\". They pointed to \"coincidences and plot twists\" that \"detract from the impact of the story as it develops\", as well as the fact that the \"romantic interest  doesn\u2019t come on the scene until halfway through the book, and the wait feels long.\" Cart agreed the novel \"gets off to a slightly slow start\". However, he found that it \"quickly becomes a superb, character-driven story.\" School Library Journal added, \"By the end of the novel, some of those plot threads are left dangling. Endings wrapped up like presents are not the right thing for every book, but some of these subplots  are tied to characters whose lives were so integral to the main story. When a character is that important and developed, it seems odd when his story just fades away.\"\nBooklist also reviewed the audiobook narrated by Corey Allen.\nIn 2016, The Boy in the Black Suit was named a Coretta Scott King honor book, and the Young Adult Library Services Association included it on their list of the Best Fiction for Young Adults.\n",
    "Pioneer of monotheism in pre-Islamic Arabia\nUmayyah ibn Ab\u012b as-\u1e62alt (Arabic: \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0644\u062a) was a poet of pre-Islamic Arabia who advocated for monotheism instead of the worship of idols. He was thought to be a member of the Banu Thaqif tribe, with Qurayshi descent on his maternal side. During the rise of Islam, Umayya is said to have become a claimant to prophethood and rivalled Muhammad, which earned him a controversial position in Islamic tradition.\nBiography\nUmayya was born in Taif. His full name is Umayya ibn Abi as-Salt al-Thaqafi, and his full lineage is Umayya ibn Abi as-Salt ibn Abdullah ibn Abi Rabi'ah ibn 'Awf ibn Thaqif. Hence, his lineage is traced back to the tribe of Banu Thaqif. His mother was a woman named Ruqayya, the great-granddaughter of the Arabian patriarch Qusayy ibn Kilab, thus maternally he has descent from the Quraysh.\nReligious beliefs\nSee also: Monotheism in pre-Islamic Arabia\nUmayya believed in monotheism, and rejected the worship of idols that classical tradition has described as being prevalent amongst his contemporaries. According to 11th-century historian Ibn Asakir, Umayya lived during the rise of Islam in the 7th century but refused to convert either out of spite, hatred, or confusion; all three reasons have been presented in the Tarikh Dimashq. In the Tazkirul Quran, it is stated that Umayya was an opponent of Muhammad who also claimed Prophethood out of jealousy when he realized the revelation was not given to him. Hadith scholar Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani affirms that Umayya did not accept Islam at all until his death in 626 CE (the ninth year of the Hijra).\nPoetry\nMain article: Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry\nIn 1934\u20131936, the Lebanese scholar Bashir Yamut collected several poems attributed to Umayya, compiling them in a book known as the D\u012bw\u0101n Umayyah ibn Ab\u012b al-\u1e62alt. Another Diwan has also been published in Beirut, Lebanon by Dar Sadr in 1998. The authenticity of the poems and its attribution to Umayya have been put into question.\nThemes\nAs a poet, Umayya wrote poems on the pre-Islamic wars, such as the wars between the Aws and Khazraj and the Basus War between the Banu Bakr and Banu Taghlib. In his Diwan, the poetry featured there focuses on themes of wisdom and beauty.\nComparison to the Quran\nUmayya's poetry overlaps with some of the content of the Quran. Both Umayya and the Quran treat similar prominent topics in the domains of creation, eschatology, and episodes of biblical prophetology. For example, both treat the story of the tribe of Thamud and the she-camel. Likewise, both include the idea that demons or jinn attempt to ascend to the firmament before being pelted by heavenly defense systems.\nSee also\nIlyas ibn Mudar\nWaraqah ibn Nawfal\nZayd ibn Amr",
    "Social media trendTalahon refers to a German trend on TikTok and other social media platforms in 2024. The trend is characterised by videos of young men, often with a Muslim migrant background, especially from Arab countries such as Syria, adopting aggressive postures and showcasing luxurious, albeit often fake, accessories. The phenomenon is deeply rooted in a specific portrayal of patriarchy, masculinity, misogyny and materialism, and it has sparked widespread discussion and controversy. Talahon was nominated as the Youth Word of the Year in Germany.\nMeaning\nThe term \"Talahon\" does not have a fixed definition, but it is believed to derive from the Arabic phrase \"taeal huna,\" (Arabic: \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644 \u0647\u0646\u0627) meaning \"come here,\" or from the song \"Ta3al Lahon\" by Syrian-German rapper Hassan, released in 2022. The song's lyrics, which discuss life on the streets, violence, and crime, are reflective of the themes prevalent in the \"Talahon\" trend. Young men identified as \"Talahon\" often display a distinctive style that includes luxury brand tracksuits, Gucci caps, and gold chains.\nCultural context\nThe \"Talahon\" trend has become a symbol of a particular youth subculture that is both celebrated and criticised. Videos often feature participants shadowboxing or performing martial arts kicks while wearing ostentatious clothing and accessories. This portrayal is meant to convey male dominance, fearlessness, and strength, resonating with some youths who see it as a form of self-expression and empowerment.\nCriticism\nCritics argue that the trend perpetuates stereotypes about young men from migrant backgrounds, portraying them as violent, misogynistic, and obsessed with material wealth. This has led to a polarised reception, with some using the term \"Talahon\" ironically to mock these stereotypes, while others embrace it as an authentic representation of their identity.\nThe \"Talahon\" trend has faced significant backlash for its perceived glorification of violence and its patriarchal and misogynistic undertones.\nIntegration experts have criticised the trend, arguing that it promotes a regressive worldview that is harmful to societal cohesion. Additionally, there are concerns about the trend being co-opted by right-wing groups to further marginalise and stigmatise young men with migrant backgrounds.\n",

    "1885 set of photographs\nSitting Bull and Buffalo Bill is a set of studio photographs of the Hunkpapa Lakota leader Sitting Bull and the entertainer Buffalo Bill, taken in Montreal in 1885. The session was held at the studio of William Notman during a North American tour of Buffalo Bill's Wild West, the Wild West show which enrolled Sitting Bull for a single season. The eight joint portraits of Sitting Bull and \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody were part of a commission for 47 photographs, which were printed and sold as cabinet cards during the tour.\nNine years prior to the session, Sitting Bull and Cody both famously participated in the Great Sioux War of 1876 on opposite sides. For this reason, the most widely distributed of Notman's dual portraits was frequently captioned \"Enemies in '76, Friends in '85\". It shows Cody pointing to an imagined horizon as he and Sitting Bull jointly hold a Winchester rifle. They are dressed in their archetypal show clothes and stand in front of a painted backdrop of a forest, as in the other dual portraits. Although interpretations of the pose vary, this image is considered emblematic of American history and culture.\nNotman's photographs helped establish the trope of the \"Cowboys and Indians\", a core element of the Western genre. They are also among the last taken of Sitting Bull before his killing by police in 1890. The depiction of his relationship with Cody in Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill has been analyzed and criticized by scholars in relation to the settler colonialism of the American territory.\nBackground\nGreat Sioux War of 1876\nIllustration of the \"first scalp for Custer\" found in promotional material for Buffalo Bill's Wild West\nOn 25 June 1876, as part of the Great Sioux War, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer commanded the 7th Cavalry Regiment against a coalition of Native American tribes, partly led by the Hunkpapa Lakota chief and medicine man Sitting Bull. The native coalition won the battle, killing Custer and everyone under his immediate command. The Battle of the Little Bighorn, as it became known, garnered considerable public interest but had little effect on the outcome of the war. The US army retaliated by sending more soldiers to the region, and the native coalition was fragmented. In the spring of 1877, Sitting Bull and his group exiled themselves in Canada.\nDuring the Great Sioux War, the showman, soldier and hunter William F. Cody, better known as Buffalo Bill, was chief of scouts of the 5th Cavalry Regiment. Although he did not participate in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, he was a past acquaintance of Custer. A month after the battle, during a skirmish at Warbonnet Creek, he killed and scalped a Cheyenne warrior, Yellow Hair, and allegedly proclaimed the event as \"the first scalp for Custer\", in honour of the commander. Cody's dramatization of the incident furthered his career as a showman, eventually becoming part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West, the show which he created in 1883.\nBuffalo Bill's Wild West\nProgram cover for the 1885 season\nIn 1881, after a four-year exile in Canada which was marked by insufficient food and resources, Sitting Bull returned to the border and surrendered to United States officials. He was a federal prisoner of war at Fort Randall until his release in 1883, after which he was made to live at the Standing Rock Agency as a ward of the American government. In 1885, Cody expressed interest in recruiting him to the Wild West. The show, made up of dramatized reenactments of recent episodes in American frontier history, enrolled Native Americans as performers. Although Sitting Bull was open to the idea, which would allow him to leave the reservation, Secretary of the Interior Lucius Q. C. Lamar was initially firmly opposed. After relentless pressure from Cody and his manager, John Burke, Lamar eventually relented and agreed for Sitting Bull to appear in the show's parade and in the arena, although not as a performer in the reenactments.\nOn 6 June, Sitting Bull signed a four-month contract with the Wild West, which paid him $50 (equivalent to $1,696 in 2023) per week with a bonus of $125 (equivalent to $4,239 in 2023). He also insisted on a clause giving him the exclusive right to sell souvenir photographs of himself and to charge a sitting fee to those who would wish to pose with him. On 12 June 1885, he joined the show in  Buffalo, New York, one of 40 American and Canadian cities in the itinerary. He quickly became one of its central attractions, contributing to the financial success of the 1885 season. His performance consisted in riding into the arena, alone on his mustang, and being taunted as the murderer of George Armstrong Custer. While he was generally booed in the United States, he was cheered on in Canada, where the show toured in the summer. In Montreal, where the Wild West arrived on 10 August and settled for a week (in the neighbourhood of Pointe-Saint-Charles), Sitting Bull was treated as an important visitor; he was presented t",

It was supposed to be a rock opera in which utopian socialists sing and dance. The theme of socialist utopia did not leave Gradsky, so in 1979, he recorded an album that included poems by Pierre-Jean de B\u00e9ranger, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Robert Burns, which at one time were revolutionary songs.\nThe record Utopiya A.

Neither the ideologically correct theme, nor Gradsky's connections, nor the neutral genre of the song suite, nor even the presence of a hammer and sickle on the cover helped her break through. The album was released only in 1987, when sympathy for the ideals of socialism was inappropriate.\nCritical reception\nIn a retrospective review of the Muzykalnaya zhizn\u00a0 magazine, Denis Boyarinov noted that the record, which is an unusual combination of times and epochs, was released at a time when it seemed completely inappropriate, because then people were hungry for change. The reviewer also added that now it resembles a giant majolica made in sound for the glory of socialism, which still pop up in small towns lost in the snows of Russia\u2014sometimes it's the best thing there, shiny fragments of illusion, pure psychedelia.\nTrack listing\nAll music is composed by Alexander Gradsky\nPersonnel\nAlexander Gradsky \u2013 vocals, synthesizer, guitar, piano, celesta, drums, bells, percussion\nVladimir Vasilkov \u2013 percussion\nSergey Zenko \u2013 flute, pipe, saxophone\nSkoromorokhi \u2013 backing band\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n",

    "\nThe Hardy Players in a scene from The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall, November 1923\nThe Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall, or, to give its full title, The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse: A New Version of an Old Story, Arranged as a Play for Mummers in One Act, Requiring No Theatre or Scenery, is a verse tragedy by Thomas Hardy based on the medieval legend of Tristan and Iseult.  His last substantial creative work, it was written, published and first performed (by an amateur group, the Hardy Players) in 1923, and revised in 1924.  It is now seldom performed and has had a mixed reception from critics.  In 1924 it was adapted as an opera by Rutland Boughton.\nSynopsis\nAfter a prologue by Merlin the play proper opens with both King Mark of Cornwall and his queen, Iseult, returning to Tintagel from separate sea-voyages.  We learn that Queen Iseult has travelled toward Brittany to find her old lover, Tristram, whom she believed to be dying, and has called off her voyage only on hearing a false report that he was already dead.  Suspicious of his wife, Mark has his man Andret keep watch on her.  Tristram now comes to Tintagel disguised as a harper, and contrives to meet the queen alone.  Tristram's wife, Iseult the Whitehanded, also arrives in search of her husband and tries to persuade him to return home.  Mark discovers Tristram's presence and fatally stabs him in the back.  The queen picks up the same dagger and kills Mark with it, then throws herself off the castle walls to her own death.  Iseult the Whitehanded enters, discovers the bodies, and sets off on her homeward journey.  The epilogue is again spoken by Merlin.\nComposition and publication\nThe history of the play goes back as far as 1870, when Hardy, living for a short while in Cornwall, began his courtship of Emma Lavinia Gifford, the woman who was to become his first wife, and visited the ruins of Tintagel Castle with her.  The version of the Tristan legend he then began to plan only started to take solid form in September 1916, after Emma's death, when he revisited Tintagel along with his second wife, Florence.  Though he soon put this project aside, he resumed it in 1923, finished a first draft in April of that year, and completed the play in August 1923.  It was published on 15 November, and appreciatively reviewed by the critics.  A second and slightly expanded edition with a different numeration of the scenes followed in 1924.\nEarly performances\nThomas Hardy (centre) attending a rehearsal of The Queen of Cornwall at the Corn Exchange, Dorchester\nThe first performance of the play was given by the Hardy Players, an amateur troupe in Dorchester, and was intended to star their leading actress, Gertrude Bugler, though her pregnancy prevented this.  Hardy himself was closely involved in the production, as was Harley Granville-Barker, an eminent theatrical figure to whom Hardy sent an early copy of the script and who responded with appreciative criticism of the play itself and of the approach to it of the Hardy Players, one of whose rehearsals he attended.  The play was performed at the Corn Exchange in Dorchester on 28, 29 and 30 November 1923, and the Hardy Players then took the production to London to be played at King George's Hall on 21 February the following year.  It was also performed in Bournemouth on 25 April 1924.  Reviews noted the difficulties presented to amateur actors by the play's archaic style, and even Hardy's wife Florence could only claim that these had been \"more or less overcome\", while admitting that the Hardy Players were better in rustic comedies.  Since 1924 there have been very few productions, though the play was notably performed on BBC radio on 28 February 1956 (repeated the following April), with Mary Morris as Queen Iseult, Rachel Gurney as Iseult the Whitehanded, and incidental music by Norman Demuth.\nLiterary sources\nThe dramatic form of The Queen of Cornwall was influenced by Hardy's respect for the conventions of Greek tragedy.  Aristotle, in his Poetics, lays down that the action should all take place in the same place and within a period of 24 hours.  Hardy followed both of these rules, and indeed the action of his play is in one unbroken sequence operating in real time.  He also employed a chorus to comment on the unfolding plot, though he called them Chanters.\nThe plot is taken from the Tristan and Isolde legend as it was told and retold in medieval and modern literature.  His medieval sources have been identified as the romances of Thomas of Britain, Gottfried von Strassburg, and Sir Thomas Malory.  The influence of Gottfried von Strassburg's Tristan has also been detected in Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure.  The original medieval form of the Tristan legend has not survived, but an attempt to reconstruct it was made by the 19th-century scholar Joseph B\u00e9dier, and Hardy is known to have owned a copy of the English translation of B\u00e9dier's work.\nIn a let",
    "Indigenous Tasmanian leader\n1835 painting of Woureddy by Thomas Bock\nWoureddy (c.1790 \u2013 7 July 1842), also known as Wurati, Woorady and Mutteelee, was a leading warrior and cleverman from the Nuenonne clan of Aboriginal Tasmanians in Australia. \nHe acted as a guide for George Augustus Robinson in his expeditions to round up the remaining Indigenous people of Tasmania during the early 1830s.\nWoureddy was a highly significant figure in communicating Indigenous culture to Robinson and his disclosures remain a prime source of information about pre-colonial Aboriginal Tasmanian customs. He was also the husband of Truganini for period of around ten years.\nHis image, and the busts of him and Truganini have over time been utilised and incorporated in conversations about the past in Tasmania.  The image by Thomas Bock is utilised in Cassandra Pybus's biography of Truganini.\nEarly life\nWoureddy was born around the year 1790 on Nuenonne country which included the region around Bruny Island (Lunawanna-alonnah) and Recherche Bay (Lyleatea) in southern Tasmania.\nAs a young child he remembered observing the French explorers, led by Rear Admiral Bruni D'Entrecasteaux and Captain Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec arriving in Recherche Bay in 1792. The French came ashore and carved images on a tree which the Nuenonne were terrified of, later destroying the tree thinking it was the work of the evil spirit they called Rageowrapper.\nIn 1804, Woureddy also witnessed the arrival of the British ships to colonise what is now the Hobart (Nibbaluna) region. He remembered the resultant conflict between the invaders and the resident Mouheneena clan who lived there in a village called Kreewer upon which the suburb of Sandy Bay is now located.\nHe also recalled white shingle-splitters abducting local black women from around the Huon River and shooting the black men if they resisted the taking of the females.\nAs a young man, Woureddy's life was still lived in a mostly traditional way isolated from the influence of the British colonists. He grew his hair into a distinctive mop of dreadlocks styled with red ochre and animal fat. His family were esteemed warriors with his brother a renowned strongman. When his brother was killed in inter-tribal conflict, Woureddy took vengeance by raping and killing his brother's former wife who was implicated in his brother's death.\nWoureddy was also considered a cleverman and custodian of his people's culture and beliefs. He excelled in the construction of catamarans, which the Nuenonne and associated clans used to conduct dangerous voyages to offshore islands such as De Witt Island to hunt seals. These vessels were made large enough to fit eight men.\nHe married and had three sons, the oldest named Myunge born around 1818 and the second was called Droyerloine born around 1820. The youngest child's traditional name is unknown.\nAssociation with George Augustus Robinson\nBy the late 1820s, the British had expanded their hold in Van Dieman's Land (as Tasmania was then known), and established several whaling and lumber stations on Bruny Island. Violence, displacement and disease brought by the British had a hugely detrimental effect to the lives of the Nuenonne.  In 1828, the Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land, Colonel George Arthur, ordered the creation of an Aboriginal ration station on the island, which in 1829 was placed under the authority of an English builder and evangelical Christian named George Augustus Robinson.\nWith the assistance of a local female teenager named Truganini, Robinson initially had some success protecting the Indigenous people at his establishment. But by October 1829, the deaths continued and only a handful of Nuenonne had survived. Woureddy's wife and youngest child died of illness. To strengthen paternal bonds he had with the survivors, Robinson oversaw the partnering of the newly widowed Woureddy with the much younger Truganini.\nThe \"friendly mission\"\nBronze bust of Woureddy\nRealising that the Aboriginal station at Bruny Island was doomed, Robinson formulated a scheme to use Woureddy, Woureddy's two sons, as well as Truganini and a few other captured Aboriginal people such as Kikatapula and Pagerly, to guide him to the clans residing in the uncolonised western parts of Van Diemen's Land. Once contacted, Robinson would \"conciliate\" these clans to accept the British invasion and avoid conflict. Lieutenant-Governor Arthur approved Robinson's plan and employed him to conduct this venture which was named the \"friendly mission\".\nThe mission left Bruny Island in early 1830 with Woureddy  playing a very important role as a guide and instructor on local Aboriginal language and culture. He also provided the skills to design and build watercraft for the group to navigate the various rivers they encountered.\nWoureddy educated Robinson about the clans of western Van Diemen's Land, whom he regarded with distrust and collectively referred to as the Toogee people. Robinson decided the mission did ",

    "French resistance network\nThe Saint-Jacques network (French: R\u00e9seau Saint-Jacques) was the first French resistance network of World War II. It was founded by Maurice Duclos - whose codename was Saint-Jacques - and operated under the auspices of Charles de Gaulle's Free France in London.\nHistory\nD\u00e9but with Free France\nFollowing his experience in the Norwegian campaign of 1940, Duclos' unit returned to Brittany but was surrounded by Nazi forces at Pl\u00e9n\u00e9e-Jugon on 17 June. With some colleagues he escaped via Jersey on a fishing boat, reaching England on 21 June, just as France signed the armistice with the Nazis. On 1 July, he joined de Gaulle's Free French in London as a deputy to Andr\u00e9 Dewavrin. Duclos suggested Paris station names as codenames; he chose Saint Jacques for himself, Dewavrin became colonel Passy, Gilbert Renault became R\u00e9my, Pierre Fourcaud (Dewavrin's other deputy) became Barb\u00e8s and Duclos' friend Alexandre Beresnikoff became Corvisart, amongst others.\nImplementation of the network\nDuclos and Beresnikoff landed off a dinghy released from a Royal Navy launch at Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados, on the evening of 4 August, with plans to assess the possibility of Adolf Hitler invading England. They sank their dinghy and went along the coast carrying a basket of carrier pigeons, securing themselves in a crevice under a Nazi guard post. They entered Saint-Aubin and went on their separate missions. Duclos reconnoitred by bicycle. He collected information on Nazi positions between Honfleur and Isigny. Without permission, he recruited a local civil engineer, F\u00e9lix Bruneau, to operate an \"action sector\" to create a climate of insecurity amongst the Wehrmacht. He went to Paris, where he created the Saint-Jacques network at his own premises at the Place Vend\u00f4me. In mid-August, he asked disaffected commandant Jean V\u00e9rines, a veteran of World War I, to be his lieutenant; V\u00e9rines' son, Guy, also joined the Saint-Jacques network. Between them, they recruited large numbers from La Garde (republican guards), gendarmes and sapeurs-pompiers (army fire crews) across northern France. Duclos also laid plans for  the Paris Job network and then helped Renault to found the Confr\u00e9rie Notre-Dame network.\nConsolidation and Vichy contacts\nHe met a former colleague from La Cagoule, journalist Gabriel Jeantet, who was now director of propaganda in the Vichy r\u00e9gime. Jeantet introduced him to others in the regime and contacts were maintained for the duration of the Nazi occupation. Duclos crossed between the Zone occup\u00e9e and the Zone libre adding contacts for his networks, particularly those working in railway infrastructure and utilities such as electricity distribution. He entered Spain in November via Perpignan before returning to London on 24 December.:\u200a74\u201375\u200a\nPlaque at the H\u00f4tel Delpech de Chaunot, Paris, commemorating the first French Resistance radio link between Paris and London, created by the first Resistance network,Saint-Jacques.\nHis report to Dewavrin of the Vichy organisation was not as favourable as that of Fourcaud, despite the useful connexions he'd made; he did not regard Vichy staff as combative enough. Nonetheless, Dewavrin was happy that three networks had been installed. He instructed Duclos to develop the network in the region between Paris, Caen and Dunkirk to gain as much information as possible about the Armistice Commission headquartered in Wiesbaden. In February 1941, he was dropped from a bomber over the Dordogne but broke one leg and sprained the other landing in woods. He made it to a farm but the doctor called by the farmer reported him to the police. He was arrested and taken to hospital in P\u00e9rigueux. Within a month he was released, with the help of Fourcaud contacting old colleagues in Vichy. He made it to the Zone occup\u00e9e, aided by a contact of Renault, and in Paris by April, he set up a radio link to London.:\u200a74\u201375\u200a\nCompromise and collapse\nV\u00e9rines had become very active amongst the gendarmerie but also recruited civilians, including abbot fr:Roger Derry. From his home in Neuilly, Duclos ran his network. He took Charles Deguy as an assistant, whose job in an oil company on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es provided key contacts and enabled him to cross the demarcation line with British military staff in the boot of his car. Reports were also sent by Roger Wybot from within the Vichy set-up who made links with Fourcaud and Saint-Jacques and saved many agents from arrest. Duclos went to Nantes in mid-June. He suspected his radio operator was a traitor and asked to use Renault's operator to transmit messages. Duclos' operator eventually gave details of all the Saint-Jacques members to the Nazis.:\u200a75\u201376\u200a\nOn 8 August, the Gestapo set a trap at the home of Saint-Jacques operative Marcel Halbout in Rouen, which led to the unravelling of the network through August and September. Renault evaded the trap. Duclos had only just returned from installing an antenna at Le Havre, became suspicious around Halbout's home and ",
    "Country house in Colwall, Herefordshire\nPerrycroft is a country house in the district of Colwall, Herefordshire, England. The house was built between 1893-1895 and was designed by C. F. A. Voysey for John William Wilson. Perrycroft is a Grade II* listed building.\nHistory\nJohn William Wilson, PC, JP (22 October 1858 \u2013 18 June 1932) was a British chemical manufacturer and politician who served for 27 years as a Liberal member of parliament (MP) for North Worcestershire. His father, John Edward Wilson, had founded the chemical manufacturers, Albright and Wilson, in 1856, in partnership with his fellow Quaker, Arthur Albright. The firm specialised in phosphorus production, principally for the making of matches and became extremely successful. John William Wilson followed his father onto the board of Albright and Wilson, and also held directorships with other major concerns, including Bryant & May and the Great Western Railway.\nWilson knew the area of the Malvern Hills through family connections, and it was proximate to the Oldbury site of the Albright and Wilson works. In 1893 he bought 80 acres of land around Colwall and commissioned Charles Vosey to design a country house. Pevsner records the price as \u00a34,900. Perrycroft was Vosey's first major commission and did much to establish his reputation.\nPerrycroft remains privately owned but the gardens and house are occasionally opened for visitors.\nArchitecture and description\nThe house is designed in Vosey's trademark Arts and Crafts style. The hipped roofs are of green/grey slate, with sweeping eaves, and five monumental chimney stacks. The bell bracket on the \"pagoda-like\" tower at the entrance front displays another typical Vosey feature; the bracket is a stylised human face or grotesque, a device he often deployed.

    "Cemetery in Laceby, Lincolnshire, England\nLaceby War Memorial in Laceby Cemetery in 2024\nLaceby Cemetery is the burial ground for the village of Laceby in Lincolnshire. Owned and maintained by Laceby Parish Council, it is notable for the Grade II listed Haagensen Memorial and Vault in its grounds which was erected in 1897.\nHistory\nLaceby Cemetery opened in July 1875, presumably when the churchyard of the parish church, St Margaret's, became full. The cemetery is made up of several acres of former farmland purchased by the Village Council. As each field filled with burials the council would buy more farmland for use as a cemetery. These fields were then divided into Sections, and, as of 2024, there are 12 Sections in the Laceby Cemetery together with two sections known as the Gardens of Remembrance for the burial of cremated remains.\nWar Memorials\nThe grave of Sapper Arthur Lyne Hewitt RE in Laceby Cemetery\nAt the entrance to the cemetery can be found the Laceby War Memorial, a granite cross commemorating the men of the village who died in the two World Wars.\nAlso in the cemetery can be found the graves of four military personnel, three from World War I and one from World War II, with their distinctive Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) headstones. These are:\n1530 Driver Fred Plaskitt, 1st North Midland Bde., Royal Field Artillery, who died on 22 May 1915, aged 29\n72638 Sapper Arthur Lyne Hewitt, F.S. Signal Depot, Royal Engineers, who died on 5 November 1915, aged 29\n12659 Private R W Twidale, 7th Bn. Lincolnshire Regiment, who died on 28 April 1916, aged 20\nLT/JX 222462 Seaman RNPS George Perring, HMS Killingholme, who died on 2 October 1945, aged 49.\nThe grave of Sqn Ldr G. A. Butler in Laceby Cemetery\nHere too are buried the ashes of Squadron Leader George Alexander Butler, DSO, DFC, together with those of his wife Betty Joan Butler. Butler served with the RAF during World War II as a pilot with 139 Sqdn, No 2 Group, Bomber Command, RAF in the UK (1941-1942); with 60 Sqdn, Air Forces in India, RAF in India, 1942-1944; and who later commanded 11 Sqdn, No 902 Wing, Headquarters Royal Air Force Bengal and Burma, RAF in Burma, (1944-1945).\nHaagensen Memorial and Vault\nThe File:Haagensen Memorial and Vault in the cemetery\nThe Haagensen Memorial with its subterranean vault was erected in 1897. The memorial has been Grade II listed since 2015. The statue, carved from a single block of white Carrara marble, depicts Janna Eleanora Andrea Haagensen, the wife of  Peter Haagensen, the Consul for Sweden and Norway in Grimsby, and their four children. Janna Haagensen is shown being guided towards heaven by an angel while her four young children emerge from two tree stumps and reach up to her imploringly. Janna looks down at her children while her raised right arm has turned into a branch of a tree; her left is held by the angel. The epitaph is carved in relief and reads:\nIN MEMORY OF \nCONSUL PETER HENRIK HAAGENSEN \nBORN AT MOSS NORWAY 3RD AUGUST 1837 \nDIED AT BOURNMOUTH MAY 12TH 1919 \nAND OF HIS BELOVED WIFE \nJANNA \nBORN AT VINGER NORWAY 7TH SEPT 1845 \nDIED AT GRIMSBY 11TH DECR 1897 \nTO THE GLORY OF GOD \nIN THE \nHOPE OF RESURRECTION AND RECOGNITION IN ETERNITY.\nThe citation for the Grade II listing states:\nArchitectural and Sculptural quality: the striking design and aesthetic quality of the statue achieves a high level of sculptural quality, which is echoed in the design and artistic quality of the marble-lined vault with its relief depictions of Peter and Janna Haagensen.\nThe Haagensen Memorial in 2024\nIt is thought that Peter Haagensen had originally intended to build a vault at Grimsby Cemetery, but this had been refused, so instead he built his marble-lined family vault at nearby Laceby Cemetery. On the death and internment in the vault of his wife Janna Haagensen in 1897 he had the marble memorial statue erected above it. Peter Haagensen joined his wife on his own death in 1919 after a service held in Norwegian. The memorial's original inscription has been altered at some time, as old picture postcards reveal that the inscription had included the names of their four children: Henry (1875\u20131943), Clara Lina Andrea (1876\u20131963), the artist Frederick Hans (1878\u20131943), and Margit Maud Haagensen (1882\u20131970). This has been removed and the place of Peter's death added in its place.\nView of the statuary on the Haagensen Memorial\nSuch was the fame of the memorial that during the first half of the 20th century it regularly received numerous day trippers arriving by coach from Cleethorpes. The numbers of visitors were sufficient to support the nearby  Laceby Tearooms and the memorial appeared on numerous picture postcards and was reproduced in glazed Goss pottery replicas.\nThe marble lined vault with its segmented arched roof is accessed by steps under twelve cast-iron hinged and padlocked flaps. Its plain mosaic floor has a coloured border of mosaic flowers. The vault's northern wall has a carved portrait in relief o",
    "Adriana Georgescu-Cosmovici (July 23, 1920 \u2013 October 29, 2005) was a political prisoner and memoirist from Romania, who emigrated to Western Europe in 1948.\nBiography\nBorn in Bucharest, Adriana Georgescu completed her secondary studies in 1939 at the Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu High School. After graduating in 1944 from the Faculty of Law of the University of Bucharest, she became the private secretary of General Nicolae R\u0103descu. After the fall of the R\u0103descu government on February 28, 1945, she was arrested on July 29 of that year; held at Malmaison Prison in Bucharest, she was subjected to rape and torture. In her memoirs, she recounted the manner in which she had been tortured by a team of which Alexandru Nicolschi was a member, and indicated that the latter had been one of the three to have threatened her with guns. She also detailed various torture methods (including vicious beatings of detainees) Nicolschi personally engaged in during interrogations at Malmaison Prison. After a trial (where she detailed the torture and rape she endured during interrogation), she was sentenced in September 1945 to 4 years of prison for \"plotting against the social order\". She was pardoned by King Michael I in April 1947. Rearrested in August of that year, she was released after a few weeks of investigation.\nOn August 2, 1948, she managed to leave Romania clandestinely, together with her future husband, \u0218tefan Cosmovici, taking refuge in Vienna, then in Paris. Later, she became a correspondent for Radio Free Europe (1952\u20131957 and 1965\u20131967) and BBC Radio's Romanian section. After marrying the English officer and author Frank Lorimer Westwater, she became a citizen of the Great Britain in 1961. She died in London at age 85.\nWorks\nAu commencement \u00e9tait la fin: la dictature rouge \u00e0 Bucarest, (Paris: Hachette, 1951)\n1951: La \u00eenceput a fost sf\u00e2r\u0219itul, published in Romania by Humanitas Publishing House, 1992, and Cultural Foundation Memoria, 1999.

He eventually migrated to Germany and worked with a music company.\nSandy Group\nIn 1987, Shahram Azar, along with Behzad Pishro, Reza Samiri, and Ahmad Abdollahi, formed the band Sandy in Frankfurt, Germany. The group's music blends pop lyrics with techno and Bandari influences. Sandy was one of the first bands to address social issues faced by Iranian youth, such as marriage, addiction, and immigration. They also pioneered Persian rap with songs like \"Boro Baba\" and \"Pari.\"\nAzar's contributions to Sandy include singing, music composition, arranging songs, producing, and writing lyrics. He is also recognized as one of the best keyboard players in Iranian music history.\nBand Members:\nShahram Khosroshahi Azar: Lead singer, composer, arranger, producer, and lyricist.\nKhashayar Khosroshahi Azar: Shahram's son, who started playing the keyboard at age five and officially joined Sandy in 2002.\nBehzad Pishro: Began his music career in Abadan and collaborated with various artists before co-founding Sandy.

It was the first full-length rock record officially released in the Soviet Union. The album is a conceptual one and consists of Russian folk songs in a modern rock treatment.\nThe album was recorded with the participation of Gradsky's musical band Skoromorokhi\u00a0.\nBackground\nThe idea of recording this album came to Alexander Gradsky in 1976, when, as a student of the Moscow Conservatory, he participated in recording and decoding works of Russian folklore. The first five tracks of the album were recorded in 1976, the final three in 1979.\nThe music and lyrics of most of the songs are traditional; Gradsky prepared arrangements of all the compositions, as well as completed the last verse in the \"Tanya belaya\". In addition, the album included the revolutionary song \t\"Vy zhertvoyu pali\", written at the end of the XIX century by Anton Amosov; when recording, an instrumental fragment was added to the end of the song.\nThe synthesizer Synthi 100, brought to the USSR by Peter Zinovieff, the creator of EMS, was widely used in the recording of the album.\nCritical reception\nWriter and journalist Vasiliy Golovanov, on the pages of Yunost magazine in March 1985, named the album among the most significant domestic works that managed to \"squeeze out\" English-language rock.\nIn a retrospective review for Colta, Denis Boyarinov stated that Gradsky does not try to fit a folk song to rock and roll schemes, does not engage in stylization and ornamentation. He leaves the authentic elements inherent in the folk song style \u2014 unusual musical dimensions, free-floating accents, archaic words, but at the same time boldly reshapes melodies, treating the ancient song as his own, or, overcome by compositional ambitions and inspired by the studio experiments of the Beatles and George Martin, inserts quotes from Bach, Stravinsky and \"Farewell of Slavianka\", references to Chaliapin, Lemeshev and musique concr\u00e8te.\nMeduza magazine included the song \"Tanya Belaya\" in the list of 13 important songs performed by Gradsky.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAlexander Gradsky \u2013 vocals, synthesizer, guitar, piano, celesta, drums, bells, percussion\nYuri Ivanov \u2013 bass guitar, harmonica\nVladimir Vasilkov \u2013 percussion\nSergey Zenko \u2013 flute, pipe, saxophone\nSkoromorokhi \u2013 backing band\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n",

    "Mountain in Montana, United States\nMiller Mountain is a 10,494-foot (3,199-metre) summit in Park County, Montana, United States.\nDescription\nMiller Mountain is located 2.85 miles (4.59\u00a0km) northwest of Cooke City, Montana, in the Beartooth Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. It is set within the New World Mining District and the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's north slope drains into headwaters of the Stillwater River, whereas the south slope drains into Sheep Creek \u2192 Soda Butte Creek \u2192 Lamar River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 2,000 feet (610 meters) above Sheep Creek in one mile (1.6\u00a0km). The mountain is composed of gabbro, Miocene breccia, and Eocene monzonite porphyry. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names, and has been featured in publications since at least 1911. The mountain is named after Adam \"Horn\" Miller (1839\u20131913), who was one of the four trappers who discovered and named the New World Mining District in 1869, with the others being Bart Henderson, J. H. Moore, and James Gourley. Adam Miller staked a claim that he called Shoo Fly Mine at the 9,300-foot-elevation level on the south slope of this mountain which would bear his name. From 1878 through the late 1880s, the Shoo Fly produced gold, copper, and lead-silver ore, but it closed in 1893 to never reopen. (Henderson Mountain is 1.61 miles (2.59\u00a0km) east-northeast of Miller Mountain).\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Miller Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F.\nSee also\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains",
    "\nAntoine Breguet (born in Paris on (1851-01-26)January 26, 1851 and died in Paris 1st on (1882-07-08)July 8, 1882), was a French physicist, the great-grandson of the watchmaker and physicist Abraham Breguet, son of physicist Louis Cl\u00e9ment Fran\u00e7ois Breguet (1804-1883), and father of aviation pioneers Louis Charles Breguet (1880-1955) and Jacques Eug\u00e8ne Henri Breguet (1881-1939). His daughter Madeleine Camille Breguet (1878-1900) married Jacques Bizet (1872-1922), son of composer Georges Bizet, in 1898 but died prematurely without descendants at the age of 21.\nBiography\nIn 1870, while still a student, Antoine Breguet was employed in the battalion of auxiliary miners of the engineering corps formed by chief mining engineer Eug\u00e8ne Jacquot to participate in the defense of the capital. Two years later, he entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, becoming the first member of his family to pursue higher education. After graduating from Polytechnique, he joined the family business.\nThe company, while maintaining its headquarters at the Quai de l'Horloge, had since 1872 workshops at 81, Boulevard du Montparnasse (6th arrondissement) better suited to its activities, which began to take on an industrial character. Antoine Breguet built the Gramme machine there and signed a treaty with Z\u00e9nobe Gramme in 1875. He then wrote a book on the theory of the Gramme machine, published in 1880. He constructed experimental and laboratory apparatus: electromagnets, induction coils, capacitors. He invented a recording anemometer powered by electricity in 1875 and a mercury telephone.\nIn 1881, he transformed the family watchmaking business into a public company under the name \"Maison Br\u00e9guet\" with the purpose of \"construction, installation, and trade\" of electrical equipment (telegraphy, telephony, signals, lighting, remote power transmission...) and with its headquarters at 37 , Quai de l'Horloge. On December 31 of the same year, Antoine Breguet, described as an \"engineer constructor,\" purchased from his father, in front of a notary, the \"business of constructing electrical appliances and precision instruments located at 39, Quai de l'Horloge, for the principal sum of 300000 francs.\"\nAt the same time, he launched the construction of new workshops at 19, Rue Didot in the Quartier de Plaisance (14th arrondissement) which he would not live to see completed (1822). Overworked, Antoine Breguet succumbed on July 8, 1882, at his residence at 4, Rue Perrault, to a cardiovascular accident. He was buried in the P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery (division 11).\nHe left behind his wife, Marie Dubois, aged 24, with three young children. The Maison Breguet was entrusted to its director, Gaston Sciama, until their majority.\nHonors\nFrench\nOfficer of Academy Palms\nForeign\nKnight of the Order of Leopold (Belgium)\n Commander of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (Spain)\nKnight of the Royal Order of the Polar Star (Sweden)\nNotes and references\n",

    "\n2024 EP by Le Sserafim\nCrazy is the fourth extended play by South Korean girl group Le Sserafim. It was released by Source Music on August 30, 2024, and contains five tracks including the lead single of the same name. The EP contains several styles of music, including EDM, house, rock, and hip hop.\nBackground and release\nOn August 5, 2024, Source Music announced that Le Sserafim would be releasing their fourth extended play (EP) titled Crazy, with pre-orders being made available at Target, Weverse Shop, and other retailers; a schedule for the group's promotional activities was also released. The group had previously teased the EP's title in the music video for \"Smart\", with the word \"Crazy\" written on a cup in one scene of the video. Prior to the EP's announcement, the group previewed the track \"1-800-Hot-N-Fun\" during their performance at Coachella on April 13, 2024. It was later confirmed that \"Crazy\" was a track on the EP and that American produer BloodPop worked on the song. During the August 15th episode of Eunchae Star Diary, Le Sserafim member Hong Eun-chae talked about the group's upcoming release, describing the title track as being similar to their previous single \"Antifragile\". In an interview with NME, the group explained that the project would explore \"the struggles of loving something so much that you would do anything for it\".\nThe comeback trailer \"Chasing Lightning\" was released on August 13, with track samplers being released the following day. Concept images for the different versions of the album were revealed from August 16 to 19. The track list was revealed on August 22, with Le Sserafim member Huh Yun-jin revealed to have worked on the writing and production of the final track \"Crazier\". The highlight medley for the album was released the following day, and the track list was re-uploaded with Huh Yun-jin and Sakura now credited on the title track. This was followed by two music video teasers for \"Crazy\" on August 28 and 29. The EP was released along with the music video for the title track on August 30, 2024.\nComposition\nCrazy contains various genres ranging from EDM and house, to rock and hip-hop. The intro track \"Chasing Lightning\" contains a techno-style instrumental with the narration \"We can't change the weather, but we just chase lightning\". The title track \"Crazy\" is described as an EDM-based house song with lyrics about the emotions someone feels when \"they meet someone that drives them crazy\". \"Pierrot\" is a hip-hop song that samples Kim Wan-sun's song \"Pierrot Smiling at Us\", with parts of the track \"hidden throughout the  melody and theme\". The English track \"1-800-Hot-N-Fun\", which was produced by American producer BloodPop, is a rock song with hip-hop elements that contain \"intense guitar riffs\" and \"rhythmic rap\" from the members. The Huh Yun-jin-produced closing track \"Crazier\" explores the group's tender side, with a message that \"inspires listeners to wholeheartedly embrace and love things that make their heart race\".\nPromotion\nPrior to the EP's release, Le Sserafim posted a dance challenge video to their social media on August 23, showcasing the voguing choreography for the title track. To celebrate the release of the EP, Source Music hosted an album release party in Seoul on August 29 and 30, featuring photo exhibitions and a listening session with commentary from the members, while Geffen Records hosted a release party in Los Angeles on August 30.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nMusicians\nLe Sserafim \u2013 lead vocals\nHuh Yun-jin \u2013 production, vocal arrangement (5)\nScore (13) \u2013 production, drums (1\u20133, 5); keyboards (all tracks), vocal arrangement (1, 2, 4), digital editing (1-4)\nMegatone (13) \u2013 production, bass (1\u20133, 5); guitar (all tracks), vocal arrangement (1, 2, 4), digital editing (1\u20134)\nIluvjulia \u2013 production, drums, synthesizer (2)\nBloodPop \u2013 production, bass, drums, keyboards (4)\nAOBeats \u2013 production, bass, drums, keyboards (4)\nOmer Fedi \u2013 guitar (4)\nJake Torrey \u2013 background vocals (2)\nMartin \u2013 background vocals (3)\nMark Johns \u2013 background vocals (4)\nSound Kim \u2013 background vocals (5)\nSupreme Boi \u2013 vocal arrangement (3)\nKim Jun-hyeok \u2013 digital editing (5), vocal arrangement (4, 5)\nTechnical\nKevin Grainger \u2013 mix engineering (1)\nGeoff Swan \u2013 mix engineering (2)\nClint Gibbs \u2013 mix engineering (3)\nAustin Seltzer \u2013 mix engineering (4)\nYang Ga \u2013 mix engineering (5)\nChris Gehringer \u2013 mastering\nHwang min-hee \u2013 engineering\nKim Min-jun \u2013 engineering (2, 4)\nLee Yeon-soo \u2013 engineering (2, 3)\nTeok Hyeon-gwan \u2013 engineering (2)\nLee Pyeong-uk \u2013 engineering (4)\nMatt Cahill \u2013 mix engineering assistance (2)\nRelease history\n",
    "Historic property in London\n1821 image of the house.\nBrandenburgh House was a historic country house on the River Thames in Hammersmith, then in Middlesex some way beyond the outskirts of London. While it had a number of owners it is best known for the brief residence of  Caroline of Brunswick in the early 1820s. It is sometimes spelt as Brandenburg House.\nEarly history\nDating back to the reign of Charles I when it was built for Nicholas Crispe, the house gained its best-known name as the residence of Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and his English wife Elizabeth Craven there from 1792. \nDuring her time there it became known for staging  amateur theatrics.\nOther earlier residents included Prince Rupert and George Doddington.\nQueen Caroline\nIt gained its greatest attention in 1820 to 1821 when Caroline of Brunswick, the estranged wife of George IV, lived there following her return to Britain after six years abroad. When her husband then tried to divorce her on Parliament it became a centre of pilgrimage for the Queen's supporters. A large delegation of London waterman came on 8 October 1820 to pay their respects.\nAlthough the government presented evidence of her adultery with her Italian lover Bartolomeo Pergarmi, the attempt to divorce her collapsed in the House of Lords. Caroline died in the house on 7 August just a week after the coronation of her husband to which she had been refused admission. Her body was conveyed back to her native Brunswick from Brandenburgh House. Although her husband insisted on a journey entirely by ship, practical difficulties meant it had to be taken by land at first. The procession was hijacked by the radical populace and taken through the City of London, the heart of her popular support.\nLegacy\nThe house was subsequently demolished. its historical legacy lives on in the name of the Caroline Estate, a housing estate a little to the north of the old house near Hammersmith Bridge. Today the site of the former Brandenburg House is located in Fulham Reach. A road running from Hammersmith station to the Riverside Studios is called Queen Caroline Street.\n",

    "Indian singer and drummer\nMark Revlon Fernandes is an Indian singer, drummer, and music producer. Referred to as the \"Prince of Goa\" by The Goan, he initially joined his brother Luke's band as a drummer and singer in 1996. Subsequently, he formed a four-piece band called Headlines with Luke. He gained popularity following the single releases of \"Ek ek dis\", \"Dis Udelho\", and \"Rise as one Goa\", as well as cover songs \"Celina\" and \"Sopnam\". An autodidactic musician, he is the bandleader of the Mark Revlon Band.\nEarly life\nMark Revlon Fernandes was born on 14 August. He has a brother named Luke. Fernandes was exposed to music from a young age, as his father was a tiatrist - a performer in the Goan theater tradition. Watching his father entertain audiences with musical performances had an impact on him, inspiring him to pursue a career in music. During his formative years, he nurtured a fascination for music, with a specific emphasis on the art of drumming. In the absence of formal training, he independently learned how to play the drums through self-instruction.\nFernandes described how, during his childhood, he honed his skills by using everyday objects such as pots and pans to create rhythmic sounds through practice, which helped nurture his passion for percussion. He also has personal connections to the cultural traditions of Goa. Fernandes has ancestral roots in Vanxim island through his maternal grandmother and often visited the island during his childhood breaks, immersing in the local festivities, including the Bonderam harvest festival in Divar island. Prior to his musical career, he was involved in amateur football, participating in inter-village competitions.\nCareer\nFernandes' initial introduction to music occurred in 1996 when his brother Luke introduced him to the musical world. At the time, Fernandes took up music despite the technological limitations of the era. His brother Luke, a musician, facilitated his exposure to music by supplying him with cassette tapes and CDs to enhance his singing and percussion abilities. In the year 1994, Luke initiated the formation of a musical ensemble, with Fernandes becoming a member in 1996. Luke would share recordings by artists such as Freddie Mercury and Boney M. with Fernandes, exposing him to a variety of musical influences. Additionally, Fernandes expanded his musical knowledge by engaging with a variety of music genres broadcast on the radio.\nFernandes performing live in 2019.\nThe four-piece musical group \"Headlines\" was formed in 1996 by the Fernandes brothers in Goa. The band's original lineup consisted of Franky on the keyboard, Edmund performed on bass, Chris was responsible for the lead guitar, and Fernandes contributed on drums and as the lead singer. The formation of Headlines followed the earlier breakup of a band that had been started by Luke in 1994. This earlier group's dissolution led the Fernandes brothers to come together and establish the new four-piece ensemble. In terms of their musical style, Headlines is described as blending elements of dance and song.\nFernandes's repertoire features a mix of original compositions as well as cover versions of other artists' works. Some of the Fernandes's popular original songs include \"Ek ek dis\", \"Dis Udelho\", and \"Rise as one Goa\", which has gained him popularity among Goan audiences. Additionally he performed covers, such as \"Celina\" and \"Sopnam\", that have been well received by Goan music fans both locally and internationally. Headlines has primarily directed its live performances towards the state of Goa, seeking to harmonize their artistic aspirations with the musical preferences of their regional audience.\nFernandes is known for his multilingual repertoire and international performances. In 2014, he took part in the United Kingdom's singing competition known as the Voice of UK, though he did not advance past the second round. Lacking formal vocal training, he expressed satisfaction in making it as far as he did in the competition. Fernandes is adept at singing in a diverse range of Indian and foreign languages, including Hindi, Konkani, and Marathi, as well as English, Portuguese, Kazakh, Italian, and Russian, respectively. His linguistic versatility allows him to cater to diverse audiences, particularly Goan listeners, for whom he performs songs in Konkani in addition to Hindi and English. He has maintained an active international performance schedule, appearing at nightclubs and other events in the United States, Australia, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Macau, Kazakhstan, the United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, Switzerland, and England. In reflecting on his musical journey, he has emphasized the importance of community support and the challenges of composing original material.\nFernandes wearing a war bonnet during a live performance in 2019.\nFernandes collaborated with Royston and Revlon Jackson in 2017 to create the audiovisual music track \"Rise as One\".

She graduated from Niuernermik Ilinniarfik in Nuuk in 1983. From 1994 to 2004 she worked as a department head at Arctic Umiaq Line and later as head of tourism in Qaqortoq.

    "The Hungarian Society for Urban and Spatial Planning (Hungarian: Magyar Urbanisztikai T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g, MUT) is the main institute of spatial planning and urban planning in Hungary. Founded in 1966, the society aims to promote the activities and profession of planning in Hungary and is coordinating the activities of all planners across the country. The society organizes annual meetings, most importantly the National Urban Conference (Orsz\u00e1gos Urbanisztikai Konferencia) and honors leading urbanists, as well as municipalities with remarkable development with its J\u00e1nos Hild Award. The organization is a member of the European Council of Spatial Planners.\nFunctions\nThe aim of the Society is to make Hungarian urbanism, consisting of the coordinated activities of many different professions as efficient and effective as possible.\nExploring new professional knowledge and gathering national and international experience of practice, and sharing it with the membership.\nTo define the knowledge and standards required for working as an expert in the field of spatial and urban development, and to regularly review the scope of these standards on the basis of socio-economic and technological trends.\nImproving the conditions for professional practice, developing and promoting theoretical and practical activities, and encouraging the spread of a broad urbanistic approach in Hungary.\nHistory\nIstv\u00e1n Sarl\u00f3s, the first president of the MUT\nThe leadership of the one-party led socialist Hungary emphasized the significance of the application of modern urban planning principles. This led to the foundation of the Hungarian Society for Urban and Spatial Planning in 1966. The founding members of the society came from a wide range of scientific fields, including demographists, sociologists, architects, transportation specialists, hygienists and politicians. Initially the institution operated under tight political control, its first secretary, Istv\u00e1n Sarl\u00f3s was a high ranking communist politician as well: at that time he was the Chairman of the Budapest City Committee, practically the mayor of the capital city. Thanks to the state's financial and political support the MUT quickly grew to become the largest forum of urbanism in Hungary.\nAfter the fall of the socialist regime in Hungary the MUT underwent considerable changes. The society almost completely changed its leadership and at the same time it lost its financial background provided by the state. After a brief crises the MUT restarted its meetings, conferences and it also participated in the new democratic government's adversary council, the National Forum on Urban Issues (Nemzeti Telep\u00fcl\u00e9s\u00fcgyi F\u00f3rum), which reviewed newly proposed urbanism-related laws. Besides its regular activities, the leadership of the society occasionally publicly states its stance on controversial projects through resolutions. In a resolution issued in 2024 the MUT called for a number of changes in the government's plans for the transformation of the brownfield territories of R\u00e1kosrendez\u0151 train station to a business centre with high rising buildings.\nRegional groups and professional departments\nFor more efficient work, members of the Hungarian Society for Urban and Spatial Planning can form smaller regional groups (ter\u00fcleti csoport) and professional departments (szakmai tagozat) which are focused on the questions of a certain region or planner group. Most counties in Hungary have their own regional group, and there is a wide range of professional departments as well, like the Young Urbanists Department (Fiatal urbanist\u00e1k tagozat), the Village Department (Falutagozat), the Administration Department (Igazgat\u00e1si tagozat) the Urban Economics Department (V\u00e1rosgazdas\u00e1gi tagozat) and many more.\nAwards\nJ\u00e1nos Hild Award\nJ\u00e1nos Hild Award of Szeged, awarded in 2023\nFounded in 1968, the most important prize of the Hungarian Society for Urban and Spatial Planning was named after J\u00e1nos Hild, one of the first city planners of Hungary. Candidates for the award compete in two main categories: local governments of towns, villages and the districts of the capital city can be awarded for a longer-term development process of their settlement with the application of the principles of modern urbanism. Winner municipalities erect a statue usually featuring the enlarged version of the award. Besides municipalities, individuals are awarded as well, for outstanding professional, scientific, educational, or social work in the fields of spatial planning, urban planning, urban development, and urban rehabilitation.\nOther awards\nAward of Excellency for the Revitalization of Public Places (K\u00f6zt\u00e9rmeg\u00faj\u00edt\u00e1si N\u00edv\u00f3d\u00edj): In cooperation with the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) the MUT created an annually distributed award in 2009, to recognize successful rehabilitation programs of public parks, squares, streets and other important public spaces.

    "1989 science fiction novel by K. W. Jeter\nFarewell Horizontal is a science fiction novel by American writer K. W. Jeter, published in 1989. It came in second for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1990, and was a finalist for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1991. The novel deals with themes of information access, security, and reliability.\nPlot\nThe novel takes place inside and on the exterior of a megastructural cylindrical building called Cylinder, which one character says \"violates at least a dozen laws of physics.\" It is not explained how this building can exist, or why it was built or by whom.\nThe novel begins with Ny Axxter, a \"graffex\" (graphic designer) on the exterior surface of the building trying to make a living as a freelancer, selling content to Ask & Receive, an information repository and apparent monopoly.\nAxxter discovers a location where the exterior of the building has been blown out by an explosion and the interior rooms are full of corpses. He attributes this to bogeymen called the Dead Centers that live in the sealed off center sections of Cylinder.\nAxxter gets a job working for one of the warrior tribes that inhabit the exterior of the building, redesigning their graphical branding identity. But the big reveal is hacked, apparently by the company that previously designed the tribe's graphics, embarrassing the tribe and leading to Axxter fleeing for his life.\nAided by a gas angel (a humanoid with a large gas bag growing out of its back so it can float in the atmosphere around the building) Axxter ends up on the far side of Cylinder. Axxter hatches a plan to travel through the center of the building back home, and to report on his odyssey as a form of entertainment for residents of Cylinder.\nAlong the way Axxter meets and is aided by a hacker who can move between bodies stashed in different parts of the building, and a Dead Center who teaches Axxter about an alternate information source to Ask & Receive.\nAxxter learns that the destruction of the site that he discovered at the start of the novel was not done by the Dead Centers, but instead by a collaboration between the two most powerful warrior tribes on the building, enabled by doctored information from Ask & Receive. Axxter broadcasts this information to the entire building, leading to the collapse of the dominant power structure of Cylinder.\n",

    "Lebanese entrepreneur and investor\nCharles Corm II (born January 31, 1974) is a Lebanese entrepreneur and investor who serves as Managing Partner of CORMCO LLC (referred to as CORMCO), a private investment company he founded in 1998 and focused on public and private companies in the global tech, biotech, and real estate industries. From 1998 to 2005, CORMCO invested in a string of high-profile IPOs, such as Broadcom in 1998 and Nvidia in 1999, these two companies now being, more than 25 years later, among the 10 most valuable companies in the world and two of the leaders of what has been called the AI revolution. Charles is also a Board Member of the Charles Corm Foundation, a non-profit foundation guided to by the humanist vision of writer and industrialist Charles Corm, founded to promote and support Lebanon's cultural and natural heritage in partnership with Saint-Joseph University of Beirut.\nEarly life\nCharles was born on January 31, 1974, in Beirut, Lebanon. His mother, Maya Shahid, is a Lebanese painter and his father, David, is a Lebanese architect and businessman. He is the grandson of Lebanese writer and industrialist Charles Corm. His great-grandfather is Lebanese painter Daoud Corm.\nIn 1975, when the Lebanese Civil War erupted, his parents sought refuge in Paris, where Charles grew up and attended school at Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague, a highly selective Jesuit school. He later attended Paris Dauphine University, from which he graduated in 1996 with an MSG in economics, management, and finance.\nCharles then earned, in 2003, an MBA from Columbia Business School in New York City, where he lived seven years before returning to Beirut, Lebanon in 2003.\nCareer\nCharles started his career in 1997 as a hedge fund analyst, covering US technology and biotechnology stocks on Wall Street. In 1998, he quit his job to found CORMCO.\nThrough CORMCO, Charles invested in a string of high-profile IPOs, such as Broadcom in 1998 and Nvidia in 1999, these two companies now being, more than 20 years later, among the 10 most valuable companies in the world, and two of the leaders of what has been called the AI revolution. Other notable investments include Emaar Properties in 2000 (IPO), Qualcomm in 2003, and Biogen in 2005. CORMCO was an early proponent of patient capital, whereas an investor is willing to forgo an immediate return in anticipation of more substantial returns down the road. This strategy helped CORMCO achieve superior investment returns from its inception in 1998 throughout 2024.\nPersonal life\nCharles now lives in Beirut, Lebanon. He is married to Lynn Dagher. They have two children, Carma and David. Charles is also, in his free time, an exhibited digital designer.\n",
    "Species of insect\nPoblicia fuliginosa is a planthopper native to the United States, described by Guillaume-Antoine Olivier in 1791. The generic placement of the species is disputed. One author in 1954 placed it into the genus Crepusia but this has not generally been accepted; a 2023 review rejected this placement although they note that the genus Poblicia needs further study of its proper constituency.\nDescription\nPoblicia fuliginosa is mostly dark in color, with small white specks on the wings. The head is short and broad. The eyes do not exceed the width of the closed forewings. The thorax and anterior abdominal segments are black, while the posterior abdominal segments are red. Adults are 8\u201317\u00a0mm (0.31\u20130.67\u00a0in) long.\nHost associations and life cycle\nIn the eastern United States, Poblicia fuliginosa mostly feeds on sumac (Rhus) species, especially the winged sumac (Rhus copallinum.) The species has also been recorded feeding on red maple (Acer rubrum), though this may not be a usual host. In the western United states, the species feeds on Baccharis salicifolia and Brickellia.\nP. fuliginosa\nPoblicia fuliginosa is hemimetabolous, meaning that it has several nymphal stages before molting into an adult. The eggs are covered with white, creamy wax.\n",
    "Mexican writer (born 1979)\nArtemisa T\u00e9llez (Mexico City, August 24, 1979) is a Mexican author. Her literary works have focused on exploring sapphism and sexual diversity, which has led to her being considered one of the most important representatives of Mexican lesbian literature.\nAs an instructor, she has offered courses on reading and writing literature that highlight Mexican writers and women's erotic stories.\nLiterary career\nT\u00e9llez's first work of poetry was published in 2010 with the title Cuerpo de mi soledad (\"Body of my Solitude\"). The poems deal with themes of love and erotic female relationships.\nIn 2014, she published the novel Crema de vanilla (\"Vanilla Cream\") with the publisher Voces en Tinta. It tells the story of a female university student who meets a woman named Lala, who she feels attracted to and with whom she begins a relationship. The novel caused a controversy after its publication concerning violence in relation to the protagonists, which is expressed in perverse sexual games that the characters play. However, academics like C\u00e9sar Ca\u00f1edo have noted that the novel can be read as a sapphic narrative and that its publication marks a key moment in the Mexican lesbian narrative.\nT\u00e9llez's next work was the short story collection Fotograf\u00edas instant\u00e1neas (\"Instant Photographs\"), published in 2016. Its main theme deals with love between women in Mexico City's lesbian underworld.\nIn the latter half of the 2010s, T\u00e9llez primarily focused on poetry. This period produced the poetry collections Cangrejo (\"Crab,\" 2017), Larga herida (\"A Lengthy Injury,\" 2018), Casa sin fin (\"Endless House,\" 2018), and Mujeres de Cromagnon (\"Cro-magnon Women,\" 2020).\nWorks\nProse\nCrema de vainilla (2014), novel\nFotograf\u00edas instant\u00e1neas (2016), stories\nPoetry\nCuerpo de mi soledad (2010)\nCangrejo (2017)\nLarga herida (2018)\nCasa sin fin (2018)\nMujeres de Cromagnon (2020)\nSee also\nLGBT literature in Mexico\nLesbian erotica",
    "\nLvivskyi Sad is an agricultural company specialising in the cultivation and processing of apples. The company also produces juices, vinegar and other products under brand GADERIA.\nThe company's products are sold in Ukraine and exported to Middle East, European Union, United Kingdom and other countries.\nThe founder and owner of the company is an entrepreneur from Lviv \u2014 Mykhailo Kupranets.\nHistory\nThe first orchard was laid out in 1996 on a 10-hectare plot of land in the Lviv region of Ukraine. It was started as a farm, which was to become a family business growing apples. In 2012, the company Lvivskyi Sad LLC was founded on its basis, functioning as a local apple producer for the local population and supplying the surrounding district until 2017. In 2017, in order to expand the enterprise, the company secured a loan of approximately 1 million euros from an external investor to increase the orchard area to 60 hectares of various apple varieties using intensive cultivation technology. Between 2017 and 2019, a storage facility using modern refrigeration technology was constructed, capable of storing 2,000 tons of produce year-round. Additionally, a state-of-the-art apple sorting line from the French manufacturer Maf Roda was launched.\nAfter repaying the borrowed funds, the orchard became a family business in 2022, transitioning to management under a closed investment fund owned by the Kupranets family: Mykhailo, his wife and son. In 2018, along with growing and processing apples, the family foundation decided to develop a new business area - blueberry growing. To this end, Grona Agro LLC was established on 50 hectares of land in the north of Kyiv region, specialising in blueberry cultivation. Over seven years, the company achieved an annual planned yield of 50 tons of blueberries. The family fund owns a 65% stake in this company.\nIn 2023, the company put into operation a line for the production of natural direct-pressed juices from the Austrian manufacturer Voran under the Gaderia brand  with the production capacity of the line is 100,000 litres per month. Gaderia juices have taken a leading position in the eco-products segment in Ukraine, and are also exported to the United Kingdom, Austria, the Baltic States, etc. on a regular basis.\nFrom 2022 to 2024, Lvivskyi Sad took an active part in the state programme to support medium-sized agricultural businesses, thanks to which the orchard area was increased by 12 hectares of intensive orchard planting of the Gala apple variety, popular in the Middle East. The state of Ukraine compensated 50% of the orchard establishment costs within the framework of the national programme.\n",

    "\nFranjo Ledi\u0107 (Croatian pronunciation: ; 12 March 1892 \u2013 26 September 1981) was a Yugoslav expressionist film director, producer and screenwriter from Derventa, one of the first notable Croatian film authors and self-proclaimed \"first Yugoslav film director\". He is best known for founding \"Ocean-film\" (later known as Jadran film), the first film studio in Croatia, and attempting to build the \"Yugoslav Hollywood\" in Zagreb in the 1920s. He published the first Croatian book and journal about film.\nLedi\u0107 also received attention as a Croatian mythologist, authoring a total of three popular self-published works on Slavic paganism. These works were later highly criticized by Croatian ethnologists, who judged Ledi\u0107's reconstructions of the 'Croatian pantheon' to be \"romanticized\", \"uncritical\" and \"arbitrary\", pointing also to a lack of verifiable sources in his works.\nBiography\nEarly life and Berlin\nLedi\u0107 was born in Derventa, Austria-Hungary, in 1892. He graduated from a public school and travelled across Europe between the years 1907 and 1910. In 1911 he settled in Berlin, and started to work various jobs in Oskar Messter's productions from 1912: an extra, set designer, make-up artist, assistant camera operator etc. During his stay in Berlin, after shooting several short films in the late 1910s, he screenwrote and acted as assistant director for Ernst Lubitsch's Sumurun and Anna Boleyn, co-directed, produced and screenwrote Angelo, Das Mysterium des Schlosses Drachenegg (\"Angelo: The Mystery of Dragontown\") with Robert Leffler, and directed his first successful movie, Cornelie Arendt. After this, he founded the first iteration of his movie company Ocean-film in Berlin, which got him praise from the journals Film-Kurier (\"Film Courier\") and Zentralblatt f\u00fcr die Filmindustrie (\"Central Paper for the Film Industry\"). The journals described Ledi\u0107 as a \"Turk\" and orientalist whose goal it was to export German film to the Middle East and the Balkan region.\nAngelo\nAngelo was a 70-minute long movie in six acts authored after Ledi\u0107's synonymous novel, and the first movie produced by Ocean-film. The film was in production for two years before its premiere. In November 1919, it went on to be aggressively marketed and widely reported on in German newspapers, several months ahead of the Berlin premiere, which coincided with the showing of The Cabinet of Dr. Calligari. In December, one month prior to the screening, advertisements announced the cast, with Leffler as director (though this would be left out in the 1921 Croatian premiere) and starring Lina Salten and Ernst Dernburg. The movie premiered on 13 February 1920 and by then, advertising and reports about the movie had already slowed down significantly, most likely due to a lack of funds. The movie ultimately received mixed reviews by critics, but still got successful showings in other countries, such as the US, Czechia, Italy and a few more. For a showing held one year after the premiere, the title had been changed to Schreckensnacht auf Schloss Drachenegg (\"A Horrible Night at Castle Dragontown\").\nPreserved sequences of the film were bought by the Yugoslav Film Archive in the 1960s, and are now kept at the Croatian Film Archive. To this day, the sequences were not able to be fully reconstructed, but 38 seconds of the movie and several shots have been preserved.\nReturn to Yugoslavia\nLedi\u0107 moved to Italy in 1921, where he stayed until 1925 and directed several short films. He was ultimately dissatisfied with this and once more moved, this time to Zagreb, Croatia, where he founded Ocean-film again, this time as a Yugoslav company. Ledi\u0107 then bought land on Horva\u0107anska street, where he built a film studio with the support of Oktavijan Mileti\u0107. The studio was built as a complex in the secessionist style and named the \"Yugoslav Hollywood\". Not long after, the studio was renamed to Jadran-film, and Ledi\u0107 went on to publish the first Croatian book on film (Film. Tko ho\u0107e k filmu?, \"Film.

It is administered as a single intravenous dose.\nThe most common  adverse reactions include cytokine release syndrome, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, infections, pyrexia, constipation, dyspnea, abdominal pain, non-cardiac chest pain, decreased appetite, tachycardia, back pain, hypotension, diarrhea, and edema.\nAfamitresgene autoleucel was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2024. Afamitresgene autoleucel is the first T cell receptor (TCR) gene therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nMedical uses\nAfamitresgene autoleucel is a melanoma-associated antigen A4 (MAGE-A4)-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic synovial sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy, are HLA-A*02:01P, -A*02:02P, -A*02:03P, or -A*02:06P positive and whose tumor expresses the MAGE-A4 antigen as determined by FDA-approved or cleared companion diagnostic devices.\nAfamitresgene autoleucel is an autologous T cell immunotherapy composed of a recipient's own T cells. T cells in afamitresgene autoleucel are modified to express a T cell receptor that targets MAGE-A4, an antigen (substance that normally triggers the immune system) expressed by cancer cells in synovial sarcoma.\nAdverse effects\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescribing information includes a boxed warning for serious or fatal cytokine release syndrome, which may be severe or life-threatening.\nThe most common  adverse reactions include cytokine release syndrome, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, infections, pyrexia, constipation, dyspnea, abdominal pain, non-cardiac chest pain, decreased appetite, tachycardia, back pain, hypotension, diarrhea, and edema. The most common grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities include lymphocyte count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, white cell blood count decreased, red blood cell decreased, and platelet count decreased.\nRecipients may also exhibit immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), an immune system-related syndrome that can occur following some immunotherapies, infections, secondary malignancies, or hypersensitivity reactions, and severe cytopenia (an abnormally low level of blood cells) for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and infusion of afamitresgene autoleucel.\nHistory\nThe safety and effectiveness of afamitresgene autoleucel was evaluated in SPEARHEAD-1, cohort 1, a multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trial that enrolled HLA-A*02:01-03 and 06 allele positive participants with inoperable or metastatic synovial sarcoma who had received prior systemic therapy with either doxorubicin and/or ifosfamide and whose tumor expressed the MAGE-A4 tumor antigen. Participants received lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Fifty-two participants with synovial sarcoma were enrolled and underwent leukapheresis, eight of whom did not receive afamitresgene autoleucel due to death (n=3), loss of eligibility prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy (n=3), withdrawal by patient (n=1), and investigator decision (n=1). Forty-five participants received lymphodepletion and one patient withdrew consent before treatment, for a total of 44 participants who received a single infusion of afamitresgene autoleucel. Effectiveness was evaluated based on overall response rate and the duration of response to treatment with afamitresgene autoleucel. Among the 44 participants in the trial who received afamitresgene autoleucel, the overall response rate was 43.2% and the median duration of response was six months.\nSociety and culture\nLegal status\nAfamitresgene autoleucel was approved for medical use in the United States under the accelerated approval pathway in August 2024.

    "Ancient Greek astrologer and mathematician\nAscletario was an astrologer and mathematician who lived in the time of the Roman emperor Domitian (that is, the 1st century CE).\nThe historian Suetonius relates an anecdote in which Ascletario was brought before the emperor for the offense of having predicted the emperor's downfall. Domitian tried to put the knowledge of the astrologer to the test, and asked him what kind of death Ascletario was to die, whereupon he answered, \"I know that I shall soon be torn to pieces by the dogs.\"\nTo prevent the realization of this prediction (and therefore the validation of Ascletario's powers), Domitian ordered him to be put to death immediately, and to be buried. When his body lay on the funeral pile, a stiff wind arose, which carried the body from the pile, and some dogs, which had been near, immediately began devouring the half-roasted body. Domitian, on being informed of this, is said to have been more moved and perplexed than he had ever been before. He was assassinated shortly thereafter, in 96 CE.\nThe Byzantine historians George Kedrenos, Constantine Manasses, and Michael Glykas give very different accounts of the same story.\n",

At the time Lawrence painted him Pellew had become known for his command of frigate HMS Indefatigable and it may commemorate a 1797 action fought against the much larger  French ship Droits de L'Homme which was driven ashore and wrecked on the coast of Brittany. Pellew won popular acclaim for the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816, a campaign to end the slavery practiced in North Africa.\nLawrence was an established young portrait painter and later became President of the Royal Academy. Pellew is shown wearing the full dress uniform of a Captain. Lawrence's portrait was the basis for an 1815 mezzotint print by Charles Turner, now in the National Portrait Gallery. The gallery also has a later 1804 portrait of Pellew by James Northcote.\nPortrait of Pellew by James Northcote, 1804.\nLawrence's portrait belonged to Edward Hawke Locker who acted as civil secretary for Pellew and was possibly given it as a gift by Pellew.

    "19th-century Spanish woman bullfighter\nFor the Colombian model, film and television actress, see Martina Garc\u00eda.\nMarta Martina Garc\u00eda (Spanish: ; 25 July 1814 \u2013 27 July 1882) was a 19th-century Spanish bullfighter known as \"Lagartijo mujeril\" (\"Womanly Lizard\") or \"La Martina\". She dominated all types of bullfighting, and stood out for being one of the few women bullfighters in her time who fought bulls alongside men. Antonio Garc\u00eda-Ramos y V\u00e1zquez in Veinte temas taurinos writes that Francisco Arjona Herrera, known as \"C\u00fachares\", stands out among them.\nDiscrepancies\nSome writers are of the opinion that Martina Garc\u00eda was born in Guillena near Seville, while others, like Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Coss\u00edo in his work Los toros, states that her birthplace was Ciempozuelos; Pascual Mill\u00e1n in his work Los novillos mentions that Garc\u00eda's point of origin was Colmenar de Oreja, near Madrid and Muriel Feiner in La mujer en el mundo del toro repeats Pascual Mill\u00e1n's assertion that Colmenar de Oreja was the bullfighter's birthplace.\nBiography\nGarc\u00eda was orphaned in 1821. In 1828 she moved to Madrid where she worked as a childminder and later, she busied herself as a cook at a bar on Madrid's Calle de Hortaleza, frequented by employees of the old Puerta de Alcal\u00e1 bullring, who encouraged her to become a bullfighter.\nOn 15 January 1837, Garc\u00eda had her d\u00e9but as a banderillera, dressed as a working-class woman, with a short skirt and no pants. On 5 November of the same year, she did a repeat performance as a banderillera together with Rosa Inard, and picadoras Magdalena Garc\u00eda and Antonia Garc\u00eda; for this performance, Martina Garc\u00eda earned two hundred reales. On Christmas Day, there was another repeat performance with the same women sharing the billing.\nOn 18 February 1838, Garc\u00eda fought for the first time as a matadora against fighting bulls as a mojiganga (a pantomime representation which was done at the time before novilladas whose origin was in the 16th century) accompanied by her own cuadrilla (team of banderilleras and picadoras) which was made up wholly of women such as Rosa Inard and Celedonia Marina, and once again she earned two hundred reales for her efforts. On 11 March 1838, she took part in Madrid in a novillada embolada (meaning that a yearling bull's horns were tipped with wooden balls) with the mojigangas representing \"The Doctor and the Nurse\", afterwards assisting with her cape in the fight with a yearling bull. She appeared shortly thereafter in another novillada playing Dulcinea del Toboso in a representation of Don Quijote de la Mancha.\nOn 26 January 1845, Garc\u00eda, dressed in the old French style, shared billing with Teresa and Magdalena Garc\u00eda, Rosa Inard and Manuela Renaud as banderilleras. She performed again in Madrid in 1846 with the women mojiganga bullfighters. On 4 February 1849, she performed in Madrid clad in a suit of lights, sharing billing with the bullfighter Mar\u00eda, \"La Gitana Cantarina\" (\"The Gipsy Woman Singer\"). Garc\u00eda's last performance there was on 16 August 1874 with Jos\u00e9 Giraldez, \"Jaqueta\", in the last celebration held at the now vanished Puerta de Alcal\u00e1 bullring\u00a0\u2014 which was torn down the next day. Critics at the time agreed that she had been intrepid and serene when facing bulls.\nOn 16 April 1874, Garc\u00eda did her last mojiganga bullfight with Juana L\u00f3pez and Tomasa Prieto as picadoras\u00a0\u2013 riding donkeys rather than the customary horses\u00a0\u2013 and Rosa Campos along with Javiera Bidaurre as banderilleras; Garc\u00eda herself was the matadora.\nGarc\u00eda forwent any apoderado (\"manager\" or \"agent\") who could have worked out contracts for her. For her abilities, the bullfighter was compared to male bullfighter Lagartijo (1841\u20131900) according to what Pascual Mill\u00e1n wrote in his work Los novillos (\"The Bull Calves\"). Garc\u00eda's bullfighting career has been compared to bullfighter Pedro Romero's (1754\u20131839) for its length, even though her own career, which lasted some forty years, was quite a bit longer than his. Despite having retired some months earlier she once again put herself before a bull on 7 November 1874, when she was sixty years old. However, she definitively retired from the bullring in 1880 at the age of sixty-six.\nGarc\u00eda was targeted by all kinds of detractors, from journalists to bullfighting writers. The critic Federico Domingu\u00edn, for instance, called her an \"unfortunate matadora and old woman\". Natalio Rivas, on the other hand, said that her long career was steeped in great courage, if little in the way of artistry.\nShe fought yearling bulls, toros embolados and bare-horned bulls; she dominated different aspects of bullfighting with skill and fluency. She fought alongside men in mixed corridas, among them C\u00fachares, who mentioned her courage and what little knowledge the bullfighter had of bulls. Pascual Mill\u00e1n spoke of her as an institution, and she was also mentioned by Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s. Conserved at the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a is the document in which Garc\u00eda sought permission to fight bu",

It was created for a town house on the outskirts of Durnovaria (which was located near 16 High Street, Fordington) and was a pavement mosaic.\nThe town house was then likely demolished shortly after the Romans left England around 410 AD as no archaeological remains that pre-date the post-Medieval period were identified from the site of the town house.\nModern history\nThe Fordington mosaic was discovered in 1903 on the site of Lott & Walne's Fordington foundry, and it was excavated in October 1927 with the help of poet Thomas Hardy, who as a result of excavating the mosaic became ill and died shortly after. The mosaic was lifted from a pit which reached around 2 metres (6.6\u00a0ft) in depth.\nThe mosaic was subsequently donated to the museum in November 1927 by Proprietors J. J. Walne and O.C.

His tenure in Kunar was short-lived, lasting only two months, before he'd be reassigned to Badakhshan following the assassination of acting governor Nisar Ahmad Ahmadi.\nGovernor of Badakhshan\nMain article: Governors of Badakhshan\nBadakhshan Province\nOn 26 June 2023, Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada appointed Ayub Khalid to serve as the governor of Badakhshan Province, departing his former position as governor of Kunar Province with Mawlawi Qudratullah Abu Hamza replacing him (Abu Hamza transferred from governorship in Zabul). Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid announced the inter-province transfer via Twitter alongside appointments to governorate posts in Kunar and Zabul. Ayub Khalid's appointment as governor of Badakhshan shortly followed the assassination of the province's former acting governor, Nisar Ahmad Ahmadi, by the Islamic State's Khorasan Province (ISIS\u2013K). On 6 June 2023, an explosive-laden vehicle was driven into Ahmadi's vehicle while driving in the provincial capital of Faizabad killing Ahmadi, his driver, and injuring six nearby civilians.\nProjects\nIn mid-January 2024, Ayub Khalid announced in an interview with the state-controlled Bakhtar News Agency both the completion of the Little Pamir Road connecting Afghanistan and the People's Republic of China and upcoming plans to pave the road with asphalt. The road project was initiated by the former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in order to open investment opportunities (primarily resource mining) in Afghanistan to the Chinese market. While praising the improved opportunities for trade with China, Ayub Khalid made no comments regarding Chinese funding of the project. Chinese critics, including Zhu Yongbiao, an international relations scholar from Lanzhou University, have expressed wariness towards the actual economic value of the road and the risks of Uyghur militants traveling between Afghanistan and Xinjiang Province, viewing the project's primary value as symbolic. In an interview with the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, Zhu described the road as \"largely devoid of practical access and economic value... It is not only too costly, it will not bring any economic value in the short term\" adding \"China must have its security considerations. The road is not economically worthwhile, but it must have security risks.\"\nIncidents\nSee also: 2024 Badakhshan Dassault Falcon 10 crash\nAt 7:00 PM AFT on 21 January 2024, a Dassault Falcon 10 business jet medically evacuating a woman from Rayong, Thailand to Moscow along with her husband and a flight crew (all Russian nationals) crashed in the mountains of Badakhshan Province after attempting a emergency low-fuel landing in Tajikistan. Afghan search teams, including the Afghan Air Force, located the downed aircraft and later a surviving nurse with minor injuries. After reports surfaced of a supposed $1.2 million sum missing from the crashed plane, Ayub Khalid created an investigative commission to look into the reported theft. The validity of the reports as well as the results of that investigation remain unclear.\nFrom 3 to 13 May 2024, nearly a year into Ayub Khalid's tenure as provincial governor, a series of rare protests and demonstrations against Taliban public administration broke out in the Darayim and Argo districts of Badakhshan. Complaints presented by protestors included the Taliban's unpopular hardline policies and the Taliban's installation of provincial leaders from other provinces including a governor (Ayub Khalid) from Kandahar, a deputy governor from Takhar, a police commander from Parwan, and a security chief from Laghman. Protests began on 3 May in response to strong Taliban enforcement of bans on illicit drugs where many impoverished Badakhshani farmers draw sole income on opium-producing poppy crops. Opposing the burning of poppy fields, protestors shuttered shops and chanted against Supreme Leader Akhundzada who had issued the ruling against poppy cultivation. The Taliban dispatched a team of negotiators to meet with protesting farmers and eventually announced a peaceful end to the demonstrations. When protests returned on 13 May, the Taliban brutally cracked down and opened fire on protestors, killing two, wounding more than twelve others.\nPersonal life\nMohammad Ayub Khalid was born in the Pashtun-dominant southern province of Kandahar.

    "Class of gunboats, Republic of China Navy\nThe Minquan class (Chinese: \u6c11\u6b0a; pinyin: M\u00ednqu\u00e1n) was a class of gunboats originally built for the Republic of China Navy. The class of ships consisted a pair of semi-sister ships and served in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War.\nBackground\nThe inauguration of Chiang Kai-shek as Chairman of the National Government of China on 10 October 1927 in Nanjing brought about a new era of centralization not seen in China since the Qing Dynasty. This also finally allowed the government to finally reinvest in China's derelict and poorly maintained navy, that had seen decades of infighting and mutinies throughout the previous Warlord Era. After a contract for new gunboats from Mitsubishi in Japan was turned down, on the grounds of the China Arms Embargo Agreement of 1919, the Kuomintang government turned to the domestic Jiangnan Shipyard. The Jiangnan Shipyard had recently successfully completed an order of six river gunboats for the United States Navy and an order, for a 418-ton gunboat based on the previously built American designs was placed with the Shanghai based shipyard. Over the next several years, a steady order of five new gunboats was placed with Jiangnan, as well as many additional navy orders for modifications and refurbishment. The third and fifth of this series of ships were two semi-sister ships called the Minquan (Chinese: \u6c11\u6b0a; pinyin: M\u00ednqu\u00e1n; Wade\u2013Giles: Ming Chuen; lit. 'People's Rights') and the Minsheng (Chinese: \u6c11\u751f; pinyin: M\u00ednsh\u0113ng; Wade\u2013Giles: Ming Sen; lit. 'People's Welfare'). These ships were named after two of the Three Principles of the People of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the father of the Republic.\nDesign\nThe two ships Minquan and  Minsheng were based on the 1920s American Yangtze Patrol gunboat designs by Superintending Engineer Robert Buchanan Mauchan of Jiangnan Shipyards. These ships were built by Jiangnan from 1913 to 1928. The new series of Chinese gunboats were designed by the succeeding Superintending engineer. Yi Zaifu (\u53f6\u5728\u99a5), who had helped work on the original US Navy designs and expanded on them. The two ships of the Minquan class were shallow draught gunboats with sea-going capabilities but expressly built for riverine service and designed to be capable of sailing up the Upper Yangtze River, all the way to Chongqing. The first ship of the class, Minquan was laid down 16 January 1929, in the same month as the completion of the gunboat Xianning and the launching of the gunboat Yongsui. Of intermediate size and displacement of the two other gunboats, Minquan had a full displacement of 600 long tons (610\u00a0t), an overall length of 59.9\u00a0m (196\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) and notably a draught of only 1.8\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in). The ship was powered by two vertical triple expansion engines, pushing two propellers at 2,600\u00a0bhp (1,900\u00a0kW) with two cylindrical boilers that were coal fired rather than oil fired like the American gunboats. Minquan was able to reach 17.5 knots (32.4\u00a0km/h; 20.1\u00a0mph) and carried 280 long tons (284\u00a0t) of coal. She was planned to be completed in only eleven months and construction went swiftly, with a launching by 21 September 1929 and completion on New Years Day, 1930. The second ship of the class was Minsheng which was laid down in January 1931, a year after Minquan was completed. Minsheng was built to a modified design of Minquan, with lessons learned from the construction of the light cruiser Yat Sen, which was built between the two ships in 1930, applied to the Minsheng and making her a semi-sister ship to Minquan rather than being an exact copy. These changes led to a small increase in displacement by 50 long tons (51\u00a0t) and increase in length by 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in). The draught was also increased slightly to 2.0\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) which would still allow the Upper Yangtze up to Chongqing but not further to Yibin. The engine layout remained the same, but with an engine output of 3,600\u00a0bhp (2,700\u00a0kW), increasing the overall top speed to 18.5 knots (34.3\u00a0km/h; 21.3\u00a0mph).\nArmament was also another area of variation between the two semi-sister ships. Generally both ships had the same main and secondary armament, but tertiary and anti-aircraft armament were mounted, dismounted or swapped out often on ROCN ships in the 30s. The main armament of both ships consisted of a single bow mounted 120\u00a0mm (5\u00a0in)/45 and a single 100\u00a0mm (4\u00a0in)/45 mounted on the stern. Minquan and Minsheng at various times were also armed with a single high-angle 76\u00a0mm (3\u00a0in)/40 mounted in front of the bridge, two or three 57\u00a0mm (2\u00a0in)/40, six 7.92\u00a0mm (0\u00a0in) machine guns and/or one 20\u00a0mm (1\u00a0in)/65 anti-aircraft gun.\nService history\nBoth ships avoided much of the ongoing turmoil of the early 1930s, with neither ship reportedly being assigned to any of the ROCN's four squadrons in 1933. By the time of the Marco Polo Bridge incident in 1937 Minsheng was located at Wuhan and Minquan at Chongqing. While Minquan guarded the temporary capital of the Republic after Battle of Nanking ",

He was a two-time Grey Cup champion, once as a player and once as an assistant coach, and was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.\nEarly life\nNewton was born in Limehouse, Ontario and moved to Sarnia when he was seven years old. He played football for the London Road High School team.\nPlaying career\nNewton played for the University of Toronto Varsity football team from 1907 to 1909. In 1908, he played in the 1908 Dominion Championship game at right half, but Varsity lost to the Hamilton Tigers.\nIn 1909, Varsity finished with a 6\u20130 record with Newton as team captain and he scored one try in the Dominion Semi-Final victory over the IRFU champion Ottawa Rough Riders. In the Dominion Championship, which was the first to be awarded the Grey Cup trophy, Varsity defeated the ORFU champion Toronto Parkdale 26\u20136 in the 1st Grey Cup.\nCoaching career\nOn August 30, 1912, Newton was named honorary coach of the Argonauts, but refused to be paid. In that season, Newton led the team to an IRFU championship and the team qualified for their second consecutive Grey Cup game. However, the Argonauts lost the 4th Grey Cup to the Hamilton Alerts. In 1913, Ross Binkley served as head coach while Newton remained in an assistant capacity.\nNewton remained with the Argonauts in 1914 where they returned as IRFU champions. The Argonauts faced his former team, Toronto Varsity, in the 6th Grey Cup, where they defeated Varsity 14\u20132.\nIn 1915, Newton coached for the Sarnia Intermediate ORFU team. After serving in the First World War, he coached the Sarnia Collegiate Institute football team from 1919 to 1920. He then moved back to coaching the Sarnia Imperials Intermediate team until 1927.\nIn 1928, Newton led the Imperials' senior entry into the ORFU, which was their first year on the circuit. In their first season in the Senior ORFU, Newton led the Imperials to the ORFU title game, but they were defeated by the Toronto Orphans 6\u20130. In 1929, Newton coached the Imperials to a 6\u20130 record and ORFU Championship, but the team was defeated by the Hamilton Tigers in the East Semi-Final. In 1930, the Imperials finished second in their division and did not qualify for the championship game. He ceded the head coach position to Milt Burt, but remained with the Imperials in other capacities.\nNewton was largely responsible for the growth of football in Sarnia which eventually led to the Imperials appearing in three Grey Cup games, winning twice. After the Imperials disbanded in 1940 near the start of World War II, Newton was the commanding officer of the Sarnia 2/26 Battery and subsequent entry into the ORFU.\nPost playing career\nNewton served in the First World War where he won the Military Cross as a member of the Canadian Field Artillery.\nNewton was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, as a builder, in November 1964. He died in Sarnia in December 1967.\nPersonal life\nNewton was married to Eleanor May Newton and they had two sons, John W. Newton and Frederick Newton.\n",

    "\nDominican soldier (1824\u20131913)\nRas\u00edn Isur\u00fan (1824 \u2013 1913) was a Dominican revolutionary and military commander. He was a hero of two independence wars of the Dominican Republic. \nEarly life\nHe was born in 1824 in the city of Puerto Plata. He was the son of a Dutch emigrant and a native  Dominican. Not much is known about his childhood or adulthood, but it is acknowledged that he was a soldier in the Dominican War of Independence.\nDominican Restoration War\nWhen the Dominican Restoration War erupted and the patriots started fighting in Puerto Plata, on August 27, 1863, Isur\u00fan, who was already recognized as a man of action, returned to arms and marched into combat. At first the city was under the control of the restorers, who forced the occupants to lock themselves in and remain besieged in the San Felipe Fortress. However, and as reports of the fighting that began on the Line in mid-month, had reached the respective captain generals of Cuba and Puerto Rico, since the two Caribbean islands under the control of Spain, had been dispatched with important reinforcements, which began to disembark in Puerto Plata on the night of August 27, 1863. Those troops reinforced the besieged, and a war broke out in fierce battle for control of the city, which was the scene of indescribable cruelties and horrors, of murders and the pillage committed by the invaders. Given the ostensible numerical and material superiority of the invading Spanish army, the patriots were forced to retreat to the fields to continue the resistance.\nThe Spanish maintained control of the ruined city, and from there, under the command of the Spanish general Mariano Cappa and Juan Suero, they started the march towards Santiago, in aid of those who were under siege in that city. Isur\u00fan, together with commanders Pedro Gregorio Mart\u00ednez and Juan Bonilla, settled in the J\u00e1cuba camp, on the road from Puerto Plata to Santiago, through Palo Quemado. These forces caused heavy casualties to the columns of the invaders, part of which they had to retreat in their first attempt to make their way to Santiago. When the fronts were stabilized in Puerto Plata, Isur\u00fan was appointed Plaza Assistant from the active camp of Maluis, in which almost every one fought days. During the war, Ras\u00edn Isur\u00fan had different bosses, among which included generals Carlos Medrano, Juan Noues\u00ed and General Gaspar Polanco himself, who was the Chief Operations Superior throughout that line.\nIsur\u00fan, a soldier in two patriotic wars, acquired the rank of general by the end of the Dominican Restoration War.\nDeath\nAccording to his biographer, Rufino Mart\u00ednez, Isur\u00fan died in 1913, at the age of 89.\nHistoriography\nMart\u00ednez also comments on the modifications suffered by the original surname of this character. Thus, Iseroen or Iserven was lost as it suffered alterations in people's speech and use. Iseru\u00e9n, first; Isur\u00fan later.

    "\nHero of the Dominican Restoration War\nCarlos Medrano was a Dominican freedom fighter who fought in the Dominican Restoration War. \nBiography\nDescribed as a selfless and tireless fighter, he joined the Dominican Restoration War upon hearing the shots that rang out in his hometown, Puerto Plata. On August 31, 1863, he arrived in Santiago, which was the scene of an intense battle between the patriots and the annexationists. He had to act in the crucial moments of the siege and after signing the Act of Independence of September 14, 1863, he returned to Puerto Plata to continue fighting.\nHe was a close companion in arms of General Gaspar Polanco. There are war parts shod with their signature, which are dated March 1864, in the camp of Maluis. In October of that year He temporarily served as head of the general camp from Las Jabillas. When Polanco overthrew Jos\u00e9 Antonio Salcedo in October 1864, this was sent under arrest to Puerto Plata, with the supposed purpose of waiting for a ship to arrive at the port of Blanco, (today Luper\u00f3n), to send him to the Turks and Caicos Islands. Who had Salcedo under his responsibility was General Carlos Medrano, and Polanco's secret order arrived to remove the prisoner from confinement, under the false pretext of sending it to Blanco, while the chiefs of custody received the secret order to execute him in the path. The sinister order was fulfilled with the execution of Salcedo, when he died on the afternoon of the 5th November 1864, in the uninhabited cove of Maim\u00f3n, Puerto Plata. When Pimentel headed the uprising of January 1865 from La L\u00ednea, President Polanco sent Medrano to Guayacanes to try to intercept the insurgents. Powerless to resist, Polanco was forced to resign and since Pedro Antonio Pimentel took over, Medrano was one of those arrested and prosecuted for the death of Salcedo. The War Council heard the case and sentenced him to death. Shortly afterward his life was spared. He died thirty years later, in 1895, in the town Hatillo Palma lineman.\nSee also\nPedro Valverde\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Salcedo\nPedro Antonio Pimentel",

    "1997 United States Supreme Court case\nSuitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 520 U.S. 725 (1997), is a United States Supreme Court case pertaining to the regulatory authority of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) and its impact on private property rights. Bernadine Suitum owned a parcel of land near Lake Tahoe, which she intended to develop. However, the TRPA imposed stringent regulations to protect the environment of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Under these regulations, Suitum was denied the permit to develop her property because it was classified as unsuitable for development based on the environmental criteria. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine the ripeness of Suitum's claim. The Court concluded that Suitum's takings claim was ripe for adjudication, emphasizing that Suitum was not required to attempt to sell her TDRs before her claim could be considered ripe. The Court based its reasoning on the immediate and direct impact of the regulatory action on her property rights, deeming further administrative actions unnecessary.\nBackground\nBernadine Suitum owned an 18,300-square-foot parcel of land in Incline Village, Nevada, near the shore of Lake Tahoe. When she purchased the property in 1972, it was zoned for residential development. In 1980, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), which regulates development in the Lake Tahoe Basin, adopted a plan prohibiting any development that exceeded \"environmental threshold carrying capacity\". In 1987, the Agency adopted an Individual Parcel Evaluation System (IPES) \u201cto rate the suitability of vacant residential parcels for building and other modification.\"\nThe IPES also established \"Stream Environment Zones (SEZs), which generally collect surface water from upland areas and direct it into Lake Tahoe and its tributaries.\" To be eligible for construction, a property must achieve a minimum score in the IPES system. However, undeveloped land located in the Stream Environment Zones (SEZs) normatively received an IPES score of zero and was therefore deemed unsuitable for construction. Therefore, as a form of recompense for the infringement of the developmental rights of property owners, the TRPA provides property owners with Transferable Development Rights (TDRs). These TDRs, with the agency's approval, enable property owners to vend their development rights to proprietors of other parcels.\nWhen Suitum applied to the agency for permission to construct a house on her lot, the agency determined that her property was located within a SEZ, assigned it an IPES score of zero, and denied permission to build. Suitum appealed the denial to the agency's governing board, which also denied relief. Suitum, however, did not seek to exercise the rights of the transferable development rights (TDRs) provided to her by the Agency, but filed a complaint for just compensation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that the TRPA's decision constituted a \"taking\" of her property.\nThe District Court determined that Suitum's claim was not ripe for adjudication due to her failure to attempt to sell her TDRs, which made it impossible to determine their specific values. As a result, the court concluded that it could not realistically assess whether the agency's regulations had impeded Suitum's reasonable expectations. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals supported this rationale and upheld the decision, asserting that the agency's action on a TDR transfer application would constitute the necessary \"final decision\" regarding the regulation's application to Suitum's property.\nArguments of the petitioner\nSuitum argued that the Agency's restrictions deprived her of \u201call reasonable and economically viable use\u201d of her property, constituting a taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Additionally, Suitum argued that any attempt to transfer her Transfer of Development Rights (TDRs) would be an \u201cidle and futile act\u201d because the TDR program was a \"sham.\"\nArguments of the respondent\nTRPA argued that Suitum's claim was not suitable for adjudication under the \"fitness for review\" standard established in Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner. The argument maintained that Suitum's takings claim was unfit for adjudication due to the absence of a final agency decision regarding the permissible extent of development on her land.\nTRPA maintained that Suitum had not pursued the available mechanisms to obtain or transfer her TDRs, concluding that she had not exhausted all administrative remedies before filing the lawsuit.\nHolding\nThe United States Supreme Court ruled that the TRPA's determination regarding Suitum's property development eligibility constituted a final agency decision, thus rendering her claim ripe for adjudication. The Court's decision reversed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal's affirmation of the District Court of Nevada's ruling against Suitum. The Court dismissed the lower court's assertion that a final decision on Suitum's land was pe",
    "Lifeboat station in Scotland\nOban Lifeboat Station is located at the harbour town of Oban, on the Firth of Lorn, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland.\nIn terms of the overall history of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), the placement of a lifeboat at Oban is a relatively recent decision. An Inshore lifeboat was first stationed here in 1972.\nThe station currently operates 13-50 The Campbell Watson (ON 1357), a Shannon-class All-weather lifeboat, on station since 2024.\nHistory\nWith a general increase in leisure boating activity, and with the nearest lifeboat stations at Islay and Mallaig being over 50 miles (80\u00a0km) away, following a coastal review in 1971, the RNLI decided to place one of their larger Inshore lifeboats at Oban.\nAn 18-foot A-class (McLachlan) Inshore lifeboat A-505 (previously given the All-weather designation 18-005) arrived at Oban on 5 May 1972. The boat was kept at a mooring off the wooden pier, and a small 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) inflatable dinghy was donated by local architect and hotelier Bill Crerar, to be used as the boarding boat. A tin-roofed shed on the South Pier leased from the local council would become the 'lifeboat station', as a place to store all essential equipment.\nThe first call for the lifeboat was just 19 days later on 24 May 1972, when three children, who had set out in their parents' sailing dinghy, found themselves unable to return in the strong winds, and were rescued as their boat headed towards the rocks of Creag Island.\nA new A-class (McLachlan) lifeboat (A-511) was sent to the station in 1973. A contribution of \u00a35000 towards the cost of the boat was received from the North British Hotel Trust. The North British Hotel Trust was set up in 1902, with half the shareholding placed in trust, to ensure that a percentage of the profits were distributed to charitable organisations.\nA service on 24 June 1974 resulted in the lifeboat towing a 16-ton vessel. Another call to two fishing boats, aground at Ardmore Point on Mull, took over two hours to reach the vessels. By 1976, it was clear that the lifeboat was being pushed to her operational limits, and sometimes beyond. In August 1978, Oban became an All-weather lifeboat station, with the arrival of a 42ft Watson-class lifeboat, the Watkin Williams (ON 922). The boat was already 22-years old at that time, but had served well at Moelfre, and been involved in at least two RNLI Gold Medal rescues under the command of Richard Evans. The Inshore boat would remain on service.\nWatkin Williams served Oban for 3 years, before being transferred to the relief fleet in 1981, and sold out of service in 1983. She was replaced for just one year by the Dorothy and Philip Constant (ON 967), another 42ft Watson-class heading for retirement, but this boat had the advantage of being equipped with radar. However, at 8.25 knots, speed was still an issue.\nIn 1982, the A-class (McLachlan) lifeboat was withdrawn, and Oban was the first station to get a new class of lifeboat to replace the Dorothy and Philip Constant. The Brede-class was a 33\u00a0ft (10\u00a0m) intermediate size lifeboat, with a crew of four, designed to meet operational requirements between the rigid inflatable Atlantic 21 class, and the larger lifeboats. Built by Lochin Marine of Rye, it had a GRP (Glass Reinforced Polymer) hull, and her twin Caterpillar 3208NA diesel engines would deliver 19 knots.\nKeen seafarers James and Ann Ritchie, of the Isle of Man brewing company Heron and Brearley, funded a lifeboat for Ramsey, the James Ball Ritchie (ON 995), which arrived on service in 1970, shortly after James' death. Ann Ritchie, n\u00e9e Gough, President of the Ramsey Ladies Lifeboat Guild, decided to fund two more lifeboats: one for Port St Mary, 54-06 Gough Ritchie (ON 1051), and one for Oban. The new Oban lifeboat was named 33-02 Ann Ritchie (ON 1080). Ann formally named the boat at a ceremony on 7 May 1983, and after a short trip on the boat, she was presented with a painting and a Caithness Glass bowl. These were returned to the station on her instruction, following her death in 1990. The residue of her estate became the Gough Ritchie Charitable Trust. One third of its income is distributed to the RNLI for use on the Isle of Man, and has so far funded two more lifeboats.\nAt 03:32 on 31 January 1985, the Oban lifeboat Ann Ritchie was called to the aid of the 80-ton fishing vessel Shemara, aground on Lady's Rock, to the south west of Lismore Island. In poor conditions and shallow water, and in the dark, the 8 crew were rescued after 14 attempts. Awards were made to the coxswain and crew.\n1990s onwards\nTrent-class lifeboat14-23 Mara Edith Macdonald (ON 1227)\nOn 16 July 1997, Oban received the 14.30\u00a0m (46\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) Trent-class lifeboat 14-23 Mara Edith Macdonald (ON 1227). This was a much larger, and much more powerful lifeboat, her twin MAN diesel engines giving a top speed of 25 knots (29\u00a0mph; 46\u00a0km/h). The Trent-class lifeboat served Oban for more than half of the time the station has existed. In ",

    "Dey of Algiers\nIbrahim Kouchouk, also known as Ibrahim el Seghir or Ibrahim IV, was the 15th ruler and Dey of Algiers. He ruled for 15 years after his predecessor Baba Abdi.\nRule\nHis predecessor Ibrahim ben Ramdan, who suffered from dysentery, elected his nephew and Khaznadar (treasurer) as his successor and abdicated on October 20, 1745. \nIbrahim was 45 years old when he was first elected. The Dey first agreed on a peace treaty with the Danish Kingdom, paying an annual tribute with military equipment, and maintained good relations with the Kingdom of France.\nShortly after sitting on the throne, he would launch an expedition to the Regency of Tunis against the Bey Ali I Pasha, after attacking his neighbor Tripoli, and also ally of the Dey, and even told him to commit suicide. The Algerians entered the territory on April 6th, 1746. On their way the army had been reinforced by the troops of the Beylik of Constantine and indigenous Arabs. After putting the city of El Kef under siege, peace was quickly achieved thanks to the submissions that Ali made, and the need of Ibrahim to take his troops to Constantine.\nAfter the Dey's return to Algiers, he had to face another rebellion in Tlemcen by the Kouloughlis of the Western Beylik, who dreamed of the reformation of the Kingdom of Tlemcen. Ibrahim mobilised his entire army against them and eventually defeated them, but ended up ordering the massacre of more of them, after their intentions of overthrowing the government of Algiers were confirmed.\nHe eventually died after being poisoned by the Kouloughlis. His khodjet al khil (Minister of Horses) Mohamed Ibn Bekir was elected as his successor.\n",
    "Town part in Pardubice, Czech Republic\nDoln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec (Czech pronunciation: ; German: Nieder Johnsdorf) is an administrative part of Lan\u0161kroun in \u00dast\u00ed nad Orlic\u00ed District in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 900 inhabitants. It is located in the northern part of the town's territory. Until 1960, it was a separate municipality.\nHistory\nThe first written mention of T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec is from 1332. In 1568, for the first time, Doln\u00ed and Horn\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec are distinguished. In 1793, the first school in Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec was built, it was the 104th building in the village. In 1798 Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec became an independent political community. Until then, all purchases and transfers of ownership had to be confirmed by the Lan\u0161kroun City Council. During Austro-Prussian War (1866) a large number of Prussian soldiers were housed in Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec. In 1880, the local volunteer fire department was founded. In 1894, a two-classroom school building with a teacher's apartment and a gym was built opposite the \"old\" school. In the same year, on the occasion of the imperial maneuvers, Franz Joseph I of Austria personally went to Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec and awarded some veterans with a golden cross of honor.\nA difficult situation arose in 1905, when the manor of Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec was offered for sale. The Czechs offered any price just to gain ownership of a huge complex just near to Lan\u0161kroun. So the money had to be found on the private market. Since no suitable German buyer could be found for the entire property, the fields and meadows were sold piece by piece, and the building with parts of the land was taken over in 1907 by the League of Germans against Czechs for the orphanage. Due to the fact that the orphanage was permanently occupied by 40-60 pupils until its abolition in 1941, most of them then became pupils of the Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec's School, the expansion of the school was carried out in 1909 under the leadership of the municipal leader Johann Peichl. In the summer of 1923, the municipality had a memorial built for the 34 victims of World War I. Electricity was introduced here in 1928.\nIn 1960, Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec again became a part of Lan\u0161kroun after 162 years.\nFirefighter unit\nIn 1880, a shed for firemen's tools (now the firestation) was built. The unit was officially approved and registered in the cadastre of associations of the town on 9 February 1886. After Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec became a part of Lan\u0161kroun in 1960, the function of the unit was reclassified to support and humanitarian. Thr unit still holds this function.\nThanks to the boom of firesport, the first year of the competition called O zelen\u00fd poh\u00e1r in the Fire Attack discipline was organized in 1993. In 2025, the 31st year of this competition will take place.\nSport\nThe football club TJ Sokol Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec was founded in 1956. The team participates in the 9th highest Czech competition.\nEducation\nIn 1946, the Agricultural and Veterinary Secondary School was founded in the building of the former orphanage. On 1 September 1964, the new building of the Agricultural and Veterinary Secondary School was opened. In 2008 and 2009, the main school buildings were renovated. At the same time, a new cowshed and veterinary centre were built. Two fields of study are currently taught at the school: Agribusiness and Veterinary Medicine.\n",

    "Mountain in Colorado, United States\nLong Branch Baldy is a mountain in the Cochetopa Hills of the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. The 11,980-foot (3,652\u00a0m) mountain is located in Saguache County, Colorado and on the Continental Divide, which here forms the border between Gunnison National Forest and Rio Grande National Forest.\nGeology\nLong Branch Baldy is located within the San Juan volcanic field and the region is dominated by Tertiary volcanic rocks, including lavas, ash flow tuffs, and breccias. The mountain itself is composed of andesite of the Conejos Formation, deposited by andesitic stratovolcanoes 33 to 29 million years ago. Small scabs of dacite from the Bonanza eruptions (33 million years ago) are present near the summit and on the northern slope of the mountain.\nLong Branch Baldy was glaciated, and glacial cirques are located on the northeast and east sides of the mountain where tarns and glacial deposits are found.\nClimate\nLong Branch Baldy's climate is classified as a subarctic climate (Dfc) in the K\u00f6ppen system, with cold, snowy winters and cool summers. It receives precipitation as snow in winter and as thunderstorms in summer, with June typically being a drier month.\nHiking\nHiking to the summit of Long Branch Baldy is typically done during the summer and early fall when snow is free of the roads used to reach the trailheads. A common route to the summit starts at the Long Branch Trailhead located at the end of Forest Road 780, 4.6 miles (7.4\u00a0km) south of the town of Sargents. A hike along the Baldy Lake Trail (Forest Trail 491) leads to the Continental Divide Trail (CDT). From there, a short hike west along the CDT to the mountain's south ridge allows for an off-trail, class 2 ridge hike leading north to the summit. This 7.2-mile (11.6\u00a0km) route (one-way) has an elevation gain of 3,400 feet (1,036\u00a0m).\nLong Branch Baldy can also be reached from four-wheel-drive roads and trails to the west, south, and east. The shortest of these hikes begins at the Razor Creek Trailhead. From here the CDT can be followed northeast to the southwest ridge of the mountain, which can then be hiked to the summit. This 4.4-mile (7.1\u00a0km) route (one-way) has an elevation gain of 1,600 feet (488\u00a0m).\n",

    "Protected area in Dorset, England\nDorset National Landscape is a National Landscape area in Dorset, southern England, formerly known as and still legally designated as the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The conservation designation means that the area is protected and promoted for its landscape value. The area was established in 1959, one of the early wave of National Landscapes to receive the designation.\nDorset National Landscape covers an area of 436 square miles (1,129\u00a0km2), nearly 43% of the area of the ceremonial county of Dorset. It includes most of the Dorset section of the Jurassic Coast, England's only natural World Heritage Site, plus three Ramsar sites, nine Special Areas of Conservation, and three Special Protection Areas.  Other parts of Dorset included in the designation are the chalk hills of the Dorset Downs, the Isle of Purbeck and Poole Harbour, and the vales and rolling hills in the west of the county.\nAround 75,000 people live within the boundaries of the area, which encompass the towns of Beaminster, Bridport, Lyme Regis and Swanage. The area includes several popular tourist attractions, and tourists made an estimated 12.6 million day trips and 1.8 million staying trips to the area in 2016.\nLandscape areas and land use\nThe Dorset National Landscape area includes a variety of landscape types.\nA large inland part of the area covers the Dorset Downs, an area of chalk downland with escarpments and chalk stream valleys noted for its calcareous grassland habitat. The Purbeck Hills form a separate narrow chalk ridge with escarpments in the southeast of the area. There is substantial arable land use on the chalk downland. North of Blandford Forum, the National Landscape area shares a boundary with the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs National Landscape, which includes other sections of Southern England's chalk formation.\nUnder the escarpments of the chalk hills are broad clay valleys, and the National Landscape area includes the Bride Valley, Corfe Valley, and a small part of the Blackmore Vale. The valleys contain substantial areas of pasture land use, typically for dairy farming, patchworked with wet woodland and meadow habitats.\nIn the east, Poole Harbour featured tidal mudflats and marshland habitats, bordered by the Purbeck Heaths lowland heathland landscape, a small part of the Dorset Heaths (which otherwise largely lie outside the National Landscape). South of these is the Purbeck Plateau, an area of exposed limestone upland with a dramatic coastline and calcareous grassland habitat.\nIn the west, the area contains a mixed landscape of rolling sandstone hills with high cliffs along the Jurassic Coast, and further broad clay valleys, including the Marshwood Vale and Powerstock Vale. These hills support oak and ash woodlands, scrub habitats, and livestock farming. Here, the Dorset National Landscape shares a boundary with the Blackdown Hills National Landscape area.\nRecreation and tourism\nA visitor centre and car park occupy a hillside at Lulworth Cove, a popular attraction in the Dorset National Landscape.\nThe coast and countryside in the National Landscape area are valued for its recreational amenity value, with the Dorset National Landscape Partnership recognising pressure from a population of 2.15 million people who live within 40 miles of the National Landscape. The towns of Dorchester, Poole and Weymouth are immediately adjacent to the boundary.\nThe natural beauty of the area attracts tourism, and there are several attractions within the boundary that have been described as tourist honeypot sites, including Abbotsbury, Cerne Abbas, Durdle Door, Lulworth Cove, and Lyme Regis.\nVisitor spending was estimated to support nearly 13,000 full-time equivalent jobs and contribute nearly \u00a3860 million to the local economy in 2016. Tourism creates challenges for the area, including the seasonal nature of many employment and business opportunities, and visitor management at some of the most popular locations, particularly on the coast, where surges in visitor numbers can overwhelm the rural infrastructure. Tourism puts pressure on the landscape through erosion, litter, traffic and car parking, the need to provide visitor facilities, and competition for local services. The Purbeck Heaths area of the National Landscape is additionally vulnerable to fire caused by visitors. These pressures were experienced especially acutely during the summers of 2020 and 2021, when the Covid-19 pandemic made international tourism difficult, leading to a surge of domestic tourism in the area.\nGovernance and ownership\nLewesdon Hill, one of several National Trust properties in the National Landscape.\nAlthough branded as a \"National Landscape\", the legal designation for the area is Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This designation does not affect land ownership, and most of the Dorset National Landscape area is privately owned by farms, estates and households.\nSome of the land is owned and ",
    "West Slavic ethnolect\nA map based on isoglosses within the Goral dialect group\nGoral, rarely called Highlander or Highland Polish, is an ethnolect of the Lechitic group, more specifically of the Lesser Poland dialect group spoken by the Gorals. Its vocabulary was significantly influenced by many languages like Slovak, Rusyn, Hungarian, Romanian and German, being common vocabulary of the Carpathian region. Some consider Goral to be a microlanguage, alongside Silesian and to a lesser extent Masurian.\nThe term Goral was first used in reference to the ethnolect by Pavol Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik in his book Slowansk\u00e9 staro\u017eitnosti, and the term derives from the Slavic word for mountain (g\u00f3ra, hora) and the noun-forming suffix denoting people -al.\nDue to their isolation, Goral dialects have many influences from Slovak, diverging significantly from the Polish literary standard and other dialects. The resulting system is also quite resilient to effects from Standard Polish, showing a more stable, unique system when compared to other Polish dialects. It is often equated to the Podhale dialect; however, this is only one of the many Goral dialects.\nTranscription\nGoral orthography is fairly unstandardized and may vary significantly dialect-to-dialect, most notably in the writing of the slanted vowels.\n",

The patent was granted to him in April 1867. Lincoln had invented the definitive version of the zoetrope in 1865, when he was about 18 years old and a sophomore at the Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Lincoln's patented version had the viewing slits on a level above the pictures, which allowed the use of easily replaceable strips of images. It also had an illustrated paper disc on the base, which was not always exploited on the commercially produced versions. On the advice of a local bookstore owner, Lincoln had sent a model to Milton Bradley and Co. in an attempt to market the animation device. \nDecember: The zoetrope is advertised in American newspapers by various shop owners.\nSpecific date unknown:\nThe photographer William Pumphrey organised an exhibition of Yorkshire Fine Art and Industry, in the grounds of the Bootham Park Hospital.

    "Species of fish\nLimia fuscomaculata, also called the blotched limia, is a critically endangered poeciliid fish endemic to Haiti.\nL. fuscomaculata was described by Luis R. Rivas in 1980 along with seven other new Limia species (L. grossidens, L. garnieri, L. immaculata, L. pauciradiata, L. miragoanensis, L. sulphurophila, and L. yaguajali) and made part of the newly erected subgenus Odontolimia. Odontolimia are characterized by their large conical teeth. The sides of the body are covered by dark spots and blotches, and this unique trait is reflected in both the scientific and the proposed vernacular name of the species.\nThe maximum reported standard length is 3.9\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0in) (a female specimen).\nL. fuscomaculata is known exclusively from the coastal freshwater Lake Miragoane in south-western Haiti and is apparently endemic to it. The lake is simultaneously home to five other Odontolimia species (L. ornata, L. grossidens, L. garnieri, L. immaculata, and L. miragoanensis) as well as to L. nigrofasciata.\nL. fuscomaculata is critically endangered due to deforestation, which is a major problem in Haiti; water pollution; the spread of invasive species such as the tilapias Oreochromis aureus and Coptodon rendalli and the common carp Cyprinus carpio; and the floods brought on by climate change.\n",
    "German saboteur for Belarusian opposition\nRico Krieger is a German citizen, most notable for his reported sabotage work inside Belarus for the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski Regiment, subsequent detainment, and release during the 2024 Russian prisoner exchange.\nBefore his detainment, Krieger worked as an rescue medic for the German Red Cross, but reportedly had a desire to aid Ukraine after witnessing Russia's aggression during their invasion of Ukraine on the news. After contacting the SBU with a desire to join the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski Regiment, a Belarusian opposition military regiment, the SBU supposedly tasked Krieger with a reconnaissance and sabotage mission inside of Belarus as a prerequisite to joining, according to Belarusian authorities. On 2 October 2023, Krieger arrived in Belarus to allegedly take photos and record coordinates of military objects in the Mogilev Region. He reportedly ended his mission by detonating a bomb at the railway station in Asipovichy, damaging the tracks but causing no injuries and while attempting the leave the country on 6 October, Krieger was detained at the Minsk National Airport.\nHis subsequent trial, which began eight months later on 6 June 2024, saw Krieger charged with six crimes: including \"mercenary activity\", \"terrorism\", and \"agent activity\". He was found guilty on all counts and given the death penalty through execution by firing squad, the first time this verdict had ever been given to a foreign citizen. The severity of the verdict was immediately challenged by the German government and human rights groups alike. On 25 July 2024, Krieger appeared on Belarusian state-run TV in a plea to ask Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko for a pardon, a move likely done in duress for propaganda purposes. The plead brought more attention to his case internationally, and by 30 July, Krieger was pardoned by Lukashenko. Two days later, he became part of the 2024 Russian prisoner exchange as the only prisoner coming from a nation other than Russia.\nBiography\nKrieger is a German citizen born in Berlin. He has one child, a daughter, who was under 18 years old at the time of his arrest. Between 2015 and 2016, Krieger worked for Pond Security at the US embassy in Berlin as an armed security officer, where he familiarized himself with operations security. During this time, Krieger reportedly had plans to apply for a US passport and emigrate to the US. He ended up leaving the embassy to work in healthcare as a nurse though, eventually specializing as a emergency medical technician (EMT).\nBefore his arrest, Krieger was a 29- or 30-year-old rescue medic for the German Red Cross (DRK), but reportedly also had intentions to serve as a military doctor in the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski Regiment, a Belarusian opposition military regiment formed to defend Ukraine after the Russian invasion in 2022, after witnessing the Russian aggression in the news. Through attempting to join the regiment, Krieger made contact with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), for which he later carried out his mission supposedly as a prerequisite to joining. This narrative presented by Belarus is likely false, however, as foreign volunteers for Ukraine have never been required to carry out such risky missions as an initiation to join. It is also unclear whether or not Krieger ever joined the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski Regiment before his arrest. In his later trial, Krieger was charged with \"terrorism\" for being part of the Regiment, designated as a  terrorist organization by Belarus, with screenshots of encrypted emails trying to join the Regiment taken from Krieger's phone used as evidence to support this claim. According to a investigation by the BBC, however, the email addressed used were fake, and no actual communication between Krieger and the Regiment was ever presented in court. Furthermore, after being contacted, the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski Regiment replied \"he is not our fighter\" when referring to Krieger.\nActivities leading to detention\nThe Asipovichy railway station in 2009, where the explosion took place in 2023\nAccording to Belarusian authorities and confessions later made by Krieger (possibly under duress), Krieger received orders from the SBU no later than 20 September 2023 to carry out this mission. He arrived in Belarus on 2 October 2023 under the persona of a tourist, carrying phones and a drone. This was confirmed by the German Red Cross who later stated Krieger's travel to Belarus was unrelated to his work with them. Under the supposed orders from the Security Service of Ukraine, Krieger first traveled to the Mogilev Region, and then to the railway station in Asipovichy to take reconnaissance photos and record the coordinates of military objects. The city of Asipovichy and the surrounding area were all known locations for hosting Belarusian and Wagner PMC military elements, with the railway station serving as a crucial hub for transporting military equipment around the capital Minsk.

    "\nDominican independence fighter (1819\u20131890)\nPedro Gregorio Mart\u00ednez (1819 \u2013 November 17, 1890) was a Dominican soldier of the Dominican Restoration War.\nEarly life\nHe was born in Sos\u00faa in 1819. He was born to Gregorio Mart\u00ednez and Catalina Abreu. He was said to have been one of the richest and most influential landowners in the entire North Coast.\nMilitary career\nWhen annexation was imposed, he admitted the facts and even agreed to be government representative in Sos\u00faa, where Mart\u00ednez had his home. But when the clarity of war and the feeling of national dignity reached his conscience, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, from Sos\u00faa, as called him to differentiate him from his namesake, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, that of Mu\u00f1oz, went to the front of battle.\nHe gathered his men and in intelligence with Juan Noues\u00ed organized the assault on Puerto Plata on August 27, 1863. The Spanish held the plaza and counterattacked, the patriotic forces retreated to remote rural areas. Mart\u00ednez, like his comrade-in-arms Gregorio de Lora, went to Santiago with his troops to reinforce the site against the occupiers. He moved to the camp in J\u00e1cuba, a point located between the two cities and on September 12, his men, together with those of commanders Juan Bonilla, Francisco Reyes Mari\u00f3n, Ras\u00edn Isur\u00fan and Norberto Reinoso, stopped the advance and made the columns retreat composed of generals Palanca and Primo de Rivera, made up of two thousand five hundred men, who were trying to force the passage towards Santiago.\nOn February 9, 1864, Pedro Gregorio Mart\u00ednez was promoted from colonel to general. In July he appointed him Governor of Santiago; On August 25, he was appointed Deputy to the Minister of War and on September 27, Commander of Weapons of San Jos\u00e9 de las Matas. He also held the governorship of Santiago under the government of General Gaspar Polanco. Before Polanco's fall he was already in disagreement with him, he had been absent from Santiago and a mediation effort was necessary for Mart\u00ednez to report back to his position and reconciliation was achieved. However, he joined Pedro Antonio Pimentel's pronouncement in January 1865 and, together with Benito Monci\u00f3n and Pimentel himself, formed part of the War Commission. Persecution broke out against many of Gaspar Polanco's supporters and Mart\u00ednez was extremely active in that task in Puerto Plata. Among those arrested on his order was a young ensign Ulises Heureaux, whom they nicknamed Lil\u00eds.\nFinal years and death\nShortly after the withdrawal of the Spaniards, Pedro Antonio Pimentel fell and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral ascended to the presidency. Then the persecuted one was Mart\u00ednez. They arrested him, transferred him to the Capital and was confined there, under the surveillance of the high police. After the Six Years administration, from 1868 to 1874, he retired almost completely from public life. His life ran until it was exhausted between agriculture and the pleasure of women. He died on his farm Sos\u00faa on November 17, 1890, and left among his most permanent inheritances, the largest descendants and the surname most abundant on the entire coast North and Northeast.\nSee also\nPedro Antonio Pimentel\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral\nUlises Heureaux\nJuan Antonio Alvarez",

    "American anti-suffrage organization\nThe Illinois Association Opposed to the Extension of Suffrage to Women (IAOESW) was an influential organization in the state of Illinois that actively campaigned against the extension of voting rights to women. Founded in 1897 by Caroline Fairfield Corbin, the association played a significant role in the anti-suffrage movement in the United States.\nHistory\nThe Illinois Women Remonstrants, a loosely organized group led by Caroline Fairfield Corbin, was established in 1886. Despite Illinois passing school suffrage for women in 1891, the scope of this measure was limited due to contested interpretations and repeated challenges in the Illinois Supreme Court.\nBetween 1893 and 1897, several township suffrage bills were introduced but were defeated three times. This period of legislative activity and the perceived security of the legislature may have contributed to the mobilization of anti-suffrage groups.\nIn 1897, in response to increasing suffrage activism, including a series of meetings held by the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) throughout Illinois that year, the Illinois Women Remonstrants restructured into the Illinois Association Opposed to the Extension of Suffrage to Women (IAOESW).\nThe IAOESW was modeled after similar anti-suffrage organizations in Massachusetts and New York. It was part of a broader national anti-suffrage movement that included state-level organizations cooperating with each other and with male anti-suffragists who provided legal and political advice.\nDuring this period, Caroline Corbin emerged as the primary author of literature from the antisuffrage organization, representing the group's views individually rather than as a collective entity. Reflecting on the women's suffrage movement, she describes the emergence of antisuffragists as follows:A new force was preparing to enter the field. For forty years, the quiet, home-loving women of America had been observing the developments in the woman suffrage movement, forming deeply held convictions about it. They perceived the push for woman suffrage as an attempt to add to their already significant domestic responsibilities the duties that men had traditionally shouldered, based on a belief in a divinely ordained division of labor between the sexes. Though these women were not inclined towards public action or conventions, their moral convictions compelled them to make significant sacrifices in opposition to what they viewed as a threat.Like their suffrage counterparts, antisuffragists were also drawn from elite circles.\nIn 1908, they went on to say that \"during these ten years the suffragists have not gained a single important victory, while legislative records show against them more than one hundred and fifty defeats, covering the ground of municipal, State and presidential or national suffrage.\nAssociation's downfall\nOn April 14, 1909, the Illinois Senate committee, chaired by Senator Breidt, favorably reported a crucial bill for statewide women's suffrage, introduced by Senator Billings and endorsed by several senators. Despite opposition from anti-suffrage advocates like Mrs. Caroline F. Corbin, Miss Mary Pomeroy Green, and Miss Jessie Fairfield, who argued against expanding suffrage, the bill advanced for full Senate consideration. The events marked a notable step forward for the suffrage movement, despite the legislative chaos and opposition encountered.\nGrace Wilbur Trout moved to Chicago in 1893. By 1900, she had immersed herself in numerous clubs, encouraging their members to join the suffrage movement. By 1910, she had emerged as one of the state's leading suffrage advocates. Elected president of the Chicago Political Equality League (CPEL), Trout quickly revitalized the previously stagnant movement. She pushed clubwomen into the suffrage movement and became one of the state's foremost suffrage leaders by 1910. Trout was elected president of the CPEL and quickly revitalized the somewhat stagnant movement.\nTrout became president of the Illinois Equal Suffrage Association in 1912 and led them until 1920 when the group disbanded, except for the year 1915\u20131916. Trout embraced attention-grabbing stunts that would bring suffrage news to the press. Within her first few years of leadership, Trout organized suffrage floats for parades, automobiles.\nTrout actively built alliances to ensure support for suffrage legislation in 1913. She secured Governor Edward F. Dunne's backing before drafting the bill for the General Assembly. Despite challenges, including an unsuccessful amendment by Catharine Waugh McCulloch, Trout managed to push the bill through. On June 11, 1913, she effectively defended the bill from anti-suffrage opposition, leading to the passage of the Presidential and Municipal Voting Act, which extended voting rights to women for most offices. However, post-victory, the suffrage movement in Illinois became dominated by upper-class leaders, creating a rift between Trout's f",

    "2017 murder in Argentina\nThe Nahir Galarza case was an Argentine judicial process, officially called  \"Galarza, Nahir Mariana s/homicidio doblemente agravado\", in which 19-year-old Nahir Mariana Galarza (born 11 September 1998) was convicted of murdering her 20-year-old boyfriend Fernando Pastorizzo (born 3 January 1997), at dawn 29 December 2017, in the city of Gualeguaych\u00fa, Entre R\u00edos, Argentina, where both lived. The case was widely covered by both national and international media.\nGalarza was sentenced to life imprisonment for homicide, which was aggravated by the fact that she and Pastorizzo were under a stable relationship.\nPerpetrator\nNahir Galarza was born on 11 September 1998 to Yamina Kroh and Marcelo Galarza, an officer of the provincial police. At the time of the crime, Nahir was a law student at Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n del Uruguay and played field hockey, which may have influenced in the case, turning her aggressive.\nWhen she was sixteen, there was a kidnapping report after she was missing for one day, but it was soon discovered that the kidnapping was false.\nBackground\nNahir and Fernando Gabriel Pastorizzo, born 3 January 1997, lived in Gualeguaych\u00fa, a city with a population of around 100,000 inhabitants located 25\u00a0km (15.5\u00a0mi) west of the border with Uruguay. Around 2012 they started a relationship whose nature was one of the main objects of discussion in the case. While Nahir's defenders supported the thesis that the couple only had casual sexual encounters, the prosecution upheld the version that they constituted a couple, even though they did not live together. The latter version was the one accepted by the court.  In January 2018, investigators confirmed, through text messages and some photographs of Pastorizzo and Nahir together with her family, that they travelled to Brazil in the summer of 2016, which strongly supported the couple thesis in addition to confirming that Galarza's family knew Pastorizzo, which they initially denied.\nAnother theme regarding the case was the circumstances under which the couple's relationship developed. Pieces of evidence such as text messages, Twitter posts, testimonies and others suggest that it was full of violence, fights, and temporary reconciliations. To Nahir's family, she was the one suffering violence from Pastorizzo. Her mother, Yamina Kroh, said that her defenders and prosecutors maintained opposite stances; while the former claimed that the aggressor was the victim, Pastorizzo, the latter claimed it was the accused, Nahir. However, the court dismissed that Nahir suffered physical violence from Pastorizzo. The Superior Justice Court of Entre R\u00edos asserted that \"Nahir Galarza's defense wanted to demonize the victim\". Regarding this matter there was also much commentary, with numerous opinions and declarations\u2014some from friends and family of both Nahir and Pastorizzo\u2014that were published on social media.\nCrime\nFernando Pastorizzo was murdered on 26 December 2017, at the Tom\u00e1s de Rocamora neighbourhood in Gualeguaych\u00fa, by two firearm shots. His body was found lying on the ground, beside his motorcycle, without signs of robbery. Shortly before the murder, he was driving Nahir on his motorcycle. The girl then walked about twenty blocks back to her home.\nAfter Pastorizzo's corpse was found in the morning, Nahir published a photograph of her and Pastorizzo on social media with the following description:\n5 years together, fighting, going forward and coming back, but always with the same love. I love you forever, my angel.\u2014\u200aNahir Galarza, December 2017.\nNahir acknowledged her authorship of the crime first to her parents and then to authorities. She asserted that she shot with her father's gun, a 9 mm she had taken with her, and then returned it to where she had found it without her father noticing. She also explained that she first shot him in his back and then in his chest.\nIn footage obtained by police from a private security camera, a person physically similar to Galarza is seen walking around 5:22\u00a0a.m. some six blocks away from the location of Pastorizzo's murder. According to the prosecution, this footage was pivotal in situating Galarza in the crime scene, even though her family denied that the person filmed was her.\nGalarza was prosecuted for \"bond-aggravated homicide\" and she was arrested under preventive detention, a condition under which she remained until her conviction.\nConviction\nOn 3 July 2018, Nahir Galarza was declared guilty of aggravated murder (which means her crime was considered more serious because she was in a stable relationship with the victim) and condemned to life imprisonment. Even though the court rejected aggravations for firearm usage and cheating that were proposed by the prosecution, this sentence means that Nahir would effectively have to serve at least 35 years in prison.\nTo date, she is the youngest woman in Argentina to have been sentenced to life imprisonment (she was 19 years, 7 months and 21 days old at the time).

    "Hospital in Attica, GreeceThe General Hospital of Athens \"Elpis\" is a hospital in the center of Athens. It is the oldest active hospital in the country.\nThe foundation stone of the Municipal Hospital of Athens \"Elpis\" was laid in June 1836 at 50 Akadimias Street, where today the Spiritual Center of the Municipality of Athens is housed. The plans were by the German architect F. Stauffert, with some modifications by his compatriot Eduard Schaubert (1804\u20131860). The construction was undertaken by the Danish architect Christian Hansen, making some additional modifications. The central part of the building was completed in 1842, through the support of fundraisers and donations from King Ludwig of Bavaria (Otto's father), the Duchess of Plaisance and many other Greeks such as Konstantinos Bellios, Alexandros Mavrokordatos, Konstantinos Galatis, Rallou Mourouzi and others.\nIt operated on Akadimias Street until 1971 when it moved to its current premises, on Dimitsanas Street in Ampelokoipoi, just behind the refugee camps on Alexandra Avenue. A relocation that was considered as far back as 1892 and was initially attempted in June 1904, with the foundation stone of the new hospital building being laid on the then municipal plot of Ampelokoipoi. However, the relocation to the new building will take place about 70 years later as it will be used initially by the Hellenic Red Cross for the care of the wounded of the Balkan Wars and then handed over to the Ministry of Defense.\nIn the hospital many figures of the medical science of Greece started their medical careers who later participated in the establishment of many of the newest hospitals in Athens, such as Theodoros Aretaios, Spyridon Magginas, Nikolaos Makkas, Marinos Geroulanos, Alivizatos and others. He treated, among others, the wounded of the 1893 war, the Thessalian and Cretan refugees, the wounded of the Balkan Wars, the Asia Minor refugees, the soldiers of the Greco-Italian War and the Athenians during the famine of the occupation.\nIt has been part of the National Health System since 1983.\n",
    "Last battle of the First Indochina War\nThe Battle of Chu-Dreh Pass also known as the Ambush at Chu-Dreh Pass and Operation Myosotis was the last battle of the First Indochina War between French and Viet Minh forces that took place on July 17, 1954, within the Central Highlands of French Indochina. It ended with the French battle group, 'Groupement Mobile No. 42' suffering heavy losses and the near destruction of the veteran Cor\u00e9e battalion. This was the last battle of the war with the Geneva ceasefire taking effect just three days later.\nBackground\nFurther information: Battle of Mang Yang Pass\nOn November 15, 1953, the French regimental task force unit of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps 'Groupement Mobile No. 100' (\"Mobile Group 100\" or GM.100) which included the elite veteran UN 'Bataillon de Cor\u00e9e' (I/Cor\u00e9e) that had fought in the Korean War was transferred to French Indochina.\nOn June 24 the following year, not long after the surrender of the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu the French Chief of Staff ordered GM.100 to abandon its defensive positions at An Khe and fall back to Pleiku, some 50 miles away over Route Coloniale 19 code named op\u00e9ration \u00c9glantine. GM.100, however were hit in a series of deadly ambushes, suffering heavy losses in men and vehicles by 29 June. They fell back to the safer Pleiku where they reorganized and re-equipped with the help of 'Groupement Mobile No. 42' (GM.42).\nOn June 29, the French headquarters in the coastal town of Nha Trang had received intelligence that the Viet Minh had infiltrated the area along Route Coloniale 14 between Pleiku and Ban M\u00ea Thu\u1ed9t. 'Groupement Mobile No. 42' (GM.42) led by veteran Lieutenant Colonel Jacques Sockeel, were to be sent out on Operation Myosotis (Forget-Me-Not) with orders to keep the road open. They were also to relieve an outpost held by a company of regular troops and some thirty guerrillas 85\u00a0km South of Pleiku. GM.42 was composed of three mountaineer infantry battalions (which included Montagnards). There was also the 4th Vietnamese Artillery Group, the two remaining companies of I/Cor\u00e9e and a reinforced armoured platoon of the Third Squadron of the 5th (\"Royal Poland\") Cuirassiers Armoured Cavalry.\nAmbush\nOn Bastille Day, July 14, the task force took to the road, and two days later at dusk, the various units had reached Ea H'leo. The French having learned some of the lessons from Mang Yang Pass had prepared themselves in case of another ambush - the artillery were pushed up to support the front units, while infantry units and vehicles established temporary defensive positions. The artillery themselves would be supported by tanks when they moved up. In addition, they would have aerial support from B-26 fighter bombers flying from bases in Nha Trang.\nThe following day the GM.42's column was passing through areas of potential ambush sites, but nothing was seen, and no attacks took place. As they approached the dangerous Chu Dreh Pass, the Montagnard infantry slowly got through without trouble, while I/Cor\u00e9e and the artillery formed the rearguard. At 10.50am, they had left the southern end of the pass when the 8th Montagnard battalion and the Brigade HQ of I/Cor\u00e9e were suddenly attacked by the Viet Minh. These were local units from the 96th Regiment which opened up on the convoy with 81mm mortars, 60mm's, and recoil less cannons.\nThe Viet Minh managed to create choke points at both the northern and southern ends of the pass. The soft skinned vehicles were targeted and soon a dozen trucks were blazing between the ends of the pass. Two companies of the 8th Montagnard battalion and the 4th company of I/Cor\u00e9e were destroyed within an hour. Other units around the choke points of the ambush were trying to fight their way out Northwards by leap frogging, and at the same time dragging their wounded. Most of the French radios were knocked out causing chaos and confusion. It meant that on the south side of the pass, the rest of GM.42 not realising what was going on further up, were attempting to stave off an ambush there. They managed to call in air support from B-26 fighter bombers, which eventually managed to help their situation. Nevertheless, the 5th (Royal Poland) Cuirassiers' tanks and vehicles meanwhile arrived at the pass not realising the plight of their cohorts and they too became hit hard.\nThe Viet Minh then stormed the vehicles with infantry in the hope of capturing their guns and radio sets. Soon they were crawling over the armoured vehicles and tanks. The 'Royal Poland' however despite the heavy losses they had sustained did save I/Cor\u00e9e from being completely wiped out.\nBy 14:00 the Viet Minh broke off their attack satisfied with the destruction they had inflicted. The French managed to withdrew but it took some time for the survivors who managed to escape the slaughter to arrive at Bu\u00f4n Ma Thu\u1ed9t.

He is known mostly as owner, manager and the moving spirit behind numerous Traditionalist periodicals, mostly El Legitimista Espa\u00f1ol (1898\u20131912) and Espa\u00f1a (1915\u20131929), both published in Buenos Aires. In Spain he briefly issued some Carlist Barcelona-based periodicals in 1889\u20131892; during this period he managed a publishing house Biblioteca Tradicionalista and published numerous propagandistic books, booklets and brochures. In 1898-1912 he was the chief Carlist representative for South America.\nFamily and youth\nfather\nThe Oller surname, possibly of French origin, was first noted in Spain in Catalan records from the 11th century; however, there is close to nothing known about Oller's distant ancestors. His paternal grandparents were Manuel Oller from Barcelona and Rosa Pallarol from San Vicente dels Horts, yet their social position remains unclear; according to their grandson, they formed a \u201cmodest family\u201d. Their son and the father of Francisco, Manuel Oller Pallarol (1810\u20131888), reportedly followed somewhat chaotic secondary education curriculum and ascended to middle strata, though it is not certain what he was doing for a living. In parish books he was recorded as \u201cpropietario\u201d and apparently he had enough financial means to engage in legitimist and Catholic propaganda and charity; fearing his economic contribution to the Carlist war effort, during the Third Carlist War the government embargoed his property. At unspecified date Manuel married Concepci\u00f3n Sim\u00f3n Ramonich (1824\u20131883), also from Barcelona.\nIt is not clear how many children Manuel and Concepci\u00f3n had and whether Francisco had any siblings. The family was fervently religious and he was brought up accordingly. He inherited also the Carlist zeal; following outbreak of the Third Carlist War he twice escaped from home trying to enlist in legitimist troops, but failed. The third attempt was successful, and in 1874, as a 14-year-old, he was able to \u201cchange my college cap for a Carlist beret\u201d. Francisco's war lasted barely a year; serving in 4. Batall\u00f3n de L\u00e9rida under Ceferino Escola, he took part in defense of Seo de Urgel and was taken prisoner there, according to his own account in the rank of alf\u00e9rez. Back in Barcelona he returned to school and some time in the late 1870s he obtained bachillerato in the local Escuelas P\u00edas. In 1880 he was due to perform military service, evaded by means of regular substitution payment of 2.000 pesetas.\nLo Crit de la Patria\nIn 1881 in Havana Oller married Carmen Anguis Carmona (1868-?). None of the sources consulted provides any closer information, e.g. it is not known whether the bride was Cuban, in what circumstances the two have met and why Oller travelled across the Atlantic. In 1883 latest the couple resided in Barcelona. Oller entered the editorial board of a freshly launched Catalan-language Carlist weekly, Lo Crit de la Patria; it was owned by Antonio Quintana, a local publisher and owner of the La Propaganda Catalana publishing house. According to some earlier historiographic works Oller founded or co-founded the weekly and himself he claimed having managed it since the early 1880s, but a present-day historian maintains he assumed management somewhat later. Francisco and Carmen lived in Barcelona. It is not clear how many children they had, but there is only one known, Concepci\u00f3n Oller Anguis, born in the late 1880s. She would later marry in Buenos Aires; Oller had one granddaughter, Concepci\u00f3n Amoedo Oller, an Argentinean citizen.\nSpain (1883-1892)\n Oller, late 1880s\nExcept an unsuccessful 1886 attempt to run for Diputaci\u00f3n Provincial of Barcelona, Oller focused on propaganda. Apart from a theatrical drama Combates del coraz\u00f3n (1884) he wrote La Espa\u00f1a Carlista (1885), a set of essays revolving around the Third Carlist War and largely formatted as polemics with Antonio Pirala. He also wrote few prologues and one translation from French. In 1887 he assumed management of Lo Crit de la Patria and steered it as a vehement Carlist propaganda vehicle, publishing venomous diatribes against the Madrid governments. However, in 1888 he faced a conflict within Traditionalist ranks, caused by secession of Nocedal-led faction named Integrists. Quintana assumed ambiguous stand, and Oller suspended his collaboration having declared that \u201cl\u2019estat de la lluyta actual dins lo partit carlista\u201d makes him re-consider. Eventually, when Lo Crit de la Patria sided with the rebels, Oller opted for total loyalty to his king and left the periodical.\nThough no longer behind the steering wheel of Lo Crit, in 1888 Oller was subject to legal investigation related to articles, published earlier during his tenure. Apart from open exaltation of Carlos de Borb\u00f3n as the king, he was also charged with barely veiled reference to the prime minister Sagasta as \u201ccanalla\u201d. The matter was examin",

She made her wrestling debut in 1958. On October 21, 1963, Brown made history when she defeated Nell Stewart for the NWA Texas Women's Championship becoming the first black woman to win a title in wrestling history.

Her son, Michael mentions his mother's life and the abuse she suffered in wrestling.\nOne of the most notorious accusations is from the family of Sweet Georgia Brown (Susie Mae McCoy), who was trained by Moolah and her husband, Buddy Lee. The Columbia Free Times reported allegations made by her daughter in 2006, in which she said her mother told her that she was often raped, given drugs, and made an addict in an intentional attempt by Ellison and Lee to control her.\nMichael McCoy, Sweet Georgia Brown's son, refuted allegations made by his sister, stating that she has an agenda and that the allegations are false. However, on the Dark Side of the Ring episode about The Fabulous Moolah, Michael McCoy stated that she was indeed made to have sex with paying promoters.

    "American writer and author\nJoanna Ferrone, also known as Jo Ferrone, is an American writer and author. She is best known for co-creating the fictional character Fido Dido with Sue Rose. Ferrone and Rose also created Angela Anaconda, which Ferrone describes as a reflection of her upbringing.\nBiography\nFerrone was the third of eight children, raised in the Catholic faith but Ferrone would later describe herself as agnostic. She was raised in Oyster Bay, New York. Growing up, she described herself as the \"consummate tomboy\".\nFerrone identifies as a lesbian, and her family's \"only gay child\". In an interview, Ferrone expressed her previous feelings that had she been born another time, she would have transitioned.:\u200a338\u200a\nCareer\nFerrone was heavily involved in the New York queer arts scene of the 1970s and 1980s.:\u200a337\u200a She cited queer pop art influences such as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring as central to her and Sue Rose's practice.:\u200a337\u200a At the time of Fido Dido's creation, Ferrone worked as the owner to a stock photo library. Before that, she worked as a department store gift wrapper, waitress, receptionist, and the owner of a stock photography company.\nFerrone was the co-creator of the mascot Fido Dido alongside Sue Rose, Ferrone's partner at the time. He was designed in 1985 with his appearance inspired by a mutual friend of the two,:\u200a337\u200a and the design was initially put on t-shirts, his design later caught the attention of Patricia Field. Three years following his creation, his design caught the interest of Pepsi's agency looking for a character to market 7-Up that embodied an energy that was \"cool, identifiable and really liberal in its outlook\". Ferrone was responsible for naming and creating the personality of the character, and served as his \"business manager\".\nFerrone co-created Angela Anaconda alongside Sue Rose, Ferrone described the series as a reaction to the premises she saw on TV while she was growing up and the questions she felt while comparing herself to the picture perfect families that were shown. Ferrone described Angela Anaconda as \"very autobiographical, that was the most natural thing.\" Ferrone revealed in an interview with YouTuber Alexandra Bender that she was not involved in Angela Anaconda's eventual inclusion in Digimon: The Movie.\nShe served as the founder and president of Honest Entertainment, which aimed to remaking Fido Dido for a modern audience. In 2002, Ferrone was slated as the co-creator and co-writer to the show Family Values alongside Tom Brady. The series was described in Variety as \"wholesome \u201950s-style family living in the modern world\" and \"\u201cPleasantville\u201d gone wild\".

Having received information that that the Lazi and Abasgi broke the alliance with the Romans and went home, the Persians decided to attack the army of Heraclius. After a while, the armies met and stood opposite each other until the evening, without taking any action.When evening came, the Byzantine emperor continued on his way, and the Sassanids followed him,they wanted to shorten the path, but ended up in a swampy area, thanks to which Heraclius entered Persarmenia, local residents learned about this and joined Shahrvaraz's army.

In 1982, during the course of an archaeological excavation conducted as 161 Water Street was built, a ship dating to the 1700s was discovered. Portions of the ship and other artifacts were sent to the Mariners' Museum in Newport News.\n161 Water Street was completed in 1983. The building was designed by Fox & Fowle.

An entity linked to Ken Dart purchased the building from Vanbarton Group in 2022. Vanbarton sold the building after zoning changes that might have permitted the conversion of the building from an office property to housing did not occur.\nThe owners of the building received a tax break of $41.3 million over a 20 year period in January 2024. This tax break was granted through New York City's \"M-CORE\" program, which provides tax breaks to owners of office buildings with high vacancy rates, freeing funds for renovations.

    "1853 train derailment in West Virginia\nThe Wheeling rail disaster refers to a train derailment that occurred near Wheeling, West Virginia in March of 1853.\nBackground\nIn January of 1853, Wheeling, West Virginia was officially connected by rail by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which was the first time that the ports of the Atlantic Ocean were connected by rail to the Ohio River valley. The Appalachian Mountain range proved to be difficult in term of forming a railway connection, however, when completed, rail travel across the mountainous area began immediately.\nThe completed railway included a rail bridge that crossed over the Cheat River; the bridge had a curved 116-foot grade, but the construction of the bridge included crossties being held in place by loosened nails.\nAccident\nOn March 27th, 1853, around 3 o'clock, P.M., a two-engine train carrying four cars (three of which were full of passengers) departed from Wheeling was crossing the bridge over the Cheat River. As the train passed over the already-loose crossties, the nails holding the beams in place detached. The train derailed as a result and sent the cars down the hundred-foot embankment.\nAs the passenger carriages tumbled down the embankment, furnaces in the passenger cars broke loose and spilled burning-hot coals onto the floor. The passenger coaches, which were made of wood at the time, proved to be weaker and would shatter and splinter in severe accidents; this combined with the spilled coals started a fire, further trapping passengers already caught in the disaster.\nThe initial death toll is stated as 8, but is believed to be as high as 17. This was the first time in the history of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad that passengers perished as the result of an accident.\nSee also\nAngola Horror - A train derailment that occurred in a similar manner in 1867.",

    "Fascist education, also sometimes known as Fascist pedagogy was developed during the era of Fascist regimes such as Mussolini's Italy (1922\u20131943), aimed to mold young minds to be loyal and obedient to the state and its ideologies. This system focused on creating a generation of citizens who would uphold and propagate the principles of Fascism.\nOverview\nCover of the school book \"Primavera fascista. Letture per le scuole elementari urbane\" of the fascist figure Asvero Gravelli, published by A. Mondadori, Italy, 1929.\nFascist education permeated all aspects of youth life, including extracurricular activities, youth organizations, and family dynamics. The overarching goal was to create a generation of individuals who were unwaveringly loyal to the Fascist state, willing to defend its principles, and propagate its ideologies throughout their lives.\nThe main and best-known representative of fascist education is Giovanni Gentile. As Minister of Education, Gentile implemented sweeping reforms to the Italian education system, known as the Gentile Reform.\nFascist states pursued policies of social indoctrination through propaganda in education and the media, and regulation of the production of educational and media materials. Education was designed to glorify the fascist movement and inform students of its historical and political importance to the nation. It attempted to purge ideas that were not consistent with the beliefs of the fascist movement and to teach students to be obedient to the state. Marinetti promoted the need of physical training of young men saying that, in male education, gymnastics should take precedence over books. He advocated segregation of the genders because womanly sensibility must not enter men's education, which he claimed must be \"lively, bellicose, muscular and violently dynamic.\"\nBasic aspects\nThe basic aspects of Fascist education were:\nIdeological Indoctrination\nCurriculum and educational materials were heavily infused with Fascist propaganda. History, literature, and even science subjects were taught in ways that supported the regime's doctrines and glorified its leaders.\nCult of Personality\nCentral figures like Benito Mussolini were portrayed as heroic saviors of the nation. Their images and stories of their supposed greatness were omnipresent in classrooms and educational resources.\nEmphasis on Physical Education and Military Training\nPhysical education and military training were critical components of the curriculum. The regime believed that a strong, healthy, and disciplined body was essential for the nation's strength. Activities such as sports, gymnastics, and military drills were commonplace.\nNationalism and Militarism\nEducation fostered an intense sense of nationalism and readiness for military service. Youth organizations like Italy's Opera Nazionale Balilla and Germany's Hitler Youth were instrumental in instilling these values and preparing young people for future roles as soldiers and loyal citizens.\nGender-Specific Roles\nBoys and girls were educated with distinct roles in mind. Boys were trained to be warriors and leaders, while girls were prepared for motherhood and domestic duties, emphasizing their roles in supporting the family and the state.\nSuppression of Dissent and Critical Thinking\nCritical thinking and dissent were discouraged. The educational system promoted conformity and obedience to the state. Ideas that contradicted Fascist ideology, such as liberalism, communism, and democracy, were vilified.\nRacial and Cultural Superiority\nParticularly in Nazi Germany, education was used to promote notions of racial purity and superiority. Textbooks and lessons often included racist ideologies, teaching children to believe in the supremacy of the Aryan race and to despise those deemed inferior.\nAnti-Communism and Anti-Liberalism\nCommunist and liberal ideas were portrayed as dangerous and destructive. The education system aimed to create a deep-seated aversion to these ideologies among the youth.\nSee also\nUr-Fascism\nAnti-fascist education",
    "1975 civil war\nThis article is about the 1975 civil war. For the 2006 conflict, see 2006 East Timorese crisis.\nIn August 1975, a civil war broke out between two opposing political parties in Portuguese Timor: the conservative Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) and the left-leaning Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin). The war took place within the context of decolonisation, as the post-Carnation Revolution Portuguese government sought to give independence to much of the Portuguese Empire. UDT and Fretilin were formed in May 1974, following the legalisation of political parties in Portugal. UDT initially advocated for continuing ties to Portugal, before shifting to promoting a gradual independence process that maintained existing institutions. Fretilin sought independence with a new political system that would address a widespread lack of development in the territory. Also formed during this time was the Timorese Popular Democratic Association (Apodeti), which advocated for an Indonesian annexation of the territory, although Apodeti gained far less popular support than the other two major parties.\nDiscussions about the future of East Timor took place within the context of the views of neighbouring Indonesia. The Indonesian government saw an independent East Timor with a potentially communist government as a security risk. This view found receptive ears among western governments affected by the recent loss of the Vietnam War. As the left-leaning Fretilin established itself as a popular political force, Indonesia applied pressure on Portugal and the other East Timorese political parties to find a pathway excluding Fretilin. The UDT and Fretilin found common ground and made a joint proposal to Portugal in January 1975 on a path to independence. However, deep mistrust between both parties, especially between their more radical wings, eventually led to a breakdown of relations.\nTensions between UDT and Fretilin came to a head on 11 August 1975 when UDT forces took control of key points in the cities of Dili and Baucau. Although this was successful and caused Fretilin leaders to flee, Fretilin began a counter-attack on 20 August. After retaking the two major cities, Fretilin continued its military campaign, and took control of most of the country by early September. The conflict exacerbated existing local tensions throughout the territory, and between 1,500 and 3,000 people are thought to have been killed during this period by both forces and in other acts of violence. The remaining Portuguese authorities retreated to the island of Atauro, while UDT leaders fled to Indonesia, leaving Fretilin as the effective government. Fretilin called for the return of Portuguese authorities and a resumption of decolonisation discussions, while setting up a caretaker government to manage the territory in the meantime.\nUDT leaders that had retreated to Indonesia began to advocate for Indonesian annexation, and Indonesia provided them with training and other military support. Indonesian special forces worked with the UDT to carry out attacks near the border, making limited gains in October. On 20 November a new offensive was launched with more significant Indonesian support. Following the refusal of Portuguese authorities to return, and losing ground to the combined UDT/Indonesian offensive, Fretilin hastily declared the independent Democratic Republic of East Timor. Indonesia responded by publicly coming out in favour of annexation, launching a full-scale invasion on 7 December, and setting up the Provisional Government of East Timor led by its allied political parties. Indonesia formally annexed East Timor on 17 July 1976.\nBackground\nMain article: History of East Timor\nEast Timor shares the island of Timor with Indonesia. The island lies to the northwest of Australia, in particular the city of Darwin.\nNew Portuguese political system\nPortuguese presence on the island of Timor started sometime in the 16th century. In the 20th century, anti-colonial movements in Portuguese Africa prompted the emergence of a national identity in East Timor. Portuguese Timor was still a relatively peaceful colony under Portuguese rule when the 25 April 1974 Carnation Revolution overthrew the previous Portuguese regime, despite armed rebellion occurring in other Portuguese colonies. The new government was nonetheless committed to the decolonisation of East Timor.:\u200a411\u200a Governor Fernando Alves Aldeia\u00a0 was instructed to prepare for decolonisation while maintaining a good relationship with Indonesia. He created the Timor Commission for Self-Determination on 13 May 1975. Self-determination for its colonies was enshrined in the Constitution of Portugal around this time.:\u200a14\u201315\u200a\nPolitical parties aside from the former National Union were legalised, and five parties formed in East Timor. The two largest were the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) and the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin). The Timorese Popular Demo",

    "Vietnamese weightlifter (born 1995)\nIn this Vietnamese name, the surname is  Tr\u1ecbnh, but is often simplified to Tr\u1ecbnh in English-language text. In accordance with Vietnamese custom, this person should be referred to by the given name, Vinh (simply) or V\u0103n Vinh (politely).\nTr\u1ecbnh V\u0103n Vinh (born 17 December 1995) is a Vietnamese weightlifter. He won a silver medal at the 2018 Asian Games. He also represented Vietnam at the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nEarly life\nV\u0103n Vinh was born in 1995 in Qu\u1ebf V\u00f5 district, B\u1eafc Ninh in a farming family. He started practicing weightifting in 2008, after weightlifter coach \u0110\u00f5 \u0110\u00ecnh Du successfully convinced V\u0103n Vinh's family to let him train at the province's Training Center, as he saw V\u0103n Vinh's adaptable physique to the sport during a talent search in secondary schools throughout B\u1eafc Ninh.\nCareer\nEarly successes\nV\u0103n Vinh emerged as one of Vietnam's most promising weightlifters in the 62\u00a0kg category and was called up to the national team at the age of 20. As he began competing internationally, he won consecutive gold medals in the clean and jerk events and silver medals in the total lift at the 2016 Asian Championships. In 2017, V\u0103n Vinh won the gold medal at the 62\u00a0kg snatch event in the 2017 World Championships, with a lift of 136\u00a0kg to set a personal record. In the 2017 SEA Games in Malaysia, V\u0103n Vinh created a big surprise in the 62\u00a0kg category as he won the gold medal with a total lift of 307\u00a0kg and set the Games' record, defeating Olympics silver medalist Eko Yuli Irawan by 1\u00a0kg.\nTr\u1ecbnh V\u0103n Vinh (left, with the silver medal) on the medal podium alongside Eko Yuli Irawan and Adkhamjon Ergashev at the 2018 Asian Games\nAn year later, Eko got his revenge after he winning the gold medal at the 62kg event at the 2018 Asian Games with a total lift of 311\u00a0kg. V\u0103n Vinh won the silver medal at the second place with 12\u00a0kg less but still made history by becoming the first Vietnamese weightlifters to win a medal in this weight class.\nDoping ban\nFollowing his achievements in several major competitions, V\u0103n Vinh was in the group of athletes receiving key investment with the target to win a medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nIn November 2018, the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) travelled to Vietnam and tested doping on V\u0103n Vinh according to regulations. In February 2019, the test results announced that he tested positive for exogenous testosterone and another banned substances. As a result, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) imposed a 4-year ban from competition a fine of US$5,000 and to V\u0103n Vinh. He decided to not appeal to the decision and accepted the sanction. According to V\u0103n Vinh, the banned substances were part of the medicaments he used to treat his injury to recover on time for the National championship.\nComeback and qualification to the Olympics\nIn February 2023, V\u0103n Vinh finished his 4-year ban and returned to compete internationally. He participated in the 61 kg event in the Asian Games in China, ranked 6th after a total lift of 292\u00a0kg. In April 2024, he officially secured at spot at the 2024 Summer Olympics, after finishing in the top 10 of the 61\u00a0kg event at the 2024 IWF World Cup.\nIn August 2024, V\u0103n Vinh competed in the men's 61 kg event at the 2024 Summer Olympics held in Paris, France. He failed three attempts to lift 128 kg in the Snatch and he did not compete in the Clean & Jerk. A successful attempt in the Snatch would have placed V\u0103n Vinh in the third position after the lift.\nAchievements\n",

    "Mark A. Goldman is an attorney and real estate entrepreneur who is notable for his work on the Marvin v. Marvin palimony case in the 1970s, as well as his co-founding of a real estate company in Southern California.\nMarvin v. Marvin case\nGoldman was co-counsel for actor Lee Marvin in Marvin v. Marvin, a case that spanned through the 1970s. Michelle Triola, Marvin's ex-live-in girlfriend, sued Marvin for the equivalent of spousal support, or \"palimony\". Triola's attorney, Marvin Mitchelson, vowed to show that \"an unmarried couple lives exactly like a married couple\" and were subject to the same property laws upon separation; in response, Goldman agreed that the trial would \"test  acceptance of alternative lifestyles.\" Mitchelson said that the case \"is going to affect everyone who ever has a date\", according to the Associated Press.\nGoldman authored the legal briefs for Marvin in the case. His California Supreme Court brief received praise from the court in a footnote, which stated: \"We wish to commend the parties and amici for the exceptional quality of the briefs and argument in this case.\"\nThe high court's decision gave Michelle Triola, actor Marvin's ex-girlfriend, an opportunity to prove they had an oral agreement for her post-relationship support. Goldman vowed that his client Marvin would \"make no effort\" to settle the suit but would instead go to trial against Triola. He told the Washington Post, \"If you want to get rid of a partner, if you want to break up, it's much smoother to get married now because there are established court procedures. This is a much dirtier fight... The claims are getting more farfetched. These are bedroom contracts. There are never any witnesses.  There's never any corroborating evidence. Some of the claims may be legitimate, but there's no way to distinguish the frivolous from the legitimate.\"\nGoldman estimated that Marvin's attorneys dedicated $300,000 worth of time to the case, plus expenses. After the conclusion of the trial, Goldman told the press, \"Judge Marshall has totally sustained Lee Marvin's position.\" Marvin himself called the result \"sensational\". Though Goldman and the rest of Marvin's trial team maintained \"a low profile in contrast to Mitchelson's high one\", Goldman's comments to the press during the trial were praised as \"disarmingly blunt\".\nGoldman also testified at a state Senate Judiciary Hearing concerning a bill to limit the effect of the Supreme Court's ruling; the bill did not pass. Goldman had opined that the bill would give rise to fraudulent claims.\nThe Real Estate Exchange\nOn January 3, 1977, Goldman co-founded the Real Estate Exchange with partners Jack Guber and Myles B. \"Skip\" Zeleny. The company secured $10 million in business in its first three months. By July 1977, the firm had grown to three offices, including one in Beverly Hills. The partners sold the firm, whose 1977 sales totaled more than $24 million, to competitor Fred Sands in 1979.\n",
    "The Girl as Soldier (German: Das M\u00e4dchen als Soldat) is a Russian folktale collected by Russian folklorist Ivan Khudyakov\u00a0, originally titled \"\u041e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0421\u043d\u043e\u0445\u0430\" (\"The Daughter-in-Law, Again\"). The tale features a heroine that masquerades her gender by adopting a male disguise, passing by tests designed to discover her gender, and is later kidnapped by her lover (or her lover's mother, in other tales); her lover's mother then forces the heroine to perform difficult tasks for her.\nSources\nThe tale was collected by Ivan Khudyakov from a source in the then-existing Ryazan Governorate, originally titled \"\u041e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0421\u043d\u043e\u0445\u0430\" (\"The Daughter-in-Law, Again\"). The tale was translated into German language by author August von L\u00f6wis de Menar with the title Das M\u00e4dchen als Soldat (\"The Girl as Soldier\").\nSummary\nA father has three daughters, and one day is drafted to war. His youngest daughter offers to go in his place, and wears the disguise of a male soldier. She joins the army and is lodged with another soldier and his mother. The soldier's mother suspects her son's friend is a woman underneath, and suggests they test her gender: first, she is to sleep on the grass, so that the way their body presses the leaves reveals their gender; next, she is to take a bath in the sauna with the soldier. The girl tricks the soldier in getting soap for her and takes a bath first. After the war ends, she returns home to her father.\nOne day, her friend, the soldier, appears at her house in the shape of a cat, places her on its back and carries her back home across the Oka river to his mother. The girl throws her ring in the water and makes a vow of silence to never address the soldier's parents, and marries him. The man's mother-in-law forces the heroine in dangerous tasks: to shear her gray sheep (who are gray wolves), then to go to the barn and milk her brown cows (who are bears), and lastly to get a reed (\"\u0431\u0451\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043c\", in the original; \"Weberkamm\", in the German translation) from her \"sister\". The heroine's husband warns her that his mother's \"sister\" is not a relative, but the witch Baba Yaga, who will devour her, so he gives her a piece of butter, a comb and a brush.\nThe heroine visits Baba Yaga in her chicken-legged hut and asks for the reed for her mother-in-law. Baba Yaga goes to sharpen her teeth. The heroine gives the piece of butter to a cat. The animal, in return, advises the girl to spit under the porch, so her saliva can answer for her, then take the reed and escape. The girl obeys the cat and flees from Baba Yaga's hut. The witch goes after her on her iron mortar, but the girl throws behind her the comb and the brush to create obstacles for her. After bringing the reed to her mother-in-law, she resigns herself to the fact that her daughter-in-law survived her every attempt. At the end of the tale, the girl fishes her ring out of the river.\nAnalysis\nTale type\nRussian scholarship classifies the tale as type SUS 428, \"\u0414\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0435 \u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c\u043c\u044b\" (\"The Girl in the Witch's Service\" or \"A girl serving a Witch\"), of the East Slavic Folktale Classification (Russian: \u0421\u0423\u0421, romanized:\u00a0SUS). According to scholar Andreas John and Russian folklorist Lev Barag\u00a0, in the East Slavic type, the heroine's mother-in-law (sometimes identified as witch Baba Yaga) sends her on dangerous tasks in order to get rid of her, but, with her husband's advice, she prevails: with the witch's son's advice, she milks cows (bears), shears sheep (devils), and pays a visit to a second witch in the other world by treating the objects with kindness.\nIn his monograph about Cupid and Psyche, Swedish scholar Jan-\u00d6jvind Swahn\u00a0 acknowledged that Russian type 428 was subtype 425A of his analysis, that is, \"Cupid and Psyche\", being the \"oldest\" and containing the episode of the witch's tasks. In the international index, however, Swahn's typing is indexed as type ATU 425B, \"The Son of the Witch\".\nCombinations with other types\nFelix Karlinger considered the tale a combination of \"heterogeneous\" subjects: the girl as soldier and the demonic mother-in-law. In this regard, Jan-\u00d6jvind Swahn, in his work about Cupid and Psyche and other \"Animal as Bridegroom\" tales, surmised that, in \"Slavonic tradition\", tales of type Aa 428 involve a sequence named \"The Girl as a Soldier\" or \"The Girl At War\", wherein the heroine wears a male disguise, joins with a compatriot who tries to unmask her gender, and eventually marries him. The tale then segues into her mother-in-law's attempts to kill her by setting ludicrous tasks for her. In addition, the East Slavic Folktale Index classified this sequence (heroine masquerading as a male soldier and the tests to her gender) as tale type SUS 884B*, \"\u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430-\u043f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430\" (\"Vasilisa-popovna\").\nVariants\nThe East Slavic Folktale Catalogue, last updated by Russian folklorist Lev Barag\u00a0 in 1979, registers 12 variants. Karelian and Russian scholarship agree that the paucity of registers indicates the \"rarity\" of this tale type.\nRussia\nVasilisa Vasilievna (Nizhny Novg",

    "Scarboro Beach Park was a lakeside amusement park in the the Beaches neighbourhood of Toronto from 1907 until 1925. The park was originally in East Toronto until its annexation by the City of Toronto in 1908. \nMap of East Toronto in 1908, just prior to being annexed to Toronto. showing Scarboro Beach Park on the shore of Lake Ontario.\nThe park operated on a 40 acre-site south of Queen Street East to Lake Ontario between Leuty and MacLean avenues It succeeded two east end trolley parks, Victoria Park (1878\u20131906) and Munro Park (1896\u20131906), which had closed the previous year.\nThe park was founded by Harry and Mabel Dorsey who purchased the site from the Sisters of St. Joseph for $165,000 in 1906. It has been the site of the Order's House of Providence farm since the 1890s. The Toronto Railway Company purchased it in 1913 and invested and expanded it as well as extending the TRC's streetcar network to reach the grounds, making it a trolley park. Previously, Toronto residents had reached the park using a steamship service from the Toronto Harbour at the foot of Yonge Street.\nThe amusement park was built at a cost of $600,000 and opened June 1, 1907. It was modelled on Coney Island's Luna Park and offered over a hundred attractions including various rides such as a Shoot the Chutes water ride, a Tunnel of Love, a roller coaster billed as a scenic train, fun houses, aerial swings, an athletic field that hosted sporting events and was the home field for a lacrosse team, and other attractions such as a freak show, daredevil acts, bathing\nand dance pavilions, band concerts and other features. In 1909, the park was the site of the first public flight in Canada when Charles F. Willard took off from Scarboro Beach Park on September 7, 1909.\nThe park closed for the last time on Septebmber 12, 1925 after 19 seasons. The Toronto Railway Company's streetcar franchise with the city had ended in 1921 with the creation of the Toronto Transportation Commission. TRC sold its assets to the city in 1924 but the city refused to include the amusement park in the deal so it was purchased instead by the Provident Investment Company which demolished the park and replaced it with a residential subdivision. Scarboro Beach Boulevard in that subdivision is named after the park.\nSee also\nHanlan's Point Amusement Park - a similar facility operating on the Toronto Islands in the same period\nSunnyside Amusement Park - opened in Toronto's west end in 2922",
    "RiverNahal Mahanaim (Hebrew: \u05e0\u05d7\u05dc \u05de\u05d7\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd) is a stream named after Kibbutz Mahanaim, located in the eastern Upper Galilee of Israel.\nGeography\nThe stream begins at an elevation of approximately 900 meters above sea level near the community settlement of Amuka, on the eastern slopes of Mount Yavnit. From there, it flows in a steep descent towards the southeast to Hatzor HaGlilit, crossing the settlement from west to east. At this point, the stream turns northeast, reaching the Korazim Plateau, passing north of Kibbutz Ma\u1e25anayim, Moshav Mishmar HaYarden, and Kibbutz Gadot, and empties into the Jordan River in an artificial channel diverted for drainage and agricultural purposes.\nThe stream forms the northern boundary of the Korazim Plateau. It is 13 kilometers long, and its drainage basin covers an area of 21 square kilometers.\nHydrology\nSeveral small springs emerge along the stream, enabling a continuous flow of water in parts of the stream, making these sections perennial. Near the ruins of Yardah, the \"Ein Yardah\" spring emerges, with a flow of up to 5 cubic meters per hour. These waters were previously utilized for agriculture and are now released into the stream.\nSprings\nIn the section of the stream between Amuka and Hatzor HaGlilit, the springs Ein Honi, named after Honi HaMe'agel, and Ein Marganit, a seasonal spring, flow. This section of the stream is well known for the blooming of the large Sternbergia. Near Hatzor HaGlilit, a tomb attributed to Honi HaMa'agel is located.\nRecreational activities\nIn the section of the stream northeast of Kibbutz Ma\u1e25anayim, the Upper Galilee Regional Council has established a bicycle trail that runs parallel to the stream.\nPrehistoric tree branch - excavations of Nahal Mahaniim\nArchaeological significance\nAt the confluence of the Ma\u1e25anayim Stream with the Jordan River, north of the Bnot Ya'akov Bridge, is a prehistoric archaeological site associated with the Middle Paleolithic period (Mousterian culture). The site has been radiometrically dated to approximately 65,000 years ago. The site contains remains of aurochs bones and flint tools used for butchering animals after hunting. Discovered in 1999, the site was excavated by Gonen Sharon on behalf of the Hebrew University and Tel-Hai College.\n",
    "British animal protectionism activist\nClive Thomas Patrick Hollands (26 April 1929 \u2013 16 November 1996) was a British animal protectionism activist and anti-vivisectionist who campaigned to improve animal welfare laws.\nBiography\nHollands was educated at St Mary's College in Liverpool. He served in the Royal Navy from 1946 to 1953. In the 1960s he took interest in animal welfare and realized that since most legislation results from pressure on Government to act, it is important for animal welfare organisations to become unified. Hollands joined the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Vivisection in 1966 as Assistant Secretary under Harvey Metcalfe. He became its secretary in 1970 and director in 1988. In 1976, he founded the Animal Welfare Year as chairman with the support of 67 animal welfare societies. He used Animal Welfare Year to arouse public interest and influence sympathetic MPs to support government action in revising and updating animal welfare legislation. The Animal Welfare Year defined its objective to \"revise and bring up-to-date present legislation, and for the introduction of new legislation\u2013Where the emphasis must be on the protection and wellbeing of animals and not on commercial interest or profit\".\nHollands was an anti-vivisectionist. He supported the abolishment of animal experimentation but felt it was unrealistic to gain governmental support so worked to reform animal welfare laws. He was Secretary of the Committee for the Reform of Animal Experimentation. He was a member of the Farm Animal Welfare Council. He commented that the \"best definition of animal welfare... embraces the concept of dignity: it means: according to animals the natural dignity which is their due as living sentient creatures\".\nHollands was a vice-president of the RSPCA (1980\u20131982) and an advisory director of the World Society for the Protection of Animals. In recognition of his service to animal welfare, Hollands was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1995.\nAnimals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986\nIn 1977, Hollands with Douglas Houghton, Baron Houghton of Sowerby and Richard D. Ryder formed the General Election Co-ordinating Committee for Animal Protection (GECCAP). The GECCAP brought together representatives from the Committee for the Reform of Animal Experimentation, Farm Animal Welfare Co-Ordinating Executive, Humane Education Council, National Joint Equine Welfare Committee and the League Against Cruel Sports.\nGECCAP aimed to \"put animal into politics\" by persuading the main political parties to include animal welfare policies in their election manifestos for the 1979 United Kingdom general election. Their campaign was successful as the Labour Party, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats published some commitments for the first time. All parties included a commitment to legislate a replacement for the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 in their 1979 election manifestos. This led to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986.\nHollands worked under the Committee for the Reform of Animal Experimentation (CRAE) to reform the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876. In 1983, CRAE formed an alliance with the British Veterinary Association (BVA) and FRAME. CRAE was composed of mostly anti-vivisectionists but they campaigned for reform, not abolition of animal experimentation. By 1985 many of their suggestions had been incorporated into the government's proposals for new legislation. The outcome was the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The Act regulates any experimental or scientific procedure which may have the effect of causing a protected animal \"pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm\".\nHe a member of the Animal Procedures Committee that was created by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.\nSelected publications\nCompassion is the Bugler: The Struggle for Animal Rights (1980)\nAnimal Rights in the Political Arena In Peter Singer.

    "Species of beetle (firefly)\nPhoturis hebes, commonly known as heebie-jeebies or the slow-hitch firefly, is a species of beetle in the Lampyridae family. It is found in the eastern United States.\nDescription\nP. hebes is a medium-sized firefly, with adults measuring 10\u201312\u00a0mm (0.4\u20130.5\u00a0in) long. It is smaller and narrower than some other Photuris species, such as Photuris lucicrescens. P. hebes have wing covers, or elytra, varying in color from brown to nearly black with light-colored side margins. There is some regional variation in coloring, and depending on the region, they may or may not have shoulder stripes. Coloring on the head shield, or pronotum, also varies. Often the pronotum is yellow, with a dark mark in the center bounded by red or orange. Photuris fireflies have longer legs than species in the other common firefly genus in the United States, Photinus. P. hebes has a pale chest and pale abdominal segments.\nLife Cycle\nBeetles such as P. hebes go through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Photuris fireflies spend the majority of their lives as larvae, which are bioluminescent. Larvae are predaceous, eating snails, worms, and other soft-bodied invertebrates. Adults appear in mid-summer, from June to July.\nBehavior\nOn summer nights starting about 20 minutes after sunset, adult male P. hebes search for a mate by signaling with quick single flashes repeated about every second, depending on temperature. They flash faster when it is warmer and slower when it is colder. Females respond to the males from the grass and possibly from trees.\nHabitat\nP. hebes are seen near trees and fencerows that border fields, pastures, streams, and other open areas.\nRange\nThey are found in the eastern United States, as far west as Oklahoma and south to Georgia.\n",

    "Peruvian political party\nThe National Alliance of Workers, Farmers, University Students and Reservists (Spanish: Alianza Nacional de Trabajadores, Agricultores, Universitarios, Reservistas y Obreros; ANTAURO), or just the National Alliance (Spanish: Alianza Nacional) is a Peruvian political party. Founded in 2023, it is led by Antauro Humala, leader of the Ethnocacerist movement.\nHistory\nFollowing the 2021 general election, Union for Peru (UPP) lost its political registration, leaving the Ethnocacerism without a political vehicle. On 20 August 2022, the leader of the movement, Antauro Humala, was released from prison after 15 years imprisoned due to the Andahuaylazo. He recognized his plans to register two parties in order to compete in the upcoming presidential election: the United Revolutionary Ethnocacerist Party (PERU) and the ANTAURO itself. On 11 January 2023 he submitted the required signatures to register the party.\nIn September 2023, a private citizen filed a challenge against the imminent registration of the ANTAURO, contending that its leader, Humala, praises the Revolutionary Junta of Juan Velasco Alvarado and supports terrorism, thereby posing a threat to Peruvian democracy. However, on 7 December 2023, the National Jury of Elections (JNE)dismissed the complaint, asserting that Humala did not officially hold any leadership position within the party. Ultimately, the ANTAURO was registered on 12 December 2023 with Marco Antonio Vizcarra, another participant in the Andahuaylazo, as the president and former UPP congressman Rub\u00e9n Ramos Zapata as the legal official.\nAmid widespread concern regarding the party's registration, Prime Minister Alberto Ot\u00e1rola declared his intention to request authorities to investigate the party's ideology, aiming to determine its commitment to democratic principles. Additionally, Congressman Carlos Anderson proposed legislation to prohibit individuals convicted of homicide from assuming the presidency in Peru, a measure designed to preempt any potential presidential candidacy by Humala in the forthcoming 2026 Presidential election.\nIdeology\nMain article: Ethnocacerism\nThe party's acronym is named after its leader, which has led to the party be deemed as a surrogate, which has been rejected by Humala. The party's main ideology is ethnocacerism, which mixes racial superiority of the 'copper skinned' with anti-Chilean rhetoric and has been described as a form of Andean fascism. Nevertheless, in January 2023, Antauro Humala was denounced for praising the Peruvian communist guerrilla group Shining Path.\nThe ANTAURO has strongly criticized the release of former President Alberto Fujimori,adopting an overtly Anti-Fujimorist rhetoric in its campaign. According to political analysts, Humala has recently sought to cast himself as the 'Peruvian Bukele', seemingly attempting to position himself as an authoritative leader. In its statute, the ANTAURO advocates for the restoration of the mandatory military service.\n",
    "Gaelic footballer\nJimmy White is a Gaelic football referee, administrator, coach, manager, player-manager and former player. He is from Killybegs.\nCareer\nAs an inter-county manager White led Donegal to an Ulster Minor Football Championship in 1985, and Ulster League title in the same year. He served as part of P. J. McGowan's backroom team when Donegal won the 1987 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship.\nWhite was a wing-back and was part of the CLG Na Cealla Beaga team that won five Donegal Senior Football Championship titles, in 1988, 1991, 1992, 1995 and 1996, and he played in two other finals without winning, in 1990 and 1993. He was involved in six of the seven finals, missing the 1996 final, even though he had played in each of the earlier matches in the competition. He served as player-manager of the team during this time as well, including in the championship winning seasons of 1991, 1992 and 1995, as well as helping the team to record three consecutive Division One League titles between 1991 and 1993. He did so after John Joe O'Shea, a Kerry native, stood aside as manager.\nWhen he stopped playing as 1996 drew to close, White began refereeing. He rose to inter-county level and was involved at all grades of the game from minor to senior. He was noted for his fitness levels and a characteristic calmness.\nWhite officiated at his first Donegal Senior Final in 1999. He refereed his sixth Donegal Senior Final twenty years later, in 2019 (first replay), tying the all-time record, having earlier been a linesman in the drawn match. His finals in between were 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2011, and there was also the 2005 replay, which was when Naomh Conaill won their first title.\nWhite refereed several senior inter-county championship finals, as well as an All-Ireland Championship final. He was the first Donegal man to referee an Ulster final in 2008. He was referee for the 2010 Connacht final. But, as he reached his fiftieth birthday the same year, he became the first inter-county referee who was forced against his will to stop officiating at inter-county level, in accordance with a recently passed motion of the GAA that ruled in favour of an age limit. His last game as an inter-county referee was the 2011 Dr McKenna Cup final between Derry and Tyrone.\nWhite continues to referee club games. In 2019, he had to leave the field of play on a stretcher after hurting his ankle. His club record includes two Ulster Club Championship finals.\nWhite also works as a tutor for aspiring referees. His daughter has played inter-county football for Donegal.\n",

    "American writer\nLeta Von Felden Myers Smart (March 15, 1893 \u2013 June 8, 1981) was an American writer, and a member of the Omaha people who was active on the national level for American Indian rights.\nEarly life\nMyers was born in Nebraska, the daughter of Garry P. Meyers and Dora Von Felden Meyers. Her father was a blacksmith and an alumnus of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Antonine Barada, an Omaha folk hero, was her great-grandfather. She described herself as a relative and former secretary of Omaha lawyer Thomas L. Sloan.\nMyers attended Hampton Institute from 1910 to 1912. She was denied admission at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School because she was less than a quarter Indian by ancestry. She was listed as 1/16 Omaha in the census of the Omaha Reservation taken in 1932.\nCareer\nSmart was active in the National Council of American Indians, and in the California Indian Rights Association. In 1923, she brought her newborn daughter to Washington, D.C., to demand that the Bureau of Indian Affairs be abolished. In 1931, she questioned the Indian affiliations of entertainer Big Chief White Horse Eagle, and he in turn questioned her Omaha identity. (She was later proven correct; White Horse Eagle was also known as John Delaney, a \"professional ethnic impersonator.\") She was especially active in establishing the full citizenship of Native Americans. \"She has little sympathy with those whose primary interest is the 'romance' of tribal Indian history,\" reported a Los Angeles paper in 1931, which quoted her as saying \"I am not nearly so much concerned over the shape of my grandfather's skull as I am over what is going to happen to me and my child.\"\nSmart spoke to community groups about laws affecting Indian rights. In 1937 and 1938, she testified at Congressional hearings on the land rights of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians, though members of the Band rejected her standing to testify about their business.  In 1945, she represented Los Angeles at the National Council of American Indians, held in Montana. In 1948, her involvement in a Navajo relief drive sponsored by Will Rogers Jr. came under scrutiny by the city of Los Angeles, particularly her eligibility to be paid by the campaign's funds.\nIn the 1950s, Smart led the successful effort to remove two statues, The Discovery of America and The Rescue, from the steps of the United States Capitol. She wrote many letters to the National Sculpture Society, arguing that the representations of Native Americans in these statues was disgraceful, shameful, and \"deplorable.\"\nPublications\n\"W-H-O\" (1920)\n\"On a Nickel\" (1921)\n\"A Picture\" (1921)\n\"A Young Man's Adventure with Opportunity\" (1922)\n\"The Last Rescue\" (1959, Harper's)\nPersonal life and legacy\nMyers married Frank G. Smart in 1921. They had a daughter, Waneta, and later divorced. She and her daughter moved to Los Angeles together in the 1930s. In 1946, Smart spent 30 days in jail after she was convicted of striking Waneta's husband, actor Victor Heyden, with a telephone. She was also prohibited from uninvited visits with Waneta or her husband for two years. She died in 1981, at the age of 87, in Los Angeles. \nThere is a folder of papers related to Smart in the library of the University of Nevada, Reno. Her work is included in Changing is not Vanishing: A Collection of American Indian Poetry to 1930 (2011).\n",

Li was married to fellow author Zhang Xingjuan, together they were considered one of the \"Northeast\u2019s four famous husband-wife writers\".\nEarly life in Manchukuo\nLi Zhengzhong was born on 16 April, 1921, in Yitong County, Jilin. From a young age, his mother encouraged him to recite Tang Dynasty poetry. He attended Jilin City No.1 Middle School. At the age of sixteen he published his first collection of writings, Yu Yin guan shi cun (Yu Yin Pavilion Poems), which is considered to be a lost literary work. Some poems from the text were recovered through local newspapers published in Manchukuo. He then attended Datong University (now Utopia University) in Shanghai from 1939 to 1941, earning a law degree. Li published two more poetry collections, Native Place Yearning and Qiyue (July), both written during his time at university. By 1945, Li published four more books; Wuxian zhi sheng wuxian zhi l\u00fc (Unlimited Life, Unlimited Travel), Sun (Bamboo), Chuntian yi zhu cao (A Blade of Spring Grass), and Lu huo (Furnace Fire). A second edition of Qiyue was published in 1946. While in Manchukuo, Li worked as a judge in a Chinese court and pursued writing, editing, and calligraphy.\nLater career\nAfter World War II, Li worked as a newspaper editor for Dongbei wenxue (Northeast Literature) and Guangfu ribao (Recovery Daily). The new Communist government sentenced Li to six months in prison for his Manchukuo career. After being released he joined the People's Liberation Army and had stopped writing in 1955. During the 1950s and 1960s he worked various positions at a factory in Shenyang, including as a teacher and a labor organizer. Li was condemned as an anti-revolutionary by a court in 1969, and was exiled to rural Liaoning alongside his wife, three children, and father.\nThe Chinese Communist Party reversed it's ruling on writers in 1978 and Li's family returned to Shenyang the following year. Li's calligraphy was exhibitioned across China and in Canada, England, and Taiwan.\nPersonal life\nHe met his future wife Zhang Xingjuan at the age of 14. The two later married in 1943 and had three children.\nLi died on February 23, 2020. His final wish was to donate a total of 500 rare books and pictures to Jilin City No.1 Middle School, which was fulfilled by his family in 2021.\n",

    "\nThe Battle of Ganzak was a clash between the Byzantine and Sasanian armies. The emperors of both empires personally took part in this battle. As a result, the Persians suffered a crushing defeat, and Khosrow fled leaving his army. As a result of this, Heraclius was able to move deeper into Persia.\nBackground\nAfter Khosrow refused the peace treaty, sending an insulting letter in response. Using Khosrow's letter as a tool of inspiration and propaganda for his army, Heraclius marched on Caucasus. Already on the way, he learned that Khosrow was with 40,000 soldiers in Ganzak.\nKhosrow's letter looked like this:\nChosroes, honored among the gods, lord and king of all the earth, offspring of the great Aramazd, to Heraclius, our senseless and insignificant servant. You have not wished to submit yourself to us, but you call yourself lord and king. My treasure which is with you, you spend; my servants you defraud; and having collected an army of brigands, you give me no rest. So did I not destroy the Greeks? But you claim to trust in your God. Why did he not save Caesarea and Jerusalem, and the great Alexandria' from my hands? Do you not know that I have subjected to myself the sea and the dry land? So is it only Constantinople that I shall not be able to erase? However, I shall forgive you all your trespasses. Arise, take your wife and children and come here. I shall give you estates, vineyards, and olive-trees, whereby you may make a living. And we shall look upon you with friendship. Let not your vain hopes deceive you. For that Christ who was not able to save himself from the Jews - but they killed him by hanging him on a cross - how can the same save you from my hands? 'For if you descend into the depths of the sea,' I shall stretch out my hand and seize you. And then you will see me in a manner you will not desire.\nBattle\nHeraclius sent the faithful Arabs forward, who defeated the guards of the Sasanian king. After this, Khosrow fled to the south, and Heraclius killed the remnants of his troops.\nAftermath\nKhosrow fled south to Dastagard, where his army finally dispersed. At this time, Heraclius took Ganzak, and after that he burned the famous temple Takht-i-Suleiman. Heraclius raided the region of Atrpatakan, as far as the King's residence at Gayshawan and continued his campaign.\nReference\n",

    "Cuban revolutionary and politician (1841-1872)\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Agramonte and the second or maternal family name is  Pi\u00f1a.\nEduardo Agramonte y Pi\u00f1a (1841 - March 8, 1872) was a Cuban revolutionary, doctor, and politician who was killed during the Ten Years' War in Cuba.\nEarly life\nEduardo Agramonte y Pi\u00f1a was born in Puerto Pr\u00edncipe (now Camag\u00fcey) in 1841. His first cousin was Cuban patriot Ignacio Agramonte. Aristides Agramonte, his son, was born in the summer of 1868 in Cuba.\nAgramonte's profession was a doctor before the independence campaigns.\nHe was an active member of the Masonic Order of T\u00ednima No. 16, established in Camag\u00fcey in 1866. Although some were against political matters being discussed in their sessions, the T\u00ednima Masonic Lodge was adopted by Camag\u00fcey revolutionaries as the conspiracy's hub in Central Cuba. In meetings coordinated by Oriente's Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes with different revolutionary groups, it was proposed to support the cause of an insurrection in Eastern Cuba.\nTen Years' War\nAgramonte took action when the war of independence against Spain erupted on October 10, 1868, following the Cry of Yara.\nLas Clavellinas Uprising\nHe was instrumental in the Las Clavellinas Uprising in Camag\u00fcey in November 1868.

    "Hungarian-American hazzan, composer, and scholar\nMax (Moshe) Wohlberg (born February 9, 1907) was a Hungarian-American hazzan, composer, and scholar. He was one of the initial members of the Cantors Assembly established in 1947 and served as its president from 1949 to 1951. He helped to found the cantorial school at the Jewish Theological Seminary where he was Professor and head of the nusach department. Self-taught, he developed a curriculum for studying nusach and producing scholarly research, educating over 100 graduates as of 1977.\nWohlberg was known for his recitative compositions and recognized as a melodist who captured the interpretive nuances of liturgical texts. His music was rooted in Jewish liturgical traditions, incorporating biblical cantillations, synagogue motifs, Yiddish song phrases, and Israeli folk melodies. These influences stemmed from his extensive exposure to Jewish musical life and were further enriched by his teaching and research.\nWohlberg died April 19, 1996, in Washington D.C.\n",

After he was killed in battle against numerically superior German forces he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union, making him the first Crimean Tatar nominated for the title, but he was only awarded the Order of Lenin.\nBiography\nHis award sheet nominating him for the title Hero of the Soviet Union\nL\u00fcmanov was born in 1911 to a Crimean Tatar family in Aqta\u00e7\u0131 (later renamed Furmanovka), and was the oldest child in his family. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1932 before joining the Red Army in either 1930 or 1933. At the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was a battalion commander in the 586th Rifle Regiment, commanded by Hero of the Soviet Union Ivan Nekrasov of the 5th Guards Rifle Division.\nSince he spoke German, he went on a mission on 20 July 1941 where he dressed up in a Nazi military uniform pretending to be a Nazi commanding officer checking on a unit, only to then take the company has prisoners of war and thereby stop the enemy's advance.\nThe battles for Yelnya in August 1941 were extremely intense: on 11 August, he received orders to lead his battalion in advancing further into Yelnya to expel Nazi forces from the western slopes in the area. In one day of the battle, his battalion killed 200 Nazis. After receiving orders to advance further east, they went on to capture two tanks and four anti-tank guns from the Nazis. By 31 August, his battalion was running very low on ammunition and ran out of food, yet he continued to lead them in battle, at which point they were fighting off numerically superior forces. In four days they managed to break out of the encirclement, but L\u00fcmanov died in the heat of battle on 5 September 1941. He was posthumously nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 3 March 1942, but was awarded just the Order of Lenin instead. His feats and the feats of his battalion were covered by many Soviet newspapers including Pravda, Izvestiya, and Krasnaya Zvezda.\nFootnotes\n",
    "Iranian warship, commissioned 2022\nIRIS Shahid Soleimani (Persian: \u0634\u0647\u06cc\u062f \u0633\u0644\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc) is the lead ship of an Iranian class of missile corvettes with the same name. It was built by the Shahid Mahallati Shipyard and is operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy of Iran.\nDesign\nHull\nThe ship has a catamaran (twin hull) design with sharp angles to give it a more stealthy design. Its design has been compared to the Chinese Type 22 missile boat and the Taiwanese Tuo Chiang class. According to Iranian officials the ship's hull is made of aluminium instead of steel which decreases the weight and is a new innovation in the Iranian shipbuilding industry.\nArmament\nThis warship is equipped with six anti-ship cruise missiles including four long-range ones (likely Noor or Ghadir) and two short-range anti-ship missiles (likely Nasir) in an order of two long-range and one short-range box launchers on each side behind the superstructure. It is also the first Iranian warship to be equipped with a vertical launching system (VLS). Its VLS includes 6 bigger cells for surface-to-surface cruise missiles and 16 smaller ones for surface-to-air missiles all of which are located behind the command bridge. The warship Shahid Soleimani is also equipped with four 23 mm gatling guns (likely Asef), one 30 mm auto-canon and two chaff dispensers. According to Commodore Alireza Tangsiri, the Shahid Soleimani-class vessels have been equipped with different missiles with ranges of 200, 300 and 750 kilometers, as well as with a new 2,000-kilometer-range cruise missile named Ghadr-474. Tangsiri later said that Sayyad Shirazi and Hassan Baqeri are equipped with 16 Navvab vertically-launched missiles and 6 Sayyad-3 missiles.\nRadars and electronics\nIntelligence and reconnaissance monitoring, surface and subsurface and air traffic monitoring are among the duties of this vessel and it is equipped with Iran's most advanced electronic warfare systems.\nPropulsion\nShahid Soleimani is powered by four indigenous diesel engines which gives it a top speed of 32 knots (59\u00a0km/h; 37\u00a0mph) and a range of 5,000 nautical miles (9,300\u00a0km; 5,800\u00a0mi).\nOther equipment\nThe warship also has a helipad and a crane under it which is used to launch and retrieve fast attack boats. The ship can carry three fast attack boats and has the ability to retrieve and rearm them.\nHistory\nAfter the end of construction at the Shahid Mahallati Shipyard on 14 June 2022, it underwent sea trials but at that time instead of four 20 mm gatling guns, it was equipped with four 12.7 mm machine guns which were later replaced. On 5 September 2022, Shahid Soleimani was commissioned into IRGC's navy branch in a commissioning ceremony.\nSee also\nIRIS\u00a0Shahid Nazeri\nIRIS\u00a0Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis",

    "Boxing match\nGreg Page vs. Tim Witherspoon, billed as True Vindication was a professional boxing match contested on March 9, 1984, for the vacant WBC heavyweight title.\nBackground\nGreg Page had become the number-one ranked heavyweight contender after defeating fellow contender Renaldo Snipes on May 20, 1983. The victory put Page in line for a title shot against the winner of the fight between reigning WBC heavyweight champion Larry Holmes and challenger Tim Witherspoon. After Holmes narrowly defeated Witherspoon by split decision, the WBC ordered Holmes to make his next defense against Page, his mandatory challenger or risk being stripped of his title. Holmes, disappointed by the $2.5 million purse he was being offered to fight Page, opted to take a more lucrative fight with Marvis Frazier which would pay him $3.1 million. WBC president Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n reiterated that Holmes would be stripped of his title should he chose to fight Frazier instead of Page confirming that Holmes had signed a WBC contract with promoter Don King to fight Page and expected Holmes to respect the contracts terms. Days later Sulaim\u00e1n had a change of heart and decided against stripping Holmes, but refused to sanction his fight against Frazier as Frazier was not among the WBC's top-10 contenders. Holmes then opted to make a title defense against Scott Frank before facing Frazier stating he would \"get around to Page\" after the holidays if the \"deal was right\".\nWith Holmes not keen to fight fight him, Page was forced to take a tune-up fight against Rick Kellar in lieu of a heavyweight title bout for which he expressed frustration  telling the media \"I'm the No. 1 contender. I'm supposed to be the one Larry's reckoning with. But that No. 1 don't mean a thing. It's just a number.\" He also expressed doubt that Holmes would ever agree to fight him saying it was like Holmes was saying \"To hell with him, let's keep him in the wings.\" After defeating both Frank and Frazier, Holmes was still unable to come to terms with Page and on December 11, 1983, officially relinquished the WBC heavyweight title in favor of recognition from the newly-formed IBF. That same day the WBC announced that the still number-one ranked Page and the number-two ranked Witherspoon would meet for the now-vacant WBC heavyweight title. Having waited for a title opportunity for the better part of a year, Page expressed both excitement and disappointment stating that while the title shot was \"something I waited for for a long time\" he \"would've liked to face Larry.\" After the fight was officially announced in early February, both Page, who entered the fight as 7\u20135 favorite, and Witherspoon bashed Holmes in the press. Page labeled Holmes a \"chicken\" while Witherspoon, whom had been defeated by Holmes the previous year and had hoped for a rematch, shared Page's sentiments stating \"The I.B.F., that ain't nothing. Holmes is running. He's supposed to be fighting Greg Page and give me a return match. How you gonna get a lot of respect running?\"\nThe fight\nThe two fighters fought a relatively close but lackluster fight and appeared sluggish as the fight went on leading to crowd to boo the lack of action, though Witherspoon served as the aggressor throughout and did just enough to earn a majority decision victory. One judge scored the fight a draw at 114\u2013114 while the two other judges scored the fight at 117\u2013111.\nAftermath\nWitherspoon admitted having trouble with Page stating after the fight \"I knew if I could get him in the center of the ring, I knew I could knock him out, but he wouldn't let me. Page, meanwhile, was so upset about his loss that he contemplated retirement saying \"This is my retirement, man. I'm through with it. It's not worth it.\"\nHolmes, now the IBF heavyweight champion, attended the fight as did then-WBA heavyweight champion Gerrie Coetzee. Holmes criticized the performance of both men telling media \"I always told you neither of them could fight.\" When asked by someone at ringside who was ahead in the fight he jokingly answered \"Where's there a fight?\"\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For WBC heavyweight title ^Note 2 For WBC and The Ring cruiserweight titles\nBroadcasting\n",

During the Cibae\u00f1o Revolution against Buenaventura B\u00e1ez he fought under the orders of Matias Ramon Mella in the assault on Saman\u00e1 in 1858. He resided in Puerto Plata since long before the annexation and under that regime he was assigned to Reserves with rank of commander.\nReyes Mari\u00f3n intervened in the national war in Puerto Plata with Gregorio de Lora. He arrived with him to the Battle of Santiago. On September 6, 1863, Lora heroically died in combat and it was Reyes Marion's turn to assume immediate command of the troops that the brave martyr commanded. Returning to the Puerto Plata line, in September 1863, he was left in the canton of J\u00e1cuba, next to General Pedro Gregorio Mart\u00ednez, Juan Bonilla and Ras\u00edn Isur\u00fan.

    "RiverNahal Zin (in Hebrew:\u05e0\u05d7\u05dc \u05e6\u05d9\u05df Arabic: Wadi al-Fikra) is one of the largest intermittent streams in the Negev, and it is commonly seen as the border between the northern and central Negev. The stream flows from the Plain of the Winds north of the Ramon Crater, passes south and at the foot of the Ben-Gurion Institute, and continues from there. In the northern Arava, the stream is dammed by an earthen embankment, flows into the drainage systems of the Dead Sea Works, and is diverted to the northern basin of the Dead Sea. The length of the stream is about 120 kilometers, and it is the second largest intermittent stream in Israel after Nahal Paran.\nNahal Zin has several names in Arabic, a different name for each section. The first, Wadi Nafha, flows from the high Negev mountain area to the point where the wadi turns 90 degrees east (after the Nabatean city of Avdat). The second part is called Wadi Mora after Ein Mora (the bitter spring named for its brackish waters), the lowest spring in the series of springs in the wadi's gorge (after Ein Ma'arif and Ein Avdat). The third part is Wadi Fukra, which flows from the canyon of Ein Avdat to the Dead Sea (the name means the poor stream, due to the scarcity of grazing food and the few acacia trees in the wadi).\nAbout 2 km north of the entrance to the Ein Avdat National Park, Nahal Zin forms a 'knee' where the stream turns at a right angle from north to east. The 'knee' was formed by ancient stream capture activity, where Nahal Zin captured the waters of an ancient and large stream that flowed before the formation of the Syrian-African Rift from the Edom Mountains westward to the Mediterranean Sea.\nOn average, about four flash floods occur annually in Nahal Zin. In 2004, a peak flow rate of 1,280 cubic meters per second was measured in the stream, the highest in Israel. In January 2010, this record was broken in Nahal Nitzana, where a flow rate of 1,420 cubic meters per second was measured. In 2007, part of the Nahal Zin channel and the erosion cliffs on both banks were declared a national park named \"Sculpture Garden\".\nThe Biblical Zin River\nAmong biblical commentators, there is a debate regarding the location of the biblical Zin River. One interpretation suggests that the Zin River was located in the area of Halutza, Shivta, and Nitzana, an area that constitutes the drainage basin of today's Zin River. There is confusion between the Zin River and the Sin River mentioned in the Book of Exodus as being \"between Elim and Sinai.\"\nThe Dam on Nahal Zin\nNaturally, the stream flows with floodwaters on average four times a year. It crosses the Negev, descends to the Arava Valley, and there splits into a giant alluvial fan that for millions of years flowed into the Sodom Salt Flat. In recent decades, Nahal Zin ends at a wide earthen dam built by the Dead Sea Works to protect the evaporation ponds from floods. Instead of flowing into the salt flat, the stream is diverted into the plant's water drainage system and redirected to the Jordan River and Nahal Arava. As a result, and due to the agricultural activity of the two settlements in the Sodom Plain, the area of the salt flat has shrunk by about 90%.\nEcological Disaster in Nahal Tzin\nWithin the boundaries of Nahal Tzin runs the Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline, a 42-inch diameter, 254-kilometer-long oil pipeline. This line was used to transport jet fuel between the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Eilat. After faults were discovered in the pipeline's casing and it did not meet the requirements of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the flow in the pipeline was stopped, and the operating company began upgrading the line. In June 2011, during the upgrade works, a backhoe hit the fuel pipeline and caused a jet fuel leak in the nature reserve. According to estimates, over one and a half million liters of fuel flowed in the Nahal Tzin streambed. The fuel pollution in the nature reserve threatened important springs downstream, necessitating quick action to save the reserve. The terrain did not allow immediate access to the leak area. To minimize the damage, initial actions were taken such as: manually closing valves, closing the area to hikers, building a barrier downstream to stop the fuel flow, and digging storage pits to collect the liquid fuel. The ecological consequences of the leak were severe: plants dried up and died, animals relying on these plants were harmed, and there was a serious concern that the pollution would be carried into the groundwater and the oases downstream due to the rains and floods typical of the area. Inspectors testified that even months after the incident, the stream reeked of fuel, Maariv, 22/07/2011}}}}. The Magistrate's Court convicted the EAPC company and several former senior officials in the company of severe pollution of Nahal Tzin and its surroundings following two leak incidents, in September and June.\nStream rehabilitation\nThe geology of the stream dictated the method of pollution treatment,",
    "Not to be confused with Volosko or Alexey Voloskov.\nVoloska, sometimes dubbed Vlasta, is a Croatian and Slavic hearth pseudo-deity that has not been attested in historical sources on Slavic paganism. The first known published source that attests to Voloska is the 1943 book Hrvatska narodna mitologija (\"Croatian National Mythology\") by psychiatrist Nikola Su\u010di\u0107, which has been criticized by Croatian ethnologists as \"incorrectly assessing\" pagan myths and as unreliable due to a lack of sources.\nAccording to Su\u010di\u0107, Voloska was the spouse of Veles and the protector of agricultural workers, symbolized by a cow and a swallow. He claims that all Slavic homes featured an alcove (\"miri\u0161te\") where a small flame would be lit in Voloska's honor. This alcove would allegedly also include statuettes of Voloska made from wood, wax or amber.\nIn popular culture\nAfter the publishing of Su\u010di\u0107's book, Voloska was mentioned in the poems of Vladimir Nazor (\"Miti i legende\", 1948) and Boro Pavlovi\u0107 (\"Slavenska lipa\", 1960).\nCommonly cited publicist and movie director Franjo Ledi\u0107, whose interpretation of Slavic mythology was cited as \"romanticized\" by ethnologist Tea \u0160koki\u0107 and \"uncritical\" by Lidija Bajuk, wrote a chapter on Voloska based on the work of Su\u010di\u0107 and the previously mentioned poems.\n",

He then prepared for his baccalaureate in Nancy, before being admitted to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in 1866.\nHe married, on 31. of July 1872. at the town hall of the fifth arrondissement of Paris, Marie Eug\u00e9nie H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bertin-Mourot, the daughter of his thesis supervisor. The couple's witnesses were chemist Henri Sainte-Claire Deville, philosopher Ernest Bersot, former Minister of Public Instruction Victor Duruy, all three from the Institut de France, and Louis Pasteur. The couple had three children:\nAlbert, born in 1873 in Paris, a military chief of staff who died in the Somme in 1916, knight of the Legion of Honour.\nHenry, born in 1877 in Nancy, a doctor, mayor of Lun\u00e9ville, general councillor of Meurthe-et-Moselle, officer of the Legion of Honour.\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne-Jeanne, born in 1879 in Nancy, a military officer's wife who, after being widowed, became the Superior of the Hospice des Dames du Calvaire in Paris, knight of the Legion of Honour.\nIn 1889, along with other personalities from Nancy, Bichat participated in the creation of L'Est r\u00e9publicain, a republican newspaper to combat Boulangism. An uncontested leader of the opportunist anti-clerical party of the Lun\u00e9ville district, Ernest-Adolphe Bichat later evolved in the opposite direction and died piously in Nancy on July 26, 1905(1905-07-26) (aged\u00a059).\nMunicipal councillor of Nancy from 1886 to 1892, he was president of the General Council of Meurthe-et-Moselle from 1892 to 1895, where he had been a councillor since 1880.\nAn Officer of Public Instruction, he was a member of the Higher Council of Public Instruction for many years, then appointed correspondent of the Academy of Sciences for the general physics section in 1893 until his death.\nKnighted in 1892, he was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1900.\nScientific career\nThanks to the gradual opening of education provided by the Republic, he accessed higher education despite coming from a modest background. After obtaining his baccalaureate in Sciences in 1863, he entered the special mathematics class at the Lyc\u00e9e de Nancy with his classmate Gaston Floquet, a future mathematician, and they both took chemistry courses from Camille Forthomme whom they later encountered as a collaborator at the faculty of sciences. He had to give up entering the Polytechnique for health reasons and instead entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in the Science section in 1866 where Pierre Auguste Bertin directed him towards physics. In 1869, he was ranked first in the agr\u00e9gation in physical sciences competition. He frequented the Bertin-Mourot family and in 1872 married his daughter Marie Eug\u00e9nie H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\nFrom 1869 to 1871, he taught physics and chemistry in Angoul\u00eame at the high school. From 1871 to 1873, he taught in Bourges. He then obtained a position as a lecturer at the faculty of sciences of Nancy, where he taught electricity, magnetism, optics, and acoustics.\nAppointed professor in 1877, then dean of the Faculty of Sciences in 1890, he directed this faculty until 1905. He participated in the creation of the university of Nancy in 1902, alongside professors Paul-\u00c9mile Appell and Lucien Cu\u00e9not. Very attached to the principles of laicity and the dissemination of knowledge, he set up free public courses on new electricity developments, the relationship between electricity and light, and X-rays, including scientific demonstrations.\nIn 1904, he chaired the 8th congress of the French Society of Physics organized in Nancy, notably in the premises of the Institut d'\u00e9lectrotechnique Nancy (future ENSIEG) where he had collaborated with Arthur Moritz Schoenflies.\nA bridge in Nancy is named in his honor.\n",
    "Togolese bean-to-bar chocolate manufacturer\nChoco Togo is a Togolese bean-to-bar chocolate manufacturer. It is structured as a cooperative and produces chocolate from domestically grown cocoa beans. It was founded in 2014 by a group of Togolese entrepreneurs who had trained as chocolatiers in Italy. Most of its chocolate is sold locally at affordable prices, but a few sales have been made to international buyers. Chocolate bars produced by Choco Togo are unique in that they are heat resistant, able to withstand temperatures of up to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F).\nFounding\nChoco Togo was established as part of an international project started by the European Union in 2013. The project, titled \"Fair, Young, Sustainable, Inclusive, and Cooperative\", aimed to \"promote cooperative and inclusive thinking\" among youth in Togo. Sixty Togolese youths were trained in entrepreneurial practices and cooperative living by the Enfant-Food-D\u00e9veloppement association, with the support of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Czech Republic, and Italy, the sponsor country. Six individuals from the larger group were then selected to travel to Sicily, Italy, for further training in chocolate making. During their time in Sicily, the trainees received instruction in cocoa processing, fair trade, tourism, and e-commerce. Upon returning to Togo, the trainees learned that domestic cocoa processing had not been attempted in the country since the colonial era, and most Togolese cocoa farmers did not know about chocolate. The trainees therefore decided to create a brand of \"Made in Togo\" chocolate and founded the Choco Togo cooperative in March 2014.\nOperations\nAt the beginning, Choco Togo was funded solely by its founders. The cooperative lacked the high-performance machines used in Sicily to produce high quality chocolate, and resorted to working with unsuitable equipment. However, these financial and equipment issues were alleviated in 2015, when Choco Togo won a number of entrepreneurial and agricultural awards which included millions of West African francs in prize money. Later that same year, the cooperative held the first chocolate fair in Togo, and received an order for 4,000 chocolate bars from Togo's Ministry of Posts and Digital Economy.\nTo source high-quality cocoa, Choco Togo tasked the Federation of Unions of Coffee-Cocoa Producers with identifying a domestic cocoa producer with organic certification. A producer representing 1,500 smallhold farmers in Ak\u00e9bou Prefecture was selected. Once harvested, the cocoa is transported to Kpalim\u00e9, Ak\u00e9bou Prefecture, where forty local women perform the initial processing, which includes sorting, roasting, shelling, and grinding. The resulting powder is then sent to Lom\u00e9, where it is refined into chocolate paste. The paste is tempered and molded into chocolate bars, most of which are sold locally at affordable prices. However, Choco Togo also sells chocolate to Asky Airlines and at one point exported 2.2 tonnes of cocoa beans to Japan.\nCommunity projects\nChoco Togo runs a community development project called Chocoland, which uses the cooperative's mutual savings and microcredits to fund the development of a cocoa farming community in Danyigan, a village in southwest Togo. In 2018, the cooperative expressed its goal of building a health center in the village to reduce the local maternal and infant mortality rates.\nOrganisation\nChoco Togo is a member of the Association of Coffee-Cocoa Processors in Togo, which is part of the Interprofessional Council of the Coffee-Cocoa Subsidiary. This council includes producers, exporters, buyers, and consumers.\nProducts\nChoco Togo's chocolate bars have a rough texture that makes them heat resistant. They can withstand temperatures of up to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F), allowing them to be sold by market stallholders in the tropical climate of Togo, which has a temperature range of 22 to 32\u00a0\u00b0C (72 to 90\u00a0\u00b0F). In 2016, the price of an 80-gram (2.8\u00a0oz) bar was 1,000 West African francs, or about 1.5 euros. Aside from chocolate bars, the cooperative also sells various derivative products, such as hot chocolate, chocolate cake, and other confectionaries. Choco Togo's chocolate is fair trade certified.\n",

His research group, the Neurobionics Lab, studies how and why people should use wearable robotic systems, and designs wearable technologies.\nResearch\nRouse and his research laboratory at the University of Michigan Neurobionics Laboratory have studied how and why people use exoskeletons and robotic prostheses and they leverage that information to develop hardware designs. A common thread within his research program is the topic of system dynamics, coupled with an emphasis on meaningful impact and 'hands-on' engineering. His group conducts scientific studies on human biomechanics and gait, while translating these insights to the development of robotic hardware, including exoskeletons and prostheses.\nRouse has showcased how the idea about leg joint stiffness is varied alongside the pose of the body during gait. He and his group have studied user-preferred settings of exoskeletons and prostheses, and investigated how these preferences vary between users and clinicians. He developed variable-stiffness prostheses and orthoses that can change their stiffness between steps, in addition to contributions in compliant mechanisms. His group also developed a new type of rotational (torsion) spring, which the most energy dense and compact design found in the robotics literature. He investigated exoskeleton control and users' ability to perceive changes in their own metabolic rate. He has developed approaches to understanding the effectiveness of lower-limb exoskeletons and their assistance using concepts from behavioral economics, which was awarded the 2023 Editor's Choice Award by Communications Engineering.\nRouse also founded and leads the Open-Source Leg project, an open-access hardware and software platform to foster lower-limb prosthetics research. The Open-Source Leg (OSL) is a modular, knee-ankle robotic leg that can be used together or separately.

    "Painting by Jan Willem Pieneman\nThe Battle of Waterloo (Dutch: De Slag bij Waterloo) is a large history painting by the Dutch artist Jan Willem Pieneman completed in 1824. It portrays the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 which marked the final defeat of Napoleon's French Empire and the end of the Napoleonic Wars. It focuses on the Allied commanders led by the Duke of Wellington.\nFollowing the success of his 1818 work The Prince of Orange at Quatre Bras the artist chose to depict another scene from the Hundred Days campaign. He traveled to London in February 1821 where he received assistance from the Duke of Wellingon who let him establish a temporary studio in Apsley House and posed for his own portrait. He also arranged sittings with other senior figures present at Waterloo and in addition had his horse Copenhagen brought to London so that Pieneman could capture its likeness. After spending nearly  nearly four months in London the artist returned to Amsterdam where he also painted the Prince of Orange in preparation for the work.\nThe work itself took almost three years to complete. Measuring eighteen and a half by twenty seven feet it was a giant canvas. It depicts the scene at the moment news reaches Wellington that Prussian forces under Blucher are arriving on the battlefield. The focus is on the Allies, particularly the British, the Dutch and Belgians of the Netherlands and the King's German Legion of Hanover. Wellington is the central figure of the scene, mounted on Copenhagen. The Prince of Orange is in the bottom left hand corner of the painting, wounded and being carried on a stretcher. Other figures portrayed include Lord Uxbridge, Rowland Hill and Miguel Ricardo de \u00c1lava. Behind them the battle rages on. To the left a British cavalryman waves a captured French Eagle in the air.\nAlthough Wellington may have planned to acquire the painting to hang at his country estate Stratfield Saye, it was bought instead by the Prince of Orange for 40,000 guilders. The sum was actually paid by his father William I as a gift for his son and heir. As a condition of the sale, Pieneman insisted that he be allowed to exhibit the painting in London.\nDue to the painting's large size it was decided to construct a specially-built pavilion in Hyde Park. This opened in early May 1825 proved very popular with the British public who turned out in large numbers. The work was on display for around ten months in total including the tenth anniversary of the battle on 18 June 1825. It was also exhibited in Brussels and Ghent. It is now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the largest work in the collection. Smaller versions exist at Apsley House and Cirencester Park in Gloucestershire where a copy was given to Wellington's political ally Lord Bathurst.\n",

Residing in Doha, Qatar, the chairman serves as a figurehead for Hamas during Palestinian elections and becomes the central leader in the resistance against Israeli occupation. Additionally, he plays a crucial role in foreign relations, leading negotiations with Israeli officials regarding peace processes, fostering reconciliation with Fatah, and enhancing ties with other Middle Eastern countries.\nHistory\nMain article: History of Hamas\nAhmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas, become the first chairman of the Hamas Shura Council and de facto leader of Hamas from December 1987 until March 2004. Following his assassination, his deputy, Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi took over for only 15 days before he was assassinated by Israel.\nThe current chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau at that time, Khalid Mashal, took over Hamas leadership and declare as the overall and de facto leader of Hamas since April 2004. Although he hold this position since 1996, he was not the overall leader of Hamas since the chairman of the Hamas Shura Council at that time considered as the de facto leader. Hamas elected Mousa Abu Marzook, the previous political bureau's chairman, as the deputy chairman of Hamas Political Bureau in January 1997.\nIn May 2017, Ismail Haniyeh, the deputy chairman of Hamas Political Bureau, was elected by the Hamas Shura Council as the chairman of Hamas Political Bureau. Hamas also elected Saleh al-Arouri as the deputy chairman of Hamas Political Bureau. However, Al-Arouri was assassinated by Israeli strike in January 2024. Six month later, Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran while attending for the inauguration ceremony of the President of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian.\nOn 1 August 2024, Khaled Mashal, the then-chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau, was expected to lead Hamas again.\nOn 5 August 2024, Abu Omar Hassan was expected to become the next chairman of Hamas Political Bureau. Before this, he serving as the chairman of the Hamas Shura Council from October 2023, succeeded Osama Mazini, after his killing on 16 October 2023 by Israeli strike.\nHowever, on 6 August 2024, Yahya Sinwar officially appointed as the next chairman of Hamas Political Bureau and de facto leader of Hamas after six days of assassination of his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh. The announcement came after the Shura Council, the body that elects Hamas's politburo, voted unanimously to choose Sinwar as the new leader, in what was described by a Hamas official as a \"message of defiance to Israel\". Khalil al-Hayya was selected as the deputy chairman of Hamas Political Bureau on the same day. Previously, Al-Hayya was the deputy leader of Hamas government in the Gaza Strip.\nStructure of organisation and selection\nHamas inherited a tripartite organization of social services, religious instruction, and military operations overseen by a Shura Council. It used to have four different roles: \na security service (Arabic: Jehaz Aman);\na military division for acquiring weapons and conducting operations (Arabic: Al-Mujahideen al Filastinun);\na charitable social welfare division (Arabic: Dawah); and\na media branch (Arabic: A'alam).\nHamas is led both internally, in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and externally, by two groups: Kuwaiti organization (Kuwaidi), led by Khaled Mashal, and a Gaza group led by Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, who was exiled first to Damascus subsequently to Egypt. Following its leader Mashal's decision to demand that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait and defy Yasser Arafat's decision to support Saddam Hussein in the invasion, the Kuwaiti group of Palestinian exiles started to receive substantial money from the Gulf States. Ismail Haniyeh was selected by the Hamas Shura Council in May 2017 to succeed Mashal as the leader of Hamas.\nThe organization's operational actions are concealed by a veil of secrecy, making its actual structure unclear.

The nearest towns are Voronikha to the north and Borovskoye, formerly known as Bakhmatovo, located near the southern lakeshore. Aleysk, the district capital, lies 42 kilometers (26\u00a0mi) to the southeast.\nGeography\nBakhmatovskoye is in the area of the sources of the Barnaulka river. It lies in one of the wide ravines of glacial origin that cut diagonally across the Ob Plateau slanting towards the Ob River. The lake has an elongated shape, stretching roughly from northeast to southwest for over 14 kilometers (8.7\u00a0mi). It is connected by a channel with neighboring lake Sredneye to the southwest and with lake Serebrennikovskoye to the northeast. The shores are flat and often deeply indented, forming bays and peninsulas. There are also a few islands in the central section. The bottom of the lake is sandy and silty with a predominance of gray silt.\nThere are a number of lakes in the same trench. Lake Sredneye is located 0.9 kilometers (0.56\u00a0mi) to the southwest and Zerkalnoye 18 kilometers (11\u00a0mi) further away in the same direction. Lake Peschanoye lies 8 kilometers (5.0\u00a0mi) to the northeast.\nFlora and fauna\nThe ribbon pine forest characteristic of the Ob Plateau grows close to the lake. Reeds, bulrush and cattails are found in sections of the lakeshore. The main fish species is the crucian carp, but gudgeon and Eurasian minnow are also found. The latter are more sensitive to increases in salinity and sometimes mass-death occurs.\nSee also\nList of lakes of Russia",

    "Dutch para-cyclist and swimmer\nMarieke van Soest (born 1987) is a Dutch para-swimmer and cyclist. In cycling, she competes on a tricycle.\nSporting career\nMarieke van Soest was born and raised in Nijkerk, the third child in a family with four children. She is a member of a Reformed district church that belongs to the Evangelical Church in the Netherlands. In 2014, she fell into a coma at the University Medical Center Utrecht due to an aneurysm, when she was actually there because of an infection in her ankle. Since she was already in hospital, an operation was able to save her life. Rehabilitation lasted two years and she had to have an artificial skull inserted. She is dependent on an electric wheelchair because she is paralyzed on one side.\nAfter her rehabilitation, van Soest devoted herself to swimming, which she had already done before her illness. She taught herself to move in the water with one arm and one leg, and she became Dutch champion in the individual medley in 2017 and 2018. Despite these achievements, the Royal Dutch Swimming Federation (KNZB) did not nominate her for the 2020 Summer Paralympics; she herself believes that she was given preference over athletes with less disabilities: \"You would have had to take the wheelchair with you and someone would have had to help me change for the swim.\"\nIn the spring of 2019, van Soest therefore decided to start cycling. To do this, the Royal Dutch Cycling Union initially loaned her a tricycle, which was not suitable for international competitions. In March 2020, she received a bike specially built for her by frame builder Ben de Ruiter.\nIn 2020 and 2021, van Soest became Dutch champion, and in 2021 she became European champion. In May 2022 she won three World Cups and two European Cups. In August 2022 she became (as the first Dutch woman) tricycle world champion in the road race and time trial, and in September 2022 Dutch champion in both disciplines.\n",

It was founded in Irkutsk in 1919 to serve the financial needs of the Czechoslovak Legion and prospered in subsequent years thanks to its strong patriotic associations. Under Nazi occupation during World War II, it was renamed Czecho-Moravian Bank in Prague (Czech: \u010ceskomoravsk\u00e1 banka v Praze) between 1940 and 1945. It was eventually nationalized and absorbed by \u017divnostensk\u00e1 Banka in 1948.\nIts head office building in Prague, designed by Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r, is so representative of the particular Czechoslovak version of art deco architecture known as rondocubism that the latter is sometimes referred to as Legiobanka style (sometimes \"Legiobank style\").:\u200a178\u200a\nOverview\nThe creation of the bank, in Irkutsk in the autumn of 1919, was preceded by that of the Military Savings Bank (Czech: Vojensk\u00e1 spo\u0159itelna a year before. A key figure for the establishment of both institutions was Franti\u0161ek \u0160\u00edp\u00a0, a legionnaire officer responsible for the logistics and financing of the approximately forty thousand-strong legionary army in Russia. \u0160\u00edp logically became the bank's first general manager. The bank maintained its activity throughout the interwar period. In addition to its head office, it had four local branch offices in Prague and 17 local branches in the rest of the country, in Berehovo, Bratislava, Brno, Duchcov, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Jihlava, Kol\u00edn, Louny, Lovosice, Ostrava, Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom, Olomouc, Pie\u0161\u0165any, Plze\u0148, Poprad, Turnov, and Zvolen.:\u200a102\u2013103\u200a\nDuring the presidency of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk in the 1920s and 1930s, the bank was associated with the political group around him known as the Hrad (lit.\u2009'the castle'). In the late 1930s, its building was also the seat of the Party of National Unity. \nIn 1940, the occupation authorities ordered the bank to rename itself as Czecho-Moravian Bank in Prague. In 1943, it was designated for merger with Kreditanstalt der Deutschen, a cooperative bank of the German community in Prague that had been established in 1911, but that plan was not carried out. The Legiobanka was re-established under its former name in July 1945, shortly after liberation,:\u200a101\u200a and nationalized in October 1945 under Decree No. 102/45. In 1948, the Communist authorities forcibly merged it into \u017divnostensk\u00e1 Banka, which itself was absorbed in 1950 into the State Bank of Czechoslovakia.\nHead office\nThe bank was initially located in Prague's \u0160tef\u00e1nik barracks and then in the hotel U Sask\u00e9ho dvora\u00a0. In 1923, it moved into its own new head office building\u00a0 designed by architect Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r in 1921. It displays four figurative representations by sculptor Jan \u0160tursa of the Legion's fighting, respectively on the Italian front (battles of Doss'Alto\u00a0 and the Piave), Eastern Front (Zborov), Russian Far East (the revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion on the Trans-Siberian Railway, known in Czech as the Magistr\u00e1le), and Western Front (Vouziers and the Terron\u00a0). Above these is a frieze depicting the return of the Legions, by Otto Gutfreund.:\u200a103\u200a Visual artist Franti\u0161ek Kysela\u00a0 led the interior design.\nIn 1922, Legiobanka purchased the adjacent building at Na Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed 26, and in 1937\u20131938 had it rebuilt on a design by Franti\u0161ek Marek to host various facilities including the avant-garde D 34 Theatre\u00a0 led by Emil Franti\u0161ek Burian. The theatre was revived from 1960 to 1991 as the E. F. Burian Theatre\u00a0. \nThe building was purchased in 1990 by \u010cSOB, which had it renovated in 1991\u20131994 and keeps a branch at the street level.

    "View of Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo\nThe Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo, also known as the Palazzo del Podesta  is a late-Romanesque-Gothic architecture, late 13th-century civic palace located in Piazza del Popolo, in the historic center of Orvieto, region of Umbria, Italy. The palace now houses some municipal offices and the main hall is used for cultural events and meetings.\nSurrounding the Piazza del Popolo is also the palaces named for the Bracci and Simoncelli families, and the deconsecrated church of San Rocco.\nHistory and description\nThis was erected as a single story loggia in 1156 by pope Adrian IV as a papal palace (Palazzo Apostolico) adjacent to the church of San Bernardo. However, it suffered grave damage during the wars of the following century, and was restored by pope Alexander IV in 1255. Thereafter it served as the residence of the Podest\u00e0, and later the Captain of the People, both representing the supreme local magistrate representing the pope.\nThe structure was enlarged within ten years of its original construction and, in 1315, the bell tower was added and in the subsequent year, a great bell was hung there. The upper part of the structure was covered in 1472 and the large hall divided into two rooms, one large and the other small. The larger of the two occupied an area that corresponds approximately to the room known today as the Sala dei Quattrocento. Subsequently, the building functioned as a residence for the Capitano del Popolo, the Podest\u00e0 and the Signori Sette.\nThe reconstruction, using local pink tufa stone, created a rectangular hall as a piano nobile, standing upon five solid arcades. The second floor has six arches facing the Piazza del Popolo, four of which now have mullioned windows. The arches are flanked by a brick fretwork consisting of protuding bricks or voids, and surmounted with circular floral or geometric (plate tracery) in the tympanum. The arches are also flanked by  The second floor was accessed by a wide staircase, leading to a tribune or terrace from where the magistrate could speak to those assembled below. At one time the stairs and tribune were roofed. The stairs alter the palace from a fortress-like exterior to this open access that symbolize the citizen's new ease of entry to the Council Hall itself.\nFrom 1596 one of the lower-section rooms housed the Studium, which had been re-instituted a few years earlier by Lorenzo Magalotti. Students of law, theology and logic came here to study twice a day, each time the bell of Palazzo del Popolo rang, until 1651. Few records of this university appear after this date. Some sources indicate that it dates back to 1013 and had connections with names such as the Benedictine monks Graziano and Gozio of Orvieto.\nIn the 16th century, a scholarly society in Orvieto, known as the Accademia de Nobili, or of the Phoenix or of the Confusi; was allowed to build a small theater, designed by Sforzino da Todi and decorated by Ricciolini, in the palazzo. It was inaugurated during the visit of Queen Christina, Queen of Sweden.\nIn the ground floor of the Palazzo, facing the Piazza del Popolo, was once found the offices of the Monte di Pieta, a pawn shop lending money mainly to the poor. It was established in 1463 under bishop Marinonim and the Franciscan friar Fra Bartolomeo da Colle, and with the support of Pope Pius II. A plaque with antisemitic overtones at the site read: To relieve the poverty of the poor and to depress the usury of the Jews, This Monte di Pieta was permitted by Pius II and erected and endowed by Orvietan piety.\n",
    "German politician (1926\u20131976)\nWerner Wittig (24 October 1926 \u2013 8 January 1976) was a German politician and party functionary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nOne of a few former Nazis to have a political career in East Germany, Wittig rose to the position of First Secretary of the Bezirk Potsdam SED and became a member of the SED Central Committee.\nWittig's career was only cut short when he surprisingly died in January 1976 at the age of 49.\nLife and career\nEarly career\nAs the son of a farm laborer, he attended elementary school in Luckenwalde from 1933 to 1941 and completed an apprenticeship as a commercial clerk there from 1942 to 1944. Wittig applied for membership in the NSDAP on 17 February 1944, and was admitted on 20 April (Hitler's birthday) of the same year (membership number 10,090,408). From June 1944 to May 1945, he was a soldier in the Wehrmacht.\nAfter the war, he initially worked as a kitchen helper in a large kitchen in Luckenwalde. In August 1945, he became a member of the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany), and after the forced merger of the SPD and KPD (Communist Party of Germany) into the SED in the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ) in 1946, he became a member of the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany).\nAfter attending the State Party School in Schmerwitz near Wiesenburg/Mark, he worked full-time for the SED. His first role was as the state youth secretary of the Mark Brandenburg SED (1946/47). From 1948, he was the personal assistant to the chairman of the Brandenburg SED, Willy S\u00e4gebrecht, and from January 1949, head of the department in the office of the state chairman of the SED.\nFrom April 1952 to August 1953, he was the First Secretary of the SED in Potsdam City in the then State of Brandenburg and later Bezirk Potsdam. After attending the CPSU Higher Party School \"W. I. Lenin\" in Moscow from 1953 to 1956, he was appointed department head in the Bezirk Potsdam SED.\nSubsequently, from January 1961 to June 1964, he was the First Secretary of the SED in Brandenburg an der Havel.\nBezirk Potsdam SED First Secretary\nFormer Bezirk Potsdam SED building in 2008. The SED's logo still is faintly visible.\nIn June 1964, Wittig rose to the position of the First Secretary of the Bezirk Potsdam SED, longtime incumbent Kurt Seibt joining the Council of Ministers of East Germany as Minister of the newly created Ministry for the Guidance and Control of Bezirk and District Councils.\nWittig additionally became a full member of the Central Committee of the SED in April 1967 (VII. Party Congress) and the Volkskammer in later that year, nominally representing a constituency in the rural north of his Bezirk.\nOn behalf of Walter Ulbricht, Wittig was one of the main people responsible for the demolition of the Garnisonkirche ruins, despite opposition from a small part of the city council, including allegedly the then mayor of Potsdam, Brunhilde Hanke.\nIn 1970, Erich Honecker proposed him along with Harry Tisch as the chairman of the Volkskammer Committee for National Defense and successor to the late Paul Fr\u00f6hlich. However, this failed due to a calculated move by Honecker, who proposed Hermann Matern at the last minute, as his preferred candidate, Paul Verner, would not have been accepted by Ulbricht, and he saw Matern as an interim solution until the planned ousting of Ulbricht.\nWittig was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in silver in 1965, the Banner of Labor in 1969, the Medal Brotherhood in Arms in gold in 1970 and the Kampforden \u201eF\u00fcr Verdienste um Volk und Vaterland\u201c in gold.\nDeath\nWittig unexpectedly passed away in Potsdam in January 1976 at the age of 49. He was succeeded by his deputy G\u00fcnther Jahn.\nDuring the GDR era, a POS in today's Berlin district of Staaken (Spandau borough), the Potsdam Polytechnic Secondary School 45, and a street in the Waldstadt II residential area were named after him. His grave is located in an honor grove at the New Cemetery in Potsdam.\n",
    "\nChemical compound\nFrontalin is a naturally occurring organic compound. It is a terpenoid and acetal that functions as a pheromone in bark beetles and elephants.\nOccurrence\nAsian elephant in Laos\nFrontalin acts as an insect pheromone in bark beetles of the genus Dendroctonus, including Dendroctonus frontalis (Southern Pine Beetle) and Dendroctonus brevicomis (Western Pine Beetle), as well as the Mountain Pine Beetle. The biologically active form is predominantly (-)-frontalin. However, (+)-frontalin also occurs in some cases. In Dendroctonus frontalis, the female mainly produces (-)-frontalin, the male mainly (+)-frontalin. In Dendroctonus rufipennis the distribution is reversed.\nIn addition to its role in insect pheromones, frontalin also serves as a pheromone in Asian elephants. It is secreted by adult male elephants during musth, with secretion levels increasing with age. It signals mating readiness, particularly attracting females who are also in the receptive phase of their sexual cycle.\nBiosynthesis\nUnlike many pheromones in bark beetles, which are derived from terpenes present in host plants, frontalin does not follow this pathway. The biosynthesis in Dendroctonus jeffreyi and other species of the genus was studied using isotope labeling. The biosynthesis is believed to originate from acetate, with geranyl pyrophosphate and 6-methyl-6-hepten-2-one being probable intermediates.\nSynthesis\nBoth enantiomers of frontalin can be synthesized starting from the ester of 8-phenylmenthol with pyruvic acid. The alcohol component acts as a chiral auxiliary. In the presence of lithium perchlorate, methylmagnesium bromide can be added to the reactant. The resulting hydroxy group can then be reacted with the Cornforth reagent (pyridinium dichromate), followed by the addition of a Grignard compound derived from 5-bromo-2-methylpent-1-ene. Reduction with lithium aluminum hydride removes the chiral auxiliary, yielding a diol. Subsequent reaction with ozone and reductive work-up with dimethyl sulfide produces (-)-frontalin. By reversing the order of the Grignard reagents, i.e., adding methylmagnesium bromide second, (+)-frontalin can be obtained.\nAn alternative synthetic route begins with a Diels-Alder reaction between 3-buten-2-one and methacrylic acid methyl ester. The methyl ester can be reduced to a hydroxymethyl group using lithium aluminum hydride. Oxymercuration with mercury(II) acetate, followed by treatment with potassium hydroxide/ sodium borohydride, hydroxylates the double bond and allows for direct cyclization to frontalin.\n",

    "American civil libertarian (1888\u20131975)\nLucille Bernheimer Milner (born Lucille Bernheimer, June 9, 1888 \u2013 August 14, 1975) was a cofounder the American Civil Liberties Union.\nBiography\nMilner was born on June 9, 1888, in St. Louis, Missouri.  At the age of 16 she moved to Colorado where she was treated for tuberculosis, returning to St. Louis until she moved to Mobile, Alabama to live with relatives. In 1912 she married her first cousin (Reece Bernheimer or Maurice Lowenstein depending on the source. \nMilner refers to her first husband only as \"Reese\" in her autobiography.) He died the same year.\nMilner moved to New York where she attended the New York School of Philanthropy (now the Columbia University School of Social Work), and the Rand School of Social Science. She returned to St. Louis after graduation. There she met Roger Nash Baldwin, who she worked with at the St. Louis, Civic League. She became active in the cause of women's suffrage, joining the Equal Suffrage League of St. Louis and attending the National American Woman Suffrage Association.\nReturning to New York, Milner was active in the National Civil Liberties Bureau advocating for the rights of conscientious objectors to military service. She would go on to serve as the executive secretary of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) when it was formed in 1920. The same year she married Joseph Milner with whom she had two children.\nMilner had a long association with the ACLU. Her relationship grew strained in the 1930s when the ACLU began removing members of the organization who were known members of the Communist party. Specifically, the ACLU forced the resignation of Harry F. Ward and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. Milner quit the organization in to protest the ACLU's advocacy for the rights of American fascist groups in the 1940s.\nIn 1954 she wrote an autobiography entitled The Education of an American Liberal.\nShe died on August 14, 1975, in New York City.\n",

    "American football player\nRick LeLacheur (born 25 August 1948) is a Canadian football executive and former ice hockey player who is the president and chief executive officer (CEO) for the Edmonton Elks of the Canadian Football League (CFL). \nEarly life and hockey career\nAn Edmonton native, LeLacheur was born on 25 August 1948. Playing at the right wing position, he was on the roster for the Edmonton Western Movers of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) for the 1966\u201367 season. LeLacheur then played two seasons for the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Canada Junior Hockey League (WCJHL), later renamed the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). He was the captain for the Oil Kings. LeLacheur's final season playing ice hockey was for the Edmonton Monarchs of the Alberta Senior Hockey League (ASHL) in 1969\u201370.\nExecutive career\nFollowing his hockey career, LeLacheur pursued a business career path, working for his family's Western Moving and Storage business for 25 years. He became Western's president in 1982, serving in the position until the company was sold in 1992.\nIn 1984, before becoming involved with any Canadian Football League (CFL) team, he was the chairman of the Grey Cup festival. He was a board member of the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos in the 1980s. From 1992 to 1998, LeLacheur served as the head of Economic Development Edmonton (EDE), also known as the Edmonton Economic Development Corporation (EEDC). In 1994, LeLacheur brokered a deal that gave Peter Pocklington full control over the Northlands Coliseum.\nLeLacheur became the president and CEO of the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, hosted in Edmonton.\nLeLacheur then served as the team president and CEO of the Eskimos from 2002 to 2011. He began his tenure with the team as the chief operating officer (COO) of the franchise. Edmonton hosted the 90th Grey Cup in 2002, with LeLacheur serving as the game's managing director. During his tenure with the Eskimos, he oversaw new building additions to the team's Commonwealth Stadium. LeLacheur won two Grey Cup championships with the Eskimos, in 2003 and 2005. In 2010, he publicly criticized the team as they started the season 0\u20134. Edmonton would again host Grey Cup festivities in 2010. LeLacheur was named the winner of the Hugh Campbell Distinguished Leadership Award for the 2011 CFL season. He left the team due to health concerns, after experiencing complications stemming from surgery for prostate cancer.\nIn December 2011, he was appointed as the chairman for a three-year term for Horce Racing Alberta (HRA), a private, not-for-profit organization.

    "Political party in United States\nUnionists in the border states organized political parties to oppose secession from the United States during the American Civil War. They extended critical support to the wartime administration of Abraham Lincoln while remaining outside Lincoln's Republican Party. While some harbored antislavery sympathies, most Unionists viewed the abolitionist movement with hostility and initially resisted Lincoln's efforts on behalf of emancipation. Unionist governments were opposed by Copperheads who opposed Lincoln's wartime policies and in some cases the war itself, as well as Confederate regular and irregular military forces.\nAbraham Lincoln won the 1860 United States presidential election on a platform that called for the exclusion of slavery from the U.S. territories; his election and subsequent efforts to suppress rebellion precipitated the secession of eleven slave states that formed the Confederate States of America. Unionist opposition to secession in the slave states included conditional unionists who preferred a compromise consistent with southern interests but held out the possibility of secession as a last resort, as well as others whose commitment to Union was unequivocal. These latter unconditional unionists remained loyal to the national government following the commencement of hostilities in April 1861, while many conditional unionists went over to the Confederacy.\nUnionists won critical elections in Kentucky and Maryland preceding the July 4, 1861 emergency session of Congress, sending more than a dozen members to the House of Representatives. They established provisional governments in Missouri and the western counties of Virginia that constituted the loyal civilian authority in those states throughout the war; a similar strategy was attempted unsuccessfully in East Tennessee. By 1862, issues related to slavery and emancipation increasingly divided Unionists between opposing factions, culminating in a formal split between Conservative and Unconditional (or Radical) Unionists. Unwilling to sanction proposals for immediate emancipation and Black enlistment, some Conservatives supported the Democratic Party in the 1864 United States presidential election; the remainder followed the Radicals into the National Union Party coalition. Lincoln's reelection on the National Union ticket demonstrated the Radicals' superior strength and established a beachhead for the Republican Party in the Upper South.\nUnionists came from diverse backgrounds, although certain commonalities were apparent. Most were former Whigs who had declined to join the Republican Party prior to the war; a minority were Unionist Democrats whose Jacksonian nationalism inspired a fierce opposition to disunion. They drew strength from Appalachia as well as merchants and businessmen in commercial centers like Baltimore. Montgomery Blair was the highest-ranking Unionist in the national government for most of the war as postmaster general in Lincoln's cabinet; other prominent Unionists included Francis Preston Blair Jr., John J. Crittenden, Henry Winter Davis, and Andrew Johnson.\nName\nIn its broadest application, \"unionist\" referred to active opponents of secession in the slave states who remained loyal to the national government following the commencement of hostilities in April 1861. Some historians and contemporary sources use the term \"unconditional unionist\" to distinguish between this former group and \"conditional unionists\" who expressed initial reservations with secession but ultimately supported the Confederacy. Elected politicians who pledged unconditional loyalty to the United States during the war were called \"Unionists\" or \"Unconditional Unionists.\" These terms were sometimes used interchangeably; in other cases, they referred to distinct party organizations, as in Maryland, where the Unconditional Union Party defeated the Conservative Unionists in the 1863 elections.\nUnionist political parties active in the border states and areas of the Confederacy occupied by the Union Army were known by a variety of names, including the Union Party, the Union Democratic Party, and the Unconditional Union Party. As the war progressed, rival Radical and Conservative organizations divided Unionists in several states. In Missouri, the Conservative state organization called itself the Unconditional Union Party in 1864; its opposition formed the Radical Union Party. Dissimilarly, in Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, and West Virginia, the \"Unconditional Union Party\" was the name used by the Radical faction. Many of these state Union parties sent delegates to the 1864 National Union Convention, including both Missouri Unionist factions.\n",

    "Turkish fairy tale\nThe Padisah's Youngest Daughter and Her Donkey-Skull Husband is a Turkish fairy tale published by researcher Barbara K. Walker.\nThe tale belongs to the international cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom or The Search for the Lost Husband, wherein a human princess marries a supernatural husband, loses him, and goes on a quest to find him. It is also distantly related to the Graeco-Roman myth of Cupid and Psyche, in that the heroine is forced to perform difficult tasks for a witch or her mother-in-law.\nSources\nResearcher Barbara K. Walker published in 1993 a tale archived at the Uysal\u2013Walker Archive of Turkish Oral Narrative with the title The Padisah's Youngest Daughter and Her Donkey-Skull Husband, first collected in 1970 from teller Niy\u00e2zi \u00c7am, from Bursa Province.\nSummary\nThe padishah assembles everyone in the palace courtyard for his three daughters to toss their apples to choose their husbands. The third daughter tosses hers and it lands near a donkey skull. She marries the donkey skull and, inside the nuptial chambers, her husband reveals he is a handsome youth, but asks her never to spill the secret, lest he disappears and she has to quest for him. Life goes on for both, and the princess visits the public bath for women. There, she is mocked for marrying a donkey skull.\nOne day, fed up with the mockery, reveals to the other women the true nature of her husband, who knocked on the door to the bath house to reprimand his wife. He tells her she may never find him again, even if she walks with an iron cane and wearing a pair of iron shoes, and vanishes. She decides to seek him out, and wears a pair of iron shoes. She reaches the Pearl Mountain, the Gold Fountain and the Diamond Fountain, where her husband lives in a mansion. They reunite, but he warns her that his mother is a giant that may devour her, so he changes her into a broom to hide her from his mother. The next day, he asks his mother not to hurt a padishah's daughter if she comes by; his mother agrees and he changes the broom back into his human wife.\nThe giantess forces the human princess to sweep or not sweep her house, to fill 40 cauldrons with her tears, and to climb the mountain, enter another mansion and get her a closed box. The husband advises the princess to drink from a fountain of bitter liquid and compliment it, to eat a sour pear from a tree and compliment it, close an open door and shut an open one, change the food of two animals for the correct ones (meat for a lion, grass for a horse), get the box and escape. She does all that and climbs down the mountain, but curiosity gets the better of her and she opens the box; \"wild music\" starts to leak from the box, until her husband appears to close it again. The princess delivers he box to the giantess mother.\nThat night, the couple decide to escape from the mansion, while his family follows them. First, they transform into a minaret and a mosque, then a sheep and a flock of sheep, and lastly a poplar tree (the princess) and a snake atop the tree (the prince). His mother comes to the tree; the snake asks her for a kiss and spits venom into her mouth. The princess and her husband return to her kingdom.\nAnalysis\nTale type\nIn the Typen t\u00fcrkischer Volksm\u00e4rchen (\"Turkish Folktale Catalogue\"), by Wolfram Eberhard and Pertev Naili Boratav, both scholars listed the variants with the horse husband under one type: TTV 98, \"Der Pferdemann\" (\"The Horse Man\"), which corresponded in the international classification to tale type AaTh 425. In a later book, Boratav stated that the Catalogue registered 25 variants, but six more had been collected since its publication.\nIn his monograph about Cupid and Psyche, Jan-\u00d6jvind Swahn\u00a0 acknowledged that Turkish type 98 was subtype 425A of his analysis, that is, \"Cupid and Psyche\", being the \"oldest\" and containing the episode of the witch's tasks. In the international index, however, Swahn's typing is indexed as type ATU 425B, \"The Son of the Witch\".\nMotifs\nThe supernatural husband\nIn most of the variants collected, the supernatural husband is a horse, followed by a man with a donkey's head and a camel. In other tales, he may be a snake, a frog or even Turkish hero Kaloghlan.\nThe heroine's tasks\nAnother motif that appears in the tale type is that the heroine must travel to another witch's house and fetch from there a box or casket she must not open. German folklorist Hans-J\u00f6rg Uther remarked that these motives (\"the quest for the casket\" and the visit to the second witch) are \"the essential feature\" of the subtype.\nThe heroes' Magic Flight\nAccording to Christine Goldberg, some variants of the type show as a closing episode \"The Magic Flight\" sequence, a combination that appears \"sporadically in Europe\", but \"traditionally in Turkey\". As their final transformation to deceive the ogress mother, the princess becomes a tree and her supernatural husband becomes a snake coiled around it. Although this episode is more characteristic of tale type ATU 313, ",
    "\nMusical artist\nRio (pronounced as Ri\u00f3 and not popularly as R\u00edo; stylized as RIO) is a new wave band formed in Pueblo Libre, Lima, Per\u00fa in the 1980s and has almost 40 years of uninterrupted career. It is composed of Pocho Prieto (vocals and guitars), Cucho Galarza (bass), Chachi Galarza (guitar), the historical members, also Fred Aching (drums) and Juan Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez (keyboards).\nHistory\nThe band was formed in early 1984 in the district of Pueblo Libre, Lima. Founders Arturo \"Pocho\" Prieto and brothers Jos\u00e9 \"Chachi\" and Lucio \"Cucho\" Galarza named the group Royal International Orchest. In this early stage, the group covered English songs.\nIn 1984, they began to write their own songs in Spanish and released Son Colegialas through the record label El Virrey. Their first release was not very successful due to problems with the publishing house. Nevertheless, they opened doors in the Cono Norte, where they began to give concerts. The following year, the group released \"Televidente\", recorded at El\u00edas Ponce's studio, not at \"El Virrey,\" and added Coco Tafur on keyboards. With this song, Rio's popularity grew to the point that they were hired for various gigs in Lima and even in the provinces.\nAfter many tours, they released their third single, \"La Universidad (cosa de locos).\" The promotion of the band was greatly helped by the edition of videos that circulated in some musical programs at that time. In 1986, the group released their first album titled Lo peor de todo, presented at concerts in countries like Chile (including the show S\u00e1bado Gigante), Mexico, and Bolivia.\nIn 1988, they released their second album D\u00f3nde vamos a parar (1988), with songs like \"Todo Estaba Bien,\" \"Lo Empiezo a Odiar,\" and \"Cont\u00e9stame.\" This LP took Rio on tour across many countries in Latin America.\nTheir third production, Revoluci\u00f3n, recorded and mixed in Santiago, Chile in November and December 1989 and released in January 1990 only in cassette format, did not achieve the success of its predecessors and went almost unnoticed. This album included songs like \"Pierdo la Raz\u00f3n\" and \"M\u00f3nica.\"\nA couple of years later, in 1992, Rio released their fourth album: Strip Tease, released in Chile and Bolivia. This album included songs like \"Al Norte de Am\u00e9rica\" or \"Tienes que Pagarme M\u00e1s,\" along with \"Dulce y amargo\" and \"Tarar\u00e1,\" which were promoted during the first half of 1989 but were not included in their previous album.\nTwo years later, they released their fifth album: Rock and Qu\u00e9?, featuring songs like \"Carol Quiere un Viaje a Londres\" or \"No Me cabe Duda.\"\nRio's subsequent albums were Relax (1996), D\u00eda de pesca (1997), and La cr\u00eda in 1999. After this album, Rio took a break before releasing what would be their ninth album, Boomerang (2003), featuring songs like \"Bella Luna,\" \"Traicionera,\" and \"Morir\u00eda por Ti.\".\nRio Today\nIn 2004, they performed for the Peruvian community in Spain, in 2006 in New Jersey, and in 2007 in Los Angeles. Since then, they have continuously toured the United States and Europe.\nIn 2005, the group recorded the version \"Por tu amor\" by vernacular singer Sonia Morales, who also performed. That year, their album 20 a\u00f1os was released, featuring the band's successes from 1986 to 2006.\nDiscography\nAlbums\nLo peor de todo (1986)\nD\u00f3nde vamos a parar (1988)\nRevoluci\u00f3n (1990)\nStrip Tease (1992)\nRock and Qu\u00e9?

    "In this Chinese name, the family name is  Tong.\nTong Guowei (died 1719) was a Qing dynasty official. He was a maternal uncle of Kangxi Emperor.\nLife\nTong Guowei was the second (or the third) son of Tulai. According to the Comprehensive history of Eight Banners (\u6b3d\u5b9a\u516b\u65d7\u901a\u5fd7), The Tong (\u4f5f) family from Fushun was a sinicized Jurchen clan, they were incorporated into the Han Chinese Plain Blue Banner. However, Pamela Kyle Crossley stated that they were actually Han Chinese and falsely claimed to be related to the Manchu Tunggiya (\u4f5f\u4f73) clan of Jilin, using this false claim to get themselves transferred to a Manchu banner in the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. The Tong family was the most powerful family during the Kangxi period, thus got the nickname \"Tong Ban Chao\" (\u4f5f\u534a\u671d), which meant \"the Tong who fill up half the Court\".\nIn 1674, after the Revolt of the Three Feudatories had begun, Wu Yingxiong, the eldest son of Wu Sangui, plotted a riot in Beijing. Hearing of the plan, Tong Guowei quickly arrested the ringleaders with the aid of thirty guards. He was appointed the commander of the imperial bodyguard (\u9818\u4f8d\u885b\u5167\u5927\u81e3) and Deliberative Ministers in 1682. In 1689 he was granted the hereditary rank First class Duke (\u4e00\u7b49\u516c). He fought against Dzungars in the Battle of Ulan Butung, in which his brother Tong Guogang was killed in action. Tong Guowei was held responsible for not taking advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy during the battle, and was dismissed from his post as Deliberative Ministers. He accompanied Kangxi on both of the latter's expeditions against Galdan in 1696 and in 1697.\nTong Guowei died in 1719. He was given the posthumous name Duanchun (\u7aef\u7d14) and awarded posthumous appointment of Grand Tutor (\u592a\u5085) by Yongzheng Emperor in 1723.\nTong Guogang and Tong Guowei were said to believe in Christianity, though their political lives prohibited their formal conversions.

    "\nThe Greenland national futsal team is controlled by the Football Association of Greenland, the governing body for futsal in Greenland, and represents the country in international futsal competitions. It is not a member of FIFA or UEFA and can, therefore, not compete in official competitions of those governing bodies. The nation competes in open competitions such as the Nordic Futsal Cup and Futsal Week.\nHistory\nThe Football Association of Greenland assembled its-first ever national futsal team in November 2013 for two friendlies against the Faroe Islands in Nuuk. It was also the first time the Faroe Islands fielded an official futsal side. Frederik Funch scored his nation's first goal in the first match for the first-ever official goal in team history. Greenland went on to win both matches.\nGreenland participated in the Nordic Futsal Cup for the first time in the 2016 edition of the tournament. The association saw this as a major step toward UEFA and FIFA membership. After years of unsuccessful attempts to joing the European confederation, the KAK submitted its application to become a member of CONCACAF, the confederation governing North America, Central America, and the Caribbean, in May 2024. When accepted, Greenland would be eligible to participate in the confederation's competitions, including the CONCACAF Futsal Championship.\nFixtures and results\nMain article: Greenland national futsal team results\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\u00a0\u00a0Win\n\u00a0\u00a0Draw\n\u00a0\u00a0Loss\n\u00a0\u00a0Fixture\n2023\nDenmark\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nNorway\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nEstonia\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nEstonia\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\n2024\nSwitzerland\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nMalta\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nSan Marino\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nEstonia\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nLatvia\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nMontenegro\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nSlovenia\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nTurkey\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nCurrent squad\nThe team plays its home matches at the Inussivik in Nuuk, Greenland\u2019s capital\nThe following players were called up for the 2023 Baltic-Nordic Futsal Cup.\nKarls Louis Sandgreen\nNiklas T.

According to Christian hagiographic accounts, she was deported along with thousands of other Christians by Shapur I. After strengthening her fellow believers in the face of persecution and converting Persian women, she was reportedly tortured in various ways, imprisoned multiple times, and eventually executed by beheading. She is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, which commemorates her on August 4th. However, some modern Orthodox hagiographers believe she might actually be a fictional character.\nShe should not be confused with the martyr Eudokia of Heliopolis.\nBiography\nHagiographic accounts\nKnown exclusively through Christian hagiographic accounts, which begin with her capture by the Persians, she is believed to have originated from Asia Minor or Anatolia. After being captured along with a relatively large number of Christians, up to 9,000, during a military campaign by Shapur I, Eudokia was reportedly deported to Persia and placed in the service of a Persian officer's family. Through her Christian actions, she managed to soften her captors before converting them. She then became involved in providing moral support to other deported Christians and in converting many Persian women. These activities attracted the wrath of the Persian authorities, who flogged her before imprisoning her for two months. After these two months, she reportedly appeared again before the Persian officials and refused once more to renounce Christianity, leading to her being beaten with thorny rods before being sent back to prison for six months. Upon her release, the episode allegedly repeated itself; this time, she would have been bound in thorns pressed against her naked body, tearing away strips of flesh, and then tied to a gibbet with ropes used to break her bones. Finally, the saint was beheaded by her executioners.\nLegacy\nHer memory is celebrated on August 4 by the Eastern Orthodox Church; however, some modern Eastern Orthodox hagiographers express doubts about her existence. They believe she might possibly be confused with Eudokia of Heliopolis.\n",
    "Entrepreneur and former Indian modelDino Martelli, previously known as Deepak Malhotra (born 1964), is a former Indian model and actor, who now runs an apparel company.\nEarly life\nDeepak lived in Bangalore, where he studied in Christ University from 1982 to 1985.\nHe was a member of Bangalore Club, and was also a national-level gymnast.\nCareer\nModelling\nOne of the earliest finds of Design and Print Group, Malhotra began his career modelling for a menswear line in Bangalore, and soon became one of the most sought after models during the late 1980s and the early 1990s.\nHe was the face of Vimal, a major textile brand of Reliance Industries, for many years; and reportedly had a contract of \u20b91.5 Lakhs in 1987, which was unprecedented at that time. He gained further popularity with his TV advertisement for Aramusk, a soap that was promoted as being for the \"extravagantly male\".\nActing\nDeepak Malhotra and Sridevi in the poster of Lamhe (1991)\nAfter his success as a model, he started getting movie offers, and moved to Mumbai. In 1991, he made his film debut with Yash Chopra's Lamhe, starring alongside Sridevi and Anil Kapoor. He was first cast in Chamatkar (1992), but gave it up to act in Lamhe, and the role went to Shah Rukh Khan. However, Lamhe didn't do very well, and his acting was panned.\nYash Chopra was planning to make Darr (1993) with Deepak Malhotra and Raveena Tandon, with Saahil Chadha as the antagonist. But because of the performance of Lamhe, Chopra decided to cast more established actors; hence ultimately Sunny Deol and Shah Rukh Khan were cast in the roles Malhotra and Chadha were supposed to play, respectively. Raveena also opted out of the project, and her role went to Juhi Chawla.\nBefore Malhotra's first acting gig in Lamhe, Gautam Rajadhyaksha had suggested his name to Rahul Rawail for the lead role in Rawail's next movie. Rawail made Bekhudi (1992) after that, but the role eventually went to another debutant Kamal Sadanah.\nIn 1992, Malhotra was signed by N. Chandra for Tejasvini (1994), which was the Hindi remake of the Telugu film Karthavyam (1990), and had Vijayashanti reprising her role as the protagonist. However, in 1993 before the movie was even released, Malhotra decided to quit acting and leave India and move to the United States where he had been offered modelling contracts.\nEntrepreneurship\nMalhotra moved to New York City and changed his name to Dino Martelli. There he studied industrial engineering and designing, and started working in the field of apparels. He is currently the principal at NYC Made Apparel, which he co-founded in 2018.\nIn 2003, he opened Caf\u00e9 Sesso in The Courtyard in Colaba, Mumbai with his friend and business partner Sabina Chopra, co-founder of Yatra.com. It shut down over a year later, and they took up the management of the restaurant at Breach Candy's Moksh gym and leisure club, naming it Spring.\nPersonal life\nIn 1998, Dino married model-turned-fashion choreographer Lubna Adam, who had opened India's first fashion model training school Catwalk in Bombay in 1990. They were in a relationship for 11 years before their marriage, and after getting married moved to New York where they lived in Upper West Side.\nThey have two sons\u2013 Kian Martelli, who was a decorated athlete in Riverhead High School, and is a designated partner in Lubna Adams Luxury Lifestyle Llp; and Kyle Martelli, salutatorian of Riverhead High's graduating Class of 2021, who is currently a student at Boston University Questrom School of Business.

    "1989 painting by Robert Lentz\nApache Christ is a painting depicting Jesus as a Mescalero holy man. Created in 1989 by Franciscan friar Robert Lentz, the eight-foot icon is displayed in the altar of the St. Joseph Apache Mission Church, a Catholic church with parishioners who are mostly Mescalero Apache. In the painting, Jesus is depicted atop Sierra Blanca, greeting the rising sun after performing a sacred puberty ritual.\nLentz, who is known for his iconography depicting Jesus in different cultural contexts, painted Apache Christ in 1989 following a conversation with the church's pastor. He met with Mescalero Apache leaders and consulted with Apache medicine men for cultural guidance. In preparation for the artwork, he studied Apache rituals and gathered sacred spring water from the summit of Sierra Blanca to use in the mixing of his paints.\nIn 2024, a priest from St. Joseph removed Apache Christ and other sacred Mescalero art objects from display due to his view that they were pagan imagery. The removal outraged many of the church's parishioners. The painting was soon reinstalled and the priest was replaced.\nBackground\nThe St. Joseph Apache Mission Church was built in Mescalero, New Mexico, in the early 20th century on the site of a prehistoric ruin of the Jornada Mogollon culture. Located within the Mescalero Apache Reservation, the church administers to the Chiricahua and Mescalero Apache people. During the construction of the church in 1920, traditional and sacred Apache spiritual items were placed beneath the cornerstone. Albert Braun, a Roman Catholic priest who helped to construct the church, respected the traditions of the Mescalero Apache ministry and did not interfere with their culture.\nArtist Robert Lentz studied icon painting under Photis Kontoglou around 1977 at the Holy Transfiguration Monastery in Brookline, Massachusetts. He became a Franciscan friar and created icons depicting Jesus in different cultural contexts, not limiting his works to traditional \"European face\" characteristics.\nConception and execution\nThe altar of the St. Joseph Apache Mission Church in 1975, before the creation of the painting\nIn 1989, Lentz travelled to Mescalero, New Mexico, to visit St. Joseph. He discussed the possibility of creating a painting for the church with Father Larry Gosselin, a fellow Franciscan who was the church's pastor at the time. Gosselin asked for approval from 15 Mescalero Apache leaders and arranged for Lentz to meet with Apache medicine men for cultural guidance. Initially the medicine men did not approve of the project, but later acquiesced, recommending that Lentz not use anyone from Mescalero as a model for the work.\nIn preparation for creating the painting, Lentz familiarized himself with Apache rituals and made a pilgrimage to the summit of Sierra Blanca where he gathered water from the sacred springs to use for mixing his paint. According to Gosselin, Lentz \"poured all of himself into that painting\", sprinkling himself with gold dust and forgoing showering so his body oils would help to adhere the gold onto the canvas. He took three months to finish the painting. According to Lentz, the intention of the painting is to show \"that people could be Apache and Catholic, and both completely\".\nLentz gave Apache Christ to the Mescalero people. When he brought the finished painting to show to Father Gosselin, a nun named Juanita was conversing with some visiting women. As the painting was unveiled, there was a three-minute silence. Sister Juanita later said that they had been in silent awe. Apache Christ was installed on the wall behind the stone chapel's altar in 1990. It received a blessing from Father Gosselin during mass. The mass was paused midway through to allow the painting to receive a traditional blessing with cattail pollen from Mescalero medicine men.\nDescription\nInterior of the St. Joseph Apache Mission Church\nApache Christ serves as the centerpiece of the St. Joseph Apache Mission Church, representing a blending of Christian rites and sacred Apache ceremonies. The icon painting depicts Jesus as a Mescalero Apache medicine man standing on the summit of Sierra Blanca at dawn. In the 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) tall painting, he is dressed traditionally, wearing moccasins, a breech cloth, and a warrior shirt. His left hand is raised, the outward-facing palm bearing a sun symbol, while his left hand holds a deer hoof rattle.

    "Preparatory body of the Council of the European Union\nA Council working party or working party is a preparatory body of the Council of the European Union. The more than 150\u00a0working parties are tasked with the first examination of legislative proposals by the European Commission and play a role during the trilogue meetings at the end of the legislative procedure of the European Union.\nWorking parties are made up of civil servants of the Member States, the European Commission and the General Secretariat of the Council and chaired by the Member State, which currently holds the rotating Council presidency.\nScholars argue that working parties informally make the majority of Council decisions.\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis for Council working parties is Article\u00a019(3) of the Council's Rules of Procedure. According to this rule, \"working parties may be set up by, or with the approval of, Coreper with a view to carrying out certain preparatory work or studies defined in advance\". Coreper, the Committee of Permanent Representatives, thus creates or approves every Council working party.\nFunction\nFirst examination of Commission proposals\nIn the legislative procedure of the European Union, the European Commission has \u2013\u00a0with some rare exceptions\u00a0\u2013 the sole right to propose new European legislation. If the European Commission proposes new legislation, this proposal (also called \"dossier\") is submitted to a Council working party for a first examination. The current Council presidency decides, which working party is to be tasked with the examination of the proposal.\nIn a Council working party, every Member State is represented by its civil servants, which come either from their ministries or their permanent representations. The members of the working party examine the commission's proposal and analyse whether the proposal is compatible with the legal system of the respective Member State and whether its policies are acceptable for their national government. For this work they receive instructions by their government. During the sessions of the working party, it is the task of the civil servants of the European Commission to explain and defend their proposal.\nThe examination of a Commission proposal ends, if the Council presidency \u2013\u00a0which rotates every six months between the Member States\u00a0\u2013 concludes that there is enough support for the adoption of a common position of the Council on the dossier, called the general approach. However, no voting takes place in a working party.\nThe Council presidency then submits the position of the working party on the dossier to Coreper for a vote. In Coreper, the Member States are represented by their permanent representatives, thus at ambassadorial level. If the vote is successful, the file goes to the Council of the European Union \u2013\u00a0which is convened at ministerial level\u00a0\u2013 for a further final vote on the general approach.\nDuring trilogue\nCouncil working parties also play a role during trilogues. Trilogues are inter-institutional negotiations in the European legislative process between the European Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission. During these negotiations a compromise between the positions of the three European institutions has to be found.\nThe Council presidency negotiates for the Council during the trilogue meetings. The presidency is often represented by an ambassador or the chair of the respective working party. The presidency has to report back to the Member States to update them on the progress of the negotiations. This is often done by informing the Council working party orally and sharing an updated \"four-column document\" with it, a document which has the Commission proposal in its first, the European Parliament's position in its second, the Council's general approach in its third and finally the current compromise position in its fourth column. During the working party sessions, the Members States can give feedback and guidance to the presidency on their opinions concerning the various compromise positions. This is of high importance because the compromise position adopted during trilogue needs, inter alia, to be formally approved by Coreper and the Council (at ministerial level), so enough support for it is essential.\nNumber of Council working parties and meeting schedule\nThe General Secretariat of the Council is tasked with providing a public list of the preparatory bodies of the Council and only the working parties on this list may meet as Council preparatory bodies. More than 150\u00a0working parties exist.\nThe meeting schedule varies to a large degree between the different working parties. Some meet every week, others only every six months.\nImportance in the Council's decision making process\nThe importance of the decision making of working parties has been rated highly. The scholar H\u00e4ge has argued that while \"working parties only 'prepare' the ministers' work,  de facto, they make the majority of Council decisions\". This position is justified with the observatio",

He is known from the Sayings of the Desert Fathers, as well as a collection of 160 sayings known as the Exhortation to the Monks (Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u0391\u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd, romanized:\u00a0Para\u00ednesis Ask\u0113t\u020fn).\nName\nThe name Hyper\u00e9chios is derived from the Greek hyper\u00e9chein , meaning, \u2018to be above,\u2019 \u2018to rise over,\u2019 or \u2018to transcend.\u2019\nLife\nVery little is known about Hyperechios. Based on his writings, Vivian (2024) deduces that he was from an upper-middle class Greek-speaking family and lived close to an urban setting.

    "August 2024 bombing of a school in an Israeli attack\nOn 4 August 2024, the Israel Defense Forces bombed Hamama School in the Gaza neighborhood of Sheikh Radwan. The school had been sheltering people displaced by the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, including women and children. Per Gaza's Civil Defense, 17 people were killed and \"many others\" were wounded, while the school itself was \"completely destroyed\". The attack was one of a number of attacks on schools during the Israeli invasion of Gaza. The Israeli army stated that the school was being used by Hamas. Hamas criticized this claim as a false pretext \"for targeting defenseless civilians\". The Palestinian Resistance Movement called the attack a continuation of Israel's \"brutal war of extermination\" in Gaza.\nBackground\nOn 6 July, UNRWA-ran al-Jawni school sheltering 2,000 refugees at the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza was targeted by an IDF raid which killed sixteen Palestinians. On 7 July, the IDF targeted the Latin Patriarchate-owned Holy Family school located in Gaza City housing hundreds of refugees, killing four. On 8 July, IDF force struck a different Nuseirat UNRWA-run school in, causing several injuries requiring treatment in a local hospital.

    "Waterloo Co-operative Residence Inc. (WCRI) is a non-profit student housing cooperative located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It is owned by its residents, also known as members, who attend the University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University, and Conestoga College. The co-op is governed by the Rochdale Principles.\nWCRI is significant in the history of the North American co-operative movement as it would expand to become, for a duration, the largest student housing cooperative on the continent. Today, the co-op can accommodate over 1300 residents in its dormitories and apartments, currently making it the second-largest organization of its kind in North America.\nWCRI was a founding member of the Ontario Student Co-operative Association and the North American Students of Cooperation.\nHistory\nWCRI was founded in July 1964 as the Waterloo division of Toronto's Campus Co-operative Residence Inc (CCRI).  Initially, two separate houses on University Avenue in Waterloo accommodated twenty-seven male and nine female students, though meals were taken together at the men's house. One cook was hired, but all other work was done by the members.  WCRI also added a house at 59 Albert Street.\nInitially, the adjacent University of Waterloo was not in favour of the co-operative. Wilfrid Laurier University held a similar view, refusing to host posters advertising its existence. However, the success of the Waterloo model would help to inspire a wave of Canadian student co-ops, funded under the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation\u2019s student housing program (then named the \"Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation).\nIndependence from CCRI was soon deemed desirable and the process of splitting off into a separate co-op was undertaken. Letters patent for the incorporation of WCRI were issued on November 8, 1965.\nBy September 1966, more than 200 students lived in various WCRI accommodations. In addition to owning several houses, the co-op had built a four-storey dormitory called Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Residence, the first such building in North America to be built, owned, and operated by students. At this point, full-time staff were beginning to be hired to handle various administrative matters.  The three floors of \"Hammar\" were named after the Freedom Summer murder victims, Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner.\nDespite some debt, plans were drawn up to build four more three-storey buildings on 2.5 acres of land that WCRI acquired at 280 Phillip Street. A $2.5 million mortgage was secured, and construction began early in 1968.\nIn 1993, WCRI owned 12 buildings and had assets of more than $15 million.  At that time it was one of three Ontario student housing co-ops that offered to lend money to The Triangle Housing Co-op, which was started in 1990 by students from Concordia and McGill universities, the Universite du Quebec a Montreal, and the Quebec Public Interest Research Group. The WCRI loan was contingent upon the Quebec students also securing a mortgage from a local caisse populaire, and a mortgate guaranteed from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.   \nIn 2003, the City of Waterloo reclassified the WCRI lands at 280 Phillip Street as Residential (from Industrial).\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, WCRI rented the 105-bed Dag Hammarskjold residence to the Region of Waterloo as short-term accommodations for people experiencing homelessness. The site was funded by the region and allowed people to keep physically distant from others while also offering food, harm reduction supplies and support to find permanent housing.\n",

Its inventory contains over 10,000 unique items. The La Luz de Jesus art gallery is located upstairs.\nHistory\nThe store opened on June 19, 1971, as Soap Plant. It was originally a family-run shop, with each member producing certain products. Peter and Billy Shire created ceramic items and leatherware, while their father, Hank, made graphics and their mother, Barbara produced soaps. Billy's flamboyant leather creations attracted clients such as Elton John and the New York Dolls. One of his denim jackets won a design competition that was sponsored by Levi Strauss & Co. in 1973, further increasing his popularity. It was later shown in an exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In the early 1980s, Billy assumed sole control of the shop and moved it to a larger location at Melrose Avenue. With more space, he included more varieties of items in the store, including books and jewelry. Billy opened Wacko in 1984 after some adjacent stores became vacant.

    "Large infrastructure developments in Brunei\nNot to be confused with National Development Plan.\nThe National Development Plan (NDP) or natively known as Rancangan Kemajuan Negara (RKN), is the name assigned by the government of Brunei to a plan designed to carry out Wawasan Brunei 2035 and diversify the economy by putting projects, programs, and initiatives into action. The RKN and planning were carried out under the direction of the Department of Economic Planning and Statistics (DEPS).\nIn 17 National Housing Scheme (RPN) zones covering a total area of 794 hectares (1,960 acres), 30,296 homes were built under the Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme (STKRJ) and the Land Scheme since the scheme's introduction in 1984. Under the two housing schemes, it has used land lots comprising 5,525 hectares (13,650 acres) hectares across four districts have been awarded since the program's inception in 1984. This information was disclosed on 9 February 2023. The program is administered and maintained nationally by the Housing Development Department (JKP).\nBackground\nIn the 16th century the Brunei empire was a prosperous and well-managed maritime power. But by the late 19th century, internal conflicts and abuses by foreign and local actors led to its decline, with Brunei approaching collapse by 1904. Widespread corruption, abuses of power, and a poorly planned system contributed to its deterioration, demonstrating how inadequate preparation and unclear future planning can severely undermine a state's stability.\nDuring the British Residence period (1906\u20131959), Brunei experienced significant administrative and economic changes. With a population of around 20,000 between 1906 and 1941, it wasn't until the 1960s that Brunei's demographic size began to approach the approximately 25,000 people from the mid-1850s. The first British resident, Malcolm McArthur, played a crucial role in stabilising the country's governance and geographical order by implementing key reforms. He established police stations, civil and criminal courts, mail services, customs offices, and wharves. These foundational developments set the stage for Brunei's economic recovery and growth, even before the commercial exploitation of its oil resources. Subsequent British Residents observed rapid trade growth and the country's transition towards true prosperity following years of decline.Brunei Town being attacked by a RAAF Bristol Beaufighter in 1945The discovery and commercialisation of oil marked the beginning of a transformative period for Brunei. Among the top oil producing nations in the world by the 1930s was Brunei, particularly inside the British Commonwealth. Due to its economic growth, Brunei was able to shift from \"rags to riches.\" But this progress was halted due to World War II. The Japanese occupation and subsequent Allied bombing strikes completely devastated Brunei. Seria's oil wells were set on fire, and Brunei Town was severely damaged, with just a Chinese temple still standing. With the sultanate in ashes, the war's devastation halted Brunei's economic growth.\nFollowing the Second World War the government gave food distribution and the restoration of basic necessities first priority. Reconstruction of about 200 business houses and new government offices handled much of the war damage by early 1953 as rehabilitation activities got underway swiftly. During Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III's reign, Brunei saw substantial advancements in its political system and infrastructure. His assistance was essential in bringing Brunei from under British protectorate to full independence. The 1959 Constitution of Brunei, which abolished the British Resident's power and installed a British High Commissioner in its place, was one of his greatest accomplishments. By doing this, the Sultan was given his internal sovereignty back and became the ultimate executive head of government. The five-year national development plans were introduced by the Sultan to support Brunei's post-war reconstruction and modernisation.\nRKN in the 20th century\nRKN 1 (1953\u20131958)\nBrunei Town in the 1950sThe newly built Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque in 1958Secretariat Building in 1954\nInitiated in 1953 and spanning from 1953 to 1958, the first national development plan (RKN 1) played a crucial role in the transformation of Brunei. Prior to its establishment, Brunei was seen as a less developed and economically deprived country. The strategy signaled a paradigm change that helped Brunei become a nation with high GDP per person and a high standard of living. A \"bloodless revolution\" was how observers characterised the advancement because of the extent of the improvements made, which was especially remarkable considering Brunei's tiny population at the time. the nation's first 5-Year Development Plan was started when the State Council authorised $100\u00a0million for the five-year term, because of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin III's leadership. The principal objectives were to improve living co",

    "Genus of planthoppers\nDiostrombus is a large genus of planthoppers from the family Derbidae, tribe Zoraidini, with more than 40 species. The large majority of species have been described from Africa and the Near East. However, a few species, including the type species, are found in southern and eastern parts of Asia. In Africa, the distribution range of Diostrombus species extends from the humid tropics of western Africa to many parts of eastern Africa, as far north as parts of Sudan and as far south as South Africa. Three species have been described from Yemen and the Iran. Like other species of the tribe Zoraidini, species of Diostrombus have long and narrow forewings and short hind wings. The main characteristic of Diostrombus is the forewing venation with the media vein having 6 branches which do not split further into sub branches. The hind wings are much shorter than half the forewing length and have a pointed tip. In profile the head is usually flat, but in some African species, the ridges on the sides of the face are extended in front of the antennae. The face is narrow. The antennae are short compared to other genera of the tribe Zoraidini, about half as long as the face.\nType species: Diostrombus politus Uhler, 1896\nDistribution\nDistribution ranges of the species in the genus Diostrombus (blue outline) and that of Diostrombus politus, the type species (brown outline)\nMore than 80% of the species described in the genus Diostrombus are found in Africa, and the majority of these have been reported from the humid tropics of western Africa, from Guinea and Sierra Leone in the North to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the South. In eastern Africa the distribution of Diostrombus species ranges from parts of Sudan and Ethiopia in the North to parts of South Africa in the South. One species has been also described from Yemen (Diostrombus nike) and two from Iran (D. adila and D. jezeki). Further east in Asia, three more Diostrombus species are found, Diostrombus carnosa, D. pennatus and the type species, D. politus. The distribution of these eastern species ranges from eastern parts of India in the West, over Myanmar, parts of China, Taiwan, South Korea to southern parts of Japan in the East. It also includes parts of Indonesia in the South.\nDescription\nDiostrombus politus - Left: head in frontal and side view - Right: shape and venation of forewing (top) and hind wing (bottom), with the media and the first media branch marked. The hind wing has a pointed tip.\nLeft: Profile of Diostrombus atricollis - Right: Forewing and hind wing of Diostrombus hopkinsi\nSpecies of Diostrombus can be recognized by the venation of the forewings and the pointed tips of the hind wings. The media of the forewing has six branches, with none of them branching further into sub branches. The radius has 2 short sub branches near its tip and compared to other Zoraidini, there are 2 long and rather broad cells between the radius and the media. The hind wings are much shorter than half the forewing length and have a distinctive shape with a pointed tip near the frontal (costal) margin.\nThe face (frons) of Diostrombus species is narrow with the ridges on its sides running approximately parallel to each other. In side view, the head typically has a flat profile. However, in some African species like in Diostrombus atricollis, the ridges on the side of the face are extended in front of the antennae. Compared to other genera of Zoraidini, the antennae are short and cylindrical, only about half as long as the face. The terminal arista (bristle) is inserted below the tip of the antennae.\nDiostrombus politus from Japan\nMany Diostrombus species are coloured orange, red or yellow like the type species which is almost completely orange-red (see the illustration on the right). Other species are only partly orange or yellow and often also have parts which are black or dark brown. A few species are predominantly black. The forewings usually have a length of 7 to 9\u00a0 mm and the length of the body, from head to the tip of the abdomen, is around 4 or 5\u00a0mm. Like in other planthoppers of the tribe Zoraidini, the wings are raised and spread out when the insects are at rest.\nBiology\nThere is no information on the biology of the nymphal stages of Diostrombus species. However, it can be assumed that they live in decaying organic matter like other derbids, feeding on fungi. The adults prefer to feed on monocots like palm trees, maize or rice, like other members of the tribe Zoraidini. Some Asian species can be common enough to be listed occasionally as minor pests.\nDiostrombus species may be also vectors of plant diseases. In Mozambique, Diostrombus mkurangai was found to be one of the most common sap-sucking insects on coconut palms affected by the lethal yellowing disease and the causal phytoplasma agent was present in this species. In Ghana, a similar disease called Cape Saint Paul Wilt also affects coconut palms and Diostrombus species were again c",

    "Neova (formerly Vapo Oy) is the major peat producer in Finland. In 1984, Vapo was 100% owned by Finnish state. From 2002 to 2005, the Finnforest part of Mets\u00e4 Group owned 33% of Vapo. This share was expanded to and 49.9% between 2005 and 2009. In 2009 ownership of Vapo was reconstructed to Suomen Energiavarat Oy, owned by EPV Energy (previously Etel\u00e4-Pohjanmaan Voima Oy) and several peat energy using companies. In June 2009 Mets\u00e4liitto (Finnforest) sold its share to Suomen Energiavarat Oy. In 2012 those responsible include several municipal energy companies e.g. Helsinki, Vantaa, Oulu, Rauma, Sein\u00e4joki, Vaasa and Lahti.\nIn 2010, Vapo came under media attention after it made an official complaint about one of the officials handling some of its more than 100 applications to new peat collection areas. The official, environmental counsellor Antti Ylitalo, had written public appeals to protect endangered natural bogs (moss, moor). Vapo made a disqualification appeal against Ylitalo claiming that his statements formed a conflict of interests in the official evaluations of Vapo's applications. Ylitalo felt that the disqualification appeal by Vapo infringed his freedom of speech.\nAccording to VTT, in 2005 the major producers in Finland were Vapo Oy (78%) and Turveruukki Oy (10%) followed by Fortum Power and Heat, Kuopion Energia, Alholmens Kraft and Vaskiluodon Voima.\nSuo Oy, a subsidiary of Vapo, cultivates reed canary grass in areas no longer used to produce peat. In 2010, it owned 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres) of agricultural land and received \u20ac673 000 in agricultural subsidies, the fifth largest agricultural subsidy in Finland at the time. In 2012, it was reported that Suo Oy had received in total some \u20ac10 million public financing over ten years for the reed canary grass cultivation. The reed, however, was viewed as a \"flop\", as it reportedly clogged equipment and remained at best equivalently priced to other products. As a result, most producers had quit.\n",

    "Road in Kenya\nThe A12 road is a road in Kenya spanning a distance of 228 kilometers. It traverses the western region of the country, forming a crucial east\u2013west route. The A12 originates at the Ugandan border in Busia and extends westward, passing through the city of Kisumu before terminating at Mau Summit. This transportation artery connects key urban centers and facilitates movement across the region, playing a role in Kenya's infrastructure network.\nRoute\nThe A12 trunk road commences at the border crossing with Uganda in Busia, marking the beginning of its eastward trajectory. As it traverses the hills and densely populated areas northeast of Lake Victoria, the A12 maintains a continuous paved surface. The road passes through the city of Kisumu, where it shares a dual designation with the A1 and features a semi-grade-separated bypass. At Ahero, the A1 diverges, and the A12 enters the elevated highlands, ascending to notable altitudes: 2,000 meters in Kericho and over 2,500 meters at Mau Summit. The A12 ultimately terminates at a grade-separated junction with the A8, marking the end of its winding and scenic route through western Kenya.\nHistory\nThe town of Busia was once the primary border crossing between Kenya and Uganda, with construction on the Mackinnon-Sclater Road commencing as early as 1890. This road, designed for oxcart travel, connected Mombasa to the Busia border crossing. However, its significance waned with the construction of the Uganda Railway, leading to a shift in the main border crossing to Malaba, located slightly north. During the British colonial era, a network of roads was established, with the route via Kisumu being a notable one, although the more northerly route via Eldoret received greater attention. In recent years, significant upgrades have been made, particularly in Kisumu. A grade-separated bypass was constructed between 2013 and 2014, improving traffic flow. Additionally, a trumpet interchange connecting to the A8 was completed at Mau Summit in 2017, further enhancing the road network's efficiency.\nRoad number history\nThe road was initially designated as the A109, a prominent route within the East African numbering system that spanned three countries. However, it was later reclassified as the B1, indicating a lower hierarchical status. This reclassification occurred during a period when the A104 motorway to the north was considered the primary connection. In 2016, the road underwent another renumbering, this time being elevated to the A12 designation. This change reflects a reevaluation of the road's importance within the regional transportation network.\n",
    "Road in Kenya\nThe A5 road is a road in Kenya stretching 114 kilometers in a north\u2013south direction through the southern region of the country. Beginning in Emali, the route traverses the landscape before ultimately reaching the Tanzanian border at Loitokitok, providing a connection between the two nations.\nRoute\nThe A5 highway originates in Emali, a town perched at an elevation of 1,100 meters above sea level, approximately 100 kilometers southeast of Kenya's capital city, Nairobi. From Emali, where it intersects with the A8, the A5 embarks on a southerly journey, traversing the tropical savannah and offering vistas of Mount Kilimanjaro. This modern, paved road winds its way through several quaint towns, with Loitokitok being the most notable, before reaching the Tanzanian border. Here, a state-of-the-art border crossing facilitates seamless travel, and on the Tanzanian side, the T21 road continues along the slopes of Kilimanjaro, ultimately leading to the town of Himo.\nHistory\nThe A5 highway has undergone a transformation in its designation, previously known as the C102, which shared the same route from Emali to the Tanzanian border. In 2016, the road was reclassified as the A5, reflecting its significance in the regional transportation network. Given its crucial role in funneling tourists to the Kilimanjaro region, the road had likely been paved for many years. A major overhaul in 2011 further modernized the A5, enhancing its quality and safety. Notably, the connecting road in Tanzania, although paved later than the A5, has since completed the seamless journey for travelers crossing the border.\n",

The building features an exterior in a monumental style, typical of the Fascist architecture, while the interior is characterized by a closer alignment with the modern principles of Italian rationalism. It also houses sculptures by Napoleone Martinuzzi and Domenico Ponzi.\nLocation\nThe building is situated in the suburb of Porta Nuova, outside the city walls, and is bordered by Via Roma and Viale Giacomo Matteotti, overlooking Piazza Fratelli Rosselli, formerly Piazza Umberto I, and commonly known as Piazza della Vasca. It serves as a key visual landmark aligned with Via Fallaci, leading into the historic center. The square features significant architecture from different periods and styles: the neo-classical Palazzo del Governo; Ludovico Quaroni's modern multi-purpose building from the 1970s; the Villino Panichi with its Renaissance Revival and Art Nouveau-style elements; and the austere former Royal Normal School (now \"Giovanni Pascoli\" middle school).\nHistory\nAs part of Benito Mussolini's plan to tackle unemployment, Decree No. 10102 on 8 July 1930, authorized the construction of the Post and Telegraph Building in Grosseto, designed by architect Angiolo Mazzoni. Mazzoni selected a site in a circular square named after Umberto I, outside the city walls in the suburb of Porta Nuova. After initial design revisions, the final project was completed by June 1930. Expropriations began in April, and demolition of existing buildings, including the recently built Art Nouveau-style Palazzo Barth, started in September.\nThe masonry contract was awarded to Milan's Rusconi Carlo company in September 1930, with a significant discount on the estimated cost. The work, which began on 4 February 1931, and involved around 120 workers daily, was completed by 20 October 1932. Marble, travertine, and granite were supplied by Societ\u00e0 Marmifera Nord Carrara of Montecatini group. The building was inaugurated on 13 November 1932, in the presence of King Victor Emmanuel III. Additional completion works were approved in August 1939.\nPost-war modifications included raising the central body of the building in 1953 (completed in 1955), constructing a new single-story section for mail carriers in 1963, and expanding the public hall and director's apartment in 1975. A request was made in 1983 to raise the eastern wing on Via Roma.\nDescription\nThe building's rear on Via Roma\nExterior\nThe clock tower\nThe main portal with the Tamed Maremma group by Napoleone Martinuzzi\nThe building is a city landmark with a monumental and rhetorical style. It has a trapezoidal plan due to the plot's shape, leading to an unconventional layout along the bisector of the angle formed by the adjacent streets. The main section, facing Piazza Rosselli, is clad in Rapolano travertine and features entrance arches. This section is connected to two nearly symmetrical wings along Via Roma and Viale Matteotti, with central spaces linking them and overlooking a rear service courtyard.\nThe main facade, about 20 meters high, is divided into three parts, highlighted by a monumental portal with a lintel supported by Ionic columns and topped by the marble group of Maremma Domata (\"Tamed Maremma\") by Napoleone Martinuzzi. A prominent elliptical tower, containing the main staircase, serves as a visual and functional hinge between the wings. The tower's verticality is accentuated by a central window illuminating the staircase and directing attention to small clock openings below the windowed loggia at the top.\nThe facade's slight concavity follows the square's circular shape, balanced by a convex granite staircase leading to a paved plaza in Rapolano travertine. This plaza features a circular fountain with a Portasanta marble basin and a central diorite sphere. Smaller portals, framed by Portasanta marble fasces, lead to elegant rooms with high-quality materials, including yellow marble from Mori and green Alpi marble benches.\nOriginal glass and brass lights are found by the entrances to the public hall, which has wooden paneling with integrated neon lighting. The right-side room, missing a marble bench, features a bronze statue of Saint Christopher by Martinuzzi.\nThe long facades on Via Roma and Viale Matteotti, rising over three floors plus a mezzanine, have regular window sequences: larger and arched on the ground floor, square on the mezzanine, and rectangular above. These facades are brick-clad with travertine accents, including floor bands, frames, and corner elements. Above the entrance arches to the small rooms, two large tripartite windows with thermal lunettes illuminate the public hall. The facade on Via Roma includes a service entrance arch and a small cross-shaped space paved with blue ceramic tiles. The eastern end feature",
    "Fictional character from Our Girl\nFictional character\nCaptain James is a fictional character from the BBC military drama Our Girl, played by Ben Aldridge. Captain James first appeared in the first episode of the first series, originally broadcast on 21 September 2014. He is introduced as the laid-back but professional commanding officer of 2-Section. His storylines in the series have included the blossoming of his romance with Molly Dawes (Lacey Turner), his intense dedication to his work, his friendship with Elvis Harte (Luke Pasqualino), his inner struggles surrounding the morality of war, and his second romance with Georgie Lane (Michelle Keegan).\nCaptain James has been described as experienced and authoritarian, but fun and easygoing. Aldridge enjoyed the task of playing someone in charge. His character's toxic love of his work was an ongoing theme during his time on the series, as Aldridge noticed that his character was happy in his co-workers' company and could only function in the army. Aldridge was captivated by his character's continuing mental health struggles, as he found it to be a delicate matter within the armed forces. After the cast for the show's fourth series was announced, and Aldridge's absence was quickly noted, it was confirmed that he had left the role to pursue other projects he had commitments to. Captain James's relationship with Georgie was criticised by viewers, and his departure was seen as abrupt and underwhelming.\nStorylines\nCaptain James is introduced as the commanding officer of 2-Section on a tour in Camp Bastion in Afghanistan. He initially doubts the capabilities of the team's new medic, Molly Dawes (Lacey Turner), but learns to respect her after saving the life of fellow soldier Smurf (Iwan Rheon) in an act of bravery. Despite Captain James telling her not to, Molly befriends a local girl named Bashira (Becky Eggersglusz), who warns her not to let 2-Section go to a mountain checkpoint, proving to be vital information which impresses him. After Molly returns from her rest and recuperation leave, she confesses her love for him, feelings which he reciprocates, despite having an estranged wife, Rebecca (Alice Patten), and a son. Upon finding out about this, Molly is initially furious but forgives him. Captain James is injured in battle and narrowly survives. Once the tour finishes, he goes on a date with Molly in his hometown of Bath, England. He decides to maintain his relationship with her while remaining in the army after divorcing Rebecca.\nAfter marrying Molly, Captain James offers Lance Corporal Georgie Lane (Michelle Keegan), an experienced army medic, a place on a humanitarian mission in Kenya with 2-Section, which she accepts. After Georgie is taken hostage by a faction of the terrorist group Al-Shabaab, he requests help from the special forces. A unit arrives, and Captain James is shocked to see it being led by his old friend Elvis Harte (Luke Pasqualino), who is also Georgie's ex-fianc\u00e9 who abandoned her on their wedding day. After they rescue her, 2-Section is granted two days of rest before returning to Britain. When they get home, Captain James offers Georgie a spot on a mission in Syria in five weeks. Although Georgie is open to it, her fianc\u00e9 Jamie (Royce Pierreson) interferes and tells him not to let her do it to prioritise her mental health. After Georgie tells him she has decided to leave the army, Captain James supports her decision but asks her to reconsider it. He later warns Elvis not to intrude on Georgie's wedding to Jamie.\nAfter an earthquake in Nepal, 2-Section is deployed on a humanitarian mission there, and Captain James arranges for Georgie to mentor new recruit Maisie Richards (Shalom Brune-Franklin). He is annoyed with her behaviour, but after a successful mission manages to see past some of her flaws. When 2-Section is called to Kathmandu barracks, Captain James and Elvis are reacquainted and it transpires that 2-Section will assist special forces on a mission in Afghanistan, to Captain James's reluctance. He cheers up when he meets Captain Azizi again, who asks him to abort the mission out of fear of how the British Army's presence impacts Afghanistan's terrorism. After the mission fails and many are injured, Captain James figures out Captain Azizi was in on it and furiously confronts him before Azizi is accidentally shot by an insurgent. When they eventually retreat to Kabul, Captain James is proud of the team but faces inner struggles regarding the British Army's involvement in Afghanistan. He later witnesses Elvis's death and is crushed by it.\nAfter a tour in Nigeria, 2-Section prepares for a training exercise in Belize. Captain James has received a bad report on his record for being tricked by Captain Azizi, so hopes to prove himself. During the exercise, Captain James is caught in a booby trap which seriously injures his leg, leaving him unable to walk. With lethal drug bandits populating the jungle, Captain James, Georgie, and a local t",

    "New Zealand mathematician and geodesist (1913\u20131985)\n\"L. P. Lee\" redirects here. For the bioengineer, see Luke Pyungse Lee.\nLaurence Patrick \"Laurie\" Lee (1913 \u2013 28 January 1985) was a New Zealand mathematician, cartographer, and geodesist who was the Chief Computer for the Department of Lands and Survey and one of the foremost experts on (especially conformal) map projections.\nLife and career\nLee was born in England in 1913, but moved with his family to Auckland at a young age. After earning a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Auckland, he took a job in 1934 in the Department of Public Works in Whang\u0101rei, then transferred in 1936 to the Department of Lands and Survey in Aukland as a draughting cadet. Because of his mathematical talents, in 1941 he was sent to Wellington as a computer, where he remained until his retirement in 1974, serving as the Chief Computer for the department from 1964 to 1974. After retirement he continued consulting for the department.\nLee had a stammer since childhood. In 1950, after reading about research psychologist William Kerr of Jersey, who claimed to have discovered a cure, Lee took a leave of absence from the Department of Lands and Survey and worked as an engineer's steward in return for passage to England on the Trojan Star. After just 18 minutes of Kerr's instruction, Lee could state the date and time without stammering, and after staying with Kerr for two weeks he considered himself effectively cured, with only a slight occasional stammer remaining.\nLee was a lifelong bachelor.\nWork\nThe Lee conformal world in a tetrahedron can be computed using Dixon elliptic functions.\nAt the Department of Lands and Survey, Lee was involved with completing the First Order Geodetic Triangulation of New Zealand, and establishing the Geodetic Datum 1949; the change to metric units; and computations for the latitude and longitude program of the International Geophysical Year, 1957\u20131959.\nLee was a specialist in map projections \u2013 especially conformal projections, which preserve angles and local shapes \u2013 and wrote many papers on the subject. Notably, he developed improved methods for calculating the transverse Mercator projection; developed a conformal projection of the Pacific Ocean minimising scale errors; and computed new conformal polyhedral map projections using elliptic functions, building on the work of Oscar S. Adams. His 1976 monograph Conformal Projections Based on Elliptic Functions is still a definitive survey. His 1944 proposal for classifying map projections has been widely adopted and built upon.\nLee joined New Zealand's Royal Astronomical Society in 1948 and was Director of the Society's Computing Section from 1954 to 1972. From 1974 to 1977 he was an editor for the Society's quarterly journal, Southern Stars. He was a founding member of the New Zealand Institute of Draughtsmen and edited its journal from 1947 to 1950, a founding member of the New Zealand Cartographic Society, and was made an honorary member of the New Zealand Institute of Surveyors in 1971.\nBibliography\nPapers\nLee, L.

In the early 18th century, Simon Scrope built a cockpit behind the house. It was later closed, and in 1788, the family built a Catholic chapel on the site. The building included a crypt, into which the family's coffins were relocated. In 1865, Joseph Hansom rebuilt the church in the Byzantine style, creating a larger building which was linked to the presbytery.  It was grade II listed in 1985.\nThe church is built of stone, and has a stone slate roof. It has a cruciform plan with transepts, but is not symmetrical, and the liturgical east is actually to the north. It has a doorway in the south-east angle, reached up a flight of steps, and an octagonal tower and belfry at the west end. There is a three-light north window. The 18th-century crypt survives.\n",

    "United States historic place\nThe Glacier Ranger Station is a park ranger office for the Glacier District of Baker National Forest in the U.S. state of Washington. Camp Glacier (F-12) was one of 70 Civilian Conservation Corps camps in Washington state, among the earliest states to establish them, and built the Glacier Ranger Station. It was established in June 1933. This is the second building to serve as the Glacier Ranger Station. The first site was taken from public land on March 16, 1908. The structure was demolished (1908\u20131931) when the Mount Baker Highway was built on its current right-of-way. Two other wood-frame buildings from the old complex were moved and altered and in use.\nThe ranger station was completed in 1938. There was a complement of 200 enrollees and 45 local experienced men (LEMS) at the camp working under 5 army officers. Several buildings built for the camp, at some distance from the station, are still in use as a summer church camp (Mt Baker Bibleway Camp) on the Mt. Baker highway.\nThe work on the station took several months. Under the supervision of a journeyman mason the columnar basalt was quarried during the summer from deposits near Heather Meadows at the head of the Mt. Baker highway. It was trucked to the construction site where most of the laying was done by the mason. The framing, roofing, and finishing was done by men from the crew.\nThe plans for the station were modified from standard building plans done during 1936 for the Forest Service and initiated L.A.F. The changes are an example of the way designs and material were improvised to limit expenses and utilize the available labor.\nThe interior was remodeled in 1967, the exterior has not been altered. The Glacier Ranger Station, is a 'crafted example of CCC projects.\nAppearance\nThe Glacier Ranger Station is a detached structure. The single building floorplan has a central rectangular \"block\u201d with wings extending from the long sides. It is referred to as a four-room station on standard Forest Service plans, The single-story Alpine Bungalow style building is primarily of basalt masonry\nconstruction with wood frame wings on the east and west sides. The exterior masonry resembles shale but is thick enough to be near ashlar in appearance. The stone has a natural rustic texture. The sections of the wall not of masonry are sided with weatherboard. There is an exposed masonry chimney on the west side of the central block, just forward of the wing. It is offset by a six-foot extension opposite it on the east side. Together the chimney, extension, and square masonry columns flanking the main front entrance and at the end of the wings give the building a very solid cozy appearance.\nThe north facing main entrance is flanked by windows and is covered by the main gable end which extends 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) to support columns in portico fashion. The gable end itself is decorated with scroll work and cut out tree designs. The roof shape is basically a central high gable met on each side by gabled wings which drop to sheds on the east and west ends. The roof covering is cedar shingle. The basalt masonry is repeated in the curbing and fencing used on the grounds of the station.\nBibliography\nJeffcott, P.R. Ghechaco and Sourdough.1963. Pioneer Printing Go.

Hussain Pointet that sounds \"transposing the carnal intimations and vocal intimacy of early '00s RnB to tactile, Island-flavoured beats\" with \"lugubrious, log-drum rhythms of Amapiano and the bright, syncopated elation of Afro-pop\", which \"sometimes soars, and sometimes falls flat\".\nZachary Horvath of HotNewHipHop praised the production, writing that it featured \"many subsets of R&B such as contemporary, Afrobeats, and pop\", pointing out the evolution of \"Chloe's dynamic and showstopping vocal performances\" in comparison to the previous album.\nTrack listing\nNote\n^  signifies an executive producer\nPersonnel\nMusicians\nChloe Bailey \u2013 vocals\nBongoByTheWay \u2013 piano (tracks 1, 10), programming (7, 10); synthesizer, vocals (7, 13); drums (10, 13), bass (13)\nJohan Lenox \u2013 strings, vocals (track 1)\nFridayy - background vocals (track 1)\nTy Dolla Sign - vocals (track 2)\nAri PenSmith \u2013 background vocals (track 4)\nBelievve \u2013 background vocals (track 4)\nMocha Bands \u2013 background vocals (track 4)\nSammy Sosa \u2013 background vocals (track 4)\nShermay Barnes \u2013 vocals (track 4)\nAkeel Henry \u2013 bass (tracks 7, 8), keyboards (7), strings (8)\nAnderson .Paak \u2013 drums, vocals (track 7)\nToki \u2013 drums (track 7)\nLuke Crowder \u2013 horn (track 7)\nCordarius Bradley \u2013 trombone (track 7)\nRalston Albert \u2013 trumpet (track 7)\nYG Marley \u2013 vocals (track 9)\nLekan Olanrewaju \u2013 background vocals (track 10)\nSubrosa \u2013 bass guitar (track 10)\nHalle \u2013 vocals (track 10)\nDe'Jour Thomas \u2013 keyboards, synth bass (track 13)\nKareen Lomax \u2013 background vocals (track 15)\nTrey Campbell \u2013 background vocals (track 15)\nJeremih \u2013 vocals (track 15)\nTechnical\nColin Leonard\u2013 mastering\nAntonio Tucci Jr. \u2013 mixing (tracks 1\u201313, 15, 16), engineering (1, 2, 4\u201313, 15, 16)\nSerban Ghenea \u2013 mixing (track 14)\nRian Lewis \u2013 engineering (tracks 3, 14)\nIan Gold \u2013engineering (track 3)\nAri PenSmith \u2013 engineering (track 4)\nSammy Soso \u2013 engineering (track 4)\nDavid \"Pac\" Urresta \u2013 engineering (track 9)\nPat Kelly \u2013 engineering (track 10)\nAlex Burns \u2013 engineering (track 12)\nChloe Bailey \u2013 vocal production\nRob Marion \u2013 engineering assistance (tracks 3, 5)\n",
